56
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>you also go one,</v>

57

58
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.020
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop it when you go one.</v>

59
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.200
<v Speaker 1>And so I won the election.</v>

60
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>So like all these stories came out and then rolling stones like let's do a</v>

61
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:44.641
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

62
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>let's do an article on him.</v>

63
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

64
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.521
<v Speaker 1>It gets crazier.</v>

65
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:47.731
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

66
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Sorry for the you already for the part that you go that you go bullshit.</v>

67
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I will never say bull shit.</v>

68
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I've heard enough of your stories.</v>

69
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

70
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>so Oliver Stone optioned the rights to my life and then from the article.</v>

71
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>So then I try to stand up and I moved to New York to start doing stamps.</v>

72
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>I did it once and to in a tile house,</v>

73
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>we went amazing.</v>

75
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>I can offer my own morning show in Tallahassee.</v>

76
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.051
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

77
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.011
<v Speaker 1>Oliver Stone option.</v>

79
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:11.581
<v Speaker 1>The rights in my life.</v>

80
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Like I start doing stand up five minutes later will Smith sees me to stand up</v>

81
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>and I get a deal development deal with him.</v>

82
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Like right out the gate it's like bill burst style,</v>

83
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>like been doing standup for no time at all.</v>

84
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Development deal based on the article and that the fact that I could competently</v>

85
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>do stand up somewhat and then the development deal falls apart with Oliver</v>

86
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Stone.</v>

87
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>All the guys that have submitted their scripts for Oliver Stone's movie about my</v>

88
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

89
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>then get their intellectual property back.</v>

90
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>One of the guy takes his movie changes,</v>

91
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>my name sells at National Lampoon and it becomes a movie Van Wilder.</v>

92
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>So theoretically,</v>

93
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>and I say this theoretically loosely,</v>

94
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll never be able to sue.</v>

95
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm never would sue,</v>

96
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:46.914
<v Speaker 1>I never would sue.</v>

97
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>But I went into national lampoon and did,</v>

98
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>do you remember Kevin Couch?</v>

99
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>He used to have a showing nationally,</v>

100
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.783
<v Speaker 1>XM radio.</v>

101
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.901
<v Speaker 1>And I told him,</v>

102
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:55.171
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

103
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>bring some exact sin.</v>

104
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to find out if this is true.</v>

105
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So then he brought some execs in and</v>

106
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I start telling the story just like I am you one of the guys fucking locks up.</v>

107
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

108
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

109
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.313
<v Speaker 2>stop right now.</v>

110
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.951
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>

111
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:06.611
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>

112
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Is this like an ambush?</v>

113
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.051
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

114
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:08.171
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

115
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be able to tell it on radio and no,</v>

116
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not lying.</v>

117
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 2>That's all I care about.</v>

118
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 2>All I care about is the story being like true.</v>

119
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.193
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

120
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.071
<v Speaker 2>what do you want?</v>

121
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Like your own radio show.</v>

122
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

123
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Ugh,</v>

124
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

125
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 2>And then he's like,</v>

126
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 2>we'll do a show parting with the original Dan while are you happy?</v>

127
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.563
<v Speaker 2>And I was like yeah.</v>

128
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And so then he was like pretty much I was like so I can say true but yeah we're</v>

129
00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 2>worried you were going to sue them.</v>

130
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 2>We were telling stories this week and about like,</v>

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.451
<v Speaker 2>Tampa,</v>

165
00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:39.961
<v Speaker 2>Tallahassee,</v>

166
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:40.441
<v Speaker 2>Gainesville,</v>

167
00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Orlando,</v>

<v Speaker 2>cause the fucker party guy.</v>

173
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.710

174
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:53.340
<v Speaker 2>was fucking insane.</v>

00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:55.200
<v Speaker 2>I get Roofie I got roof a couple of times.</v>

176
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 2>So you became like a celebrity partier.</v>

177
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I became the guy that I'd walk after the,</v>

178
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:00.661
<v Speaker 2>before the article,</v>

179
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:01.441
<v Speaker 2>I was just the loud,</v>

180
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.130
<v Speaker 2>fun,</v>

181
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.960
<v Speaker 2>shirtless guy on top of the bar,</v>

182
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.430
<v Speaker 2>getting everyone in a frenzy.</v>

183
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.320
<v Speaker 2>And then when the article came out it was like the fucking lineman would come to</v>

184
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:10.591
<v Speaker 2>the bar.</v>

185
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I drank at Yonnie's and they'd pull me aside and they're like,</v>

186
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.220
<v Speaker 2>you're drinking with us tonight.</v>

187
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.720
<v Speaker 2>We want to drink with a party animal.</v>

188
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 2>And then I just be up with these lines and like four lineman and we'd be just</v>

189
00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:21.900
<v Speaker 2>doing shots and shots and shots and these guys are 350 pounds,</v>

190
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.850
<v Speaker 2>two to 18 at the time,</v>

191
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 2>probably like going through to 18 and probably more like two 25 but,</v>

192
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:29.340
<v Speaker 2>but and so I became like,</v>

193
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.630
<v Speaker 2>like I say famous,</v>

194

<v Speaker 2>I knew 40% of the bar knew who I was in Tampa.</v>

200
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knew who I was back when people actually read magazines that it's</v>

201
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.610
<v Speaker 2>bigger reality shows before the Internet,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I did everything I did like fucking they sent you ready for this?</v>

209
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>This is how bizarre this eight period period got,</v>

210
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 2>they sent ESPN send a tour bus with two actors in it to come shoot a commercial</v>

212
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.361
<v Speaker 2>for the x games.</v>

213
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:20.541
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

214
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to like the,</v>

215
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 2>and one of the actors was Johnny Knoxville,</v>

216
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 2>fucking bizarre shit.</v>

217
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 2>So Johnny Knoxville,</v>

218
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 2>we meet and he says,</v>

219
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:28.724
<v Speaker 2>you do drugs.</v>

220
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.883
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

221
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

222
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.791
<v Speaker 2>in my head,</v>

223
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

224
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.361

225
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:32.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm an adult.</v>

226
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

227
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 2>So going to this tour bus,</v>

228
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 2>I never done pills like pills.</v>

229
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Speaker 2>And so he liked pores like Clemson on shit.</v>

230
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

231
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

232
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

233
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.111
<v Speaker 2>little stronger.</v>

234
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Probably like Pete Tylenol PM probably still.</v>

235
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 2>He's just poured some tea,</v>

236
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 2>some Tylenol or whatever it was.</v>

237
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 2>He pours it with my hand.</v>

238
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 2>And so I like thumb one,</v>

239
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:51.591
<v Speaker 2>like finger one,</v>

240
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:55.580

241
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 2>So you are being calculated about it.</v>

242
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:57.321
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

243
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck I'm taking.</v>

244
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.091
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

245
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 2>And I haven't started drinking.</v>

246
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done it.</v>

247
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.131
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just like,</v>

248

250
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:06.460
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Those are wild dunes.</v>

259
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 2>And Johnny Knoxville is passing bills around and he's lightened a Bong Bong hits</v>

260
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:16.251
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

305
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.851

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:05.600

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.021
<v Speaker 2>there were no,</v>

308
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

309
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 2>they were a fake breakaway beer bottles.</v>

310
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 2>But we were like,</v>

311
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 2>but we had seen Bam do it and we thought it was funny.</v>

312
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 2>So we were doing it with these fake breakaway bottles but were outfitted with a</v>

313
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 2>real bottle.</v>

314
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

315
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Bam and his posse.</v>

316
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:18.560
<v Speaker 2>But it was the CKY posse.</v>

317
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to break a beer bottle over their head.</v>

318
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 2>The rolling stone stuff was crazy when that came out.</v>

319
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 2>It was like being famous.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Cut Back to how I pissed on my girlfriend's table.</v>

324
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 2>That was like untangling a necklace.</v>

325
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:36.530

00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 2>And then you start piecing back like little things.</v>

485
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

486
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 2>did we get stuck in a phone booth last night?</v>

487
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.511
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

488
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:07.961
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

489
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 2>we got locked in their food cabinet like in their,</v>

490
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 2>in their food closet,</v>

491
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.570
<v Speaker 2>like a pantry because in their pantries were eating and their kitchen and then</v>

492
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 2>this and this.</v>

493
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:16.751
<v Speaker 2>I start,</v>

494
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:17.171
<v Speaker 2>remember I go,</v>

495
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

496
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 2>so like a girlfriend come out.</v>

497
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.250
<v Speaker 2>The girlfriend's coming and it was a sliding door,</v>

498
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 2>so it was,</v>

499
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.890
<v Speaker 2>we were eating and the girlfriends came out,</v>

500
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 2>the sisters and they go,</v>

501
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking making a ton of noise.</v>

502
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 2>So me and Danny went into the pantry and shut the door,</v>

503
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 2>but then we couldn't figure out how to open it because there wasn't a handle.</v>

504
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 2>You guys were hammered and he's had a pantry and they shoved you in the pantry</v>

505
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:35.890
<v Speaker 2>to quiet you down.</v>

506
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 2>We shoved ourselves into the pantry so that we could continue eating.</v>

507
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:39.131
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

508
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:39.761
<v Speaker 2>we're going to bed.</v>

509
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 2>They left.</v>

510
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.051
<v Speaker 2>We went to the Pantry,</v>

511
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 2>shut the door,</v>

512
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:42.970
<v Speaker 2>and then I remember sitting in the pantry.</v>

513
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I do remember this distinctly is us being in the pantry thinking we were in a</v>

514
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:46.991
<v Speaker 2>phone booth,</v>

515
00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 2>laughing how hard all,</v>

516
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 2>they had all this food in this phone booth and we're like,</v>

517
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 2>he believe this boom news has fucking Doritos in it.</v>

518
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 2>So then that's all I remember.</v>

519
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.510
<v Speaker 2>So then he says to me,</v>

520
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 2>he goes them and he's really adamant.</v>

521
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:01.940
<v Speaker 2>So he leaves.</v>

522
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I lay back down and I'm like,</v>

523
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm being framed for this shit.</v>

524
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 2>All the sudden I start,</v>

525
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 2>do you ever have one of those we use,</v>

526
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 2>remember the dream you had last night?</v>

527
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 2>And I distinctly remember seeing her dad in his underwear.</v>

528
00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:14.494
<v Speaker 2>In my dream.</v>

529
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:15.641
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

530
00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:15.911
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

531
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I did have a dream about her dad and his underwear.</v>

532
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:18.724
<v Speaker 2>That's odd.</v>

533
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.773
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like,</v>

534
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 2>but he was in here yelling at me.</v>

535
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.241
<v Speaker 2>There's not a jury.</v>

536
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>And yet she has with an old man.</v>

537
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

538
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.481
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

539
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 2>what happened was,</v>

540
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:25.931
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

541
00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:26.890
<v Speaker 2>and then I start going,</v>

542
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.641
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

543
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 2>this totally did happen.</v>

544
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I woke up in the middle of the night,</v>

545
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 2>walked out to their dining room table,</v>

546
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.730
<v Speaker 2>erect and tried to go to the bathroom.</v>

547
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.710
<v Speaker 2>You know how you kind of try to lean it down.</v>

548
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 2>So I must have been making a ton of noise at their dining room table.</v>

549
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Pissed on their dining room table,</v>

550
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 2>full blown pissed on their dining.</v>

551
00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:45.784
<v Speaker 2>When you tell me this now,</v>

552
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.170
<v Speaker 2>now I'm remembering.</v>

553
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

554
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

555
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I fucking do remember.</v>

556
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:50.350
<v Speaker 2>You remember being erect?</v>

557
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

558
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.551
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

559
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

560
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I just remember trying to pee.</v>

561
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 2>You know how when you have one of those nights where you're like in the</v>

562
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:56.171
<v Speaker 2>bathroom,</v>

00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:56.411

564
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't get to like lean forward.</v>

565
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:00.280
<v Speaker 2>So I'm leaning forward over their dining room table,</v>

566
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 2>trying to Piss,</v>

567
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 2>making a ton of noise,</v>

568
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:03.250
<v Speaker 2>knocking everything off of it.</v>

569
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.730
<v Speaker 2>He comes out in his tighty whities I remember that because she came back in and</v>

570
00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I go to see your dad were tidy whities and she goes,</v>

571
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:08.791
<v Speaker 2>he does well,</v>

572
00:14:08.791 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>

573
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.993
<v Speaker 2>nevermind.</v>

574
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.840
<v Speaker 2>I then you can't dream.</v>

575
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.131
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

576
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:12.901
<v Speaker 2>no one wears off.</v>

577
00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:13.734
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

578
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I dream about tighty whities twenties let's say 26 25 so here's the worst part.</v>

579
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:22.990

580
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:24.160

<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

582
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:25.750

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bed.</v>

584
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.233

<v Speaker 2>where's your bed?</v>

586
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:29.940

615
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I would beat the fucking kids ass.</v>

619
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.950
<v Speaker 2>All the time when I'm really wasted.</v>

620
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Like if I black out drunk night,</v>

621
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll wake up and think like,</v>

622
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

623
00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:23.300
<v Speaker 2>I have to pee right now.</v>

624
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 2>And I always like put on a shirt the next morning like,</v>

625
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:25.761
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

626
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:26.900
<v Speaker 2>why is it smelled like urine odd?</v>

627
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I did it again.</v>

628
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

629
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I do it all the time when I drink a lot.</v>

630
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 2>So when you drank a lot,</v>

631
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:32.893
<v Speaker 2>you'll piss the bed.</v>

632
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I think I get confused and I wake up and I'm like,</v>

633
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I just pee on my champions suitcases alive.</v>

634
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.203
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

635
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.960
<v Speaker 2>really drunk people.</v>

636
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:42.711
<v Speaker 2>Peanut suitcases.</v>

637
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:42.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

638
00:15:42.851 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 2>That's actually fairly common.</v>

639
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

640
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.400
<v Speaker 2>it happens maybe twice a year.</v>

641
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 2>The last time you were here,</v>

642
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a fucking story about the Russian mob.</v>

643
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 2>We tease these bitches.</v>

644
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.570
<v Speaker 2>We let these people right now on Twitter,</v>

645
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 2>they have been going crazy all day.</v>

646
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Do not let Bert Kreischer get out of there without the Russian mob story.</v>

647
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

648
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Tell us what the fuck happened.</v>

649
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

650
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:06.490
<v Speaker 1>This is in 1993 probably I think is what I went to Russia.</v>

651
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I was taking rushing classes at Florida state.</v>

652
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were Spanish classes because I thought there has been this</v>

653
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 1>glasses because I,</v>

654
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 1>it was a noon class and I signed up and then I was like,</v>

655
00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 1>fucking sweet Spanish at noon.</v>

656
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I can phone that in.</v>

657
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:23.060
<v Speaker 1>And then I get there and they start writing in a new language and new alphabet.</v>

658
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:23.391
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

659
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:23.900
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

660
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.040
<v Speaker 1>this clearly isn't Spanish.</v>

661
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.270
<v Speaker 1>So then I said,</v>

662
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:26.781
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave.</v>

663
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And the teacher's like,</v>

664
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:28.250
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

665
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.083
<v Speaker 1>don't leave.</v>

666
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

667
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.830
<v Speaker 1>because if you leave,</v>

668
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.200
<v Speaker 1>we can't have a class and I can't get my master's degree.</v>

669
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.591
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

670
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 1>but if you stick around,</v>

671
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:35.571
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to,</v>

672
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you have to have class.</v>

673
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I get done the end of the class.</v>

674
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:37.994
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

675
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.451
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

676
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:38.811
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

677
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:39.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

678
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

679
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.990
<v Speaker 1>if you don't leave and I want and just show up at class,</v>

680
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:42.824
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a c.</v>

681
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

682
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.270
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

683
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

684
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:45.920
<v Speaker 1>So I took Russian,</v>

685
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.851
<v Speaker 1>I took Russian one,</v>

686
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:47.031
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

687
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:48.490
<v Speaker 1>and three because these kids need it,</v>

688
00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:50.630
<v Speaker 1>another guy in the class to take these classes.</v>

689
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:51.950
<v Speaker 1>So then finally I take rush.</v>

690
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd take it right from when we go to Russia,</v>

691
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.680
<v Speaker 1>we go to Russia.</v>

692
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:55.521
<v Speaker 1>But this is Rochelle.</v>

693
00:16:55.521 --> 00:16:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Like when the mob ran Russia,</v>

694
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.543
<v Speaker 1>like are you,</v>

695
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>are you guys aware of that?</v>

696
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.250
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

697
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

699
00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:06.110
<v Speaker 1>to do with Russia.</v>

700
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.460
<v Speaker 1>So when going over to Russia,</v>

701
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.294
<v Speaker 1>you had to,</v>

703
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:18.250
<v Speaker 1>So we paid off the mob and they gave us in return to banditos too young mobsters</v>

714
00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:34.010

725
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Do not interact with them.</v>

726
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Do not engage them.</v>

727
00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:47.750
<v Speaker 1>They're only here to shadow it.</v>

728
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 1>So in my head I'm like fucking get to know these guys,</v>

729
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:50.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

730
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Like get a bottle of vodka,</v>

731
00:17:52.031 --> 00:17:52.821
<v Speaker 1>a six pack of Baltic,</v>

732
00:17:52.821 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 1>go knock on their door.</v>

733
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.111
<v Speaker 1>Now mind you,</v>

734
00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I speak no Russian at the time,</v>

735
00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Speaker 1>no rushing because I'd never studied in any of the classes.</v>

736
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 1>So first night there a knock on Igor in Sasha's room and they're having a party</v>

737
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:04.050
<v Speaker 1>in there and like fucking all their friends are in their room.</v>

738
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 1>They lived right next to me and Kendra,</v>

739
00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 1>my teacher lived across the hall from Igor.</v>

740
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 1>So knock on their door,</v>

741
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Igor opens the door and he looks like a fucking thug.</v>

742
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.140
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

743
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 1>he's got like a wife beater on a cigarette of beer and he just looks at me in</v>

744
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Russia and he just goes sto.</v>

745
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And now the second he says that I start panicking.</v>

746
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 1>All the phrases I had in my head that I was trying to say all disappear.</v>

747
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 1>And all I say to Igor in Russian is I am the machine.</v>

748
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.160
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

749
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:35.791
<v Speaker 1>but I just said,</v>

750

751
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.640
<v Speaker 1>And he went stole.</v>

752
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And now I don't know what I said.</v>

753
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:40.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:41.784
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck you up.</v>

757
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.031
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

758
00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:42.481
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:43.471
<v Speaker 1>I am the machine.</v>

761
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

762
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:44.940
<v Speaker 1>say it again.</v>

763
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.211

<v Speaker 1>I have let me scene.</v>

765
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.000

769
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.</v>

00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

771
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.171

779
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.260
<v Speaker 1>If we went on a field trip,</v>

780
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.761

1161
00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:40.334
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>

1162
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.710
<v Speaker 1>And then we just get to the dock and there's a boat there and we get on it and</v>

1163
00:26:43.711 --> 00:26:44.544
<v Speaker 1>take off.</v>

1164
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 1>And halfway through we realize like,</v>

1165
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I just stole the fucking boat.</v>

00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And he was like rushing must be just fucking crazy.</v>

1168
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

1169
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.800
<v Speaker 1>We went to,</v>

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.750
<v Speaker 1>went to a big mob boss party one night and he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of,</v>

1202

<v Speaker 2>there's like the Will Smith Story.</v>

1203
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.680
<v Speaker 2>I had to put it in,</v>

1204
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.210
<v Speaker 2>but then I wanted to do the cerebral palsy one.</v>

1205
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do one where I met Ralph Sampson and when I was a kid I was,</v>

1206
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I got off Thompson.</v>

1207
00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1208
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.430
<v Speaker 2>he was a basketball player and I was,</v>

1209
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I went to school at,</v>

1210
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>

1211
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.730
<v Speaker 2>I was like in eighth grade I decided I really want to be a basketball player and</v>

1212
00:27:52.731 --> 00:27:57.731
<v Speaker 2>so I went to Villanova basketball camp and Ralph Sampson came to speak and like</v>

1213
00:27:57.891 --> 00:28:01.610
<v Speaker 2>the first night I got a concussion and the two best basketball players got</v>

1214
00:28:01.611 --> 00:28:02.780
<v Speaker 2>pulled out for drinking.</v>

1215
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.050
<v Speaker 2>So the next day I had to sit out with two that's basketball players and everyone</v>

1216
00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:07.040
<v Speaker 2>thought we drank together.</v>

1217
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.140
<v Speaker 2>So now all of a sudden I'm 15,</v>

1218
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.380
<v Speaker 2>14 and everyone thinks I'm cool because I'm partying with the 18 year olds.</v>

1219
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.790
<v Speaker 2>So Ralph Sampson comes,</v>

1220
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:14.840
<v Speaker 2>I thought this defined me.</v>

1221
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Ralph Sampson comes up to give a speech.</v>

1222
00:28:16.731 --> 00:28:17.031
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1223
00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to talk to you about two things.</v>

1224
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.010
<v Speaker 2>There's 5,000 kids on the gym floor.</v>

1225
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.491
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1226
00:28:22.491 --> 00:28:25.760
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about basketball and we're talking about discipline first let's</v>

1227

1231
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.300
<v Speaker 2>but I was the only fucking person.</v>

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:11.981
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1302
00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:12.161
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1303
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Why would you put your hands up if you don't party?</v>

1304
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:13.781
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1305
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:14.680
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be cool.</v>

1306
00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:16.180
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1307
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.000
<v Speaker 2>so like so now and then everyone would come up and they'd be like,</v>

1308
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:19.481
<v Speaker 2>party animal,</v>

1309
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:20.314
<v Speaker 2>you partying harder.</v>

1310
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.191
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

1311
00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:22.024
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1312
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:26.110
<v Speaker 2>But then I became cool at that camp and then I have friends and so I wrote that</v>

1313
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:27.880
<v Speaker 2>story is a little longer and I gave it to them.</v>

1314
00:30:27.881 --> 00:30:28.390
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1315
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.380
<v Speaker 2>this is the best story.</v>

1316
00:30:29.381 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 2>This defines me.</v>

1317
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.420
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1318
00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.950
<v Speaker 2>oh I'm not really.</v>

1319
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.240
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1320
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's all partying stories,</v>

1321
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:37.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's like that's a hilarious story.</v>

1322
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.523
<v Speaker 2>Oh thanks.</v>

1323
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh nutty.</v>

1324
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:44.080
<v Speaker 2>That this could have possibly sent you on a path when you were that young.</v>

1325
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1326
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Know 13 years old.</v>

1327
00:30:45.581 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1328
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1329
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.160
<v Speaker 2>and it's all just wanting to be accepted.</v>

1330
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.730
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>

1331
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever have one of those moments where you'd go somewhere and you didn't</v>

1332
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:51.670
<v Speaker 2>know anybody?</v>

1333
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1334
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.070
<v Speaker 2>But you felt like everyone fucking grew up together.</v>

1335
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:54.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1336
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:55.450
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird feeling.</v>

1337
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I felt like that a lot as a kid.</v>

1338
00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 2>But I thought that that define me.</v>

1340
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Cause then I became the Po.</v>

1341
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.500
<v Speaker 2>I became the party animal that kind of lived up to whatever I,</v>

1342
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:04.931
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1343
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I went to high school the very next year.</v>

1344
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:07.060
<v Speaker 2>It didn't know anyone,</v>

1345
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:08.440
<v Speaker 2>so I'm sure that kind of,</v>

1346
00:31:08.441 --> 00:31:08.771
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1347
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1348
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.090
<v Speaker 2>it worked in Villanova,</v>

1349
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:11.583
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1350
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.570
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

1351
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.930
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
