<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>it was um,</v>

15
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>straight after the fire had their hospital.</v>

16
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I spent about four hours in hospital.</v>

17
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:17.101
<v Speaker 1>I thought I broke my foot,</v>

18
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>but luckily all the x rays came back clear.</v>

19
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>swelling's going down a lot now.</v>

21
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:22.750
<v Speaker 1>So I once Asia,</v>

22
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I was going to be at a fight December the fifth.</v>

23
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.621
<v Speaker 1>It looks like ammonia with,</v>

24
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:26.454
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

25
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

26
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

28
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>did you kick an elbow or something?</v>

29
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Like he knows I keep these names about half a dozen times.</v>

30
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hurt and cause my face was so jacked up from all the cuts and then it</v>

31
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>wasn't until I was getting stitched up.</v>

32
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Then I noticed my foot was that into go elephant,</v>

33
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>try to band and then a,</v>

34
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.870
<v Speaker 1>and then once the stitches,</v>

35
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>then I cyborg come into the change room to get a photo of me.</v>

36
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>And as I stood up to get a photo with her,</v>

37
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>then I realized the pain was rushing to my foot.</v>

38
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.121
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

39
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

40
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I think my foot's broken so straight.</v>

41
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Luckily there was an ambulance there.</v>

42
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>We'll get straight into the emergency and then um,</v>

43
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.631
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

44
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>it was good onto the,</v>

45
00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

47
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.511
<v Speaker 1>the painkillers,</v>

48
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>which took me into a different dimension.</v>

49
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>What did they give you?</v>

50
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

51
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>it's stuff that's,</v>

52
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.971
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

54
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>different names here in America to Australia,</v>

55
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like oxy code owns or something like illustrating with an injection.</v>

56
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Probably Morphine.</v>

57
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.043
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

59
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>this pink elephant came into the room and started chatting to me as in,</v>

61
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.113
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

62
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

63
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>your foot's not broken,</v>

64
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

65
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 1>you are in a different galaxy now.</v>

66
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.303
<v Speaker 1>Say Welcome.</v>

67
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And that was pretty cool.</v>

68
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>It was a really a pink elephant and he just fucking around.</v>

69
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I could be possibly a fucking around.</v>

70
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.883
<v Speaker 1>So you got,</v>

71
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you've had 300 and how many stitches in your 15 year?</v>

72
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Three 15 315 I broke,</v>

73
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I broke 300 about four weeks before I got to America with a,</v>

74
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>an accident and the gym,</v>

75
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>sparring and I thought okay,</v>

76
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>300 year beauty.</v>

77
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And then cosmo was,</v>

78
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>cosmo was polite enough to give me another two cuts with another 15 stitches.</v>

79
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Speaker 1>So now I thought my,</v>

80
00:01:55.601 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>my plateau was three hundreds and now my next goal is I guess is 400 cause I've</v>

81
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>already passed the three point line.</v>

82
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Goodness.</v>

83
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Who's got the most stitches in their face ever.</v>

84
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>And my tie.</v>

85
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's a good question.</v>

86
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have to be close.</v>

87
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I gotta be up there.</v>

88
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.593
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to be,</v>

89
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

90
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>but I'm starting to now and my doctor,</v>

91
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:13.231
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

92
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>because I bring my own doctor with me when I come to fight everywhere around the</v>

94
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>world and he said it's just scars.</v>

95
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Speaking on scars now is um,</v>

96
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>the Nick Diaz sorta eyebrows.</v>

97
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>So this one's had at least maybe 18 alone.</v>

98
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

99
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>this ice one laughed.</v>

100
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:27.504
<v Speaker 1>I 80,</v>

101
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>80 still dressed the main cause that's the right elbow two coming down.</v>

102
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.453
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

103
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.250
<v Speaker 1>well that's the knock on mortar as opposed to glory,</v>

104
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>which unfortunately they just got,</v>

105
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>they just lost their,</v>

106
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>their deal with spike TV or canceled their agreement with spike to you.</v>

107
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happens,</v>

108
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>but they pulled glory off spike,</v>

109
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:51.411
<v Speaker 1>which is really very disappointing for me as a fan of a kickboxing.</v>

110
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>And I was just hoping that that would translate into,</v>

111
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>just to people getting a more,</v>

113
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>more understanding in this country of,</v>

114
00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:00.234
<v Speaker 1>of a</v>

115
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 2>high level kickboxing.</v>

116
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

117
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.763
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

118
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.603
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

119
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.620
<v Speaker 3>he um,</v>

120
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.550
<v Speaker 3>glory,</v>

121
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 3>glory was the the one and then the head of the line fight.</v>

122
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.550
<v Speaker 3>So I reached out to Scott Kent with the lion fighting at hell mate.</v>

123
00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:12.660
<v Speaker 3>Is there any chance you can put me on?</v>

124
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.903
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

125
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I seen how much exposure that having with access TV and uh,</v>

126
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.300
<v Speaker 3>and with there,</v>

127
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.680
<v Speaker 3>with the deal with everyone in the world is paying attention to the lifeline</v>

128
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.440
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

129
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.390
<v Speaker 3>And because it's pure my attire as well,</v>

130
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:24.751
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

131
00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:25.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

132
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.201
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

133
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:27.210
<v Speaker 3>is that this is definitely in the show to try and be on to,</v>

134
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.260
<v Speaker 3>to raise the profile.</v>

135
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.160
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

136
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.240
<v Speaker 3>I jumped on board and then,</v>

137
00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

138
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm so devastated that I lost it was,</v>

139
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 3>it was such a tough fight,</v>

140
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.910
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>

141
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.250
<v Speaker 3>even now I'm lost and I'm sad.</v>

142
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.120
<v Speaker 3>I knew that I,</v>

143
00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I gave 100%.</v>

144
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

145
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.851
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully the,</v>

146
00:03:41.851 --> 00:03:45.300
<v Speaker 3>the Crowder was an entertaining enough to hopefully invite me back and hopefully</v>

147
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Scott was happy with my performance.</v>

148
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.980
<v Speaker 2>So was a,</v>

149
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.240
<v Speaker 2>it was a great fun fight.</v>

150
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 2>But what I was going to say is a glory doesn't have elbows.</v>

151
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.570
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

152
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

153
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.760
<v Speaker 2>the thing that people worry about with like lion fight and pure Moy Tai is that</v>

154
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:58.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of cuts in,</v>

155
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people get cut and primarily get cut by elbows.</v>

156
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

157
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.603
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

158
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 2>the way I look at it,</v>

159
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like that is a,</v>

160
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

161
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 2>it's an excellent weapon.</v>

162
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.020
<v Speaker 2>And if you should be able to kick or if you are able to kick and you're able to</v>

163
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:14.400
<v Speaker 2>need the face and you're able to do all the things that you can in MMA,</v>

164
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:16.710
<v Speaker 2>why can't you elbow and in my time,</v>

165
00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:16.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 2>and why can't you clinch,</v>

167
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same as MMA.</v>

169
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 3>How can you,</v>

170
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 3>how can you take away the rules and water it down into one sort of category?</v>

171
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

172
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.093
<v Speaker 3>and then called,</v>

173
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the same deal when they think Corbett came over here,</v>

174
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 3>he's the elbow master.</v>

175
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

176
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.270
<v Speaker 3>and then when he came over here to fight for glory and he got beaten by</v>

177
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 3>spoiling,</v>

178
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 3>he got beaten by Saki and everyone saying,</v>

179
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.521
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

180
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 3>but if he had his elbows,</v>

181
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.231
<v Speaker 3>that would have changed.</v>

182
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:41.580
<v Speaker 3>The</v>

183
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.413
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

184
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.901
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

185
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:43.501
<v Speaker 2>You never know,</v>

186
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:44.071
<v Speaker 2>but you never know.</v>

187
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Certainly it's,</v>

188
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:46.170
<v Speaker 2>it makes you think,</v>

189
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.620
<v Speaker 2>and you know when you're thinking that's bad in the cage or the ring or wherever</v>

190
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.523
<v Speaker 2>you're competing,</v>

191
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.770
<v Speaker 2>the idea is to train so hard and train exactly how you're going to fight so that</v>

192
00:04:58.291 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 2>it all comes out automatically.</v>

193
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.680
<v Speaker 2>And when your automatic instinct for Nathan,</v>

194
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:01.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

195
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:02.551
<v Speaker 2>how many fights is,</v>

196
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:03.510
<v Speaker 2>he had a,</v>

197
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I think close to 70.</v>

198
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

199
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:05.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

200
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:06.600
<v Speaker 2>think about all those fights.</v>

201
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Did he add throwing elbows?</v>

202
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Think about all those training sessions,</v>

203
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:10.284
<v Speaker 2>throwing elbows,</v>

204
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden he's in positions where it's like,</v>

205
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.751
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

206
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:14.670
<v Speaker 2>don't throw an album because that's normal.</v>

207
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.290
<v Speaker 2>You're getting in the clinch and it just,</v>

208
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

209
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.880
<v Speaker 2>it's just normal for you.</v>

210
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

211
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.800
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden they tell you you can't do it.</v>

212
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

213
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

214
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.810
<v Speaker 2>it's problematic.</v>

215
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

216
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:25.110
<v Speaker 2>it's nice for these guys to be able to have another outlet.</v>

217
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I know Tyrone,</v>

218
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Tyrone Spong is,</v>

219
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:29.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing some boxing down,</v>

220
00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:30.180
<v Speaker 2>just some straight boxing,</v>

221
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.270
<v Speaker 2>which I think probably at least he has shoes on.</v>

222
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be just thinking that he's,</v>

223
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:35.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:35.700
<v Speaker 2>like it'll,</v>

225
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.780
<v Speaker 2>it'll help him not throw kicks and not thinking you can throw elbows and things,</v>

226
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:44.490
<v Speaker 2>but the guys who are the best and the guys who are the the best,</v>

227
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:45.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

228
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.040
<v Speaker 2>at that particular style of Moitai,</v>

229
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.260
<v Speaker 2>it'd be great to see them use all their weapons.</v>

230
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.080
<v Speaker 2>It'd be great to see them utilize all the techniques of Muay Thai.</v>

231
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.930
<v Speaker 2>He see how technical when we tie is,</v>

232
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

233
00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:56.061
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

234
00:05:56.061 --> 00:06:01.061
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people from the outside that are watching it appreciate it for</v>

235
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 2>what it really is.</v>

236
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredibly intense and technical martial art.</v>

237
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:08.710
<v Speaker 2>We'll Thailand's uh,</v>

239
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 2>how many hundred years old say it's already a perfected to the,</v>

240
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 2>to the rule set and then everyone's trying to water it down to them to make it</v>

241
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 2>their own specific sorta rule set.</v>

242
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.840
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

243
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.673
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

244
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 2>it's not the authentic,</v>

245
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 2>when you keep it as it is,</v>

246
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:23.061
<v Speaker 2>it's already,</v>

247
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 2>the products are already there.</v>

248
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to change it.</v>

249
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 2>It's already,</v>

250
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 2>it's already been fine on perfect enough and fast.</v>

251
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:29.770
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a,</v>

252
00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a shame that a different organizations trying to,</v>

253
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.583
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

254
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 2>I suppose people don't like the clincher as much.</v>

255
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:36.111
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>

256
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I think it's getting a little bit boring.</v>

257
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 2>And plus when you get two guys that aren't,</v>

258
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

259
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 2>at a certain level,</v>

260
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 2>it does seem a little bit sorta doll.</v>

261
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not entertaining.</v>

262
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 2>But in the early levels grapplings and very low level.</v>

263
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>So it was a lot of things at a low level.</v>

264
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

265
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.210
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think you should ever sort of make rules that are dictated just to</v>

266
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:59.060
<v Speaker 2>make people that are at a low level fight in a more fan friendly,</v>

267
00:06:59.061 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 2>enjoyable way.</v>

268
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 2>I think you should just allow the people that are watching it to see the</v>

269
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 2>difference between a novice and someone who's an expert and see someone who uses</v>

270
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 2>the clinch to their advantage and see all the different techniques that can be</v>

271
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 2>landed from the clinch,</v>

272
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 2>the uses of the need,</v>

273
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 2>the use of the knees,</v>

274
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 2>the elbows from the break.</v>

275
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

276
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of beautiful techniques that can be used from the clinch that you</v>

277
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:25.001
<v Speaker 2>don't see because what glory has done is sort of adopt the rules of k one which</v>

278
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese had kind of decided,</v>

279
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:27.201
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

280
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be a way to make these guys fight in a more exciting and fast</v>

281
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:31.934
<v Speaker 2>paced way.</v>

282
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 2>What's make the rounds,</v>

283
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

284
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 2>just what's a,</v>

285
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 2>to make the fight shorter instead of having like many rounds,</v>

286
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 2>like 10 rounds or 12 rounds or something like that,</v>

287
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:41.450
<v Speaker 2>like a boxing match,</v>

288
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 2>let's just do like three rounds and have them go fucking crazy for three rounds,</v>

289
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.330
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

290
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

291
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 2>When I fought in Europe,</v>

292
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

293
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.370
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

294
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.920
<v Speaker 2>that afforded an organization called Super League back in 2003,</v>

295
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 2>2004 and that was the same deal.</v>

296
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:54.291
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

297
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 2>we're not gonna spend airfare,</v>

298
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 2>money flowing all the way from Australia and get cut in the first round and have</v>

299
00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 2>the flight stop 60 seconds in.</v>

300
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it's a waste of money for us.</v>

301
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:02.920
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

302
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.281
<v Speaker 2>so we'll,</v>

303
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

304
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.161
<v Speaker 2>we'll keep,</v>

305
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 2>the knees will keep everything else,</v>

306
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:07.140
<v Speaker 2>but we'll just eliminate and elbows just from case to the,</v>

307
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:08.150
<v Speaker 2>that that does happen.</v>

308
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Does I'm lion fight,</v>

309
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 2>do drug testing?</v>

310
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.871
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

311
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:12.021
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

312
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 2>there was no urinary test.</v>

313
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Half the money.</v>

314
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

315
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.883
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

316
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.480
<v Speaker 2>And then I think we're in Vegas and uh,</v>

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.740

321
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.463
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

322
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

323
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.461
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>

324
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:28.671
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting for a job for me now is a Temecula the,</v>

326

<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

327
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:33.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a casino,</v>

328
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:34.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

329
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.560
<v Speaker 2>You guys ready?</v>

330
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 2>A Casino Chang goes out.</v>

331
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:36.824
<v Speaker 2>What it is.</v>

332
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 2>And is that a native American reservation where they can do whatever they want?</v>

333
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 2>They have their own regulations.</v>

334
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

335
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:42.921
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

336
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 2>they kept a martial arts.</v>

337
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:46.460
<v Speaker 2>A lot of mixed martial arts live in California.</v>

338
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.791
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

339
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Speaker 2>You have a native American reservations did because they put on a king of the</v>

340
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 2>cage in a native American reservations when you couldn't have MMA in California.</v>

341
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:56.244
<v Speaker 2>It was illegal.</v>

342
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.640
<v Speaker 2>And so we used to drive out to the middle of nowhere to these very small native</v>

343
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 2>American casinos.</v>

344
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.541
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

345
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

346
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 2>that's where the king of the cage would be.</v>

347
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

348
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 2>that was like the primary way that,</v>

349
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 2>that's how like Uriah Faber got started.</v>

350
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys quit and Jackson got started.</v>

351
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys get started and king in the cage and in California because of this</v>

352
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 2>loophole that allows native American reservations put on the fights.</v>

353
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.740
<v Speaker 2>But boy,</v>

354
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I would like it if they drug tested guys.</v>

355
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

356
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:23.960
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

357
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

358
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I definitely feel a lot safer if I knew it wasn't faithful lighting.</v>

359
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 2>A pure animals did just do the Jews to the tits.</v>

360
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:31.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

361
00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:32.191
<v Speaker 2>Cosmo,</v>

362
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Xander is a big fella and um,</v>

363
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 2>he's quite a bit larger than you.</v>

364
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

365
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 2>The guy that you fought was,</v>

366
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:37.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

367
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.260
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

368
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:38.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

369
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.310
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad six three.</v>

370
00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 2>He then went to,</v>

371
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 2>when they announcing this at six one,</v>

372
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 2>but there's no way six one,</v>

373
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 2>when I was looking up at him,</v>

374
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 2>when the referee borders together,</v>

375
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

376
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 2>it was like looking at a Michael Jordan or Sam.</v>

377
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:48.991
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

378
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:49.824
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

379
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:50.791
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

380
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

381
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:51.991
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

382
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:52.111
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

383
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 2>once the fight starts to just,</v>

384
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.840
<v Speaker 2>just trying to present,</v>

385
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:55.171
<v Speaker 2>get there,</v>

386
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:56.030
<v Speaker 2>get into his range.</v>

387
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 2>It was either as you explode into,</v>

388
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.630
<v Speaker 2>try and try and learn your combinations,</v>

389
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:01.940
<v Speaker 2>those knees are flying past,</v>

390
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:03.410
<v Speaker 2>pass your head left and right.</v>

391
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.263
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

392
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 2>it's just makes it so much,</v>

393
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 2>so much harder when they say [inaudible] and I'm,</v>

394
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:09.650
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing is he can make I think seventies,</v>

00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 2>a very specific way of moving inside of the octagon or inside the the ring</v>

439
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>

440
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.090
<v Speaker 2>If I watched you like it just silhouette of Sherman's,</v>

441
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 2>someone showed me a silhouette of you move and I go,</v>

442
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 2>oh that's John Wayne par.</v>

443
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.011
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

444
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:12.520
<v Speaker 2>you could totally tell it's,</v>

445
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting.</v>

446
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:17.210
<v Speaker 2>You have your own very specific style of a,</v>

447
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 2>of moving.</v>

448
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 2>And I would imagine that that style is like,</v>

449
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:20.821
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

450
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:23.760
<v Speaker 2>you do a lot of things that are other more Thai guys do.</v>

451
00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:23.971
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

452
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 2>you're very light on the front foot,</v>

453
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:29.340
<v Speaker 2>but there's a way you have of throwing punches and combinations and so heavy off</v>

454
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 2>that front left leg is very specific to you.</v>

455
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.091
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

456
00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:35.310
<v Speaker 2>and I think that for a lot of guys,</v>

457
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:36.330
<v Speaker 2>let's kind of present them.</v>

458
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Who is your,</v>

459
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

460
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>it's very effective.</v>

461
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:40.560
<v Speaker 2>But it's unique,</v>

462
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

463
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.030
<v Speaker 2>and it can,</v>

464
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 2>your style of movement,</v>

465
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

466
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.401
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

467
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of another guy.</v>

468
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Like if I watch certain guys,</v>

469
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:47.641
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

470
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:48.780
<v Speaker 2>oh well that guy fights.</v>

471
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy.</v>

472
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 2>He kind of moves a little bit like him or Tiago Alva as a sort of like that guy</v>

473
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>or you</v>

474
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.071
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

475
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>you could kind of do that with,</v>

476
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of fighters.</v>

477
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.951
<v Speaker 1>But now with you,</v>

478
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:57.281
<v Speaker 1>you got it.</v>

479
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 1>This weird sort of unusual timing,</v>

480
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>especially that left leg man.</v>

482
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.101
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

483
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:07.270
<v Speaker 1>you're like one of the best guys have ever seen at that front left leg counter.</v>

484
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Like to the body when a guy's throwing a punch.</v>

485
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think you get all that time spending in Thailand that there was one of</v>

486
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:13.841
<v Speaker 1>their main things.</v>

487
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 1>It was a telling me it's so hard,</v>

488
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 1>the block of the back leg,</v>

489
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:16.541
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

490
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:17.201
<v Speaker 1>cause that lead leg,</v>

491
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:17.860
<v Speaker 1>so light it,</v>

492
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>and then a majority of the time,</v>

493
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 1>90% of the people who are throwing lakes,</v>

494
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.090
<v Speaker 1>so you've got that lead leg ready.</v>

495
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:22.924
<v Speaker 1>But when next time,</v>

496
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.970
<v Speaker 1>the three that left,</v>

497
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

498
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard the block.</v>

499
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So I've perfected that.</v>

500
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Left on the underpads,</v>

501
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm throwing that 70% of the time and my right leg is my power leg,</v>

502
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>my left legs might my counter.</v>

503
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 1>So I'm throwing that more than anything.</v>

504
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

505
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

506
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I started off with a really strong right leg and my left leg was okay and I just</v>

507
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.570
<v Speaker 1>worked at at work that it worked at it to make it my main weapon.</v>

508
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm like a jab for boxer like comes through McKesson weapon.</v>

509
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

510
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.791
<v Speaker 1>And then someone,</v>

511
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 1>as soon as someone comes in to strike,</v>

512
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I throw that left leg and it's not only am I trying to school,</v>

513
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'm using it as a break to try and stop you from throwing your combinations.</v>

514
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

515
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.011
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

516
00:12:57.011 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 1>if I don't land on your ribs,</v>

517
00:12:58.421 --> 00:12:59.151
<v Speaker 1>I'm hitting your arms.</v>

518
00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pushing you off balance so you can't throw the right hand.</v>

519
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Will I want to try and break that right hand down.</v>

520
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:06.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's taking the power away from your right punch and you're putting weight</v>

521
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 1>into it too.</v>

522
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 1>And landing with the Shin,</v>

523
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 1>which also keeps the knee and the thigh bone from you to them.</v>

524
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:14.290
<v Speaker 1>It creates a space.</v>

525
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:14.561
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

526
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 1>And is a lot of power to it.</v>

527
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

528
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 1>If you use that so effectively,</v>

529
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

530
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And she should have used it more too because in the after flight speech Cosmo's</v>

531
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:21.731
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

532
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:21.941
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

533
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:23.920
<v Speaker 1>he was hurting me with that left leg and then um,</v>

534
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:25.001
<v Speaker 1>to the body.</v>

535
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

536
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.440
<v Speaker 1>He said that on the APP,</v>

537
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 1>the flights and that's like,</v>

538
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.290
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

539
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.123
<v Speaker 1>dammit I should have,</v>

540
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I should have used it more.</v>

541
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 1>But there was a couple of unique moments in that fight.</v>

542
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 1>One of them was in the third round when you just opened up with this crazy</v>

543
00:13:37.481 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 1>flurry.</v>

544
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

545
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Like what was going on there?</v>

546
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.440
<v Speaker 1>You just have this feeling.</v>

547
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you just just say,</v>

548
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to put a barrage on this motherfucker and see what happens?</v>

549
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

550
00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:48.470
<v Speaker 1>My theory is if I,</v>

551
00:13:48.471 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 1>if I can get someone covering up,</v>

552
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to stop them.</v>

553
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.870
<v Speaker 1>So if the opportunity comes in and if I might take me 30 punches of my time,</v>

554
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:55.661
<v Speaker 1>if 50 punches,</v>

555
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>but eventually I figure if I can find that gap and I hit you hard enough,</v>

556
00:13:58.931 --> 00:13:59.764
<v Speaker 1>I know I can drop you.</v>

557
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.690
<v Speaker 1>So I was just trying my hardest to try and land that big one to try and put him</v>

558
00:14:03.691 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

559
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 1>And I knew that I've done enough work in the gym to to throw all night and my</v>

560
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.430
<v Speaker 1>gas tank was full.</v>

561
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 1>There was no way I was going to guess.</v>

562
00:14:10.691 --> 00:14:11.950
<v Speaker 1>So I just kept throwing,</v>

563
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:12.251
<v Speaker 1>throwing,</v>

564
00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:12.541
<v Speaker 1>throwing.</v>

565
00:14:12.541 --> 00:14:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I think he'd come on and just lend that good one to just give him,</v>

566
00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:17.710
<v Speaker 1>giving yourself an eight count to get myself back into the game.</v>

567
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

568
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

569
00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:19.600
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

570
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I think he wore 30 ish and then,</v>

571
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:22.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

572
00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 1>he got here to the corner and they shrugged it off.</v>

573
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

574
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 1>dammit,</v>

575
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.833
<v Speaker 1>now I'm screwed.</v>

576
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

577
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

578
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

579
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.600
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because you see a guy blocking punches and covering up,</v>

580
00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

605
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>In the fourth round,</v>

606
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 1>you rocked him with a right hand and then he started like cleaning the bottom of</v>

607
00:14:58.491 --> 00:14:59.070
<v Speaker 1>his feet.</v>

608
00:14:59.070 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

609
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.733
<v Speaker 1>He was hurt.</v>

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:01.701
<v Speaker 1>He was hurt.</v>

611
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:01.970
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

612
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:02.101
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You just got rock first.</v>

615
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:10.340
<v Speaker 1>First I thought he lost his mouthpiece and then I,</v>

616
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

617
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.383
<v Speaker 1>as I seen him sweat,</v>

618
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I've gone to John Payne and that,</v>

619
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.261

623
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought he lost his contact.</v>

624
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what was going on,</v>

625
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>but it was a full like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just a second.</v>

632
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.403
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

633
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.130

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what was going on either.</v>

653
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:44.790
<v Speaker 1>He got hustled as well say to each credit he,</v>

657
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:50.210
<v Speaker 1>because after that he wasn't the same.</v>

658
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.610
<v Speaker 1>And then in the fourth round or the fifth round,</v>

685
00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:34.040
<v Speaker 1>he was in one of the other rooms getting these knees put back into together so</v>

686
00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 1>you could see his nose leaking when he was talking to pat Miletich his nose was</v>

687
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 1>leaking,</v>

688
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:38.960
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

689
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.090
<v Speaker 1>he's a tough guy and it seems like a really,</v>

690
00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:42.140
<v Speaker 1>really nice guy too.</v>

691
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.180
<v Speaker 1>We've fought each other three times now.</v>

692
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And then we've also fought on the same cards here in Jamaica,</v>

693
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:48.600

697
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 1>And then even when we've,</v>

698
00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

699
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.050

703
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:01.250
<v Speaker 1>So there's no animosity.</v>

704
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:01.611
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

705
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:02.444
<v Speaker 1>it's just business,</v>

706

<v Speaker 1>He's got to get paid.</v>

708
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:04.521
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get paid.</v>

709
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:04.641
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

710
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:05.790
<v Speaker 1>we beat competition.</v>

711
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.651
<v Speaker 1>Competition.</v>

712
00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:06.981
<v Speaker 1>We beat,</v>

713
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:07.820
<v Speaker 1>we beat each other up.</v>

714
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.290
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end of it again,</v>

715
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>we got on each other's change room.</v>

716
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:11.331
<v Speaker 1>We high five.</v>

717
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:11.811
<v Speaker 1>Good fight.</v>

718
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

719
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

720
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

721
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because that's a,</v>

722
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>that's a big part of fighting is the comradery between fighters,</v>

723
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 1>but also a big part of fighting is the mental game when there is no camaraderie,</v>

724
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:27.200
<v Speaker 1>when guys are fucking with each other and it becomes emotional.</v>

725
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of fighters that have been tripped up by emotions.</v>

726
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Like Donald Cerrone was on the podcast and we were talking about his fight with</v>

727
00:17:35.001 --> 00:17:35.241
<v Speaker 1>date.</v>

728
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Diaz and Nate Diaz talked to all kinds of crazy shit to him,</v>

729
00:17:38.811 --> 00:17:40.400
<v Speaker 1>knocked his cowboy hat off,</v>

730
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:40.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

731
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.010
<v Speaker 1>call them every fucking name in the book.</v>

732
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And then when they fought,</v>

733
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Donald was all fucked up emotionally.</v>

734
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.000
<v Speaker 1>He was so emotionally invested and beaten guy's ass and not losing to this guy</v>

735
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:53.700
<v Speaker 1>that he just couldn't perform at his best.</v>

736
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

737
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 1>he just was so tied up.</v>

738
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 1>And Conor Mcgregor,</v>

739
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 1>he does that to everybody.</v>

740
00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:58.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

741
00:17:58.381 --> 00:17:59.820
<v Speaker 1>He fucks with you so hard.</v>

742
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 1>By the time you get in there,</v>

743
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:02.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know who you are.</v>

744
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.310
<v Speaker 1>He's got you convinced you're a totally different person.</v>

745
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.840
<v Speaker 1>You'll just want to kill him and then you can't even hit him.</v>

746
00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:08.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

747
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.180
<v Speaker 1>it's such a,</v>

748
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 1>it's such a mind fuck when you wind up hating someone.</v>

749
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

750
00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.100
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>

751
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be a pleasure when you meet a gentleman like cosmo Alexander,</v>

752
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 1>who's a great fighter as well.</v>

753
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.300
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have to think about all that jazz.</v>

754
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:22.080
<v Speaker 1>You can just,</v>

755
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.950
<v Speaker 1>just be yourself.</v>

756
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

757
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm very lucky with this boy.</v>

758
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.131
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had any,</v>

759
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

760
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.263
<v Speaker 1>quantum and Greg is,</v>

761
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

762
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:27.931
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

763
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz is in that of ever and all your fights,</v>

764
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

765
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.041
<v Speaker 1>with those,</v>

766
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 1>one time I was on a television show called the contender as a French gentleman</v>

767
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 1>that was sort of getting under everyone's skin and he was a token token,</v>

768
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:40.201
<v Speaker 1>a lot of smack,</v>

769
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:40.910
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

770
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:41.743
<v Speaker 1>what was that guy's name?</v>

771
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:42.743
<v Speaker 1>Rafiq.</v>

772
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Rafiq him.</v>

773
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.720
<v Speaker 1>And then everyone was coming up to me saying,</v>

774
00:18:45.721 --> 00:18:46.441
<v Speaker 1>you got to knock this plug,</v>

775
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 1>can't you go and look this book out?</v>

776
00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:50.530
<v Speaker 1>And then even the field cream look come and behind the scenes and oh you got all</v>

777
00:18:50.531 --> 00:18:52.110
<v Speaker 1>these book yet you got to get this guy off the show.</v>

778
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Cause as soon as you add on as shy,</v>

779
00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:54.721
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you lost,</v>

780
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:55.554
<v Speaker 1>you went home.</v>

781
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.161
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

782
00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:56.994
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

783
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I put a lot of pressure on myself to,</v>

784
00:18:58.781 --> 00:18:59.850
<v Speaker 1>and then again,</v>

785
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 1>the hottie try knock somebody out,</v>

786
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:04.280
<v Speaker 1>the less it happens and then the more mentally draining you get to cause why is</v>

787
00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:04.430
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

788
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Why haven't knocked him out yet?</v>

789
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.511
<v Speaker 1>Instead of thinking,</v>

790
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:06.721
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

791
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:07.471
<v Speaker 1>just do the business.</v>

792
00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:09.090
<v Speaker 1>And then if something lands then it goes down.</v>

793
00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>But when the harder you try,</v>

794
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:11.191
<v Speaker 1>the less it happens,</v>

795
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 1>then the more frustrated you get,</v>

796
00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 1>then the more tired you get because you're mentally drained.</v>

797
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.080
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

798
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough gig that it's,</v>

799
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

800
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 1>it's that way with everything man.</v>

801
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 1>It's that way with everything.</v>

802
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you get emotionally invested in something like that and just you're</v>

803
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:25.710
<v Speaker 1>dealing with that other thing,</v>

804
00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>which is even bigger and more central to your,</v>

805
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:29.124
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts,</v>

806
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 1>then your actual task at hand,</v>

807
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:31.831
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with this,</v>

808
00:19:31.831 --> 00:19:33.330
<v Speaker 1>like this talk,</v>

809
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:33.961
<v Speaker 1>jazz,</v>

810
00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:34.231
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

811
00:19:34.231 --> 00:19:34.441
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

812
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:34.680
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

813
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Which is you're going to fight.</v>

814
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

815
00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:36.850
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

816
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you're going to engage in the most intense form of competition ever,</v>

817
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.220
<v Speaker 1>and you're concentrating on this bullshit like talking bullshit.</v>

818
00:19:44.221 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Like what difference does it make?</v>

819
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 1>What we say if we're going to fight?</v>

820
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:47.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

821
00:19:47.161 --> 00:19:49.770
<v Speaker 1>the difference is if you can fuck with the guys emotions,</v>

822
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:50.401
<v Speaker 1>he can't fight.</v>

823
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

824
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.833
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

825
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

826
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

827
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.820
<v Speaker 1>on the wane with Cosmo,</v>

828
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

829
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.690
<v Speaker 1>at the airport I bought myself a,</v>

830
00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.900
<v Speaker 1>a little boomerangs,</v>

831
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 1>sue a souvenir,</v>

832
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.890
<v Speaker 1>and then I presented at the cosmo at the Wayne and then,</v>

833
00:20:03.891 --> 00:20:04.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

834
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.330
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

835
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 1>we hugged and shook hands and took a photo with the boomerang.</v>

836
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 1>And it was just that a gentleman gesture.</v>

837
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:09.961
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

838
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:10.111
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

839
00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:11.570
<v Speaker 1>well they sure ain't gonna remember me.</v>

840
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.690
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

841
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.750
<v Speaker 1>but then you look at the UFC and then they get the,</v>

842
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.820
<v Speaker 1>that Dana white standing in the middle and the Holden guys met this guy,</v>

843
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:18.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

844
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.180
<v Speaker 1>24 hours time that you're going to punch each other in the face anyway.</v>

845
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.520
<v Speaker 1>So what boy,</v>

846
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.930
<v Speaker 1>what will the wireless acting?</v>

847
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.000
<v Speaker 1>And then same with them.</v>

848
00:20:27.001 --> 00:20:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Conor McGregor and Eldorado,</v>

849
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 1>every time they get together it's like,</v>

850
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:32.370
<v Speaker 1>well you technically you can't really do it and now you're both going to get in</v>

851
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 1>a lot of trouble or you're going to get fine.</v>

852
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:39.170
<v Speaker 1>But either the commission or Dana or UFC or so just kind of,</v>

853
00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you just be,</v>

854
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I know it sells tickets to,</v>

855
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I know it's in a test.</v>

856
00:20:41.621 --> 00:20:41.801
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

857
00:20:41.801 --> 00:20:42.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

858
00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:42.841
<v Speaker 1>it's riveting.</v>

859
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:43.740
<v Speaker 1>It's so you can't,</v>

860
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:44.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't not watch it.</v>

861
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.040
<v Speaker 1>You can't not train into the websites and the,</v>

862
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 1>and the replays.</v>

863
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.023
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

864
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:49.481
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

865
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 2>but he's been a gentleman sometimes can be boring compared to complete.</v>

866
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 2>When you look at it like that,</v>

867
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.640
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a catch 22 right.</v>

868
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

869
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 2>cause you can make a lot of money by being an Asshole,</v>

870
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

871
00:20:59.500 --> 00:20:59.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

872
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:00.190
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

873
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Speaker 2>people pay attention to you.</v>

874
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:01.901
<v Speaker 2>It'd be,</v>

875
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:02.621
<v Speaker 2>it becomes,</v>

876
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:03.270
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

877
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Speaker 2>is huge media selling point.</v>

878
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:05.651
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

879
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:07.240
<v Speaker 2>the story and look,</v>

880
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:08.021
<v Speaker 2>the Jon Jones,</v>

881
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Cormier fight,</v>

882
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

883
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that Jon Jones is the best light heavyweight on the planet.</v>

884
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think he beat Daniel Cormier because he's incredibly skillful.</v>

885
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And because he's just so good.</v>

886
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 2>But I also believe that Daniel Cormier,</v>

887
00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Aa was fucked up going into that fight emotionally because John had talked so</v>

888
00:21:24.611 --> 00:21:25.600
<v Speaker 2>much shit to him.</v>

889
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.990
<v Speaker 2>They got in a fight at the weigh ins where they like literally we're throwing</v>

890
00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 2>punches at each other and they had to be separated.</v>

891
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.620
<v Speaker 2>It was a giant bro.</v>

892
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.311
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a Wayans.</v>

893
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:34.780
<v Speaker 2>Rather it was a truck conference,</v>

894
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.250
<v Speaker 2>giant brawl,</v>

895
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 2>the press conference knocking people over,</v>

896
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Speaker 2>throwing shoes at each other.</v>

897
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 2>He was madness.</v>

898
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 2>But John can handle that stuff better than Daniel.</v>

899
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Ken.</v>

900
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.840
<v Speaker 2>John can still perform at the same level and under those circumstances,</v>

901
00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Daniel did.</v>

902
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

903
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

904
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

905
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:52.661
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

906
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:52.961
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

907
00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:53.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

908
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:53.951
<v Speaker 2>that was insane.</v>

909
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:54.784
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

910
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:55.803
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy.</v>

911
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:56.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

912
00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 2>let's just Connor too.</v>

913
00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

914
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.180
<v Speaker 2>part of what Connor's doing is fucking with people.</v>

915
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what Muhammad Ali,</v>

916
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad Ali did to Sonny Liston and Muhammad Ali first fought Sonny Liston.</v>

917
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

918
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.780
<v Speaker 2>he was screaming and yelling at him so bad at the ins that they weren't going to</v>

919
00:22:10.781 --> 00:22:11.614
<v Speaker 2>let them fight,</v>

920
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.100
<v Speaker 2>that they thought there was something wrong with him because his heart rate was</v>

921
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 2>so crazy and his blood pressure was so high.</v>

922
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.610
<v Speaker 2>They were worried that like this guy is not fit to fight.</v>

923
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.110
<v Speaker 2>And then he calmed down.</v>

924
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:23.321
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

925
00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:24.071
<v Speaker 2>just relax when I was,</v>

926
00:22:24.071 --> 00:22:24.431
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

927
00:22:24.431 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

928
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:24.981
<v Speaker 2>I know what,</v>

929
00:22:24.981 --> 00:22:26.080
<v Speaker 2>no fuck no what I'm doing.</v>

930
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking with this dude.</v>

931
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.900
<v Speaker 2>And it turned out that he knew that Sonny Liston,</v>

932
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.930
<v Speaker 2>although he's terrifying and he's just this massive hard puncher and knocked</v>

933
00:22:37.571 --> 00:22:38.560
<v Speaker 2>everybody dead.</v>

934
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.360
<v Speaker 2>He was scared of crazy people.</v>

935
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:40.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

936
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

937
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's what Muhammad Ali did.</v>

938
00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:44.380
<v Speaker 2>He just act like a fucking crazy person.</v>

939
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:45.610
<v Speaker 2>He used to drive to Sonny Liston,</v>

940
00:22:45.611 --> 00:22:46.444
<v Speaker 2>his house.</v>

941
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:51.010
<v Speaker 2>He would park his car on Sonny Liston lawn and yell out at him in the middle of</v>

942
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:51.011
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>

943
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:51.860

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.280
<v Speaker 2>They're just a brilliant entrepreneur.</v>

1020
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be set up for life.</v>

1021
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 2>And he wasn't like that earlier in his career,</v>

1022
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1023
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 2>he became like that really when he got to the UFC.</v>

1024
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:38.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1025
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:39.041
<v Speaker 2>he had a,</v>

1026
00:24:39.041 --> 00:24:39.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1027
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1028
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.060
<v Speaker 2>a hair of that before.</v>

1029
00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:44.120
<v Speaker 2>He had a little bit of that before where he was confident and he would talk</v>

1030
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:44.601
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1031
00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:47.300
<v Speaker 2>And I've been following Connor for years.</v>

1032
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted him a long time ago,</v>

1033
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.560
<v Speaker 2>like a several years ago,</v>

1034
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:54.110
<v Speaker 2>back when he was a fighting in England,</v>

1035
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:54.944
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was,</v>

1036
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:55.933
<v Speaker 2>I think it was England.</v>

1037
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure,</v>

1038
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 2>fighting and some overseas organization.</v>

1039
00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:01.850
<v Speaker 2>And I watched him on youtube and I was like,</v>

1040
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:03.050
<v Speaker 2>this guy's fucking talented.</v>

1041
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 2>He's talented.</v>

1042
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 2>He's got a clean left hand to his,</v>

1043
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:07.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1044
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.371
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1045
00:25:07.371 --> 00:25:08.640
<v Speaker 2>his left hand power punch.</v>

1046
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Oof.</v>

1047
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking good night Irene.</v>

1048
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Punch man from this apple.</v>

1049
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:12.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:25:12.741 --> 00:25:12.931
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1051
00:25:12.931 --> 00:25:13.341
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1052
00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 2>he's so good at measuring guys too.</v>

1053
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Very good at measuring and he has a very offspeed movement.</v>

1054
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 2>His movement is unusual.</v>

1055
00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult to Tom.</v>

1056
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I just want the things I was thinking about when I was watching you find unusual</v>

1057
00:25:25.971 --> 00:25:26.780
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

1058
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.081
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1059
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:27.291
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1060
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:27.561
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1061
00:25:27.561 --> 00:25:28.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1062
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:28.641
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1063
00:25:28.641 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1064
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.980
<v Speaker 2>very difficult thing for guys to deal with.</v>

1065
00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of fighters will tell you that,</v>

1066
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:33.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1067
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 2>sparring with a person who has a very traditional style is almost like</v>

1068
00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:38.630
<v Speaker 2>comforting sometimes.</v>

1069
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.630
<v Speaker 2>But we spar with a guy who might not even be a skillful,</v>

1070
00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's doing things all wrong but has a lot of power.</v>

1071
00:25:44.661 --> 00:25:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Like does things like real,</v>

1072
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:46.850
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1073
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:47.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1074
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.310
<v Speaker 2>the guy who just fought sugar,</v>

1075
00:25:49.311 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Shane Mosley that crazy guy who smoked cigarettes from like a wrong yoga.</v>

1076
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:53.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:25:53.781 --> 00:25:54.614
<v Speaker 2>Ricardo [inaudible].</v>

1078
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.191
<v Speaker 2>Ricardo,</v>

1079
00:25:55.191 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 2>my org is a perfect example.</v>

1080
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.673
<v Speaker 2>When he used to fight,</v>

1081
00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:57.901
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1082
00:25:57.901 --> 00:25:59.480
<v Speaker 2>the late great virgin forest,</v>

1083
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.080
<v Speaker 2>he beat that dude because forest couldn't deal with his,</v>

1084
00:26:02.081 --> 00:26:02.510
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1085
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.231
<v Speaker 2>his weird,</v>

1086
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:05.600
<v Speaker 2>crazy punches coming from everywhere.</v>

1087
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.441
<v Speaker 2>It was madness.</v>

1088
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's punches were coming from like behind his calf and over the top and hit you</v>

1089
00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:11.601
<v Speaker 2>on the nose.</v>

1090
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

1091
00:26:12.861 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Like everything was winking and wild and with murderous intentions,</v>

1092
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.320
<v Speaker 2>it was so street,</v>

1093
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1094
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.701
<v Speaker 2>everything it was,</v>

1095
00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:21.010
<v Speaker 2>it was not like skillful,</v>

1096
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:26.020
<v Speaker 2>was not like fighting like a Roberto Duran who was like incredibly skillful,</v>

1097
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:27.890
<v Speaker 2>but also like raw too.</v>

1098
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1099
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:29.331
<v Speaker 2>with Ricardo,</v>

1100
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:29.751
<v Speaker 2>my organ,</v>

1101
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:30.710
<v Speaker 2>everything was awkward.</v>

1102
00:26:30.711 --> 00:26:31.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like you didn't know what the fuck.</v>

1103
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.470
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't get into this rhythm.</v>

1104
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Like when she like to very skillful boxers fight,</v>

1105
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:36.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1106
00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:37.201
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1107
00:26:37.201 --> 00:26:38.000
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

1108
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.110
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for openings.</v>

1109
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:39.944
<v Speaker 2>They're probing,</v>

1110
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>but you see like of of a common rhythm or a rhythm that</v>

1111
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:45.840
<v Speaker 1>you've seen before,</v>

1112
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:46.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1113
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a conventional way of moving that same in Bangkok,</v>

1114
00:26:50.121 --> 00:26:52.440
<v Speaker 1>you watch two professional ties in their training.</v>

1115
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.333
<v Speaker 1>Identical.</v>

1116
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.550
<v Speaker 1>So when you put them against each other and now you're watching the chess game</v>

1117
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.620
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

1118
00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1119
00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:58.900
<v Speaker 1>well back in the 90s,</v>

1120
00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.251
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1121
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:01.770
<v Speaker 1>then you chuck in your Raymond Deco's or more.</v>

1122
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Luckily for myself,</v>

1123
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:03.361
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1124
00:27:03.361 --> 00:27:04.190
<v Speaker 1>you throwing that,</v>

1125
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 1>that the hands because they weren't really boxing back then.</v>

1126
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:06.991
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1127
00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:09.450
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden you're thrown out the rhythm because they're not,</v>

1128
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.620
<v Speaker 1>they're all of a sudden they're like,</v>

1129
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's going on here?</v>

1130
00:27:11.731 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1131
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:12.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Ramon Dekkers used to do everything hard.</v>

1133
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything hard.</v>

1134
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking punch was murder.</v>

1135
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Every kick was murder.</v>

1136
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1137
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1138
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.730
<v Speaker 1>but see,</v>

1139
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.730
<v Speaker 1>the difference between you and him was that you've fought smart enough to get to</v>

1140
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:29.220
<v Speaker 1>39 years old and still confined world title fights.</v>

1141
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1142
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Whereas by the time he was in his late thirties,</v>

1143
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.330
<v Speaker 1>his body had just been destroyed.</v>

1144
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.010
<v Speaker 1>He destroyed his ankles.</v>

1145
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Like they say that by the time he had his last few fights,</v>

1146
00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:41.400
<v Speaker 1>like his ankles were so bad that his doctors told him,</v>

1147
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 1>if you break your ankle again,</v>

1148
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.400
<v Speaker 1>we might have to amputate your foot.</v>

1149
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1150
00:27:44.681 --> 00:27:44.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:27:44.901 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 1>And so he switched his stance.</v>

1152
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.030
<v Speaker 1>He started kicking him with his other leg,</v>

1153
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 1>but then the fight was to get heated up and he'd go fuck it.</v>

1154
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And he would go right back and throw that same kick over and over again.</v>

1155
00:27:55.351 --> 00:27:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Just slamming the guy's arms,</v>

1156
00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.130
<v Speaker 1>slamming her knee slammed or their shin.</v>

1157
00:27:59.280 --> 00:27:59.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1158
00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:00.510
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy and he's a king.</v>

1159
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I said that last time too.</v>

1160
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:02.580
<v Speaker 1>He's still looking.</v>

1161
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:02.941
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>

1162
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I still think it was amazing man.</v>

1163
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.140
<v Speaker 1>The Pan,</v>

1164
00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:05.973
<v Speaker 1>the greatest ever.</v>

1165
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:06.781
<v Speaker 1>He was the man.</v>

1166
00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:06.940
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1167
00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 1>he's someone I'm trying to implement and still,</v>

1168
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:09.870
<v Speaker 1>and I said that last time too.</v>

1169
00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.713
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah.</v>

1170

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 1>every single,</v>

1174
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.210
<v Speaker 1>every single time I have a fight,</v>

1175
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to emulate,</v>

1176
00:28:16.531 --> 00:28:19.980
<v Speaker 1>trying to walk in his footsteps to become the next team.</v>

1177
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Say now how,</v>

1178
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.420
<v Speaker 1>how have you gotten to 39 years of age though?</v>

1179
00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean with all your cuts and all that stuff,</v>

1180
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:30.060
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have any injuries that have stopped you from competing at the</v>

1181
00:28:30.061 --> 00:28:31.110
<v Speaker 1>world class level?</v>

1182
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1183
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:32.300

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1187
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I've been so fortunate to have good genetics.</v>

1188
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1189
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.540
<v Speaker 1>and I still had the passion.</v>

1190
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.320
<v Speaker 1>I still wake up every morning at five 30.</v>

1191
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1192
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the road at six 30.</v>

1193
00:28:42.031 --> 00:28:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm still running 12 ks.</v>

1194
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1195
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm still hitting the pads just as hard.</v>

1196
00:28:46.231 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm still doing messy rounds.</v>

1197
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:48.531
<v Speaker 1>I had to,</v>

1198
00:28:48.531 --> 00:28:49.680
<v Speaker 1>for this last pip would,</v>

1199
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I was running a hundred kilometers a week.</v>

1200
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I ran for 10 weeks.</v>

1201
00:28:53.161 --> 00:28:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I worked at,</v>

1202
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I ran a thousand kilometers for this camp.</v>

1203
00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's morning and night altogether.</v>

1204
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:59.670
<v Speaker 1>American,</v>

<v Speaker 1>600 miles,</v>

1208
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 1>600 miles for the tea and the tea every 10 weeks.</v>

1209
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of fucking miles.</v>

1210
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:06.811
<v Speaker 1>Nine rounds.</v>

1211
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:07.231
<v Speaker 1>And the peds,</v>

1212
00:29:07.231 --> 00:29:07.921
<v Speaker 1>it sounds better.</v>

1213
00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:08.820
<v Speaker 1>When you say a thousand though,</v>

1214
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 1>it sounds Colombia I should go to meet is,</v>

1215
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:14.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1216
00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:15.933
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1217
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 1>nine rounds in the pads.</v>

1218
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I was to boxing five tied,</v>

1219
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.281
<v Speaker 1>two or three legs,</v>

1220
00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:21.114
<v Speaker 1>shields.</v>

1221
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.520
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm still running with the young kids.</v>

1222
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm still spinning the young guys in Australia.</v>

1223
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I've got a couple of young gentleman's at Jake Lynn and Elliot calmed them to</v>

1224
00:29:27.691 --> 00:29:28.800
<v Speaker 1>come to the gym on Saturdays.</v>

1225
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1226
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.080
<v Speaker 1>they're in their early twenties.</v>

1227
00:29:31.081 --> 00:29:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm still holding my with them and then they let the best projects.</v>

1228
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Australia has an m and m I'm not losing.</v>

1229
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So you think the dust because of your passion,</v>

1230
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:43.360
<v Speaker 1>do you think that's because of your enthusiasm that you truly love morning time</v>

1231
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:44.230
<v Speaker 1>and I know you do.</v>

1232
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's up to you.</v>

1233
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:46.084
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

1234
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Speaker 1>it's so exciting and invigorating and fulfilling.</v>

1235
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And do you think that that's what happens to fighters?</v>

1236
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1237
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.850
<v Speaker 1>first the,</v>

1238
00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.510
<v Speaker 1>the waning enthusiasm even before the body starts to fail.</v>

1239
00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1240
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

1241
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

1242
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1243
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.010
<v Speaker 1>because I've had other students that have of,</v>

1244
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.300
<v Speaker 1>cause I run the gym off.</v>

1245
00:30:04.301 --> 00:30:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I'd go as it had 30,</v>

1246
00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:06.101
<v Speaker 1>40 flights,</v>

1247
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:06.940
<v Speaker 1>said a world beaters,</v>

1248
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.840
<v Speaker 1>but the shoulder pops with an egos or their ankles goes and then it's not,</v>

1249
00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 1>they have to retire.</v>

1250
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

1251
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 1>not a case of that one too.</v>

1252
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 1>They have to where I've been so fortunate that my knees are in tech,</v>

1253
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:17.890
<v Speaker 1>my shoulders are good.</v>

1254
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:18.380
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

1255
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1256
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.080
<v Speaker 1>I've had a few poems in my hands,</v>

1257
00:30:20.081 --> 00:30:20.311
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1258
00:30:20.311 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 1>nothing really to stop me.</v>

1259
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:22.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1260
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:23.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1261
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:24.730
<v Speaker 1>surgeries of your hands at all?</v>

1262
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:24.911
<v Speaker 1>Nine.</v>

1263
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

1264
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.953
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

1265
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.161
<v Speaker 1>I've just had stitches,</v>

1266
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:29.650
<v Speaker 1>just lots of no surgeries at lots and lots and lots of stitches.</v>

1267
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:30.820
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1268
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.490
<v Speaker 1>besides that,</v>

1269
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:32.141
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1271
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so blessed that I'm gay.</v>

1272
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 1>And then besides good genetics and the passion that's,</v>

1273
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:40.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1274
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:40.571
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1275
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I just want to,</v>

1276
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Speaker 1>my life from the time I was four years old,</v>

1277
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.070
<v Speaker 1>all I want him to be as a martial artist and now I'm getting older and I know</v>

1278
00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:50.500
<v Speaker 1>that my time is coming and I don't want to stop.</v>

1279
00:30:50.501 --> 00:30:51.221
<v Speaker 1>I want to ride the,</v>

1280
00:30:51.221 --> 00:30:53.540
<v Speaker 1>ride the wave all the way until I pass.</v>

1281
00:30:53.541 --> 00:30:54.341
<v Speaker 1>But I know I can't,</v>

1282
00:30:54.341 --> 00:30:55.174
<v Speaker 1>but I want to,</v>

1283
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.620
<v Speaker 1>if I had my way,</v>

1284
00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I'd fight to the very day that I go to my grave.</v>

1285
00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.441
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

1286
00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:02.530
<v Speaker 1>are you more careful now that you're 39 years old,</v>

1287
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.990
<v Speaker 1>you more careful now about your diet,</v>

1288
00:31:04.991 --> 00:31:06.570
<v Speaker 1>about rehabilitation,</v>

1289
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.960
<v Speaker 1>about those kinds of things?</v>

1290
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm more more aware about losing weight before a flight.</v>

1291
00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Before I was trying to do at toy away.</v>

1292
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to lose 10 kilos in three,</v>

1293
00:31:14.981 --> 00:31:17.560
<v Speaker 1>four days and now I'm doing it over a 10 week period.</v>

1294
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:19.720
<v Speaker 1>So I'm only losing those last few kilos.</v>

1295
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And the two days prior to the awake,</v>

1296
00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.600
<v Speaker 1>the Wayne,</v>

1297
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.350
<v Speaker 1>do you think that though when you finding a really big guy like cosmo Xander who</v>

1298
00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.380
<v Speaker 1>most likely lost a shitload of water,</v>

1299
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.460
<v Speaker 1>water weight the day before the fight and then I ve um,</v>

1300
00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:37.550
<v Speaker 1>re rehydrated which is legal in Moitai still not legal in MMA anymore.</v>

1301
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1302
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.490
<v Speaker 1>at least in the UFC.</v>

1303
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that is,</v>

1304
00:31:41.261 --> 00:31:41.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1305
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1306
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 1>that it's a detriment to you though?</v>

1307
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>

1308
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I went up a weight division also.</v>

1309
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.741
<v Speaker 1>I usually,</v>

1310
00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:50.590
<v Speaker 1>if I middle what was still the boxing one 60 middle and seeing what's in the</v>

1311
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:51.310
<v Speaker 1>books and weight divisions.</v>

1312
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.510
<v Speaker 1>And this was one 68,</v>

1313
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.530
<v Speaker 1>67,</v>

1314
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:54.363
<v Speaker 1>67,</v>

1315
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>because I was flying to America.</v>

1316
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to stab myself on the plane.</v>

1317
00:31:57.941 --> 00:32:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to get here and I didn't want to have to put the sweatsuit on and</v>

1318
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want a sauna,</v>

1319
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.530
<v Speaker 1>so I only had to lose a s two kilos,</v>

1320
00:32:05.531 --> 00:32:06.364
<v Speaker 1>six pounds.</v>

1321
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 1>So there's nothing he say.</v>

1322
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:08.741
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1323
00:32:08.741 --> 00:32:09.574
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1324
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.990
<v Speaker 1>and then come with come,</v>

1325
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.730
<v Speaker 1>come way and tell I felt comfortable,</v>

1326
00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:14.740
<v Speaker 1>but then come fight time there for size differences.</v>

1327
00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Like oh my God,</v>

1328
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:16.391
<v Speaker 1>it was different.</v>

1329
00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting that know the one who was coming on in the fourth and fifth</v>

1330
00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:19.991
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

1331
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:20.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1332
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1333
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:21.021
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1334
00:32:21.021 --> 00:32:21.610
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1335
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1336
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I wanted it.</v>

1337
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.323
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1338
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1339
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.483
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

1340
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember how long it's been since I've one of the world's huddles so</v>

1341
00:32:28.721 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

1342
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I've been very fortunate enough to win 10,</v>

1343
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted this one because like,</v>

1344
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.570
<v Speaker 1>like I was saying last time I was here,</v>

1345
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:35.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1346
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to try and reach,</v>

1347
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I've been lucky enough to be famous in Australia</v>

1348
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 2>and be famous and Thailand and made my name in Japan.</v>

1349
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 2>But America is like the last friend here where we're at or haven't really sort</v>

1350
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:47.671
<v Speaker 2>of excelled or,</v>

1351
00:32:47.671 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 2>or I want to,</v>

1352
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I wanted that title to say America.</v>

1353
00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:52.200
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1354
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.033
<v Speaker 2>this is me.</v>

1355
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.661
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1356
00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:54.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1357
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:54.790
<v Speaker 2>and then I lost him.</v>

1358
00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1359
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:55.390
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1360
00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.200
<v Speaker 2>but I hope I put an entertaining fight enough.</v>

1361
00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:58.973
<v Speaker 2>Definitely did.</v>

1362
00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>

1363
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.620
<v Speaker 2>how many titles does a lion fight have?</v>

1364
00:33:01.621 --> 00:33:02.454
<v Speaker 2>How many divisions?</v>

1365
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1366
00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 2>they ever,</v>

1367
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.150
<v Speaker 2>one 61 60.</v>

1368
00:33:05.151 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1369
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.460
<v Speaker 2>I believe you had single Gloria holds it may.</v>

1370
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1371
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Was it other young Thai kid that I forgot his what?</v>

1372
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Possibly I think.</v>

1373
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.341
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

1374
00:33:13.341 --> 00:33:13.870
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1375
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:14.180
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1376
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:14.361
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1377
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:16.310
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the stars in lion fight.</v>

1378
00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:16.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1379
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:16.911
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1380
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I personally think the lion fight has some of the best skilled kick boxers in</v>

1381
00:33:21.531 --> 00:33:22.350
<v Speaker 2>the world today.</v>

1382
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1383
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy watching those shows mean especially they'll,</v>

1384
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.520
<v Speaker 2>they'll bring in some ties that are just murderous.</v>

1385
00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:29.490
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1386
00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:29.810
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1387
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.670
<v Speaker 2>they'll level of mortar that they show.</v>

1388
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 2>You get to see this beautiful execution of the style Purina that just fought on</v>

1389
00:33:37.951 --> 00:33:38.111
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1390
00:33:38.111 --> 00:33:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Any mains from Holland.</v>

1391
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:40.641
<v Speaker 2>She's amazing.</v>

1392
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:41.031
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

1393
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:42.350
<v Speaker 2>and then her fight,</v>

1394
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:43.184
<v Speaker 2>we're against sidewalk.</v>

1395
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.590
<v Speaker 2>I did not hear about her until she fought Cyborg.</v>

1396
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.530
<v Speaker 2>And then I was really intrigued to see how cyborg would fight against it.</v>

1397
00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.730
<v Speaker 2>My pure Moitai rules.</v>

1398
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:50.460
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1399
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:50.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1400
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 2>the Dutch girl came and said,</v>

1401
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:53.054
<v Speaker 2>who is this?</v>

1402
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:53.601
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>

1403
00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:54.434
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1404
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.273
<v Speaker 2>she's a base.</v>

1405
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.070
<v Speaker 2>There's the difference of pure and Moitai against pure MMA.</v>

1406
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.963
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

1407
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.070
<v Speaker 2>it was a beautiful to watch the jewelry in a bar.</v>

1408
00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:04.220
<v Speaker 2>She has her name and she's tall and long.</v>

1409
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.671
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1410
00:34:04.671 --> 00:34:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Dutch people are amongst some of the tallest European,</v>

1411
00:34:07.301 --> 00:34:11.060
<v Speaker 2>say the average height is six feet tall and they're very big people,</v>

1412
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:11.691
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1413
00:34:11.691 --> 00:34:12.524
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1414
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.730
<v Speaker 2>your arena is like probably one of the most technical women in the world when it</v>

1415
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:19.820
<v Speaker 2>comes to Moitai and that you got to see that in that fight with Cyborg.</v>

1416
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.001
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>

1417
00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:20.661
<v Speaker 2>when she pushed,</v>

1418
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:22.700
<v Speaker 2>kicked her in the face and knocked her down.</v>

1419
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:22.851
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1420
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:23.181
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

1421
00:34:23.181 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 2>she's a beast.</v>

1422
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:25.850
<v Speaker 2>She's a beast.</v>

1423
00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe it has anything to do with the,</v>

1424
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.190
<v Speaker 2>the nutrients that are in pancakes,</v>

1425
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.093
<v Speaker 2>pancakes,</v>

1426
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.073
<v Speaker 2>pancakes,</v>

1427
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:37.980
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

1428
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:38.810
<v Speaker 2>The Dutch people were like,</v>

1429
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 2>pancakes and smokes and biggest,</v>

1430
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.413
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1431
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.311
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1432
00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:44.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1433
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it probably has to do with marijuana.</v>

1434
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana is making the girl,</v>

1435
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:48.231
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1436
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:48.951
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just,</v>

1437
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1438
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.740
<v Speaker 2>probably hardy people you know are hardy.</v>

1439
00:34:51.741 --> 00:34:52.910
<v Speaker 2>It's gets cold as fuck.</v>

1440
00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.280
<v Speaker 2>They're all the strong survived.</v>

1441
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.061
<v Speaker 2>It's like Vikings.</v>

1442
00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Why are they so fucking big?</v>

1443
00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Like those people in Iceland that always win those a strongest man competitions.</v>

1444
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.671
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

1445
00:35:01.671 --> 00:35:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Why is it all these Iceland guys to keep winning when you see them,</v>

1446
00:35:04.641 --> 00:35:05.030
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

1447
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.863
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1448
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I get it as a fucking viking.</v>

1449
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.480
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

1450
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.920
<v Speaker 2>that's a viking that made it to 2015 with some viking genes.</v>

1451
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:12.470
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1452
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1453
00:35:12.821 --> 00:35:16.100
<v Speaker 2>nothing else to do besides pick up big boulders and put them in a hundred meters</v>

1454
00:35:16.101 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 2>down the road.</v>

1455
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.860
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting what you said though about Jorena when she fought a</v>

1456
00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:20.361
<v Speaker 2>sidebar,</v>

1457
00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 2>because I'll tell you what,</v>

1458
00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:21.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1459
00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:24.920
<v Speaker 2>I was super impressed with her technique and super impressed with our skill</v>

1460
00:35:24.921 --> 00:35:25.191
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

1461
00:35:25.191 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 2>but I was impressed with Cyborg grit and determination because she was getting</v>

1462
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:33.350
<v Speaker 2>her fucking ass kicked and she hung in there and she kept trying to win that</v>

1463
00:35:33.351 --> 00:35:33.651
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1464
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:35.660
<v Speaker 2>She kept chasing that girl down and she,</v>

1465
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:36.680
<v Speaker 2>and she was getting beat.</v>

1466
00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.500
<v Speaker 2>She was getting beat and she was losing and she was technically outmatched.</v>

1467
00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1468
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a difference in,</v>

1469
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1470
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 2>someone who's really good at hitting things hard and someone who's really good</v>

1471
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:48.204
<v Speaker 2>at my tie,</v>

1472
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 2>someone who's really good at setting things up,</v>

1473
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.720
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1474
00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 2>And I think that what she can do better than Cyborg is set things up</v>

1475
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 2>technically.</v>

1476
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:56.761
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1477
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:59.100
<v Speaker 2>and it's not the sidewalk can't learn that.</v>

1478
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.120
<v Speaker 2>She certainly can.</v>

1479
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.590
<v Speaker 2>But when you see someone who's used to like take downs and submissions and</v>

1480
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.060
<v Speaker 2>dealing with little gloves and dealing with fighting people that are nowhere</v>

1481
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:10.440
<v Speaker 2>near her technical level,</v>

1482
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.040
<v Speaker 2>that was without a doubt the best striker Cyborg ever faced because she's been</v>

1483
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 2>fighting girls that literally there've been assaults,</v>

1484
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:17.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1485
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.301
<v Speaker 2>you've seen a lot.</v>

1486
00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Like the toughest girl she ever fall was Gina Carano.</v>

1487
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1488
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:21.181
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1489
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:21.810
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1490
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:22.710
<v Speaker 2>that was a good fight.</v>

1491
00:36:22.711 --> 00:36:25.050
<v Speaker 2>It was a good fight up until cyborg started beating her down.</v>

1492
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.660
<v Speaker 2>But the level of Moit high,</v>

1493
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 2>like in someone like lion fight,</v>

1494
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 2>like the girl who was the girl who fought into this,</v>

1495
00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:31.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1496
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 2>this past weekend,</v>

1497
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:35.030
<v Speaker 2>she's very good from check.</v>

1498
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1499
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1500
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.230
<v Speaker 2>From the Czech Republic.</v>

1501
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:39.661
<v Speaker 2>All apologies,</v>

1502
00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:41.610
<v Speaker 2>I forget her name but she was very good as well.</v>

1503
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Very tough.</v>

1504
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.880
<v Speaker 2>But that was a pleasure to watch that fight cause those,</v>

1505
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.710
<v Speaker 2>those girls were very technical,</v>

1506
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:47.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1507
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.070
<v Speaker 2>drain and brought to the table with the Cyborg flight was,</v>

1508
00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm a letter frank kicks to the face,</v>

1509
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:52.420
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1510
00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.080
<v Speaker 2>which I don't think Nma people use 'em as,</v>

1511
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:55.381
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1512
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:58.980
<v Speaker 2>as effectively because they can't use it because the catches in the takedown and</v>

1513
00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:02.350
<v Speaker 2>also the straight up knees because during her stay at all what,</v>

1514
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 2>what a normal person would throw to the bloody,</v>

1515
00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:05.430
<v Speaker 2>she can throw to the face,</v>

1516
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.690
<v Speaker 2>no problem whatsoever.</v>

1517
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden you have those two different elements coming at Ya.</v>

1518
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:10.300
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1519
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:10.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1520
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.470
<v Speaker 2>and that's what kept leaning over and edit that kept dropping her,</v>

1521
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.830
<v Speaker 2>especially when she was holding the ropes and taping in the corner and stream.</v>

1522
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.080
<v Speaker 2>And cyborg was rushing in to try and knock her out.</v>

1523
00:37:19.081 --> 00:37:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And straight into his friend kicks.</v>

1524
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 2>She throws it to the body.</v>

1525
00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:22.921
<v Speaker 2>Well too.</v>

1526
00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:26.520
<v Speaker 2>She did that in this fight to that she throws that front kick to the body real</v>

1527
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:30.210
<v Speaker 2>well and she follows it up with nice straight punches and she sold long.</v>

1528
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.520
<v Speaker 2>She keeps you at the end of her punches.</v>

1529
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1530
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I man,</v>

1531
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:38.040
<v Speaker 2>I get frustrated when I see that more is not more popular in the United States.</v>

1532
00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:38.874
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

1533
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:39.331
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1534
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:39.691
<v Speaker 2>and I know,</v>

1535
00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not the only one because the big thing that everybody always says</v>

1536
00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:43.890
<v Speaker 2>about MMA,</v>

1537
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 2>which of course I disagree with because I have a background in Jujitsu,</v>

1538
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 2>but that when it goes to the ground that it's boring.</v>

1539
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's boring because I understand what's happening and to me it's</v>

1540
00:37:52.201 --> 00:37:52.831
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>

1541
00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I want to see like a guy like Damien Maia when he takes guys down,</v>

1542
00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:56.940
<v Speaker 2>strangles him.</v>

1543
00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.810
<v Speaker 2>To me that's beautiful.</v>

1544
00:37:57.811 --> 00:37:58.560
<v Speaker 2>That's art.</v>

1545
00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.040
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

1546
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to see like how he's setting things up.</v>

1547
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:01.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1548
00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:03.230
<v Speaker 2>when he fought Neil Magnin,</v>

1549
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:03.901
<v Speaker 2>his last fight,</v>

1550
00:38:03.901 --> 00:38:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't wait to interview him because he made some adjustments on the ground</v>

1551
00:38:07.381 --> 00:38:10.410
<v Speaker 2>and took the guy's back and the guy was defending in the first,</v>

1552
00:38:10.411 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1553
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.161
<v Speaker 2>first round.</v>

1554
00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1555
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.230
<v Speaker 2>what adjustment did you make?</v>

1556
00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Like how did,</v>

1557
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:13.941
<v Speaker 2>what did you,</v>

1558
00:38:13.941 --> 00:38:17.790
<v Speaker 2>and he was explaining it to me and I could see the technique and the art in his,</v>

1559
00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:19.920
<v Speaker 2>in his words like it to him,</v>

1560
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.690
<v Speaker 2>it was a problem to be solved.</v>

1561
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1562
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I see that in Moitai too.</v>

1563
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.321
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1564
00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:25.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1565
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.700
<v Speaker 2>for um,</v>

1566
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1567
00:38:27.121 --> 00:38:28.840
<v Speaker 2>everybody that like the,</v>

1568
00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:29.970
<v Speaker 2>the meatheads that watch,</v>

1569
00:38:29.971 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mess when it goes to the ground.</v>

1570
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Well why don't you like my tie then?</v>

1571
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Why is it more tie like the most popular combat sport in the world?</v>

1572
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's all stand up.</v>

1573
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:41.170
<v Speaker 2>And if you watch lion fight,</v>

1574
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:41.351
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1575
00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 2>you might see five,</v>

1576
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 2>six knockouts a night.</v>

1577
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Like a dream killer.</v>

1578
00:38:45.191 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Balano that fucking kid with a spinning elbow cay on his last fight.</v>

1579
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1580
00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Wild stuff,</v>

1581
00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1582
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:52.331
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1583
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:52.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1584
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 2>I think also like access TV is one of those weird stations.</v>

1585
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Mark Cuban owns it.</v>

1586
00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.690
<v Speaker 2>It's at the end of the dial and direct TV.</v>

1587
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Can't fucking find it.</v>

1588
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:02.501
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1589
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:02.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1590
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:07.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's one of those things where somehow or another there has to be a</v>

1591
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 2>consciousness shift where people have to be able to appreciate it.</v>

1592
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1593
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.970
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know what that shift is.</v>

1594
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to make that shift.</v>

1595
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it would be that would cause it to get on some big event on</v>

1596
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:18.971
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

1597
00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:19.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1598
00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:20.290
<v Speaker 2>yachts and climb,</v>

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:22.020

1605
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1606
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky.</v>

1607
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I was very lucky at this.</v>

1608
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 2>The SSJ and judges,</v>

1609
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:29.740
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky.</v>

1610
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.250
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>

1611
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.083
<v Speaker 2>you're them.</v>

1612
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.013
<v Speaker 2>You're too kind.</v>

1613
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.413
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just,</v>

1614
00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.230
<v Speaker 2>I just need some exposure because what,</v>

1615
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.830
<v Speaker 2>what of what I've realized is I'm lucky,</v>

1616
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I think I said this last time as well.</v>

1617
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.370
<v Speaker 2>The UFC has so good at making superstars.</v>

1618
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 2>And then when you,</v>

1619
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.011
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1620
00:39:45.011 --> 00:39:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm Gloria Line flight,</v>

1621
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1622
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.870
<v Speaker 2>you can say it's a spa spoiling us fighting,</v>

1623
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:50.121
<v Speaker 2>cooking,</v>

1624
00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:50.954
<v Speaker 2>Saki for instance.</v>

1625
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1626
00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows who they are besides the hardcore [inaudible] but um,</v>

1627
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.480
<v Speaker 2>amazing because MMA is so big.</v>

1628
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows the cowboy Cerrone's everyone knows their joints ain't pas.</v>

1629
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.161
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

1630
00:40:03.161 --> 00:40:03.791
<v Speaker 2>when they fight,</v>

1631
00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:04.780
<v Speaker 2>you already know the history.</v>

1632
00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:06.310
<v Speaker 2>You already know this guy is a killer.</v>

1633
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:07.090
<v Speaker 2>This guy's,</v>

1634
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.290
<v Speaker 2>this guy's going to talk shit,</v>

1635
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:10.020
<v Speaker 2>this guy going to it's yes.</v>

1636
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

1637
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 2>That's only been the case for,</v>

1638
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:12.760
<v Speaker 2>for 10 years.</v>

1639
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1640
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1641
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.160
<v Speaker 2>In 2005,</v>

1642
00:40:15.161 --> 00:40:18.910
<v Speaker 2>when Stephan Bonner and Forrest Griffin fought on Spike TV,</v>

1643
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.830
<v Speaker 2>nobody knew who the fuck those guys were.</v>

1644
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:21.600
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1645
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.270
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1646
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.180
<v Speaker 2>they were fighting so hard that at one point in time,</v>

1647
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I believe the statistics was the statistic was 10 million people were watching</v>

1648
00:40:29.951 --> 00:40:30.610
<v Speaker 2>that fight,</v>

1649
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:33.340
<v Speaker 2>which for a cable TV fight was fucking insane.</v>

1650
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.010
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why so many people watched it is they,</v>

1651
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.270
<v Speaker 2>they started watching it.</v>

1652
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.100
<v Speaker 2>It was like 3 million people or something like that.</v>

1653
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Cause it was the final spike TV.</v>

1654
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.840
<v Speaker 2>And during the fight the numbers went up like substantially and they believe</v>

1655
00:40:47.261 --> 00:40:49.360
<v Speaker 2>that people were literally calling people up and going,</v>

1656
00:40:49.361 --> 00:40:52.690
<v Speaker 2>you've got these crazy white motherfuckers are beating the shit out of each</v>

1657
00:40:52.691 --> 00:40:53.590
<v Speaker 2>other on spike TV.</v>

1658
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Go turn this on right now.</v>

1659
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.650
<v Speaker 2>And they literally believe that it was through word of mouth during the fight</v>

1660
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.160
<v Speaker 2>that changed MMA history because during that fight,</v>

1661
00:41:03.161 --> 00:41:07.030
<v Speaker 2>because it was so crazy and so wild and those guys just picked up,</v>

1662
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:11.740
<v Speaker 2>pedal to the metal and went nuts for the entire fight and it was,</v>

1663
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.560
<v Speaker 2>there were so evenly matched that after it was over,</v>

1664
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:15.580
<v Speaker 2>a sport was made.</v>

1665
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:15.851
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

1666
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:17.530
<v Speaker 2>sport was made by one fight.</v>

1667
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1668
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 2>that's not an exaggeration because to this day,</v>

1669
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.410
<v Speaker 2>although it was a great performance by Diego Sanchez,</v>

1670
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:26.530
<v Speaker 2>nobody talks about Diego Sanchez versus Kenny Florian.</v>

1671
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1672
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Diego Sanchez fought Kenny Florian for the 185 pound title on that same night.</v>

1673
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.320
<v Speaker 2>And Diego took Kenny down and beat the shit of him,</v>

1674
00:41:33.321 --> 00:41:34.154
<v Speaker 2>stopped him.</v>

1675
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 2>But nobody talks about that fight.</v>

1676
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.390
<v Speaker 2>It was the fight between those two guys.</v>

1677
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:38.661
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

1678
00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonner that literally made MMA and from then on the,</v>

1679
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.170
<v Speaker 2>the numbers just started going crazy.</v>

1680
00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody started tuning in and it just picked up and then the ultimate</v>

1681
00:41:48.531 --> 00:41:51.200
<v Speaker 2>fighter took off and then it picked up more and more and more and more.</v>

1682
00:41:51.201 --> 00:41:53.060
<v Speaker 2>And then it became a huge sport,</v>

1683
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:55.850
<v Speaker 2>but it literally was born out of one event.</v>

1684
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1685
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Like that was,</v>

1686
00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.460
<v Speaker 2>we need something like that for Moy Tai.</v>

1687
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 2>We need something like that for kickboxing.</v>

1688
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.440
<v Speaker 2>One big thing where people go,</v>

1689
00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1690
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 2>And if that can happen,</v>

1691
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:07.124
<v Speaker 2>I think in,</v>

1692
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.390
<v Speaker 2>you also need a promoter like Dana White and uh,</v>

1693
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:10.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1694
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.220
<v Speaker 2>owners like the Fertittas you need some,</v>

1695
00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:18.370
<v Speaker 2>some powerful organization has got balls and money and really gets behind it and</v>

1696
00:42:18.371 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 2>they need a lot of luck.</v>

1697
00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1698
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Well that's it.</v>

1699
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how Kaitlyn,</v>

1700
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked up because,</v>

1701
00:42:22.461 --> 00:42:23.294
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1702
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.620
<v Speaker 2>they had everything they had,</v>

1703
00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.413
<v Speaker 2>they</v>

1704
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.080
<v Speaker 2>had the money that the TV that had the slow motions,</v>

1705
00:42:35.081 --> 00:42:35.960
<v Speaker 2>they had the highlights.</v>

1706
00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:37.330
<v Speaker 2>It had the missing fingers.</v>

1707
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Has the dudes with the body suits the body tattoos?</v>

1708
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1709
00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.081
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1710
00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:42.780
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>they were gigantic in Japan,</v>

1714
00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:46.401
<v Speaker 3>they have disappeared.</v>

1715
00:42:46.401 --> 00:42:46.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1716
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:47.390
<v Speaker 3>where do we go?</v>

1717
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.500
<v Speaker 3>Where does the kickboxing go?</v>

1718
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.690
<v Speaker 3>If I'm a young kid and I'm watching the TV,</v>

1719
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:51.590

1721
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.800

1727
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1728
00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 3>household name.</v>

1729
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in Moitai,</v>

1730
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1731
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.130
<v Speaker 3>you might get a few little medals or trophies to putting on your,</v>

1732
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:13.280
<v Speaker 3>your pool room.</v>

1733
00:43:13.281 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1734
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.331
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

1735
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:15.164
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

1736
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.900
<v Speaker 3>no one driving Mercedes Benz is as a return.</v>

1737
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.451
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

1738
00:43:20.451 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 3>there's not even a hundred thousand dollar payday for him when he guy,</v>

1739
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:23.321
<v Speaker 3>if you've,</v>

1740
00:43:23.321 --> 00:43:23.520
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

1741
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 3>you get 10 grand,</v>

1742
00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:25.000
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1743
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:25.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1744
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.153
<v Speaker 3>10 grain.</v>

1745
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1746
00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.370
<v Speaker 3>but I still got to go to work Monday.</v>

1747
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:29.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1748
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.843
<v Speaker 3>And for women</v>

1749
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.860
<v Speaker 2>even crazier,</v>

1750
00:43:32.861 --> 00:43:33.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1751
00:43:33.161 --> 00:43:35.770
<v Speaker 2>think about the small group of talent,</v>

1752
00:43:35.771 --> 00:43:37.780
<v Speaker 2>the depth of talent in women's MMA.</v>

1753
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a perfect example.</v>

1754
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:42.940
<v Speaker 2>The UFC 115 pounds strawweight champion,</v>

1755
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:43.480
<v Speaker 2>you honor,</v>

1756
00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.790
<v Speaker 2>you and Jay check is a Moitai champion.</v>

1757
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Six time world Muay Thai champion and she's just murdering checks.</v>

1758
00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Just murdering.</v>

1759
00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.110
<v Speaker 2>She's nasty.</v>

1760
00:43:53.111 --> 00:43:53.741
<v Speaker 2>She's business.</v>

1761
00:43:53.741 --> 00:43:55.540
<v Speaker 2>She is so nasty.</v>

1762
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.210
<v Speaker 2>But other than her,</v>

1763
00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.930
<v Speaker 2>you know you have a bunch of people in her division that are really,</v>

1764
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:02.831
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

1765
00:44:02.831 --> 00:44:06.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a few with some experience that are getting better,</v>

1766
00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:08.830
<v Speaker 2>but they're not world championship level.</v>

1767
00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:09.693
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1768
00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:14.110
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a girl who wants to make it in fighting and you look at the pool</v>

1769
00:44:14.111 --> 00:44:16.660
<v Speaker 2>of talent that's in the UFC right now in the women's division,</v>

1770
00:44:16.661 --> 00:44:18.460
<v Speaker 2>especially 115 pound division,</v>

1771
00:44:18.461 --> 00:44:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be compelled to try to make it there.</v>

1772
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1773
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.340
<v Speaker 2>At one 35 you got that murderer,</v>

1774
00:44:23.341 --> 00:44:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Ronda Rousey flipping bitches on their heads and shit.</v>

1775
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Snapping arms.</v>

1776
00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.000
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough one because she's so advanced you,</v>

1777
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.003
<v Speaker 2>she's so,</v>

1778
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.300
<v Speaker 2>she's so advanced that she's just smashing everybody they put in front of her.</v>

1779
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:37.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's a,</v>

1780
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough one because you would have to learn how to grapple at a very high</v>

1781
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:42.930
<v Speaker 2>level to even be able to hang in there with her.</v>

1782
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:45.270
<v Speaker 2>And now are her striking is getting way better too.</v>

1783
00:44:45.271 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 2>So it becomes problematic.</v>

1784
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 2>But what is the one thing that no one's ever done to Ronda Rousey?</v>

1785
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 2>Kicked the shit out of her legs.</v>

1786
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:52.951
<v Speaker 2>Strike.</v>

1787
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:53.784
<v Speaker 2>Keep her away.</v>

1788
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.481
<v Speaker 2>Keep her away.</v>

1789
00:44:54.481 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Stuff to take down and kick the shit out of her legs.</v>

1790
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:58.500
<v Speaker 2>We haven't seen that at all.</v>

1791
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Like at all we've seen.</v>

1792
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:01.044
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1793
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:06.320
<v Speaker 2>How much would you like to see a world championship level Moyie Thai fighter</v>

1794
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:06.871
<v Speaker 2>like Yolanda,</v>

1795
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:10.590
<v Speaker 2>you and Jay check who's fighting at one through a natural one 35 who fights</v>

1796
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:11.424
<v Speaker 2>Ronda Rousey.</v>

1797
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Someone who comes out there and you see this like super high level striking game</v>

1798
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.730
<v Speaker 2>with good takedown defense since bras.</v>

1799
00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Now you got to fight.</v>

1800
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got some crazy shit happen.</v>

1801
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're supposed to expect with cases that cause the Ghana.</v>

1802
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.020
<v Speaker 2>That was supposed to happen in February.</v>

1803
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:25.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1804
00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:28.940
<v Speaker 2>but cats and Ganos not worldclass in Moitai tough.</v>

1805
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 2>The bill went,</v>

1806
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.090
<v Speaker 2>then she ran into dive into your arms.</v>

1807
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1808
00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.093
<v Speaker 2>what did you,</v>

1809
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:37.290
<v Speaker 2>she's going to be laying in bed for a really long time ago.</v>

1810
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:38.183
<v Speaker 2>What did I do?</v>

1811
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1812
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:42.900
<v Speaker 2>cats in Ghana also you have to think as never fought in that stage before.</v>

1813
00:45:42.901 --> 00:45:47.901
<v Speaker 2>That stage itself is just such a mind fuck standing in that octagon,</v>

1814
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.580
<v Speaker 2>the bright lights,</v>

1815
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 2>the cameras are on you and you're like,</v>

1816
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:53.064
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1817
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:53.821
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1818
00:45:53.821 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 2>That's probably half the reason why she made that mad,</v>

1819
00:45:56.791 --> 00:46:00.750
<v Speaker 2>crazy bum rush across the octagon and just wanting an attacker.</v>

1820
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1821
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1822
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1823
00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.190
<v Speaker 2>I heard the same thing from Therese when I was training with George.</v>

1824
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:05.521
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1825
00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:09.630
<v Speaker 2>people who don't understand that they fight in the prelims and then yeah,</v>

1826
00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:11.670
<v Speaker 2>because George has done it so many times.</v>

1827
00:46:11.671 --> 00:46:12.810
<v Speaker 2>He said you used to the pressure,</v>

1828
00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.780
<v Speaker 2>but then you get the guys that are fighting George and then all of a sudden it's</v>

1829
00:46:15.781 --> 00:46:16.180
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1830
00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.870
<v Speaker 2>five [inaudible] and the posters,</v>

1831
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:18.820
<v Speaker 2>you're doing the oil,</v>

1832
00:46:18.821 --> 00:46:19.621
<v Speaker 2>the oil,</v>

1833
00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:20.454
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>

1834
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.291
<v Speaker 2>and then the,</v>

1835
00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:22.080
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1836
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.010
<v Speaker 2>you have to walk out in front of that 25,000 people or whatever the MGM or</v>

1837
00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] when he fought Toronto,</v>

1838
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Toronto 60 say,</v>

1839
00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 2>and you're the bad guy,</v>

1840
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:32.991
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1841
00:46:32.991 --> 00:46:33.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1842
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.133
<v Speaker 2>In Canada.</v>

1843
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.031
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1844
00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1845
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.201
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1846
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 2>the pressure just breaks them before they even walk.</v>

1847
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1848
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Brixton probably weeks in advance and then,</v>

1849
00:46:41.711 --> 00:46:42.630
<v Speaker 2>and then the day comes,</v>

1850
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:43.470
<v Speaker 2>you think you can handle it.</v>

1851
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:44.610
<v Speaker 2>And the day comes and then yes,</v>

1852
00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:48.090
<v Speaker 2>you implode on the inside or not.</v>

1853
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Or you look Jon Jones,</v>

1854
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 2>you fight Shogun and your first world title fight,</v>

1855
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.570
<v Speaker 2>you're 24 years old and you beat his ass.</v>

1856
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.190
<v Speaker 2>He stopped them and everybody goes,</v>

1857
00:46:56.191 --> 00:46:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

1858
00:46:57.451 --> 00:46:58.290
<v Speaker 2>look at this guy.</v>

1859
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:59.011
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1860
00:46:59.011 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 2>I think John was 23 actually,</v>

1861
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:01.560
<v Speaker 2>now that I think about it,</v>

1862
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.570
<v Speaker 2>he was the youngest ever UFC champion.</v>

1863
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that Josh Barnett won the UFC heavyweight title when he was 24 so</v>

1864
00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I think I might be off by this,</v>

1865
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:11.710
<v Speaker 2>but I think John was 23 yeah,</v>

1866
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1867
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:13.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a special guy.</v>

1868
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:14.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1869
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:14.491
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

1870
00:47:14.491 --> 00:47:16.110
<v Speaker 2>just a special competitor.</v>

1871
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.660
<v Speaker 2>And I think that for someone like Cat Zingano,</v>

1872
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.720
<v Speaker 2>that media pressure is just as much pressure.</v>

1873
00:47:21.721 --> 00:47:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Having all those people ask you what's it like?</v>

1874
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.890
<v Speaker 2>What's it going to be like when you get in there?</v>

1875
00:47:25.891 --> 00:47:26.641
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to win?</v>

1876
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to,</v>

1877
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.470
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to beat Rhonda?</v>

1878
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna do about her arm bars?</v>

1879
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1880
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1881
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.511
<v Speaker 2>think about that.</v>

1882
00:47:31.511 --> 00:47:32.440
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna to better arm bar?</v>

1883
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about that fucking 15 seconds.</v>

1884
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:37.890
<v Speaker 2>And your arm barred dentally question the end of the equation.</v>

1885
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1886
00:47:38.201 --> 00:47:43.201
<v Speaker 2>And then you get our hard times that by 10,000 times every period of three</v>

1887
00:47:43.391 --> 00:47:44.224
<v Speaker 2>months prep.</v>

1888
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a mind fuck yeah.</v>

1889
00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Driving insane.</v>

1890
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.760
<v Speaker 2>But I think someone like you,</v>

1891
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Ana who is a world champion already,</v>

1892
00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 2>she's so used to competing at an incredibly high level and then she had to get</v>

1893
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.030
<v Speaker 2>her bearings in the UFC.</v>

1894
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.890
<v Speaker 2>She had that a one really tough fight with Claudia.</v>

1895
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Good day.</v>

1896
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1897
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Where it was neck and neck.</v>

1898
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:03.071
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

1899
00:48:03.071 --> 00:48:03.904
<v Speaker 2>very close fight.</v>

1900
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.490
<v Speaker 2>And then from then on she's gone to just dominate.</v>

1901
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a woman like that,</v>

1902
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.230
<v Speaker 2>like if you could find something like that at one 35 it would be very</v>

1903
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 2>interesting because although Rhonda is getting better at striking,</v>

1904
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.860
<v Speaker 2>you very rarely if ever see her throw kicks.</v>

1905
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:18.693
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare.</v>

1906
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1907
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.790
<v Speaker 2>And for someone who's a good Moint tie fighter man,</v>

1908
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:22.121
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

1909
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:25.870
<v Speaker 2>and also Ron has notoriously has had problems with her knees.</v>

1910
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1911
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to find someone that can fight going backwards is because run</v>

1912
00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:34.690
<v Speaker 2>the charges across the cage and then anyone that silly enough to stand in front</v>

1913
00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:37.180
<v Speaker 2>of it and think they can strike standing on the split dead,</v>

1914
00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:38.560
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get taken down the straight away.</v>

1915
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:39.521
<v Speaker 2>So you're gonna have to,</v>

1916
00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be mobile,</v>

1917
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.910
<v Speaker 2>otherwise she's going to grab you and flip it upside down.</v>

1918
00:48:42.911 --> 00:48:46.570
<v Speaker 2>And then when you hit an inside out and then you're also going to have to be</v>

1919
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:48.730
<v Speaker 2>world class as an athlete.</v>

1920
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 2>And I think that she is,</v>

1921
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:55.330
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think anybody she's ever fought is except maybe Sarah.</v>

1922
00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:56.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1923
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:57.303
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

1924
00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:57.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1925
00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:58.091
<v Speaker 2>who was,</v>

1926
00:48:58.091 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1927
00:48:58.810 --> 00:48:59.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1928
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:01.180
<v Speaker 2>not Alexis Davis,</v>

1929
00:49:01.181 --> 00:49:02.810
<v Speaker 2>but a Sarah McMahon who's,</v>

1930
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:03.580
<v Speaker 2>was that her name?</v>

1931
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.340
<v Speaker 2>The Olympic gold medal at the Olympic silver medalist and wrestling.</v>

1932
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1933
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1934
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.820
<v Speaker 2>she was obviously an excellent wrestler,</v>

1935
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:10.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1936
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:11.620
<v Speaker 2>so you've got that.</v>

1937
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:13.600
<v Speaker 2>She was at obviously an excellent wrestler,</v>

1938
00:49:13.601 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 2>but as an MMA fighter,</v>

1939
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:16.450
<v Speaker 2>she just,</v>

1940
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 2>there's like some holes in her game,</v>

1941
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:18.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1942
00:49:18.881 --> 00:49:19.301
<v Speaker 2>and she's,</v>

1943
00:49:19.301 --> 00:49:21.340
<v Speaker 2>she's not very good off of her back either.</v>

1944
00:49:21.341 --> 00:49:23.620
<v Speaker 2>She gets put on her back and she doesn't do so well,</v>

1945
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 2>but I think Ron does.</v>

1946
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:27.130
<v Speaker 2>She's a winner overall.</v>

1947
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Like that's like the most important thing.</v>

1948
00:49:28.841 --> 00:49:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Like that person,</v>

1949
00:49:30.221 --> 00:49:31.950
<v Speaker 2>like the John Jones mentality,</v>

1950
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.230
<v Speaker 2>the person who just knows how to win is not going to get rattled by the</v>

1951
00:49:35.231 --> 00:49:39.120
<v Speaker 2>pressure's not going to get rattled by all the hype and all the bullshit talk is</v>

1952
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.410
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to go in there and perform at their,</v>

1953
00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.600
<v Speaker 2>at their maximum level.</v>

1954
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda obviously can do that,</v>

1955
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:45.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1956
00:49:45.881 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 2>and she even said recently,</v>

1957
00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:48.281
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

1958
00:49:48.281 --> 00:49:49.510
<v Speaker 2>the more fucked up and crazy,</v>

1959
00:49:49.511 --> 00:49:52.060
<v Speaker 2>her life is more fucked up and crazy things are the better.</v>

1960
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:52.930
<v Speaker 2>She fights hay,</v>

1961
00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:54.670
<v Speaker 2>which is just nuts.</v>

1962
00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Last flight with them,</v>

1963
00:49:56.441 --> 00:49:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Beth.</v>

1964
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1965
00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:57.951
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1966
00:49:57.951 --> 00:49:59.110
<v Speaker 2>that right hand you landed,</v>

1967
00:49:59.140 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

1968
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.430
<v Speaker 2>you've never seen an another go look at another go with a single punch side.</v>

1969
00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.170
<v Speaker 2>That insane.</v>

1970
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:06.161
<v Speaker 2>Not an MMA.</v>

1971
00:50:06.161 --> 00:50:08.140
<v Speaker 2>At least the only time I've ever seen that in,</v>

1972
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1973
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.850
<v Speaker 2>in kickboxing.</v>

1974
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1975
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:11.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1976
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm was knocked some bitches dead with head kicks,</v>

1977
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:14.710
<v Speaker 2>head kicks,</v>

1978
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Butt Butt,</v>

1979
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.341
<v Speaker 2>Butt,</v>

1980
00:50:15.341 --> 00:50:16.280
<v Speaker 2>a singer right down there.</v>

1981
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:16.750
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1982
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:17.481
<v Speaker 2>that was nasty.</v>

1983
00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:18.100
<v Speaker 2>And it was nice.</v>

1984
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like she just a flash knockdown either.</v>

1985
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:20.711
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

1986
00:50:20.711 --> 00:50:21.544
<v Speaker 2>she was out,</v>

1987
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:22.211
<v Speaker 2>she was dead.</v>

1988
00:50:22.211 --> 00:50:24.100
<v Speaker 2>She was dating when she was hurt already.</v>

1989
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 2>W and then you know,</v>

1990
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 2>she tagged her was fucked up.</v>

1991
00:50:26.831 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Is she tagged with the right hand then as she's going down,</v>

1992
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda was already thrown the left.</v>

1993
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1994
00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:32.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1995
00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:33.680
<v Speaker 2>and the left landed two as she was,</v>

1996
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.270
<v Speaker 2>her body was already given out.</v>

1997
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1998
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.890
<v Speaker 2>That was nasty.</v>

1999
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:37.301
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

2000
00:50:37.301 --> 00:50:40.340
<v Speaker 2>that was a wakeup call to a lot of people that she's like learning how to strike</v>

2001
00:50:40.341 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2002
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.230
<v Speaker 2>But all with all due respect,</v>

2003
00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.700
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is a brawler like her technique is,</v>

2004
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not that good.</v>

2005
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:53.500
<v Speaker 2>She throws like kind of arm punches and she's like physically like bull doggish</v>

2006
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you know she's tough and strong but she's not,</v>

2007
00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:57.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2008
00:50:57.681 --> 00:50:58.940
<v Speaker 2>she's not moving like,</v>

2009
00:50:58.941 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 2>like yo Jay check.</v>

2010
00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:00.621
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2011
00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Like she's not moving like an elite striker.</v>

2012
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 2>She's throwing barrages of punches and the pressure for her must have been off</v>

2013
00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:11.540
<v Speaker 2>the fucking charts in Brazil fighting Ronda Rousey,</v>

2014
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:13.130
<v Speaker 2>talking so much shit.</v>

2015
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:17.570
<v Speaker 2>And then she fucked up and talked about Rhonda is Dad and suicide and all that.</v>

2016
00:51:17.571 --> 00:51:17.810
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2017
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:19.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2018
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:21.650
<v Speaker 2>the Brazilians kind of turned on her for that.</v>

2019
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:24.890
<v Speaker 2>And then at the Wayans the Brazilians were cheering Rhonda,</v>

2020
00:51:24.891 --> 00:51:26.570
<v Speaker 2>which never happens.</v>

2021
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>

2022
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:29.690
<v Speaker 2>that's how much she's transcended.</v>

2023
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.720
<v Speaker 2>She can go to Brazil and the Brazilians would cheer her.</v>

2024
00:51:32.721 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that in my life.</v>

2025
00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Wait till she eats Australia.</v>

2026
00:51:34.941 --> 00:51:35.301
<v Speaker 2>And she's,</v>

2027
00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:35.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2028
00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:36.201
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

2029
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:36.830
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

2030
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:39.110
<v Speaker 2>she's a global phenomenon.</v>

2031
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.930
<v Speaker 2>She's amazing when she hits Australia,</v>

2032
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I think the amount of support she's going to get there,</v>

2033
00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:44.990
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be off the charts as well.</v>

2034
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:46.301
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a,</v>

2035
00:51:46.301 --> 00:51:46.960
<v Speaker 2>and then I switched.</v>

2036
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Holly had more fights in the UFC.</v>

2037
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Was gonna ask Ya on the,</v>

2038
00:51:51.051 --> 00:51:51.651
<v Speaker 2>on the side,</v>

2039
00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about that fight?</v>

2040
00:51:52.611 --> 00:51:54.980
<v Speaker 2>And I think I'm a little bit early for pull Holly,</v>

2041
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:55.730
<v Speaker 2>but Geez,</v>

2042
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.770
<v Speaker 2>she's amazing books that she's still to win so many more titles in boxing and</v>

2043
00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.420
<v Speaker 2>then that head kicks a killer too.</v>

2044
00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2045
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:02.331
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2046
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:02.781
<v Speaker 2>it's not that,</v>

2047
00:52:02.781 --> 00:52:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that Holly is capable.</v>

2048
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.450
<v Speaker 2>What I,</v>

2049
00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:05.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2050
00:52:05.661 --> 00:52:06.680
<v Speaker 2>one of those things I said is like,</v>

2051
00:52:06.681 --> 00:52:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2052
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a smart fight because I want to see her fight some more</v>

2053
00:52:10.371 --> 00:52:10.790
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2054

<v Speaker 2>I want to see her fight.</v>

2055
00:52:11.541 --> 00:52:12.374
<v Speaker 2>Misha Tate.</v>

2056
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.640
<v Speaker 2>I want to see her fight,</v>

2057
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:14.503
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2058
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:15.831
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank.</v>

2059
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:16.664
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez.</v>

2060
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I want to see her fight some tough girls and put on a show and then,</v>

2061
00:52:20.421 --> 00:52:20.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2062

2063
00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2064
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I believe you had mentioned the main that before.</v>

2065
00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

2066
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:25.551
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

2067
00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:26.330
<v Speaker 2>she's a terror.</v>

2068
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:28.640
<v Speaker 2>She's knocked out Sarah McMahon and her last fight,</v>

2069
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:29.390
<v Speaker 2>she was awesome.</v>

2070
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.450
<v Speaker 2>She's a beach day and you can tell she wants it too.</v>

2071
00:52:32.451 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 2>She's not,</v>

2072
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:34.280
<v Speaker 2>she's not in the base.</v>

2073
00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 2>The TC,</v>

2074
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.230
<v Speaker 2>she wants that title built bad.</v>

2075
00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:37.100
<v Speaker 2>It is Sarah McMahon.</v>

2076
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:37.251
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2077
00:52:37.251 --> 00:52:38.084
<v Speaker 2>Am I saying that?</v>

2078
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:39.613
<v Speaker 2>Make sure I'm right.</v>

2079
00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost positive I am,</v>

2080
00:52:41.601 --> 00:52:42.890
<v Speaker 2>but for one or for whatever reason,</v>

2081
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:45.440
<v Speaker 2>I see her face in front of me and for whatever reason,</v>

2082
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Sarah seems like I fucked up day.</v>

2083
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:49.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't have too many names in my head,</v>

2084
00:52:49.311 --> 00:52:49.670
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2085
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:50.503
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

2086
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:51.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2087
00:52:51.561 --> 00:52:52.160
<v Speaker 2>it is right.</v>

2088
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:52.993
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2089
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2090
00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:53.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2091
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:57.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think Holly is physically very capable without a doubt.</v>

2092
00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.990
<v Speaker 2>And technically very capable without a doubt.</v>

2093
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Should be the best striker run has ever faced.</v>

2094
00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:02.870
<v Speaker 2>No question about it.</v>

2095
00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2096
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:05.240
<v Speaker 2>It's whether or not she can keep the fight standing.</v>

2097
00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.320
<v Speaker 2>She can keep Rhonda offer whether she could deal with the pressure when she goes</v>

2098
00:53:09.321 --> 00:53:12.750
<v Speaker 2>out there and they're 70,000 insane.</v>

2099
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:14.780
<v Speaker 2>That's 10,000 more than we've ever done before.</v>

2100
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

2101
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.490
<v Speaker 2>and it's already almost sold out.</v>

2102
00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's crazy if I'm fighting main events in Albuquerque and to it to come</v>

2103
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:24.350
<v Speaker 2>into Australia and fighting in front of it because footballs in the Melbourne</v>

2104
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 2>and to across the octagon</v>

2105
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.940
<v Speaker 1>at that Blonde Damon coming out to that fucking Joan Jett Song,</v>

2106
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:31.300
<v Speaker 1>g wised.</v>

2107
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever heard anyone call it or the the one Damon,</v>

2108
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:35.483
<v Speaker 1>he's a dean.</v>

2109
00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:36.571
<v Speaker 1>He's no,</v>

2110
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:37.381
<v Speaker 1>no question about it.</v>

2111
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:37.601
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

2112
00:53:37.601 --> 00:53:40.860
<v Speaker 1>when you're locked in that thing with her and she goes after those girls,</v>

2113
00:53:40.861 --> 00:53:41.694
<v Speaker 1>that's a demon.</v>

2114
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:42.763
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2115
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you say after we did the podcast in February,</v>

2116
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:45.181
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2117
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky enough to go to the UFC hearing at the staples center and then,</v>

2118
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:49.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2119
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:51.570

2120
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2121
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:53.340

<v Speaker 1>And as a fan boy,</v>

2124
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I had my iPhone.</v>

2125
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2126

2128
00:54:03.661 --> 00:54:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I should ask her for her.</v>

2129
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:05.611
<v Speaker 1>The I'll fuck it.</v>

2131
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2132

<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2157
00:54:30.831 --> 00:54:31.800
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get a photo with him.</v>

2158
00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2159
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.050
<v Speaker 1>this is the Guy Admin knows who you are.</v>

2160
00:54:34.051 --> 00:54:34.550
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

2161
00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2162
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.380
<v Speaker 1>he was on,</v>

2163
00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.001
<v Speaker 1>he's amazing.</v>

2164
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:38.050
<v Speaker 1>So then we took a photo and then we,</v>

2165
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:39.091
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

2166
00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:39.901
<v Speaker 1>she's amazing.</v>

2167
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:41.130
<v Speaker 1>She's such a cool person.</v>

2168
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.631
<v Speaker 1>I was so scared.</v>

2169
00:54:42.631 --> 00:54:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I was so star Trek and then I'm sure it's just normal.</v>

2170
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:45.601
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2171
00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:46.081
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2172
00:54:46.081 --> 00:54:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and then afterwards I'll come down and got some,</v>

2173
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.740
<v Speaker 1>a couple of drinks at the hotel bar there and Edmond was there and he made his</v>

2174
00:54:52.741 --> 00:54:54.600
<v Speaker 1>way over to come and have a chat to me.</v>

2175
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And then we just talk like a week long lost friends.</v>

2176
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.691
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

2177
00:54:57.691 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 1>he was such a gentleman as well.</v>

2178
00:54:58.831 --> 00:54:59.850
<v Speaker 1>He was such a nice guy.</v>

2179
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2180
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.481
<v Speaker 1>people get,</v>

2181
00:55:01.481 --> 00:55:01.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2182
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

2183
00:55:02.581 --> 00:55:03.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2184
00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:04.390
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason they get,</v>

2185
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:06.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a misconception about what he's like,</v>

2186
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2187
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I think part of is the Armenian thing.</v>

2188
00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2189
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Armenians are so,</v>

2190
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:12.870
<v Speaker 1>they're so masculine,</v>

2191
00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2192
00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:13.861
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

2193
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:17.010
<v Speaker 1>they have this certain way about them that a lot of people,</v>

2194
00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:18.030
<v Speaker 1>they misread that,</v>

2195
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:18.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2196
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:19.291
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

2197
00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:19.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2198
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:20.730
<v Speaker 1>they're fun people.</v>

2199
00:55:20.731 --> 00:55:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2200
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.391
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

2201
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:22.530
<v Speaker 1>they're very proud,</v>

2202
00:55:22.531 --> 00:55:23.490
<v Speaker 1>very fun people.</v>

2203
00:55:23.491 --> 00:55:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

2204
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of Armenians.</v>

2205
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I really liked them because I sit in the ultimate fighter too,</v>

2206
00:55:28.231 --> 00:55:30.750
<v Speaker 1>so I was expecting a certain sort of presence,</v>

2207
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:32.850
<v Speaker 1>but then when it was just,</v>

2208
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:33.601
<v Speaker 1>he's a gentleman,</v>

2209
00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:33.940
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2210
00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:34.161
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2211
00:55:34.161 --> 00:55:34.981
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>

2212
00:55:34.981 --> 00:55:35.814
<v Speaker 1>He will say cool.</v>

2213
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And then him,</v>

2214
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.810
<v Speaker 1>and then we just started talking about my attire and fighting.</v>

2215
00:55:39.811 --> 00:55:42.750
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm actually my wife who's a fight on the same card as in back in the</v>

2216
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:43.590
<v Speaker 1>day when he was competing.</v>

2217
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.311
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2218
00:55:44.311 --> 00:55:44.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2219
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2220
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.260
<v Speaker 1>we compete.</v>

2221
00:55:46.261 --> 00:55:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Where did you,</v>

2222
00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.580
<v Speaker 1>did you ever see him compete?</v>

2223
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2224
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:50.040
<v Speaker 1>they fought in the same cards here and Kelly</v>

2225
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:54.883
<v Speaker 1>in Buena Park.</v>

2226
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.251
<v Speaker 1>That's when,</v>

2227
00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:56.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2228
00:55:56.461 --> 00:55:57.294
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

2229
00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:57.901
<v Speaker 1>It's fight number.</v>

2230
00:55:57.901 --> 00:55:58.734
<v Speaker 1>I've just kidding.</v>

2231
00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:01.903
<v Speaker 1>When a park,</v>

2232
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:02.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2233
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:03.181
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2234
00:56:03.181 --> 00:56:03.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2235
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:06.150
<v Speaker 1>he's done some great things with other fighters too.</v>

2236
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Like he's really improved Travis Brown's hands,</v>

2237
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:09.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2238
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.500
<v Speaker 1>he's done some real good work with him.</v>

2239
00:56:10.501 --> 00:56:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you saw 'em and Travis Browne's fight against Brenda's,</v>

2240
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:15.210
<v Speaker 1>you saw some sharp combinations,</v>

2241
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.110
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2242
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2243
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:17.131
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

2244
00:56:17.131 --> 00:56:17.731
<v Speaker 1>he got knocked up.</v>

2245
00:56:17.731 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Rl asked you in the fight afterwards,</v>

2246
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:20.880
<v Speaker 1>but that was just chaos.</v>

2247
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.860
<v Speaker 1>But I'd heard that like in the gym,</v>

2248
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting dynamic</v>

2249
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.031
<v Speaker 2>between fighters.</v>

2250
00:56:25.031 --> 00:56:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes fights,</v>

2251
00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:28.930
<v Speaker 2>like when you look at guys on paper,</v>

2252
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:31.760
<v Speaker 2>like Travis was ranked number three in the world and our lost,</v>

2253
00:56:31.761 --> 00:56:32.410
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't,</v>

2254
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:32.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2255
00:56:32.661 --> 00:56:35.800
<v Speaker 2>a Lawsky was a guy that everybody thought was at the end of his,</v>

2256
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:36.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2257
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:37.413
<v Speaker 2>his time.</v>

2258
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 2>But our Lasky,</v>

2259
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:41.170
<v Speaker 2>it's been a worldclass.</v>

2260
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Stryker for a long time are lost.</v>

2261
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:45.640
<v Speaker 2>You'd been a heavyweight champion of the UFC,</v>

2262
00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:48.100
<v Speaker 2>had a nasty power in his punches,</v>

2263
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:48.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2264
00:56:48.461 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 2>nasty right hand and in the gym,</v>

2265
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.510
<v Speaker 2>there's no pressure in the gym.</v>

2266
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:56.500
<v Speaker 2>He could be himself and in the gym he had been used to bullying Travis around.</v>

2267
00:56:56.501 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he had been beaten Travis up when they'd had sparring sessions.</v>

2268
00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.940
<v Speaker 2>That was what the word was.</v>

2269
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:03.940
<v Speaker 2>So that when they'd gotten into the octagon together,</v>

2270
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:05.380
<v Speaker 2>like for everybody else,</v>

2271
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:05.741
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

2272
00:57:05.741 --> 00:57:06.380
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2273
00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:06.811
<v Speaker 2>her laughs,</v>

2274
00:57:06.811 --> 00:57:07.750
<v Speaker 2>he's got a tough fight.</v>

2275
00:57:07.751 --> 00:57:08.201
<v Speaker 2>But for him,</v>

2276
00:57:08.201 --> 00:57:09.034
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2277
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:09.581
<v Speaker 2>our spa,</v>

2278
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:10.720
<v Speaker 2>this guy a hundred times,</v>

2279
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go after him.</v>

2280
00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 2>And so they went after each other and one point Travis had them down,</v>

2281
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:16.841
<v Speaker 2>man had him down.</v>

2282
00:57:16.841 --> 00:57:18.580
<v Speaker 2>It hurt bad and our laughs,</v>

2283
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 2>he came back from that and knocked him out and like that was one of the craziest</v>

2284
00:57:21.851 --> 00:57:23.360
<v Speaker 2>rounds in heavyweight history.</v>

2285
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Can Matt necessarily say cool,</v>

2286
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:26.561
<v Speaker 2>wild,</v>

2287
00:57:26.561 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 2>wild round and then a Lusk guys in flights and mia and I was expecting the same</v>

2288
00:57:30.551 --> 00:57:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Oleske liberal Kotlin St.</v>

2289
00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:35.830
<v Speaker 2>I was expecting this same thing expecting the same fireworks and unfortunately</v>

2290
00:57:35.831 --> 00:57:36.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a little,</v>

2291
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 2>it was a little bit of a look quite the same enthusiasm in that one I think in</v>

2292
00:57:41.021 --> 00:57:41.854
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>

2293
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that happens in really high pressure fights,</v>

2294
00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.510
<v Speaker 2>and I think this correlates with what we were talking earlier about pressure and</v>

2295
00:57:49.511 --> 00:57:50.540
<v Speaker 2>about like you,</v>

2296
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you know we were talking about guys that put too much pressure on themselves</v>

2297
00:57:53.501 --> 00:57:57.280
<v Speaker 2>from shit talking and get too much emotionally wrapped up in it.</v>

2298
00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:02.500
<v Speaker 2>When a fight is a fight where they say the winner is going to be the number one</v>

2299
00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:03.210
<v Speaker 2>contender,</v>

2300
00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:04.470
<v Speaker 2>we'll next fight for the title.</v>

2301
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Those fights suck at least 50% of the time because at least 50% of the time</v>

2302
00:58:09.311 --> 00:58:12.880
<v Speaker 2>everybody locks up and nobody wants to do anything stupid because a win</v>

2303
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:15.660
<v Speaker 2>virtually guarantees you a shot at the title yet.</v>

2304
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:20.740
<v Speaker 2>But the fight wasn't good because neither guy pulled the trigger and it was</v>

2305
00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:20.980
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2306
00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.300
<v Speaker 2>it was very lack luster.</v>

2307
00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:24.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like both guys were like hesitant and,</v>

2308
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 2>and even our Lawsky,</v>

2309
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.690
<v Speaker 2>even though he won the fight when I was interviewing him,</v>

2310
00:58:28.691 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't happy gay.</v>

2311
00:58:29.681 --> 00:58:31.960
<v Speaker 2>He was shaking his head and he was devastated and he is crazy.</v>

2312
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:32.620
<v Speaker 2>He won,</v>

2313
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.131
<v Speaker 2>he won.</v>

2314
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:33.700
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2315
00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:35.950
<v Speaker 2>he thought he was going to have the next shot at the title,</v>

2316
00:58:35.951 --> 00:58:36.611
<v Speaker 2>but then you know,</v>

2317
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:38.230
<v Speaker 2>then the fight was bad.</v>

2318
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:41.500
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the weird things about the UFC that people don't like is if</v>

2319
00:58:41.501 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Speaker 2>there isn't any like clear structure.</v>

2320
00:58:43.361 --> 00:58:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Like when Misha Tate one,</v>

2321
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:48.400
<v Speaker 2>she was virtually guaranteed shot at the title beat Jessica.</v>

2322
00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I you got a shot at the title.</v>

2323
00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:50.381
<v Speaker 2>She Be Jessica.</v>

2324
00:58:50.381 --> 00:58:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2325
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:51.770
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2326
00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:52.670
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

2327
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:53.230
<v Speaker 2>It's the price.</v>

2328
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:54.063
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2329
00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:54.971
<v Speaker 2>you're not ready for that.</v>

2330
00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:55.804
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>

2331
00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.093
<v Speaker 2>So she's,</v>

2332
00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:58.031
<v Speaker 2>she's actually,</v>

2333
00:58:58.031 --> 00:59:02.050
<v Speaker 2>she made some interview recently where she said that she should probably think</v>

2334
00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:05.650
<v Speaker 2>about what she's going to do when she retires and she should probably at least</v>

2335
00:59:05.651 --> 00:59:06.484
<v Speaker 2>consider that.</v>

2336
00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:07.211
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2337
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2338
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:09.640
<v Speaker 2>She's like thinking about retiring.</v>

2339
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's an interesting thing when you look at the number one person in the</v>

2340
00:59:13.811 --> 00:59:14.291
<v Speaker 2>division,</v>

2341
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 2>which is clearly Rhonda,</v>

2342
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:16.750
<v Speaker 2>who's made,</v>

2343
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I think she may like $6 million last year or $7 million,</v>

2344
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:21.070
<v Speaker 2>something fucking crazy.</v>

2345
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.650
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

2346
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:22.760
<v Speaker 2>and that's in fighting,</v>

2347
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:23.501
<v Speaker 2>forgot about,</v>

2348
00:59:23.501 --> 00:59:25.370
<v Speaker 2>or all these ads she's doing,</v>

2349
00:59:25.371 --> 00:59:27.290
<v Speaker 2>she's in a million different fucking commercials.</v>

2350
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:27.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2351
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:32.441
<v Speaker 2>she's probably made that much on top of that with just ads and endorsements and</v>

2352
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:33.531
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

2353
00:59:33.531 --> 00:59:35.360
<v Speaker 2>She's done two big movies.</v>

2354
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.970
<v Speaker 2>She's making fucking truckloads of money.</v>

2355
00:59:37.971 --> 00:59:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2356
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.530
<v Speaker 2>And then there's Meisha Tate,</v>

2357
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:41.840
<v Speaker 2>who's the number two girl in the division,</v>

2358
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:42.853
<v Speaker 2>arguably.</v>

2359
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2360
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 2>even though she's lost to Ronda three times,</v>

2361
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:48.140
<v Speaker 2>she's the number two girl in the division,</v>

2362
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:48.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2363
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2364
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:51.470
<v Speaker 2>And how much do you think she makes?</v>

2365
00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is,</v>

2366
00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a fraction.</v>

2367
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:54.613
<v Speaker 2>A small,</v>

2368
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 2>as long as she's not hot,</v>

2369
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:57.110
<v Speaker 2>she's hot as fuck.</v>

2370
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.033
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2371
00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:59.120
<v Speaker 2>It's got beautiful body.</v>

2372
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:00.961
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

2373
01:00:00.961 --> 01:00:01.700
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

2374
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.533
<v Speaker 2>sorry Misha.</v>

2375
01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.381
<v Speaker 2>All due respect.</v>

2376
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:04.460
<v Speaker 2>But she's a great fighter too.</v>

2377
01:00:04.461 --> 01:00:05.300
<v Speaker 2>She's very tough.</v>

2378
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's photos of you at the Wayne plus.</v>

2379
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:09.411
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was her,</v>

2380
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it was looking at Rhonda Zass.</v>

2381
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:12.223
<v Speaker 2>I've looked at a few hours.</v>

2382
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.863
<v Speaker 2>He kept board.</v>

2383
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not a do,</v>

2384
01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing there in their underwear,</v>

2385
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:19.630
<v Speaker 2>feet away from me not being a creek,</v>

2386
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.780
<v Speaker 2>just doing my job.</v>

2387
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2388
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.030
<v Speaker 2>but you know me,</v>

2389
01:00:24.031 --> 01:00:25.910
<v Speaker 2>shit probably makes it very,</v>

2390
01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 2>very small fraction of what Rhonda makes.</v>

2391
01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.810
<v Speaker 2>And she's elite.</v>

2392
01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.730
<v Speaker 2>She's an outstanding fighter.</v>

2393
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 2>She's tough as shit man.</v>

2394
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:34.640
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2395
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:35.600
<v Speaker 2>and people love her.</v>

2396
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:36.463
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2397
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.050
<v Speaker 2>I believe she's been to the movies and then as well.</v>

2399
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2400
01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.160
<v Speaker 2>His cyborg and Holly did that last one.</v>

2401
01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:41.300
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2402
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the Instagram and Facebook now,</v>

2403
01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:44.810
<v Speaker 2>but who's making that movie?</v>

2404
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to see that movie?</v>

2405
01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:47.331
<v Speaker 2>What does that movie,</v>

2406
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:52.331
<v Speaker 2>that movie some fucking 3:00 AM Cinemax fucking Zombie movie chicken zombies</v>

2407
01:00:52.851 --> 01:00:53.770
<v Speaker 2>heads off or something.</v>

2408
01:00:53.771 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2409
01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.400
<v Speaker 2>it's like people,</v>

2410
01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:56.211
<v Speaker 2>when people would tell me,</v>

2411
01:00:56.211 --> 01:00:56.481
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2412
01:00:56.481 --> 01:00:57.440
<v Speaker 2>he's doing movies now.</v>

2413
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:58.303
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2414
01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:58.641
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2415
01:00:58.641 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people doing movies.</v>

2416
01:01:00.201 --> 01:01:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of movie?</v>

2417
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:02.523
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2418
01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Bj Penn did if a couple of movies and we've and Gina Carano has done like,</v>

2419
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.460
<v Speaker 2>she's done some big movies and she did that,</v>

2420
01:01:10.461 --> 01:01:10.671
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2421
01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:11.630
<v Speaker 2>that one movie.</v>

2422
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:12.700
<v Speaker 2>What was that movie that he was,</v>

2423
01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:13.910
<v Speaker 2>she was a star Haywire.</v>

2424
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Nobody saw it.</v>

2425
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.220
<v Speaker 2>And then because nobody saw it,</v>

2426
01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:17.270
<v Speaker 2>nobody gave me shit about it.</v>

2427
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.440
<v Speaker 2>It faded away.</v>

2428
01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.280
<v Speaker 2>And then you don't hear about her as a movie star anymore.</v>

2429
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean she was,</v>

2430
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:22.250
<v Speaker 2>she was that close,</v>

2431
01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:27.580
<v Speaker 2>that close to being this runaway train movie star and this fast and the furious</v>

2432
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:30.430
<v Speaker 2>and there's all the figures which she,</v>

2433
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda was in that Rhonda was in one of those.</v>

2434
01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2435
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:34.810
<v Speaker 2>And then also a Deadpool,</v>

2436
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I think that was coming out.</v>

2437
01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.740
<v Speaker 2>She just got a major part hopefully that my school I broke had a Korea.</v>

2438
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2439
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>the ads for the or the previews for Deadpool look bad out.</v>

2440
01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:44.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough,</v>

2441
01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>but my point is it's a tough racket.</v>

2442
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.290
<v Speaker 2>The movie business is a tough racket.</v>

2443
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2444
01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2445
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:49.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2446
01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I remember Frank shamrock saying to be once like he's,</v>

2447
01:01:52.101 --> 01:01:53.390
<v Speaker 2>he said he was going to get into acting.</v>

2448
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.561
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2449
01:01:53.561 --> 01:01:53.651
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2450
01:01:53.651 --> 01:01:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna take over the world of acting the same way I took over the world of</v>

2451
01:01:55.791 --> 01:01:56.061
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

2452
01:01:56.061 --> 01:01:56.894
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2453
01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:57.801
<v Speaker 2>good luck with that,</v>

2454
01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:58.540
<v Speaker 2>dude did.</v>

2455
01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.780
<v Speaker 2>You can't even control that.</v>

2456
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:03.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you can run hills better than anybody and kick people's asses that</v>

2457
01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:03.980
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2458
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:04.701
<v Speaker 2>when you're fighting,</v>

2459
01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:05.840
<v Speaker 2>you could be undeniable.</v>

2460
01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2461
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.543
<v Speaker 2>you were fighting,</v>

2462
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.150
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2463
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:11.450
<v Speaker 2>they lock you in that octagon or you hop over the ropes into that ring.</v>

2464
01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:13.580
<v Speaker 2>And when the referee says fight,</v>

2465
01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:15.470
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that can save that guy.</v>

2466
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:16.041
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2467
01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:18.860
<v Speaker 2>you storm after him and knock him out and you're the fucking king.</v>

2468
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:21.270
<v Speaker 2>But in the world of acting,</v>

2469
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.680
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

2470
01:02:22.681 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 2>there's so many hoops and ladders and so much bullshit.</v>

2471
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:27.420
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't matter if you're the best from you,</v>

2472
01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:28.450
<v Speaker 2>you know exactly what's going on.</v>

2473
01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.820
<v Speaker 2>You've sort of enough,</v>

2474
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I've done some acting,</v>

2475
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:34.590
<v Speaker 2>but I've been very lucky to be like on the outside of it all looking in,</v>

2476
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:34.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2477
01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:36.300
<v Speaker 2>cause I was always a standup comic.</v>

2478
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.880
<v Speaker 2>I always had that as my real career.</v>

2479
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:42.150
<v Speaker 2>And then this acting thing was something I did when they offered me money to do</v>

2480
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:42.550
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2481
01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 2>If it's not something I really chased after that much.</v>

2482
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.310
<v Speaker 2>And so when I watch other people that were chasing after it,</v>

2483
01:02:47.311 --> 01:02:47.911
<v Speaker 2>I got to see,</v>

2484
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:48.121
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2485
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 2>the psychological aspect of it,</v>

2486
01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:54.030
<v Speaker 2>you see people kissing people's asses because you want everybody to like you</v>

2487
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.930
<v Speaker 2>because you want to get cast in these movies and you got to make friends the</v>

2488
01:02:57.931 --> 01:02:59.010
<v Speaker 2>right social circles.</v>

2489
01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:00.660
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be in the right red carpets.</v>

2490
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 2>You gotta support the right cause.</v>

2491
01:03:02.371 --> 01:03:04.890
<v Speaker 2>You have to have the right political affiliations.</v>

2492
01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:05.310
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2493
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:06.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a mess,</v>

2494
01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2495
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking mess.</v>

2496
01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.780
<v Speaker 2>You can't say anything controversial.</v>

2497
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.321
<v Speaker 2>Can't,</v>

2498
01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 2>can't do anything too fucked up.</v>

2499
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:12.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2500
01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:12.780
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

2501
01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.530
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things you can get away with as an athlete you can get away with</v>

2502
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 2>as an actor because if you did,</v>

2503
01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:18.931
<v Speaker 2>they would just write,</v>

2504
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:21.330
<v Speaker 2>unless you're like some fucking Johnny Depp Style,</v>

2505
01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:23.760
<v Speaker 2>huge undeniable movie star,</v>

2506
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.140
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with a lot of shit.</v>

2507
01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:25.951
<v Speaker 2>But that's just,</v>

2508
01:03:25.951 --> 01:03:27.000
<v Speaker 2>you become undeniable.</v>

2509
01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:28.380
<v Speaker 2>You have so much fan base.</v>

2510
01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:28.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2511
01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:29.340
<v Speaker 2>he's already,</v>

2512
01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.960
<v Speaker 2>he's already there so he can do what he wants now.</v>

2513
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

2514
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:33.060
<v Speaker 2>But even like Tom Cruise,</v>

2515
01:03:33.061 --> 01:03:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise fucked up and he started,</v>

2516
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:35.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2517
01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:39.480
<v Speaker 2>he did a bunch of wacky interviews where he's talking about Brooke Shields and</v>

2518
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Scientology.</v>

2519
01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2520
01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 2>And antidepressants had put dude his fucking movies,</v>

2521
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.141
<v Speaker 2>tickets,</v>

2522
01:03:45.141 --> 01:03:47.400
<v Speaker 2>sales ditch dropped after that.</v>

2523
01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:50.160
<v Speaker 2>And it took a while for them to rebound.</v>

2524
01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Took a couple of years to rebound.</v>

2525
01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Didn't help things at all.</v>

2526
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:54.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2527
01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.670
<v Speaker 2>that's wacky fucking shit,</v>

2528
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:57.000
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2529
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>

2530
01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:58.051
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>

2531
01:03:58.051 --> 01:04:00.030
<v Speaker 2>it's that weird world of acting.</v>

2532
01:04:00.031 --> 01:04:00.661
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2533
01:04:00.661 --> 01:04:03.900
<v Speaker 2>when frank was telling me he was gonna take over that world and my chooses,</v>

2534
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:05.370

2539
01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:09.900
<v Speaker 2>What's not the same world.</v>

2540
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:13.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'm going to take over the world of being a marathon runner yet.</v>

2541
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:13.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2548
01:04:18.511 --> 01:04:19.560
<v Speaker 2>You're running the same road.</v>

2549
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.960
<v Speaker 2>You're not running the same road when you're acting.</v>

2550
01:04:21.961 --> 01:04:22.794
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2563
01:04:39.211 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 2>after I did the documentary of the bus event and we played around a little bit</v>

2564
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:45.350
<v Speaker 2>and then we went to Thailand and then I was lucky enough to work with the,</v>

2565
01:04:45.351 --> 01:04:47.580
<v Speaker 2>some Thai stuntman and a,</v>

2566
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:51.720
<v Speaker 2>they'd work with a tiny jar and it was nice to get you guys credible.</v>

2567
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Say they stopped him that well I got to work with um,</v>

2568
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2569
01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.280
<v Speaker 2>you had thrown an inch,</v>

2570
01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.660
<v Speaker 2>a punched and each pass their face and they literally throw themselves back 10</v>

2571
01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:02.280
<v Speaker 2>feet onto concrete unto thee,</v>

2572
01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.173
<v Speaker 2>unto their back,</v>

2573
01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.200
<v Speaker 2>you think.</v>

2574
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:04.480
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2575
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.900
<v Speaker 2>and then they lay their eggs,</v>

2576
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:07.780
<v Speaker 2>they laid a Dade for three seconds,</v>

2577
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.440
<v Speaker 2>open their eyes,</v>

2578
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:08.940
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2579
01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.401
<v Speaker 2>do it again.</v>

2580
01:05:09.401 --> 01:05:10.950
<v Speaker 2>And this time we're going to cut it in a bit shorter.</v>

2581
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:13.050
<v Speaker 2>And then the term stuff again and again,</v>

2582
01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:14.610
<v Speaker 2>and they can't really know how to fall,</v>

<v Speaker 1>make it look amazing.</v>

2589
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2590
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guys who far you get,</v>

2591
01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:22.980
<v Speaker 1>they've got to really know how to fall in up for themselves.</v>

2592
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:23.201
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2593
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:23.561
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2594
01:05:23.561 --> 01:05:24.570
<v Speaker 1>a different different league.</v>

2595
01:05:24.571 --> 01:05:25.404
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2596
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2597
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather punch someone in the faces letter.</v>

2598
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather make my money free bottlers instead of pretending to be violent.</v>

2599
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>And the documentary that you were talking about it people didn't understand you</v>

2600
01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>through your thick Aussie accent,</v>

2601
01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.240
<v Speaker 1>blessed with venom and it's a great documentary and it details your life and</v>

2602
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>learning Moyie Thai and moving to Thailand and living there and fighting there.</v>

2603
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's really cool documentary man.</v>

2604
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Thanks you.</v>

2605
01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2606
01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:52.240
<v Speaker 1>so many people were messaging me and saying,</v>

2607
01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Jared and sent me here in the youtube comments saying thank you very much for</v>

2608
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:56.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2609
01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.870
<v Speaker 1>for the Joe Rogan a the great documentary.</v>

2610
01:05:58.871 --> 01:05:59.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

2611
01:05:59.380 --> 01:05:59.571
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2612
01:05:59.571 --> 01:06:00.404
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

2613
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:00.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2614
01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:01.511
<v Speaker 1>saying before,</v>

2615
01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:03.010
<v Speaker 1>like when I got released in Australia,</v>

2616
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:04.780
<v Speaker 1>it was lucky enough to be open in cinemas.</v>

2617
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:06.850
<v Speaker 1>So we had cinema release and then,</v>

2618
01:06:06.851 --> 01:06:07.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2619
01:06:07.181 --> 01:06:08.050
<v Speaker 1>it just went nowhere.</v>

2620
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's on youtube now.</v>

2621
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.861
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be,</v>

2622
01:06:09.861 --> 01:06:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to have a look a bit of a bit,</v>

2623
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.453
<v Speaker 1>not only about,</v>

2624
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2625
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.810
<v Speaker 1>my career,</v>

2626
01:06:13.811 --> 01:06:15.640
<v Speaker 1>but also about Thai culture.</v>

2627
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.830
<v Speaker 1>So I nausea,</v>

2628
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.530
<v Speaker 1>going to Thailand and learning the Tai Customs and culture and learning how to</v>

2629
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.290
<v Speaker 1>speak Thai and eating on the floor and sleep,</v>

2630
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.860
<v Speaker 1>sleeping on the wooden floor and training seven hours a day.</v>

2631
01:06:26.861 --> 01:06:27.694
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty.</v>

2632
01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.990
<v Speaker 1>And then fighting the killers too.</v>

2633
01:06:28.991 --> 01:06:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't just going in there and make it up and nothing numbers.</v>

2634
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky enough to sat at the bottom and then work my way up to winning two</v>

2635
01:06:35.321 --> 01:06:36.220
<v Speaker 1>world titles in Bangkok.</v>

2636
01:06:36.221 --> 01:06:36.651
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

2637
01:06:36.651 --> 01:06:36.781
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2638
01:06:36.781 --> 01:06:37.331
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2639
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:38.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a happy ending.</v>

2640
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating documentary too because like culturally it's such a,</v>

2641
01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:48.090
<v Speaker 1>it's such a unique thing for someone to do to immerse themselves in the world of</v>

2642
01:06:49.931 --> 01:06:53.860
<v Speaker 1>the tie and have these more tie fighters and live like they live and train like</v>

2643
01:06:53.861 --> 01:06:54.520
<v Speaker 1>they live.</v>

2644
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.190
<v Speaker 1>And a guy coming from Australia and moving there and doing that,</v>

2645
01:06:57.191 --> 01:06:57.491
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2646
01:06:57.491 --> 01:06:58.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2647
01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:58.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2648
01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:58.840
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2649
01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.261
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>

2650
01:06:59.261 --> 01:06:59.591
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

2651
01:06:59.591 --> 01:07:02.980
<v Speaker 1>amazing to watch someone just enter into a world.</v>

2652
01:07:02.981 --> 01:07:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It's so completely different than theirs.</v>

2653
01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:05.311
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

2654
01:07:05.311 --> 01:07:09.490
<v Speaker 1>you barely had a grasp at all of the language and you know,</v>

2655
01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:14.491
<v Speaker 1>you're training with these guys that have been essentially preparing for fights</v>

2656
01:07:14.861 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 1>the way they have,</v>

2657
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.420
<v Speaker 1>the way they did it with you for hundreds and hundreds of years before you were</v>

2658
01:07:19.421 --> 01:07:20.254
<v Speaker 1>ever born.</v>

2659
01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2660
01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:20.891
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2661
01:07:20.891 --> 01:07:21.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2662
01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:22.510
<v Speaker 1>and then what happened was,</v>

2663
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:26.290
<v Speaker 1>so say I've moved into this camp and there's about 10,</v>

2664
01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:27.880
<v Speaker 1>10 fighters there and then,</v>

2665
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2666
01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:29.970
<v Speaker 1>one night,</v>

2667
01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2668
01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:30.791
<v Speaker 1>I've had my flight,</v>

2669
01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I've won,</v>

2670
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I've gone to a patio with all the westerners hanging out,</v>

2671
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2672
01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>for a week's holiday and I've come back and all the other kids that had run</v>

2673
01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:37.954
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2674
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:39.700
<v Speaker 1>So then there was only me and the superstar.</v>

2675
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2676
01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.570
<v Speaker 1>and now that I was giving them 50% of my prize money after every flight,</v>

2677
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:45.240
<v Speaker 1>so now it was in the camps,</v>

2678
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.770
<v Speaker 1>best interest to try and make me as as good as I could,</v>

2679
01:07:47.771 --> 01:07:51.280
<v Speaker 1>as fast as I could so I could win more fights and make more prize money so they</v>

2680
01:07:51.281 --> 01:07:52.630
<v Speaker 1>get 50% more income.</v>

2681
01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:54.460
<v Speaker 1>The only way that could,</v>

2682
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>the only way they could survive is for me to become the best that I could so</v>

2683
01:07:58.091 --> 01:07:59.230
<v Speaker 1>they could get more money,</v>

2684
01:07:59.231 --> 01:08:00.064
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>

2685
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:00.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2686
01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:00.570
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

2687
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:02.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what a fortuitous roll the dice for.</v>

2688
01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 1>You say I was showing the under the,</v>

2689
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.531
<v Speaker 1>under the bus,</v>

2690
01:08:05.531 --> 01:08:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but until the little grinder,</v>

2691
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:07.601
<v Speaker 1>looking back,</v>

2692
01:08:07.601 --> 01:08:08.140
<v Speaker 1>looking back,</v>

2693
01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.870
<v Speaker 1>it was like the biggest blessing that could happen because if there was 50</v>

2694
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:11.180
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2695
01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.180
<v Speaker 1>then I would have been stuck in a bag by myself.</v>

2696
01:08:13.181 --> 01:08:15.220
<v Speaker 1>But because I was only me and the superstar,</v>

2697
01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2698
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.520
<v Speaker 3>and then the supersize sancton noise,</v>

2699
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:19.700
<v Speaker 3>the he had no,</v>

2700
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:20.260
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

2701
01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:20.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2702
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.450
<v Speaker 3>he's fighting was the deadly kisser.</v>

2703
01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.730
<v Speaker 3>The deadly kiss.</v>

2704
01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:24.231
<v Speaker 3>Her kiss her.</v>

2705
01:08:24.231 --> 01:08:25.064
<v Speaker 3>So why is that?</v>

2706
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Because there's so much gambling in Thailand.</v>

2707
01:08:27.111 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 3>So if he thought he was beating his opponent at the end of the round,</v>

2708
01:08:29.631 --> 01:08:31.730
<v Speaker 3>he'd give him a kiss on the cheek and that will show the punters,</v>

2709
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:32.301
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2710
01:08:32.301 --> 01:08:32.900
<v Speaker 3>I've got this.</v>

2711
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:33.800
<v Speaker 3>So that all bid on him,</v>

2712
01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.060
<v Speaker 3>a little Betty and say,</v>

2713
01:08:35.061 --> 01:08:35.930
<v Speaker 3>if you're being kissed by him,</v>

2714
01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:36.920
<v Speaker 3>it means he's kicked your ass.</v>

2715
01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Say you did the deadly Kisa opponents know this nickname was the deadly killer</v>

2716
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:42.711
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

2717
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:43.400
<v Speaker 3>if they get,</v>

2718
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:43.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2719
01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:45.230
<v Speaker 3>because after the round that Ding,</v>

2720
01:08:45.231 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 3>he'd walk up and just give you a kiss on the cheek.</v>

2721
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.770
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

2722
01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.710
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck man,</v>

2723
01:08:48.711 --> 01:08:49.850
<v Speaker 3>you not kicking my ass.</v>

2724
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.860

2870
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.350
<v Speaker 1>and then a where's where's,</v>

2871
01:12:10.351 --> 01:12:12.870
<v Speaker 1>rob was a little bit bigger when he was fighting and toys a little bit smaller.</v>

2872
01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:13.920
<v Speaker 1>So he was knocking them out.</v>

2873
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:16.670
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time he should have been knocking him out because he does it.</v>

2874
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:19.380
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're fighting western of US western or you're not going to get</v>

2875
01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 1>the same worldwide sorta.</v>

2876
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Raymond was his fighting like the pure killers at a day at their weight.</v>

2877
01:12:27.451 --> 01:12:29.550
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not just beating him but knocking them out.</v>

2878
01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:29.821
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2879
01:12:29.821 --> 01:12:30.940
<v Speaker 1>and then when the Po,</v>

2880
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:34.180
<v Speaker 1>when the tires are paying attention and the country stopping to watch a western</v>

2881
01:12:34.181 --> 01:12:35.300
<v Speaker 1>or come to their country to,</v>

2882
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.970
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2883
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:37.320
<v Speaker 1>to knock out their their best,</v>

2884
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:38.400
<v Speaker 1>then you know you've made it.</v>

2885
01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2886
01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:41.520
<v Speaker 1>He was a real phenomenon and for,</v>

2887
01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:46.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of those things that for people that don't know the sport or</v>

2888
01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 1>aren't aware of it,</v>

2889
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:52.350
<v Speaker 1>like you can go right now to youtube and go on a journey through the world of,</v>

2890
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:55.800
<v Speaker 1>of one of the greatest combat sport athletes ever.</v>

2891
01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.350
<v Speaker 1>And Ramon Dekkers has so many fights on youtube.</v>

2892
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.080
<v Speaker 1>You can go and watch them and you'll understand what we're talking about when</v>

2893
01:13:01.081 --> 01:13:04.980
<v Speaker 1>you just watch to that guy just slam those kicks in and the attack with a</v>

2894
01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:06.780
<v Speaker 1>barrage of beautiful punches.</v>

2895
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:08.880
<v Speaker 1>He was a monster and the monster,</v>

2896
01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 1>these pressure to hidden push guys into the corner on unto the ropes.</v>

2897
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:16.740
<v Speaker 1>And then it wouldn't matter if he got hit 14 times in the way and he just give</v>

2898
01:13:16.741 --> 01:13:17.574
<v Speaker 1>me one,</v>

2899
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.570
<v Speaker 1>give me one bang,</v>

2900
01:13:18.571 --> 01:13:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2901
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2902
01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.280
<v Speaker 1>and then boom,</v>

2903
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.900
<v Speaker 1>and then just knock him out unconscious.</v>

2904
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:23.580
<v Speaker 1>My style is so hard.</v>

2905
01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:25.110
<v Speaker 1>It was such a hard style.</v>

2906
01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:25.320
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2907
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.810
<v Speaker 1>he did a seminar at my gym.</v>

2908
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.181
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2909
01:13:27.181 --> 01:13:27.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2910
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:27.751
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2911
01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:29.250
<v Speaker 1>just have three or four of us.</v>

2912
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.210
<v Speaker 1>We just keep it tiny.</v>

2913
01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:31.170
<v Speaker 1>We just keep it really small.</v>

2914
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.033
<v Speaker 1>That's what he wanted.</v>

2915
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.660
<v Speaker 1>The emir four person seminar,</v>

2916
01:13:33.661 --> 01:13:34.290
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want,</v>

2917
01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:36.120
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want the big 100 people.</v>

2918
01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:36.481
<v Speaker 1>He just said,</v>

2919
01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:36.651
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2920
01:13:36.651 --> 01:13:38.430
<v Speaker 1>let's keep it six people max.</v>

2921
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:39.361
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2922
01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:39.661
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2923
01:13:39.661 --> 01:13:41.610
<v Speaker 1>let's keep it an odd number so I can join in.</v>

2924
01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:47.090
<v Speaker 1>So many took it turns the gun at one by one with this and then he'd say,</v>

2925
01:13:47.551 --> 01:13:47.761
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2926
01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:48.331
<v Speaker 1>put your hands up.</v>

2927
01:13:48.331 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to demonstrate a demonstration.</v>

2928
01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:51.410
<v Speaker 1>And he'd go,</v>

2929
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.751
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2930
01:13:51.751 --> 01:13:53.820
<v Speaker 1>two Hook Lake and then you think,</v>

2931
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.800
<v Speaker 1>and he's going to tap and it's like boom,</v>

2932
01:13:55.801 --> 01:13:56.101
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2933
01:13:56.101 --> 01:13:58.480
<v Speaker 1>boom and then chop and then your eyes would go,</v>

2934
01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.250
<v Speaker 1>bink,</v>

2935
01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:00.240
<v Speaker 1>what the hell was that?</v>

2936
01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:03.690
<v Speaker 1>And then it sort of look at me as if it was,</v>

2937
01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:06.180
<v Speaker 1>he was shocked that he hit me so hard.</v>

2938
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It my reaction.</v>

2939
01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:07.951
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2940
01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:08.730
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2941
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2942
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:09.571
<v Speaker 1>ah yeah,</v>

2943
01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:10.404
<v Speaker 1>that was crazy.</v>

2944
01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:10.740
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2945
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2946
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>in Holland this is normal.</v>

2947
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:13.421
<v Speaker 1>This is what we do.</v>

2948
01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Because on the ring there's no surprises.</v>

2949
01:14:14.981 --> 01:14:16.900
<v Speaker 1>So if we train like this on the ring,</v>

2950
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:17.890
<v Speaker 1>this isn't an,</v>

2951
01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:18.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking at him,</v>

2952
01:14:18.551 --> 01:14:19.780
<v Speaker 1>gone to,</v>

2953
01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>there is no way in hell I'd like to train with like this.</v>

2954
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Especially everyday for a couple of hours every single day.</v>

2955
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:28.810
<v Speaker 1>They'd be detrimental to them through my health.</v>

2956
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Well ultimately is do you think that that's part of what broke him down?</v>

2957
01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Like as he got older,</v>

2958
01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:35.980
<v Speaker 1>like he was devastated.</v>

2959
01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Like physically by the time he was done,</v>

2960
01:14:37.571 --> 01:14:38.560
<v Speaker 1>his ankles were gone.</v>

2961
01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2962
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:39.551
<v Speaker 1>possibly.</v>

2963
01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:40.061
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>

2964
01:14:40.061 --> 01:14:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think you've got to the stage where he's buddy was so destroyed where he</v>

2965
01:14:43.451 --> 01:14:44.231
<v Speaker 1>can only do pads.</v>

2966
01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:44.861
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't even,</v>

2967
01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:45.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2968
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you would spa.</v>

2969
01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I remember him telling us at lunch,</v>

2970
01:14:47.621 --> 01:14:47.891
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2971
01:14:47.891 --> 01:14:48.041
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2972
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:48.761
<v Speaker 1>I just do pads,</v>

2973
01:14:48.761 --> 01:14:49.001
<v Speaker 1>pads,</v>

2974
01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:49.301
<v Speaker 1>pads,</v>

2975
01:14:49.301 --> 01:14:49.780
<v Speaker 1>and then was,</v>

2976
01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.080
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2977
01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.190
<v Speaker 1>because he was fighting so regularly,</v>

2978
01:14:51.191 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have the spy because he was following up with possibly every two weeks</v>

2979
01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:54.581
<v Speaker 1>or so.</v>

2980
01:14:54.581 --> 01:14:55.750
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2981
01:14:55.751 --> 01:14:56.081
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2982
01:14:56.081 --> 01:14:56.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2983
01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:57.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2984
01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I did sit,</v>

2985
01:14:57.670 --> 01:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>that's the eternal debate because like in,</v>

2986
01:15:00.561 --> 01:15:01.750
<v Speaker 1>in MMA as well,</v>

2987
01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Joe Duffy was supposed to be fighting.</v>

2988
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Dustin poray this past weekend in Ireland in a huge card in Dublin,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the last guy to beat Conor McGregor,</v>

2994
01:15:15.730 --> 01:15:16.720

01:15:35.441 --> 01:15:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you got fucked up.</v>

3013
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Like you need a lot of time off.</v>

3014
01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:39.700
<v Speaker 1>You need a few months off,</v>

3015
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you can't fight.</v>

3016
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3017
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Accounting backwards from 10 apple,</v>

3018
01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:43.500
<v Speaker 1>orange,</v>

3019
01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.333
<v Speaker 1>lemon.</v>

3020
01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:47.500
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

3021
01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:49.480
<v Speaker 1>that's the eternal debate.</v>

3022
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you spar like the Dutch,</v>

3023
01:15:52.331 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Speaker 1>do you fucking go crazy?</v>

3024
01:15:53.831 --> 01:15:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Like Melvin Manhoef and Mike's gym,</v>

3025
01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:57.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3026
01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:58.390
<v Speaker 1>you just fucking attack,</v>

3027
01:15:58.391 --> 01:15:58.781
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>

3028
01:15:58.781 --> 01:16:02.140
<v Speaker 1>attack and just take your lumps and deal with it and just,</v>

3029
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.310
<v Speaker 1>and then when you fight,</v>

3030
01:16:03.311 --> 01:16:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you will fight like that because you finally that all the time or do you take a</v>

3031
01:16:07.511 --> 01:16:08.800
<v Speaker 1>more intelligent approach?</v>

3032
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Like many fighters do,</v>

3033
01:16:10.511 --> 01:16:13.090
<v Speaker 1>like the ties to where they spar and they don't spar harder.</v>

3034
01:16:13.091 --> 01:16:13.860
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3035
01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:14.321
<v Speaker 1>All the toys.</v>

3036
01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Then even when I first got there,</v>

3037
01:16:15.611 --> 01:16:17.350
<v Speaker 1>there was no shin pads or,</v>

3038
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.273
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3039
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3040
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:19.360
<v Speaker 1>it was nice.</v>

3041
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:19.811
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

3042
01:16:19.811 --> 01:16:20.080
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3043
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.520
<v Speaker 1>and then you'd could almost sweat bag meets,</v>

3044
01:16:21.521 --> 01:16:21.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3045
01:16:21.671 --> 01:16:22.250
<v Speaker 1>it's just te,</v>

3046
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.490
<v Speaker 1>te,</v>

3047
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.710
<v Speaker 1>te,</v>

3048
01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Te,</v>

3049
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.460
<v Speaker 1>and then you're just working on movement nation peds,</v>

3050
01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Amy Shit on Shane.</v>

3051
01:16:27.761 --> 01:16:28.511
<v Speaker 1>It's still be fast.</v>

3052
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:29.430
<v Speaker 1>And then you pull out that light,</v>

3053
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:30.071
<v Speaker 1>like karate,</v>

3054
01:16:30.071 --> 01:16:31.190
<v Speaker 1>letting put karate style,</v>

3055
01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but there was Thai boxing and then,</v>

3056
01:16:32.741 --> 01:16:33.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3057
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you still know if he got,</v>

3058
01:16:33.991 --> 01:16:34.200
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>

3059
01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:34.530
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>

3060
01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:35.520
<v Speaker 1>got or not say if,</v>

3061
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:36.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3062
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.180
<v Speaker 1>the Shin Land and across your ribs,</v>

3063
01:16:37.181 --> 01:16:37.860
<v Speaker 1>it'd be pulled.</v>

3064
01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.693
<v Speaker 1>We just a tap.</v>

3065
01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:40.211
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3066
01:16:40.211 --> 01:16:40.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3067
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.470
<v Speaker 1>and then you'd get spoiled with the kids that were 10 years old and saying,</v>

3068
01:16:43.471 --> 01:16:44.380
<v Speaker 1>do a nation peds.</v>

3069
01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:46.570
<v Speaker 1>And then no one got hurt.</v>

3070
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:47.980
<v Speaker 1>And then after three hours,</v>

3071
01:16:47.981 --> 01:16:49.660
<v Speaker 1>you're still smiling and still joking.</v>

3072
01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.400
<v Speaker 1>But you've learned so much.</v>

3073
01:16:51.401 --> 01:16:52.020
<v Speaker 1>You've learned it.</v>

3074
01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:55.360
<v Speaker 1>You just got your ass kicked by a 10 year old without getting beat up,</v>

3075
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:56.223
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>

3076
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:57.340
<v Speaker 1>When we box,</v>

3077
01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:57.861
<v Speaker 1>when we box,</v>

3078
01:16:57.861 --> 01:16:58.720
<v Speaker 1>we spy about 80,</v>

3079
01:16:58.721 --> 01:16:59.554
<v Speaker 1>90%.</v>

3080
01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:00.160
<v Speaker 1>But when we,</v>

3081
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:00.490
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>

3082
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:02.620
<v Speaker 1>when we kick and play in and in the clinch,</v>

3083
01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3084
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:04.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit more control over the Clinton is harder.</v>

3085
01:17:04.961 --> 01:17:05.771
<v Speaker 1>That is I suppose.</v>

3086
01:17:05.771 --> 01:17:05.951
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3087
01:17:05.951 --> 01:17:06.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3088
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.680
<v Speaker 1>longevity as you can do that in a clinch,</v>

3089
01:17:08.681 --> 01:17:09.630
<v Speaker 1>the same like Jujitsu,</v>

3090
01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you can go full blast and you don't have to worry about it cause you're not</v>

3091
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.520
<v Speaker 1>striking each other.</v>

3092
01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3093
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:14.121
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>

3094
01:17:14.121 --> 01:17:14.760

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

3097
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:18.320

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:34.090
<v Speaker 1>and then you hear about MMA guys and then if they have more than 30 flights,</v>

3113
01:17:34.091 --> 01:17:34.550

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3157
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:35.270
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3158
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:36.710
<v Speaker 1>so for them over there,</v>

3159
01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:38.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a 10 year old.</v>

3160
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3161
01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.560
<v Speaker 1>if you're at 25 kilos to you're not working with a hundred percent Perry that</v>

3162
01:18:42.561 --> 01:18:44.060
<v Speaker 1>you your score and you're playing the game.</v>

3163
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3164
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:46.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not until you get into your,</v>

3165
01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:46.791
<v Speaker 1>your 13,</v>

3166
01:18:46.791 --> 01:18:49.670
<v Speaker 1>14 and then you start using a bit more forced and you're excited to get me on</v>

3167
01:18:49.671 --> 01:18:51.350
<v Speaker 1>with damage on the shins in a bit more.</v>

3168
01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3169
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:53.840
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be a bit more wary of punching payer.</v>

3170
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.531
<v Speaker 1>But as a,</v>

3171
01:18:54.531 --> 01:18:56.600
<v Speaker 1>as a junior from say seven to 10,</v>

3172
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:58.370
<v Speaker 1>you can definitely get away with fighting three,</v>

3173
01:18:58.371 --> 01:18:58.670
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

3174
01:18:58.670 --> 01:18:59.351
<v Speaker 1>five times a week.</v>

3175
01:18:59.351 --> 01:19:00.050
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

3176
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3177
01:19:00.201 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 1>some people say that that's the best way to teach kids to because they learn</v>

3178
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:05.300
<v Speaker 1>before they can hurt each other.</v>

3179
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3180
01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.920
<v Speaker 1>And you learn like how to move properly and your body develops like that.</v>

3181
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3182
01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.530
<v Speaker 1>your body develops.</v>

3183
01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Like there's people that are um,</v>

3184
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:17.630
<v Speaker 1>that started out like to have like a martial arts background when they were</v>

3185
01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:19.460
<v Speaker 1>young and then they started putting on weight,</v>

3186
01:19:19.461 --> 01:19:20.294
<v Speaker 1>like muscle weight.</v>

3187
01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:20.961
<v Speaker 1>But there's still,</v>

3188
01:19:20.961 --> 01:19:25.961
<v Speaker 1>it's super flexible and it's because their body sort of developed throwing kicks</v>

3189
01:19:26.841 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 1>and their body develop doing those motions.</v>

3190
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:30.110
<v Speaker 1>And if you can learn,</v>

3191
01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of people that believe that as as a boxer,</v>

3192
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:35.690
<v Speaker 1>that if you don't start when you're young,</v>

3193
01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you'll never achieve like a Floyd Mayweather level or Roy Jones Jr level.</v>

3194
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not possible.</v>

3195
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:45.920
<v Speaker 1>They say it's not like your body has to develop doing that in Australia.</v>

3196
01:19:45.921 --> 01:19:49.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a big controversy right now because the athletic commission and the</v>

3197
01:19:49.371 --> 01:19:50.204
<v Speaker 1>government's and there,</v>

3198
01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:51.260
<v Speaker 1>they're all talking,</v>

3199
01:19:51.261 --> 01:19:55.370
<v Speaker 1>they're talking and they don't want juniors to compete in any form of combat</v>

3200
01:19:55.371 --> 01:19:58.130
<v Speaker 1>sport whatsoever until the age of 18 which I,</v>

3201
01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:00.530
<v Speaker 1>which I think is ludicrous because if that happens,</v>

3202
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:02.780
<v Speaker 1>you've got the rangers,</v>

3203
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:06.560
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world that have already excelled to a certain level and if we</v>

3204
01:20:06.561 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>don't start competing to 18</v>

3205
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.780
<v Speaker 3>we're already behind the eight ball.</v>

3206
01:20:09.781 --> 01:20:10.080
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

3207
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 3>we're so far behind that,</v>

3208
01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:12.330
<v Speaker 3>but that's so ignorant.</v>

3209
01:20:12.331 --> 01:20:13.410
<v Speaker 3>That's ignorant on their part.</v>

3210
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:16.320
<v Speaker 3>People don't understand combat sports because that's the time to learn.</v>

3211
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3212
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:17.191
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3213
01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:17.480
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

3214
01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.560
<v Speaker 3>and then it's also,</v>

3215
01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:19.710
<v Speaker 3>you're not learning it.</v>

3216
01:20:19.711 --> 01:20:20.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the flight.</v>

3217
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:21.750
<v Speaker 3>It's about the culture.</v>

3218
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3219
01:20:22.090 --> 01:20:23.160
<v Speaker 3>It's about the lifestyle.</v>

3220
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:26.280
<v Speaker 3>It's about living healthy and training and training the body and getting</v>

3221
01:20:26.281 --> 01:20:30.690
<v Speaker 3>flexible and getting over the fear of getting in competition as well.</v>

3222
01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:35.700
<v Speaker 3>It's about experiencing what young people are terrified of getting your ass</v>

3223
01:20:35.701 --> 01:20:38.100
<v Speaker 3>kicked and I'm experiencing it in the gym.</v>

3224
01:20:38.101 --> 01:20:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3225
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:39.810
<v Speaker 3>My daughter was lucky enough this,</v>

3226
01:20:39.811 --> 01:20:41.160
<v Speaker 3>that fighting at the age of eight.</v>

3227
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:44.400
<v Speaker 3>And it's hilarious how many people say that my daughter was lucky enough to</v>

3228
01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:45.660
<v Speaker 3>start fighting at the age of eight.</v>

3229
01:20:45.661 --> 01:20:46.030
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3230
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3231
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:47.710
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>

3232
01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I remember she walked in as,</v>

3233
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:49.440
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

3234
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.510
<v Speaker 3>as a little baby girl and I was,</v>

3235
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:52.950
<v Speaker 3>I was so petrified as a father,</v>

3236
01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.900
<v Speaker 3>but then she walked out like a woman.</v>

3237
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:56.160
<v Speaker 3>She walked out as a warrior,</v>

3238
01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:57.300
<v Speaker 3>as eight year old warrior.</v>

3239
01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:01.050
<v Speaker 3>And then ever since she's had this passion for the fighting.</v>

3240
01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:02.730
<v Speaker 3>She loves collecting trophies.</v>

3241
01:21:02.731 --> 01:21:03.880
<v Speaker 3>She loves making,</v>

3242
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.863
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3243
01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:07.320
<v Speaker 3>magazines and doing interviews.</v>

3244
01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:08.310
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3245
01:21:08.311 --> 01:21:08.751
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3246
01:21:08.751 --> 01:21:09.000
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3247
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.890
<v Speaker 3>it makes you a bit,</v>

3248
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.120
<v Speaker 3>become a better person,</v>

3249
01:21:12.121 --> 01:21:12.541
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

3250
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:13.120
<v Speaker 3>I think it,</v>

3251
01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.920
<v Speaker 3>it makes your evolve evolves where it would,</v>

3252
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.260
<v Speaker 3>it definitely,</v>

3253
01:21:19.261 --> 01:21:20.094
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3254
01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.630
<v Speaker 3>people had never fought.</v>

3255
01:21:21.631 --> 01:21:23.070
<v Speaker 3>We never understand what it's like to,</v>

3256
01:21:23.071 --> 01:21:26.910
<v Speaker 3>to have that bond against someone to compete for a couple of minutes.</v>

3257
01:21:26.911 --> 01:21:27.744
<v Speaker 3>And then after that,</v>

3258
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.010
<v Speaker 3>no matter what happens,</v>

3259
01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.710
<v Speaker 3>I've always with 122 people,</v>

3260
01:21:31.711 --> 01:21:32.544
<v Speaker 3>I can say,</v>

3261
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3262
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:34.621
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just a friend,</v>

3263
01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:35.090
<v Speaker 3>but I have,</v>

3264
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.170
<v Speaker 3>I've shared a moment in time where me and you,</v>

3265
01:21:37.171 --> 01:21:37.410
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

3266
01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:40.340
<v Speaker 3>we've went into a different dimension for that,</v>

3267
01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.610
<v Speaker 3>that time that we fought each other.</v>

3268
01:21:41.611 --> 01:21:42.121
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

3269
01:21:42.121 --> 01:21:42.331
<v Speaker 3>Does that,</v>

3270
01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:42.960
<v Speaker 3>it does mean that,</v>

3271
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.793
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3272
01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:46.440
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing they can erase that memory of me and you,</v>

3273
01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:46.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3274
01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:49.620
<v Speaker 3>the standing toe to toe and exchanging blows.</v>

3275
01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:51.120
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3276
01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:51.561
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

3277
01:21:51.561 --> 01:21:52.394
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3278
01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:56.130
<v Speaker 3>this is why I love the sport so much because I have such a deep passion for it.</v>

3279
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3280
01:21:56.931 --> 01:21:58.760
<v Speaker 2>when I was watching that cosmo Alexander fight,</v>

3281
01:21:58.761 --> 01:22:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I was actually thinking that I was like,</v>

3282
01:22:00.021 --> 01:22:00.441
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

3283
01:22:00.441 --> 01:22:03.020
<v Speaker 2>are they sharing a crazy cause I was also thinking like,</v>

3284
01:22:03.021 --> 01:22:06.560
<v Speaker 2>you're 39 years old and I don't know how much longer you can compete at this</v>

3285
01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.240
<v Speaker 2>elite world class level.</v>

3286
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3287
01:22:08.481 --> 01:22:10.280
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting in a world championship fight.</v>

3288
01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:11.460
<v Speaker 2>And I'm watching this,</v>

3289
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:11.661
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3290
01:22:11.661 --> 01:22:11.841
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3291
01:22:11.841 --> 01:22:12.220
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

3292
01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:14.870
<v Speaker 2>this is an intense moment that these two guys are sharing.</v>

3293
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:18.020
<v Speaker 2>And afterwards you guys were smiling and hugging each other and I was like,</v>

3294
01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:18.531
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3295
01:22:18.531 --> 01:22:20.810
<v Speaker 2>those guys really did just share a very,</v>

3296
01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:25.100
<v Speaker 2>very intense experience and a very intense moment that very few people will ever</v>

3297
01:22:25.101 --> 01:22:25.740
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

3298
01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:26.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3299
01:22:26.101 --> 01:22:26.401
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3300
01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:26.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3301
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:27.031
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3302
01:22:27.031 --> 01:22:27.810
<v Speaker 3>it's actually there.</v>

3303
01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:28.560
<v Speaker 3>And then to,</v>

3304
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.520
<v Speaker 3>to erase that from childhood memories for young kids not to have that</v>

3305
01:22:32.521 --> 01:22:33.151
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

3306
01:22:33.151 --> 01:22:35.670
<v Speaker 3>I think that's so sad because,</v>

3307
01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:36.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3308
01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.480
<v Speaker 3>what's better,</v>

3309
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.150
<v Speaker 3>especially coming from myself,</v>

3310
01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.000
<v Speaker 3>if to go to school on the fighting on,</v>

3311
01:22:42.001 --> 01:22:44.700
<v Speaker 3>said they in the tournament and go to school on Monday and tell him the boys,</v>

3312
01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:45.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3313
01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:45.561
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3314
01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:45.721
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3315
01:22:45.721 --> 01:22:48.250
<v Speaker 3>I've got a gold medal for whatever competition that you split.</v>

3316
01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.113
<v Speaker 3>Obg Judo,</v>

3317
01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:49.953
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

3318
01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:50.671
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo,</v>

3319
01:22:50.671 --> 01:22:51.151
<v Speaker 3>karate.</v>

3320
01:22:51.151 --> 01:22:51.984
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if it's more,</v>

3321
01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:53.040
<v Speaker 3>it could be anything.</v>

3322
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:54.050
<v Speaker 3>It's an oil,</v>

3323
01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.571
<v Speaker 3>even soccer,</v>

3324
01:22:54.571 --> 01:22:55.081
<v Speaker 3>football.</v>

3325
01:22:55.081 --> 01:22:55.201
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

3326
01:22:55.201 --> 01:22:55.510
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

3327
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.830
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

3328
01:22:55.830 --> 01:23:00.240
<v Speaker 3>you've gone out in the weekend and you've excelled at that sport that you've,</v>

3329
01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:00.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3330
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.793
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3331
01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.730
<v Speaker 3>put your life into.</v>

3332
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:03.540
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3333
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.470
<v Speaker 3>and that the boys come over to house,</v>

3334
01:23:05.471 --> 01:23:06.230
<v Speaker 3>they have a sleepover.</v>

3335
01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 2>You got four or five trays up on the shelf,</v>

3336
01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:10.510
<v Speaker 2>nothing can make you more proud than,</v>

3337
01:23:10.511 --> 01:23:13.870
<v Speaker 2>than to be in there from my fighting days.</v>

3338
01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:19.200
<v Speaker 2>So I think it also teaches you how to overcome very scary moments and very</v>

3339
01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:20.410
<v Speaker 2>difficult moments.</v>

3340
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.130
<v Speaker 2>And I think when you don't overcome difficult moments,</v>

3341
01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:25.660
<v Speaker 2>you always have that fear.</v>

3342
01:23:25.661 --> 01:23:26.071
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

3343
01:23:26.071 --> 01:23:28.000
<v Speaker 2>how would I do under pressure?</v>

3344
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:29.980
<v Speaker 2>What would happen to me under PR?</v>

3345
01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean how would I do when the chips are down,</v>

3346
01:23:31.901 --> 01:23:32.800
<v Speaker 2>when I'm nervous.</v>

3347
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3348
01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.810
<v Speaker 2>and people who compete,</v>

3349
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 2>they have the experience of doing that.</v>

3350
01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:41.530
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's where characters built characters built through adversity.</v>

3351
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.170
<v Speaker 2>And I think to deny young kids the opportunity that,</v>

3352
01:23:44.171 --> 01:23:46.510
<v Speaker 2>especially out of ignorance because if they don't,</v>

3353
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:49.930
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand that young kids don't get hurt the way adults do.</v>

3354
01:23:49.931 --> 01:23:51.700
<v Speaker 2>And you're fighting like you know,</v>

3355
01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.820
<v Speaker 2>you see a guy like a gold con Saki fight and Tyrone Spong,</v>

3356
01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:56.050
<v Speaker 2>those are big boys,</v>

3357
01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 2>big heavy throwing guys that are throwing fucking bombs.</v>

3358
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:03.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference between that and two six year olds that are fighting</v>

3359
01:24:03.431 --> 01:24:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Moitai with headgear on and the gloves and,</v>

3360
01:24:06.781 --> 01:24:07.070
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3361
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:08.980
<v Speaker 2>and Shin pads in an amateur fight.</v>

3362
01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.370
<v Speaker 2>What those kids are doing is they're learning how to do something that's very</v>

3363
01:24:12.371 --> 01:24:12.930
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

3364
01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3365
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.940
<v Speaker 2>And that is the same coming that,</v>

3366
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:15.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3367
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.880
<v Speaker 2>that moment,</v>

3368
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.360
<v Speaker 2>that same,</v>

3369
01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.081
<v Speaker 2>the same fee,</v>

3370
01:24:17.081 --> 01:24:18.010
<v Speaker 2>but with the protection.</v>

3371
01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost the same.</v>

3372
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I like what you said on the,</v>

3373
01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:21.880
<v Speaker 2>I have eye shade one,</v>

3374
01:24:21.881 --> 01:24:24.550
<v Speaker 2>a yield quotations on my Instagram the other day.</v>

3375
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:26.140
<v Speaker 2>They absolutely killed it about,</v>

3376
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:26.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3377
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.210
<v Speaker 2>people that have never been in a street fight.</v>

3378
01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3379
01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:29.861
<v Speaker 2>it's that same thing.</v>

3380
01:24:29.861 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Where have people that are,</v>

3381
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.960
<v Speaker 2>you'll always say,</v>

3382
01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:32.793
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

3383
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:33.881
<v Speaker 2>that glide pieces,</v>

3384
01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:34.930
<v Speaker 2>these pieces of me off of,</v>

3385
01:24:34.931 --> 01:24:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to knock him out.</v>

3386
01:24:35.801 --> 01:24:36.101
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

3387
01:24:36.101 --> 01:24:36.191
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3388
01:24:36.191 --> 01:24:37.024
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

3389
01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:39.760
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea if that guy hit you back.</v>

3390
01:24:39.761 --> 01:24:40.910
<v Speaker 2>You know how much it's going to hurt.</v>

3391
01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:43.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3392
01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:46.810
<v Speaker 2>what I said was that I don't understand how people who have never had any</v>

3393
01:24:46.811 --> 01:24:49.480
<v Speaker 2>martial arts experience at all are willing to fight.</v>

3394
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:49.951
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3395
01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:50.741
<v Speaker 2>Like they're crazy.</v>

3396
01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:51.471
<v Speaker 2>Like they're fighting.</v>

3397
01:24:51.471 --> 01:24:54.070
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen people fight in the streets that you could tell when they're</v>

3398
01:24:54.071 --> 01:24:54.461
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>

3399
01:24:54.461 --> 01:24:56.860
<v Speaker 2>that they have no fighting experience at all.</v>

3400
01:24:56.861 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 2>They don't know anything,</v>

3401
01:24:58.030 --> 01:25:00.610
<v Speaker 2>and yet they're willing to take a chance and fight.</v>

3402
01:25:00.611 --> 01:25:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Some guy they don't even know and they're going to somehow or another,</v>

3403
01:25:04.001 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 2>they think they're going to kick this guy's ass like you don't even know.</v>

3404
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:07.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't know anything.</v>

3405
01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:08.973
<v Speaker 2>It is</v>

3406
01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.470
<v Speaker 2>just flailing.</v>

3407
01:25:11.471 --> 01:25:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it happen.</v>

3408
01:25:12.401 --> 01:25:12.521
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3409
01:25:12.521 --> 01:25:13.390
<v Speaker 2>it's terrifying.</v>

3410
01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it.</v>

3411
01:25:14.261 --> 01:25:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how people are willing to do that so mad right now I'm just going</v>

3412
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:18.520
<v Speaker 2>to go walk over the Amgen.</v>

3413
01:25:18.521 --> 01:25:19.354
<v Speaker 2>Lucky man.</v>

3414
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.141
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>

3415
01:25:20.141 --> 01:25:20.741
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>

3416
01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:21.880
<v Speaker 2>It's not that easy.</v>

3417
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:22.540
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3418
01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:24.100
<v Speaker 2>and then once that confrontations thoughts,</v>

3419
01:25:24.101 --> 01:25:25.810
<v Speaker 2>if you hit that person and then you don't knock him out,</v>

3420
01:25:25.811 --> 01:25:28.070
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to piss him off or you break your hand.</v>

3421
01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:31.800
<v Speaker 2>How many times did people don't not throw a punch and hit a guy in the forehead</v>

3422
01:25:31.801 --> 01:25:33.310
<v Speaker 2>and just smash your hand open?</v>

3423
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3424
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:33.781
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3425
01:25:33.781 --> 01:25:35.780
<v Speaker 2>they pull it out and then they break a bottle.</v>

3426
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.690
<v Speaker 2>They pull something out of the pockets of Christ.</v>

3427
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Then it gets this Nixon level,</v>

3428
01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:40.990
<v Speaker 2>it's life or death now.</v>

3429
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

3430
01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to fight at all.</v>

3431
01:25:43.151 --> 01:25:46.140
<v Speaker 2>And you're in a life or death situation where you just hope this guy doesn't</v>

3432
01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:46.940
<v Speaker 2>kill you.</v>

3433
01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:47.141
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3434
01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Let's hope somebody that rescues you beforehand.</v>

3435
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:50.583
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying,</v>

3436
01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:51.040
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3437
01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Especially because the different,</v>

3438
01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:52.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

3439
01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:53.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a big difference.</v>

3440
01:25:53.741 --> 01:25:57.400
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's where a lot of people get confused when it comes to martial</v>

3441
01:25:57.401 --> 01:25:59.050
<v Speaker 2>arts and the equated with violence,</v>

3442
01:25:59.490 --> 01:25:59.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3443
01:25:59.830 --> 01:26:00.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3444
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3445
01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.320
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3446
01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.660
<v Speaker 2>the competition of a fight or have a,</v>

3447
01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:05.800
<v Speaker 2>an event like a,</v>

3448
01:26:05.801 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 2>a martial arts event is very,</v>

3449
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:13.370
<v Speaker 2>very different thing because you're preparing for a skill contest and the skill</v>

3450
01:26:13.371 --> 01:26:15.290
<v Speaker 2>contest may be dangerous and there's a Po,</v>

3451
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:18.110
<v Speaker 2>there's possibly violent endings to these things,</v>

3452
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:23.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's not violence in the sense of you're not like trying to go out and find</v>

3453
01:26:23.151 --> 01:26:24.560
<v Speaker 2>someone and make them your victim.</v>

3454
01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.420
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing is you're trying to compete,</v>

3455
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.201
<v Speaker 2>you're competing.</v>

3456
01:26:27.201 --> 01:26:28.160
<v Speaker 2>And in doing so,</v>

3457
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:33.260
<v Speaker 2>you learn something about yourself and you develop a confidence that for someone</v>

3458
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:34.640
<v Speaker 2>who's never competed like that,</v>

3459
01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.350
<v Speaker 2>it never totally understand.</v>

3460
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3461
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:38.030
<v Speaker 2>If violent game of chess.</v>

3462
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:38.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3463
01:26:39.010 --> 01:26:40.430
<v Speaker 2>And even more crazy than chess,</v>

3464
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:43.280
<v Speaker 2>especially MMA because there's so many more,</v>

3465
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 2>there's so many moves.</v>

3466
01:26:44.511 --> 01:26:46.830
<v Speaker 2>There's so much going on this like if you,</v>

3467
01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.680
<v Speaker 2>if you're playing chess,</v>

3468
01:26:48.681 --> 01:26:52.070
<v Speaker 2>you have so much time to think about it unless you're playing that speed chess</v>

3469
01:26:52.071 --> 01:26:53.210
<v Speaker 2>shit where they're hitting the clock.</v>

3470
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 2>But when you're playing chess and you're overlooking this board,</v>

3471
01:26:57.710 --> 01:27:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean not taking anything away from chess because chess is a fascinating game</v>

3472
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.250
<v Speaker 2>and there's so much complexity to it and there's so many different moves,</v>

3473
01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:06.560
<v Speaker 2>so many different possible combinations.</v>

3474
01:27:06.561 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 2>But believe it or not,</v>

3475
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:11.420
<v Speaker 2>there are more possible combinations and fighting.</v>

3476
01:27:11.630 --> 01:27:13.400
<v Speaker 2>There's more possible combinations.</v>

3477
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.260
<v Speaker 2>The outcome is more terrifying.</v>

3478
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:16.640
<v Speaker 2>More is at stake.</v>

3479
01:27:16.641 --> 01:27:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Your physical health is at stake.</v>

3480
01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:22.460
<v Speaker 2>You're gambling your health on discipline.</v>

3481
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 2>You have to get up in the morning,</v>

3482
01:27:24.081 --> 01:27:24.380
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3483
01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:29.380
<v Speaker 2>you have to overcome your body being tired and sore and you got to get up when</v>

3484
01:27:29.601 --> 01:27:30.381
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to.</v>

3485
01:27:30.381 --> 01:27:32.090
<v Speaker 2>When that warm bed is calling you,</v>

3486
01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:34.880
<v Speaker 2>you got to put on your fucking running shoes and you've got to go do your</v>

3487
01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:37.570
<v Speaker 2>roadwork and you've got to do your strength and conditioning and you've got to</v>

3488
01:27:37.571 --> 01:27:37.971
<v Speaker 2>spar.</v>

3489
01:27:37.971 --> 01:27:41.160
<v Speaker 2>When you don't want a spa and your body's starting to get run down and you've</v>

3490
01:27:41.161 --> 01:27:42.770
<v Speaker 2>got to make sure you get the right amount of sleep.</v>

3491
01:27:42.771 --> 01:27:44.750
<v Speaker 2>You got to make sure you're getting the right amount of nutrition.</v>

3492
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.160
<v Speaker 2>There's all these variables,</v>

3493
01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:47.090
<v Speaker 2>emotions,</v>

3494
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:47.661
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3495
01:27:47.661 --> 01:27:48.980
<v Speaker 2>the physical fear,</v>

3496
01:27:48.981 --> 01:27:50.840
<v Speaker 2>the fear of your own demise,</v>

3497
01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.080
<v Speaker 2>not the nerves of a,</v>

3498
01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure chess players get nervous before they have a match,</v>

3499
01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.740
<v Speaker 2>but do you think they get nervous the way a fighter gets nervous?</v>

3500
01:27:58.010 --> 01:27:59.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's possible.</v>

3501
01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.750
<v Speaker 3>And they'll have to go in the hospital after then.</v>

3502
01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:01.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3503
01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:04.530
<v Speaker 3>And then there's no fear or am I going to get looked at and I'm going to cut,</v>

3504
01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:05.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3505
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:05.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3506
01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.593
<v Speaker 3>when I compete,</v>

3507
01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:06.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3508
01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:08.910
<v Speaker 3>I tried to tell people that are coming up through the sport.</v>

3509
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:09.181
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

3510
01:28:09.181 --> 01:28:10.410
<v Speaker 3>what's it like to have your first fight?</v>

3511
01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:11.460
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3512
01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:12.840
<v Speaker 3>it's luck was him before he,</v>

3513
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:14.220
<v Speaker 3>once that the bill rings,</v>

3514
01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:15.300
<v Speaker 3>everything goes numb.</v>

3515
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.040
<v Speaker 3>And you don't have time to think,</v>

3516
01:28:17.041 --> 01:28:18.270
<v Speaker 3>so you have to take yourself.</v>

3517
01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Everything's on that muscle memory.</v>

3518
01:28:19.741 --> 01:28:24.590
<v Speaker 3>So say many times I've been punched or keep that or an elbow is shown and I've</v>

3519
01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.870
<v Speaker 3>blocked it with a quarter of a second ago,</v>

3520
01:28:27.871 --> 01:28:29.720
<v Speaker 3>and I'm thinking in my Haiti,</v>

3521
01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:31.680
<v Speaker 3>if that had a hit me flush out would have been knocked out.</v>

3522
01:28:32.130 --> 01:28:32.911
<v Speaker 3>But I'm somehow,</v>

3523
01:28:32.911 --> 01:28:37.470
<v Speaker 3>rather than when my body knows the blocking time to camera and time and then I</v>

3524
01:28:37.471 --> 01:28:38.281
<v Speaker 3>don't hear anything,</v>

3525
01:28:38.281 --> 01:28:39.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't see anything besides my opponent.</v>

3526
01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3527
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:41.030
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

3528
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3529
01:28:41.170 --> 01:28:41.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3530
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:43.320
<v Speaker 3>just in this different world.</v>

3531
01:28:43.710 --> 01:28:44.543
<v Speaker 3>And then the end,</v>

3532
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:45.760
<v Speaker 3>the end of the book,</v>

3533
01:28:46.050 --> 01:28:46.830
<v Speaker 3>the fight,</v>

3534
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:50.010
<v Speaker 3>the bell rings Ding and all of a sudden it seems that the world opens back up</v>

3535
01:28:50.011 --> 01:28:50.250
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

3536
01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm back on the chair,</v>

3537
01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I can hear voices again.</v>

3538
01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3539
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:55.330
<v Speaker 3>and then I can't remember the fight.</v>

3540
01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.700
<v Speaker 3>The fight is just a blur.</v>

3541
01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3542
01:28:57.570 --> 01:28:58.580
<v Speaker 3>it's like Toby was a Haiti,</v>

3543
01:28:58.590 --> 01:29:00.840
<v Speaker 3>remember this or that or til you watch the replay on the,</v>

3544
01:29:00.841 --> 01:29:01.500
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3545
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 3>on the phone</v>

3546
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.780
<v Speaker 1>or the internet or the replay.</v>

3547
01:29:03.781 --> 01:29:04.614
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3548
01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.400
<v Speaker 1>it's it,</v>

3549
01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:05.731
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3550
01:29:05.731 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

3551
01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.520
<v Speaker 1>you into a different realm completely.</v>

3552
01:29:08.521 --> 01:29:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It's such a unique experience to,</v>

3553
01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:11.400
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3554
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:16.010
<v Speaker 1>to turn off your brain and just rely on pure instinct as a,</v>

3555
01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:16.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3556
01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:17.520
<v Speaker 1>it's again,</v>

3557
01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:18.210
<v Speaker 1>that's why I love it.</v>

3558
01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:19.043
<v Speaker 1>I love it so much.</v>

3559
01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be an intensity that no one else could ever understand.</v>

3560
01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:26.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably a bond that you share with those people that you get into</v>

3561
01:29:26.671 --> 01:29:27.121
<v Speaker 1>the ring with,</v>

3562
01:29:27.121 --> 01:29:28.220
<v Speaker 1>like Cosmo Xander,</v>

3563
01:29:28.221 --> 01:29:33.221
<v Speaker 1>that the average person would just never be able to understand what you guys</v>

3564
01:29:33.391 --> 01:29:34.260
<v Speaker 1>have gone through.</v>

3565
01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:34.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3566
01:29:34.711 --> 01:29:39.630
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea you've been cut and you can the one eyes blurry from the blood</v>

3567
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

3568
01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to wipe it because that's a tale from your opponent,</v>

3569
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:44.040
<v Speaker 1>the bloods that no noise.</v>

3570
01:29:44.041 --> 01:29:47.910
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to try and stay there with one way or red and bloody and Yucky.</v>

3571
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:49.890
<v Speaker 1>And you can feel a stickiness in your eye,</v>

3572
01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:50.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3573
01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 1>and you can feel the pain,</v>

3574
01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:56.000
<v Speaker 1>you can feel your eyes throbbing and then you've got to turn off a,</v>

3575
01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:56.843
<v Speaker 1>it's such a,</v>

3576
01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:02.040
<v Speaker 1>you got to take yourself as such in that you've got to go so much soul searching</v>

3577
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.570
<v Speaker 1>to keep focus on,</v>

3578
01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:05.910
<v Speaker 1>on being violent.</v>

3579
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And trying to win no matter how,</v>

3580
01:30:07.531 --> 01:30:08.490
<v Speaker 1>even though you're losing,</v>

3581
01:30:08.491 --> 01:30:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you know that you have to like try and come back and still still knock this guy</v>

3582
01:30:11.581 --> 01:30:15.000
<v Speaker 1>out and make adjustments and make adjustments and just turn the pain off.</v>

3583
01:30:15.001 --> 01:30:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Yet still trying to focus on how am I going to this,</v>

3584
01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:18.840
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing is not working.</v>

3585
01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:22.380
<v Speaker 1>So I have to try and up the ante and try something else and that might get me in</v>

3586
01:30:22.381 --> 01:30:26.530
<v Speaker 1>more danger again where I might get even more cat or my or more beat up or</v>

3587
01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.570
<v Speaker 1>another need of the face.</v>

3588
01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:32.640
<v Speaker 1>So do you ever work with a hypnotist or a psychologist or a sports psychologist</v>

3589
01:30:32.641 --> 01:30:33.070
<v Speaker 1>or anything?</v>

3590
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.903
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3591
01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3592
01:30:35.461 --> 01:30:36.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3593
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Vinny shoreman I,</v>

3594
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:39.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm good friends with any,</v>

3595
01:30:39.121 --> 01:30:41.090
<v Speaker 1>but I never worked with anyone I know.</v>

3596
01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Try with Vinnie Vinnie's I was,</v>

3597
01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:44.371
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering,</v>

3598
01:30:44.371 --> 01:30:44.701
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3599
01:30:44.701 --> 01:30:45.534
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

3600
01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3601
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:47.490
<v Speaker 1>hypnosis and Vinny put me under,</v>

3602
01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:48.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3603
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was under,</v>

3604
01:30:49.471 --> 01:30:50.071
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

3605
01:30:50.071 --> 01:30:50.341
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3606
01:30:50.341 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 1>this is a strange state.</v>

3607
01:30:51.871 --> 01:30:52.704
<v Speaker 1>He puts you in.</v>

3608
01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a very interesting cat.</v>

3609
01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:54.671
<v Speaker 1>Then he's been,</v>

3610
01:30:54.671 --> 01:30:55.021
<v Speaker 1>he's cool.</v>

3611
01:30:55.021 --> 01:30:56.580
<v Speaker 1>He came out to Australia with a friend.</v>

3612
01:30:56.581 --> 01:30:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And where any Alison and then,</v>

3613
01:30:57.811 --> 01:30:58.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3614
01:30:58.290 --> 01:31:00.720
<v Speaker 1>there were hanging out for a week and we were good buddies.</v>

3615
01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:00.901
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3616
01:31:00.901 --> 01:31:01.734
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3617
01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.300
<v Speaker 1>and then in Australia as well,</v>

3618
01:31:03.301 --> 01:31:06.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of mine coaches as well that I've noticed that of setting to a</v>

3619
01:31:06.541 --> 01:31:07.321
<v Speaker 1>period of somewhere.</v>

3620
01:31:07.321 --> 01:31:08.730
<v Speaker 1>But because I'd been in Thailand so long,</v>

3621
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe I need mine coaching.</v>

3622
01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I believe I'm already at that stage in my life where I know exactly what I want.</v>

3623
01:31:16.410 --> 01:31:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Same with this world title with Cosmos.</v>

3624
01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:18.773
<v Speaker 1>I know I wanted it.</v>

3625
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't need someone to tell me that I wanted it.</v>

3626
01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I know I want it and when I lose it,</v>

3627
01:31:22.411 --> 01:31:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fucking pisses me off.</v>

3628
01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:25.670
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

3629
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:26.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3630
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:28.830
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have that thought about what it is.</v>

3631
01:31:28.831 --> 01:31:29.250
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>

3632
01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I did as well,</v>

3633
01:31:30.091 --> 01:31:30.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3634
01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:30.661
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3635
01:31:30.661 --> 01:31:34.680
<v Speaker 1>well what you're gonna do is it's going to solidify what you want and you go</v>

3636
01:31:34.681 --> 01:31:35.514
<v Speaker 1>after it.</v>

3637
01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think it's that what Vinny instead of hypnosis,</v>

3638
01:31:39.931 --> 01:31:44.610
<v Speaker 1>what Vinny likes to think of it as like you're optimizing the pathways for your</v>

3639
01:31:44.611 --> 01:31:45.444
<v Speaker 1>focus.</v>

3640
01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:47.010
<v Speaker 1>And instead of like saying,</v>

3641
01:31:47.011 --> 01:31:47.671
<v Speaker 1>I know what I want,</v>

3642
01:31:47.671 --> 01:31:48.504
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go get it.</v>

3643
01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It's sharpening that to a razor's edge.</v>

3644
01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:52.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

3645
01:31:52.711 --> 01:31:53.544
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3646
01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I think you should,</v>

3647
01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone should look into it and not,</v>

3648
01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:58.710
<v Speaker 1>and not necessarily saying that everyone should implement it.</v>

3649
01:31:58.711 --> 01:31:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3650
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.230
<v Speaker 1>like here's a perfect example</v>

3651
01:32:00.230 --> 01:32:02.200
<v Speaker 2>of like Roy Jones Jr in his prime.</v>

3652
01:32:02.410 --> 01:32:05.080
<v Speaker 2>How would say just do everything you're doing.</v>

3653
01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Don't change a God damn thing.</v>

3654
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:07.234
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3655
01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:12.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean when he was fighting and just moving like no one has ever moved before</v>

3656
01:32:12.161 --> 01:32:14.590
<v Speaker 2>knocking guys out with combinations that were just ridiculous.</v>

3657
01:32:14.591 --> 01:32:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Like how could you say that guy needs to go to a mind coach?</v>

3658
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:18.430
<v Speaker 2>You can't write.</v>

3659
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.760
<v Speaker 2>But I really honestly believe that even though I would say just do whatever</v>

3660
01:32:24.011 --> 01:32:24.640
<v Speaker 2>you're doing,</v>

3661
01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.920
<v Speaker 2>if he did go to a mind coach,</v>

3662
01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:29.470
<v Speaker 2>it would probably take it to an even different level.</v>

3663
01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Probably take it to an even higher level.</v>

3664
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:34.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that everything you do,</v>

3665
01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:36.940
<v Speaker 2>everything you do is good.</v>

3666
01:32:36.941 --> 01:32:37.774
<v Speaker 2>As you're doing it,</v>

3667
01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:38.650
<v Speaker 2>you could do it better.</v>

3668
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I think everything can be optimized,</v>

3669
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:40.991
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3670
01:32:40.991 --> 01:32:43.960
<v Speaker 2>And I think everything has layers and levels to it.</v>

3671
01:32:44.230 --> 01:32:45.460
<v Speaker 2>And to say,</v>

3672
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:46.450
<v Speaker 2>this is good enough,</v>

3673
01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.680
<v Speaker 2>this we're done here.</v>

3674
01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I just think honestly it almost like it disrespects the process of evolution.</v>

3675
01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.870
<v Speaker 2>It disrespects the process of,</v>

3676
01:32:55.871 --> 01:32:56.704
<v Speaker 2>of getting,</v>

3677
01:32:56.770 --> 01:32:58.390
<v Speaker 2>getting better at it of greatness.</v>

3678
01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Like for every Roy Jones Jr there's a guy watching Roy Jones Jr and thinking</v>

3679
01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I've got to figure out a way to beat that motherfucker and training harder and</v>

3680
01:33:05.921 --> 01:33:10.921
<v Speaker 2>maybe he has just as many physical gifts and maybe he has just a slight edge in</v>

3681
01:33:11.151 --> 01:33:12.400
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a weird,</v>

3682
01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:16.150
<v Speaker 2>strange way because he's been watching Roy Jones jr compete.</v>

3683
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3684
01:33:16.511 --> 01:33:17.344
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

3685
01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that this sport is all about like minute differences,</v>

3686
01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:24.130
<v Speaker 2>like all combat sports.</v>

3687
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:25.143
<v Speaker 2>Just like I do,</v>

3688
01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:25.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3689
01:33:25.371 --> 01:33:27.640
<v Speaker 2>nick curse on his strength and conditioning coach,</v>

3690
01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:29.261
<v Speaker 2>really a highly,</v>

3691
01:33:29.261 --> 01:33:30.520
<v Speaker 2>highly respected trains.</v>

3692
01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3693
01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Hofeld dos Anjos who's the UFC lightweight champion and trains a rustle on</v>

3694
01:33:35.201 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 2>providing a cough,</v>

3695
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:41.131
<v Speaker 2>a famous boxer and bunch of other elite athletes done some work with Joe</v>

3696
01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Schilling now too,</v>

3697
01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 2>was doing some work with Joe Schilling.</v>

3698
01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:43.871
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3699
01:33:43.871 --> 01:33:44.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3700
01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.330
<v Speaker 2>he said something really interesting when,</v>

3701
01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3702
01:33:47.010 --> 01:33:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Hofeld dos Anjos beat Anthony Pettis and he said,</v>

3703
01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:51.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3704
01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:52.720
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we did with him,</v>

3705
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:53.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3706
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.850
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3707
01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:54.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3708
01:33:54.101 --> 01:33:54.581
<v Speaker 2>all these,</v>

3709
01:33:54.581 --> 01:33:54.701
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3710
01:33:54.701 --> 01:33:55.930
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning drills,</v>

3711
01:33:55.931 --> 01:34:00.910
<v Speaker 2>it's about executing and getting there just slightly faster.</v>

3712
01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:01.540
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

3713
01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.950
<v Speaker 2>even though he dominated that fight,</v>

3714
01:34:02.951 --> 01:34:04.180
<v Speaker 2>think about those exchanges.</v>

3715
01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 2>He dominated those exchanges by maybe a half a second.</v>

3716
01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Like he landed a half a second quicker.</v>

3717
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:10.870
<v Speaker 2>He was a half a second.</v>

3718
01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:13.480
<v Speaker 2>What were is recovery was just a little quicker.</v>

3719
01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.850
<v Speaker 2>He was able to reengage just a little quicker.</v>

3720
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.840
<v Speaker 2>And those little tiny edges,</v>

3721
01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:22.420
<v Speaker 2>there's little tiny edges means he lands first and it means he's dominating.</v>

3722
01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:23.980
<v Speaker 2>And even though his advantage,</v>

3723
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:27.400
<v Speaker 2>like physically his advantage of execution was so small,</v>

3724
01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:28.450
<v Speaker 2>it was enough.</v>

3725
01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Those little advantages are enough to win a fight.</v>

3726
01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's incredible when you think about it that way,</v>

3727
01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.250
<v Speaker 2>that this sport is just,</v>

3728
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:41.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of like these incremental increases in ability,</v>

3729
01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:43.000
<v Speaker 2>incremental advances.</v>

3730
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3731
01:34:43.410 --> 01:34:44.740
<v Speaker 2>So fascinating to me.</v>

3732
01:34:44.741 --> 01:34:45.910
<v Speaker 2>I never grow tired of it.</v>

3733
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:47.610
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm sort of a,</v>

3734
01:34:47.690 --> 01:34:52.690
<v Speaker 2>an the cavemen era to where I believe that I think what they're the mind coaches</v>

3735
01:34:52.931 --> 01:34:54.460
<v Speaker 2>are doing awesome.</v>

3736
01:34:54.490 --> 01:34:56.590
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time I don't need someone in the pat my back and say,</v>

3737
01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:56.711
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3738
01:34:56.711 --> 01:34:57.530
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a good job.</v>

3739
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3740
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3741
01:34:58.460 --> 01:34:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I had him doing that though.</v>

3742
01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3743
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3744
01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're doing a talk to Vinnie.</v>

3745
01:35:02.151 --> 01:35:03.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe,</v>

3746
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe he give you a bit of an insight on it,</v>

3747
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:08.180
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're right too.</v>

3748
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:09.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3749
01:35:09.171 --> 01:35:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he's right and you're wrong.</v>

3750
01:35:11.091 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right too,</v>

3751
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.680
<v Speaker 1>because you're a proven champion,</v>

3752
01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3753
01:35:16.341 --> 01:35:17.360
<v Speaker 1>and that mindset,</v>

3754
01:35:17.361 --> 01:35:19.550
<v Speaker 1>the steely determination that you've developed,</v>

3755
01:35:19.551 --> 01:35:20.900
<v Speaker 1>like nobody needs to tell you how to do it.</v>

3756
01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:21.651
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3757
01:35:21.651 --> 01:35:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3758
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I firmly believe you're one of those guys.</v>

3759
01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:26.540
<v Speaker 1>You could wake up at three o'clock in the morning and say it's go time and you</v>

3760
01:35:26.541 --> 01:35:27.231
<v Speaker 1>put your shorts on,</v>

3761
01:35:27.231 --> 01:35:28.610
<v Speaker 1>wrap your hands and you know,</v>

3762
01:35:28.611 --> 01:35:29.480
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck to do.</v>

3763
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:31.070
<v Speaker 1>You just kind of fall into it.</v>

3764
01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:31.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3765
01:35:31.281 --> 01:35:32.030
<v Speaker 1>it's your thing.</v>

3766
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:33.110
<v Speaker 1>It'd been doing it forever.</v>

3767
01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:36.110
<v Speaker 1>I cause there's a gentleman in Australia that's doing it.</v>

3768
01:35:36.111 --> 01:35:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And then if someone's having a bad day on it,</v>

3769
01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:38.601
<v Speaker 1>they call him and say,</v>

3770
01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:38.931
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

3771
01:35:38.931 --> 01:35:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I had a bad session.</v>

3772
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:40.603
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>

3773
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:41.583
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>

3774
01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow's a new day where I know,</v>

3775
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.571
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3776
01:35:44.571 --> 01:35:45.320
<v Speaker 1>today I fucked up.</v>

3777
01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.131
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow I'm going to,</v>

3778
01:35:46.131 --> 01:35:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to train harder and make sure that it doesn't happen again.</v>

3779
01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3780
01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you're on mind coach.</v>

3781
01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.640
<v Speaker 1>And then I let no one else to blame but myself too.</v>

3782
01:35:52.641 --> 01:35:56.420
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very lucky in Australia that I owned the gym.</v>

3783
01:35:56.421 --> 01:35:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my own train and my manager,</v>

3784
01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I do all my own Nigga negotiations with uh,</v>

3785
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.863
<v Speaker 1>promoters.</v>

3786
01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3787
01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:08.150
<v Speaker 1>I have my friends that come in like Kevin from New Zealand here that comes and</v>

3788
01:36:08.151 --> 01:36:08.880
<v Speaker 1>helps me.</v>

3789
01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:09.061
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3790
01:36:09.061 --> 01:36:09.431
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

3791
01:36:09.431 --> 01:36:10.131
<v Speaker 1>we work on different,</v>

3792
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:10.880
<v Speaker 1>we talk,</v>

3793
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.550
<v Speaker 1>I give him ideas of what I want to do on the pads.</v>

3794
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3795
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:15.320
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3796
01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.200
<v Speaker 1>so everything I'm,</v>

3797
01:36:16.201 --> 01:36:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3798
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm in control of my own destiny,</v>

3799
01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:18.853
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>

3800
01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I've got no one dictating me what to do.</v>

3801
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3802
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I was the one that reached out to Scott can try and get in line for,</v>

3803
01:36:25.191 --> 01:36:27.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one that's reaching out to all these different guys.</v>

3804
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:29.360
<v Speaker 1>So you like that,</v>

3805
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.130
<v Speaker 1>but some people don't.</v>

3806
01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:31.401
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3807
01:36:31.401 --> 01:36:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Some people like they're,</v>

3808
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:33.620
<v Speaker 1>they just don't want to train.</v>

3809
01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:34.341
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to thank,</v>

3810
01:36:34.341 --> 01:36:36.050
<v Speaker 1>they want their manager to tell him who the fight.</v>

3811
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:39.230
<v Speaker 1>They want everything set up for them and they just want to concentrate on</v>

3812
01:36:39.231 --> 01:36:39.680
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

3813
01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3814
01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3815
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:41.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3816
01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Well cause I've finished toilet.</v>

3817
01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:45.140
<v Speaker 1>When I moved back to Australia from Thailand there was,</v>

3818
01:36:45.141 --> 01:36:46.310
<v Speaker 1>there was no one for me there.</v>

3819
01:36:46.311 --> 01:36:49.280
<v Speaker 1>So opened a gym because I needed somebody to train.</v>

3820
01:36:49.281 --> 01:36:51.770
<v Speaker 1>So I had to teach classes to pay their rent so I could still have somewhere to</v>

3821
01:36:51.771 --> 01:36:56.771
<v Speaker 1>train and that sort of blossomed into the gyms that have been successful.</v>

3822
01:36:57.471 --> 01:37:00.110
<v Speaker 1>So then I started having more guys trained on the meeting and they wanted to</v>

3823
01:37:00.111 --> 01:37:00.440
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

3824
01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden I'm working their corners and learning how to wrap hands</v>

3825
01:37:03.681 --> 01:37:04.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3826
01:37:04.190 --> 01:37:08.420
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm trying to do everything and then also at the same time and trying to</v>

3827
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:09.980
<v Speaker 1>create my own career as well.</v>

3828
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:11.360
<v Speaker 1>So I've been,</v>

3829
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:11.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3830
01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.673
<v Speaker 1>so lucky then.</v>

3831
01:37:13.690 --> 01:37:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3832
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:15.310
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>

3833
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:16.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just what happened.</v>

3834
01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:17.893
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I wanted,</v>

3835
01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:19.220
<v Speaker 1>like I wanted a coach.</v>

3836
01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to have a coach,</v>

3837
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:22.130
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's what I've been doing.</v>

3838
01:37:22.131 --> 01:37:24.620
<v Speaker 1>It's been working and I've been lucky enough to be successful.</v>

3839
01:37:24.621 --> 01:37:26.410
<v Speaker 1>So where would you train if you,</v>

3840
01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:30.070
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't have to run your school and if you didn't have to wear,</v>

3841
01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:33.800
<v Speaker 1>is there a place in the United States or in Thailand or anywhere in the world</v>

3842
01:37:33.801 --> 01:37:37.730
<v Speaker 1>where you would train titled Thailand was perfect for them for five years and</v>

3843
01:37:37.731 --> 01:37:38.150
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

3844
01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:38.983
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3845
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:41.720
<v Speaker 1>definitely definitely grew out of that.</v>

3846
01:37:41.721 --> 01:37:44.840
<v Speaker 1>And when it was wanting to come to Australia was perfect and then put,</v>

3847
01:37:44.841 --> 01:37:46.190
<v Speaker 1>where would I train you grew out of it.</v>

3848
01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:46.940
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>

3849
01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3850
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:48.380
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3851
01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.630
<v Speaker 1>the flights were so high for so small money,</v>

3852
01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:51.561
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3853
01:37:51.561 --> 01:37:52.520
<v Speaker 1>so high level fides,</v>

3854
01:37:52.521 --> 01:37:53.181
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous,</v>

3855
01:37:53.181 --> 01:37:54.320
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous flights.</v>

3856
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3857
01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.011
<v Speaker 1>guys with 200,</v>

3858
01:37:56.011 --> 01:37:59.520
<v Speaker 1>300 fights and then your prize money is enough for a happy meal.</v>

3859
01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.211
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

3860
01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time you convert that happy meal,</v>

3861
01:38:04.831 --> 01:38:05.910
<v Speaker 1>money to Australian money,</v>

3862
01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:06.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3863
01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:07.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3864
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you're buying a pack of chewing gum.</v>

3865
01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:09.753
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

3866
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:12.300
<v Speaker 1>what's the cheapest you ever fought for the cheapest?</v>

3867
01:38:12.301 --> 01:38:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I fought for was 1000 bucks,</v>

3868
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.230
<v Speaker 1>which was $25.</v>

3869
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3870
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3871
01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.590
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to pay money to the gym and then you got to think about</v>

3872
01:38:22.591 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 1>training expenses and food,</v>

3873
01:38:24.090 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 1>even losing money,</v>

3874
01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:25.711
<v Speaker 1>a lot of money.</v>

3875
01:38:25.711 --> 01:38:26.431
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3876
01:38:26.431 --> 01:38:27.180
<v Speaker 1>it sort of sucks.</v>

3877
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:27.930
<v Speaker 1>But then I worked,</v>

3878
01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I worked my way up and then my last fight in Thailand was for 1 million bucks,</v>

3879
01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:33.330
<v Speaker 1>which was approximately 35,000 Australian.</v>

3880
01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:34.470
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3881
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3882
01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:35.491
<v Speaker 1>that's not bad.</v>

3883
01:38:35.491 --> 01:38:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3884
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:36.563
<v Speaker 1>If that's okay.</v>

3885
01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:40.200
<v Speaker 1>It was probably like super elite worldclass fight.</v>

3886
01:38:40.201 --> 01:38:40.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3887
01:38:40.561 --> 01:38:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And then from there,</v>

3888
01:38:41.521 --> 01:38:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I've been on the under thirties or forties for the last 10 years.</v>

3889
01:38:44.581 --> 01:38:46.950
<v Speaker 1>So I've been very fortunate that way that I've,</v>

3890
01:38:46.951 --> 01:38:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I've enough to survive and live comfortably and I only have to train and look</v>

3891
01:38:51.361 --> 01:38:52.050
<v Speaker 1>half of the gym.</v>

3892
01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:52.590
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3893
01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:53.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3894
01:38:53.290 --> 01:38:55.980
<v Speaker 1>we're a lot of other people that I manage.</v>

3895
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:56.431
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3896
01:38:56.431 --> 01:38:56.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3897
01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:57.660
<v Speaker 1>if they're lucky,</v>

3898
01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:01.020
<v Speaker 1>if they get $3,000 is they've hit the jackpot.</v>

3899
01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:04.980
<v Speaker 1>It's such a hard sport to try and become a superstar.</v>

3900
01:39:04.981 --> 01:39:05.814
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard.</v>

3901
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:08.610
<v Speaker 1>So there was one place where you would train if you had,</v>

3902
01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:09.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3903
01:39:09.170 --> 01:39:10.410
<v Speaker 1>it was totally up to you,</v>

3904
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

3905
01:39:11.010 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I guess Holland,</v>

3906
01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Holland.</v>

3907
01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3908
01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:14.090
<v Speaker 1>how long do you know?</v>

3909
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>

3910
01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably trained,</v>

3911
01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:21.660
<v Speaker 1>we call him his core hammers is a sketch and he's got the writing on the wall,</v>

3912
01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:22.411
<v Speaker 1>the board with,</v>

3913
01:39:22.411 --> 01:39:23.244
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3914
01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Raymond and then,</v>

3915
01:39:24.511 --> 01:39:25.344
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3916
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:26.183
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3917
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I was the gentleman now that trains at a glory and there's doing this Kim,</v>

3918
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Nikki Holson and I'm not sure,</v>

3919
01:39:32.041 --> 01:39:32.591
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure he's,</v>

3920
01:39:32.591 --> 01:39:34.820
<v Speaker 1>he's with call him and say he was for a while.</v>

3921
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't off.</v>

3922
01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.150
<v Speaker 1>He is anymore.</v>

3923
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I believe he's still with that,</v>

3924
01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.310
<v Speaker 1>that circle of guys.</v>

3925
01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:42.043
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

3926
01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:42.991
<v Speaker 1>He's excellent.</v>

3927
01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:44.010
<v Speaker 1>He's one of my dream flights.</v>

3928
01:39:44.050 --> 01:39:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3929
01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm a probably a little bit older,</v>

3930
01:39:45.571 --> 01:39:47.790
<v Speaker 1>40 now because he's in his peak and I'm a little bit older,</v>

3931
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:49.980
<v Speaker 1>but he was one of the guys that it's always,</v>

3932
01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that we'd cross paths,</v>

3933
01:39:51.841 --> 01:39:53.730
<v Speaker 1>but we never did he see,</v>

3934
01:39:53.731 --> 01:39:54.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3935
01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:55.860
<v Speaker 1>he's glory 76,</v>

3936
01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

3937
01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3938
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:58.020
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 77.</v>

3939
01:39:58.220 --> 01:39:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3940
01:39:58.630 --> 01:39:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Georgia's weights.</v>

3941
01:39:59.240 --> 01:39:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3942
01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Walter.</v>

3943
01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:00.481
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3944
01:40:00.481 --> 01:40:01.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's one 70.</v>

3945
01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:01.951
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>

3946
01:40:01.951 --> 01:40:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3947
01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3948
01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:03.120
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

3949
01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:03.391
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3950
01:40:03.391 --> 01:40:04.440
<v Speaker 1>he's a little heavier,</v>

3951
01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:07.940
<v Speaker 1>a little more like cosmo Alexander Cosmos in a kill it too.</v>

3952
01:40:07.941 --> 01:40:09.000
<v Speaker 1>He just got dynamite.</v>

3953
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3954
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.040
<v Speaker 1>it has to left talk nasty,</v>

3955
01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:12.180
<v Speaker 1>nasty punches just like,</v>

3956
01:40:12.210 --> 01:40:13.043
<v Speaker 1>just like Raymond.</v>

3957
01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm very similar to what we'll use.</v>

3958
01:40:14.941 --> 01:40:19.941
<v Speaker 1>Is Raymond Deca mini me so well he has a very tactical style over intelligent,</v>

3959
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:21.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3960
01:40:21.091 --> 01:40:22.770
<v Speaker 1>like when he fought Raymond Daniels,</v>

3961
01:40:22.771 --> 01:40:25.650
<v Speaker 1>good high knees will need of the faces and killer,</v>

3962
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:27.030
<v Speaker 1>but he fought Raymond Daniels,</v>

3963
01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Daniels throws all those wild combinations and crazy shit.</v>

3964
01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:30.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3965
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:31.560
<v Speaker 1>just walked them down,</v>

3966
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:32.540
<v Speaker 1>figured out,</v>

3967
01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:33.450
<v Speaker 1>keep the pressure on them,</v>

3968
01:40:33.451 --> 01:40:34.500
<v Speaker 1>throw a lot of leg kicks,</v>

3969
01:40:34.501 --> 01:40:35.430
<v Speaker 1>throw combinations,</v>

3970
01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:38.460
<v Speaker 1>rip that left hook to the body and eventually took them out.</v>

3971
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And once he presses him into the corner too,</v>

3972
01:40:40.081 --> 01:40:40.914
<v Speaker 1>there's no escape.</v>

3973
01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:41.310
<v Speaker 1>And he's got,</v>

3974
01:40:41.310 --> 01:40:43.110
<v Speaker 1>he's got that nice switch knee to the face.</v>

3975
01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And the Raymond Daniels is an interesting case.</v>

3976
01:40:45.151 --> 01:40:45.361
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

3977
01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:46.110
<v Speaker 1>do you know who he is?</v>

3978
01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:46.943
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3979
01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:47.843
<v Speaker 1>he's wise.</v>

3980
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.590
<v Speaker 1>They fought twice and he stopped in both times.</v>

3981
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:50.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3982
01:40:50.161 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Raymond Daniels is an interesting case because there's a guy who was at leat at</v>

3983
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.810
<v Speaker 2>a very odd style of fighting.</v>

3984
01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 2>He was elite at point karate and if you watch his point,</v>

3985
01:40:59.201 --> 01:41:00.400
<v Speaker 2>karate fights online,</v>

3986
01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:03.760
<v Speaker 2>you realize like God it's guy just blitz is in with this crazy shit.</v>

3987
01:41:03.761 --> 01:41:07.510
<v Speaker 2>And then they would stop it and point cry for people don't know is like a really</v>

3988
01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:12.010
<v Speaker 2>high level game of tag with karate because once you touch the guy,</v>

3989
01:41:12.011 --> 01:41:12.970
<v Speaker 2>like literally touch them,</v>

3990
01:41:12.971 --> 01:41:14.980
<v Speaker 2>they stop it and they score the point.</v>

3991
01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:20.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's very difficult to transition from that into continuous fighting.</v>

3992
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Like when you fight in kickboxing or Thai or an MMA,</v>

3993
01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:27.191
<v Speaker 2>when you hit a guy,</v>

3994
01:41:27.191 --> 01:41:28.480
<v Speaker 2>once he hits you back,</v>

3995
01:41:28.481 --> 01:41:31.690
<v Speaker 2>you hit him again and it's all about hitting and not being hit and movement.</v>

3996
01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:32.200
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

3997
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:36.700
<v Speaker 2>what karate would they get really good at is this blitz where they jump on you</v>

3998
01:41:36.701 --> 01:41:37.480
<v Speaker 2>and to attack,</v>

3999
01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:41.200
<v Speaker 2>but they have to get used to hitting back and the referee not stopping the</v>

4000
01:41:41.201 --> 01:41:42.034
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

4001
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.870
<v Speaker 2>So credits or Raymond Daniels,</v>

4002
01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:49.110
<v Speaker 2>he went from doing this one style of like jumping in and hitting a guy once to</v>

4003
01:41:50.770 --> 01:41:54.760
<v Speaker 2>this continuous stock and then also factor in leg kicks.</v>

4004
01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Cause in these karate tournaments you can't kick the legs.</v>

4005
01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.760
<v Speaker 2>So he's jumping in with all these wild kicking and punching techniques and then</v>

4006
01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:07.900
<v Speaker 2>he goes from that to this incredibly difficult,</v>

4007
01:42:07.901 --> 01:42:09.940
<v Speaker 2>grueling style of fighting.</v>

4008
01:42:10.150 --> 01:42:11.950
<v Speaker 2>The guys have their hands up very high.</v>

4009
01:42:11.951 --> 01:42:13.660
<v Speaker 2>The throwing a lot of leg kicks and,</v>

4010
01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:18.670
<v Speaker 2>and he's excelled at it except at the very elite level when he's fought the very</v>

4011
01:42:18.671 --> 01:42:20.710
<v Speaker 2>best guys like Joseph optoline stopped him.</v>

4012
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Same thing,</v>

4013
01:42:21.610 --> 01:42:22.600
<v Speaker 2>attack the legs,</v>

4014
01:42:22.601 --> 01:42:23.380
<v Speaker 2>attack place,</v>

4015
01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:25.090
<v Speaker 2>get them to block the leg goes up high,</v>

4016
01:42:25.091 --> 01:42:25.924
<v Speaker 2>it head kicks him.</v>

4017
01:42:26.110 --> 01:42:31.110
<v Speaker 2>But it's utilizing the Moy Thai style to defeat this style where he just,</v>

4018
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:33.790
<v Speaker 2>he's got so many tools,</v>

4019
01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:38.860
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't quite have all of it together at a world class level.</v>

4020
01:42:39.610 --> 01:42:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Let the guy fight on the outside,</v>

4021
01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:41.891
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4022
01:42:41.891 --> 01:42:45.160
<v Speaker 2>he's got that blitz blitz in those wild kicks.</v>

4023
01:42:45.161 --> 01:42:46.150
<v Speaker 2>He's really interesting.</v>

4024
01:42:46.170 --> 01:42:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4025
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:48.370
<v Speaker 2>Very Unorthodox edits.</v>

4026
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:49.300
<v Speaker 2>The spins.</v>

4027
01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4028
01:42:50.050 --> 01:42:50.883
<v Speaker 2>And the jumping,</v>

4029
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:51.940
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to wonder man,</v>

4030
01:42:51.941 --> 01:42:52.151
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4031
01:42:52.151 --> 01:42:54.340
<v Speaker 2>with a guy with those type of skills,</v>

4032
01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.680
<v Speaker 2>if he could get his hands at the same level as like a niche Niki holds can or a</v>

4033
01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:02.290
<v Speaker 2>valine and get those leg kicks at the level that those guys have,</v>

4034
01:43:02.291 --> 01:43:02.520
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4035
01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

4036
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:04.183
<v Speaker 2>you man.</v>

4037
01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:05.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4038
01:43:05.181 --> 01:43:05.330
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4039
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.901
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

4040
01:43:05.901 --> 01:43:06.710
<v Speaker 3>He's um,</v>

4041
01:43:06.710 --> 01:43:07.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4042
01:43:07.190 --> 01:43:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4043
01:43:07.530 --> 01:43:08.420
<v Speaker 3>But then Nikki Holsten,</v>

4044
01:43:08.421 --> 01:43:09.254
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

4045
01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:10.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how anyone can fight him right now.</v>

4046
01:43:10.791 --> 01:43:13.790
<v Speaker 3>He's probably the the king at that weight division.</v>

4047
01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4048
01:43:15.170 --> 01:43:15.401
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

4049
01:43:15.401 --> 01:43:17.180
<v Speaker 3>so there's a lot of talent and glory.</v>

4050
01:43:17.181 --> 01:43:19.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a really drives me nuts to seeing,</v>

4051
01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:22.730
<v Speaker 3>seeing that them leaving spike TV,</v>

4052
01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:24.020
<v Speaker 3>I'd really bums me out.</v>

4053
01:43:24.021 --> 01:43:26.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's gonna happen now because the without them and the prize</v>

4054
01:43:26.571 --> 01:43:30.680
<v Speaker 3>money we had the again and B that they exposure where what happens now,</v>

4055
01:43:30.681 --> 01:43:32.910
<v Speaker 3>what happens to the lion fights.</v>

4056
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:35.330
<v Speaker 3>They're only channel to go near like I suppose.</v>

4057
01:43:35.331 --> 01:43:38.720
<v Speaker 3>And their ability is doing the kickboxing version as well with their last show</v>

4058
01:43:38.721 --> 01:43:40.070
<v Speaker 3>with the ring in the cage.</v>

4059
01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.480
<v Speaker 3>So that was interesting.</v>

4060
01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:43.160
<v Speaker 3>And that was combined with glory.</v>

4061
01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4062
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:44.181
<v Speaker 3>I suppose.</v>

4063
01:43:44.181 --> 01:43:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4064
01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:46.520
<v Speaker 3>I think that that was what they were doing.</v>

4065
01:43:46.521 --> 01:43:47.060
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

4066
01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:50.450
<v Speaker 2>They were just trying to have like a big crazy like Japanese style event,</v>

4067
01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.313
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4068
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know</v>

4069
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4070
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:53.510
<v Speaker 1>It just bums me out.</v>

4071
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:57.170
<v Speaker 1>It just bums me out that it for whatever reason it didn't catch on.</v>

4072
01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4073
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4074
01:43:58.450 --> 01:43:59.283
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4075
01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.640
<v Speaker 1>and spike is obviously where the UFC took off.</v>

4076
01:44:01.641 --> 01:44:03.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like it can't happen there,</v>

4077
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:05.330
<v Speaker 1>but whatever reason it just didn't.</v>

4078
01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4079
01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:06.951
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

4080
01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:07.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4081
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:08.090
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

4082
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.510
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

4083
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:09.130
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for us.</v>

4084
01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Strike is we um,</v>

4085
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

4086
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:13.940
<v Speaker 1>have they get the Steel Cup on the corners in between flights?</v>

4087
01:44:13.941 --> 01:44:14.731
<v Speaker 1>They didn't Tingler Jean,</v>

4088
01:44:14.731 --> 01:44:15.600
<v Speaker 1>any good need change?</v>

4089
01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Pass the hat around.</v>

4090
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:20.630
<v Speaker 1>What about in Holland?</v>

4091
01:44:20.631 --> 01:44:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

4092
01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:23.300
<v Speaker 1>is it they make money at Holland fighting,</v>

4093
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:24.163
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

4094
01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4095
01:44:25.371 --> 01:44:28.370
<v Speaker 1>they shut down all the big shows as a massive show called showtime with,</v>

4096
01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:28.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4097
01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:33.650
<v Speaker 1>half a football stadium and I believe that had like 30 to 40,000 people that</v>

4098
01:44:33.651 --> 01:44:35.840
<v Speaker 1>would come to these events three or four times a year.</v>

4099
01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:40.550
<v Speaker 1>And then apparently the hell's angels were involved with a little bit of</v>

4100
01:44:40.551 --> 01:44:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Washington washing this and that.</v>

4101
01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:42.711
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

4102
01:44:42.711 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4103
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:44.900
<v Speaker 1>they got banned from doing the big shows.</v>

4104
01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's why there's nothing happening in Hollindale.</v>

4105
01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4106
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

4107
01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:49.580
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4108
01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.470
<v Speaker 1>it was that that was the place to go.</v>

4109
01:44:51.471 --> 01:44:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Hollen and showtime and Cosmo was a former showtime champion also in about a</v>

4110
01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:57.830
<v Speaker 1>hiree love.</v>

4111
01:44:57.831 --> 01:44:58.664
<v Speaker 1>Watch that.</v>

4112
01:44:58.850 --> 01:45:00.090
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking crazy.</v>

4113
01:45:00.110 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Send me shield or crazy killers.</v>

4114
01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:03.320
<v Speaker 1>All the Dutch.</v>

4115
01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.640
<v Speaker 1>It was such an amazing show.</v>

4116
01:45:04.641 --> 01:45:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And then because they're knocked on the head now there's,</v>

4117
01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:07.920
<v Speaker 1>where do you go?</v>

4118
01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.180
<v Speaker 1>They'd like that was the,</v>

4119
01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:09.860
<v Speaker 1>besides,</v>

4120
01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:10.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4121
01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Thailand.</v>

4122
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Holland was at that place and now,</v>

4123
01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.300
<v Speaker 1>now that's dried up.</v>

4124
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems that maybe Japanese can fucking pick up the slack and come back</v>

4125
01:45:18.531 --> 01:45:19.370
<v Speaker 1>with k one again.</v>

4126
01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know they're trying to do a new MMA promotion.</v>

4127
01:45:21.951 --> 01:45:23.270
<v Speaker 1>They have fade or for new years.</v>

4128
01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4129
01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:24.680
<v Speaker 1>but here's the problem.</v>

4130
01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:28.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no heavyweight talent out there that can't find fate or an opponent.</v>

4131
01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Someone said he's opponents for flights or something with two.</v>

4132
01:45:32.370 --> 01:45:32.871
<v Speaker 1>Well that guy,</v>

4133
01:45:32.871 --> 01:45:33.860
<v Speaker 1>they pulled that guy out.</v>

4134
01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he's not in shape.</v>

4135
01:45:35.301 --> 01:45:35.631
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

4136
01:45:35.631 --> 01:45:35.901
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

4137
01:45:35.901 --> 01:45:36.021
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4138
01:45:36.021 --> 01:45:36.980
<v Speaker 1>an Indian gentleman,</v>

4139
01:45:36.981 --> 01:45:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I believe from India.</v>

4140
01:45:38.890 --> 01:45:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't even,</v>

4141
01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:40.161
<v Speaker 1>I know who he is,</v>

4142
01:45:40.161 --> 01:45:40.611
<v Speaker 1>but he's not,</v>

4143
01:45:40.611 --> 01:45:42.020
<v Speaker 1>he's just not world class.</v>

4144
01:45:42.021 --> 01:45:42.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

4145
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:45.040
<v Speaker 1>not for a guy like fate or like,</v>

4146
01:45:45.041 --> 01:45:45.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4147
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:48.200
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about arguably the greatest heavyweight of all time and you're</v>

4148
01:45:48.201 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 1>going to have him fight a guy who's just nowhere near his league for a New</v>

4149
01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:52.761
<v Speaker 1>Year's eve show.</v>

4150
01:45:52.761 --> 01:45:53.594
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

4151
01:45:53.670 --> 01:45:55.220
<v Speaker 1>You need world class talent.</v>

4152
01:45:55.530 --> 01:45:56.920
<v Speaker 1>There was so much excitement when they,</v>

4153
01:45:56.921 --> 01:45:57.220
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4154
01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:57.891
<v Speaker 1>he and he answered,</v>

4155
01:45:57.891 --> 01:46:01.260
<v Speaker 1>he was coming back and then there was the 20 supposed to fight in the UFC what</v>

4156
01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:01.890
<v Speaker 1>supposed to,</v>

4157
01:46:01.890 --> 01:46:04.910
<v Speaker 1>and it was talking to the UFC then there was still good but going to Bella toy</v>

4158
01:46:04.911 --> 01:46:07.160
<v Speaker 1>and then he was going to make the big announcement and then,</v>

4159
01:46:07.161 --> 01:46:07.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4160
01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:08.150
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

4161
01:46:08.150 --> 01:46:08.451
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4162
01:46:08.451 --> 01:46:09.284
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to Japan.</v>

4163
01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Well I think at least spike TV's going to air the fight.</v>

4164
01:46:12.381 --> 01:46:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I think they did something in conjunction with Spike TV for,</v>

4165
01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:17.173
<v Speaker 1>for this event.</v>

4166
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:18.710
<v Speaker 1>So I believe,</v>

4167
01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:19.693
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

4168
01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that it's in conjunction with Spike TV.</v>

4169
01:46:24.170 --> 01:46:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4170
01:46:24.710 --> 01:46:25.240
<v Speaker 1>The fate or,</v>

4171
01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.510
<v Speaker 1>but who the fuck is he going to fight?</v>

4172
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:30.100
<v Speaker 1>There's no one out there unless Randy coture comes out of retirement and then</v>

4173
01:46:30.101 --> 01:46:31.310
<v Speaker 1>then Randy's 50,</v>

4174
01:46:31.311 --> 01:46:32.940
<v Speaker 1>whatever years old and you're gonna need,</v>

4175
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4176
01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.030
<v Speaker 1>a strong undercut to support it as well.</v>

4177
01:46:35.031 --> 01:46:35.870
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's signed.</v>

4178
01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Everyone saw it would be the ability to,</v>

4179
01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:42.580
<v Speaker 1>or UFC or it's crazy time or world series of fighting between those three shows.</v>

4180
01:46:42.681 --> 01:46:43.700
<v Speaker 1>They have everybody,</v>

4181
01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:45.110
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

4182
01:46:45.110 --> 01:46:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Bella toward doesn't even really have a heavyweight champion.</v>

4183
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:49.090
<v Speaker 1>He never see their heavyweight champion fighting.</v>

4184
01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck is there?</v>

4185
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Heavyweight</v>

4186
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.903
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

4187
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.541
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4188
01:46:51.541 --> 01:46:52.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4189
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the guy has fun.</v>

4190
01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:54.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're heavyweight champion.</v>

4191
01:46:54.421 --> 01:46:56.580
<v Speaker 2>He's fought and like two years or something crazy like that.</v>

4192
01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a mass man.</v>

4193
01:46:58.440 --> 01:46:59.490
<v Speaker 2>It really is a mess.</v>

4194
01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:00.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just this.</v>

4195
01:47:00.230 --> 01:47:01.440
<v Speaker 2>It's very unfortunate.</v>

4196
01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:02.573
<v Speaker 2>I would like,</v>

4197
01:47:04.330 --> 01:47:04.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4198
01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see him fight a quality opponent if he's going to come back and get</v>

4199
01:47:08.850 --> 01:47:09.870
<v Speaker 2>definitely like the,</v>

4200
01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:10.681
<v Speaker 2>like the pri days.</v>

4201
01:47:10.681 --> 01:47:11.514
<v Speaker 2>That would have been amazing.</v>

4202
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4203
01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:12.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4204
01:47:12.541 --> 01:47:13.440
<v Speaker 2>they did it before.</v>

4205
01:47:13.441 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Why can't they do it again?</v>

4206
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:15.570
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4207
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:15.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4208
01:47:15.901 --> 01:47:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it's gotta be,</v>

4209
01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:20.930
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be some upstarts,</v>

4210
01:47:20.931 --> 01:47:25.260
<v Speaker 2>some young up and coming fighters out there all over the world that are very</v>

4211
01:47:25.261 --> 01:47:25.861
<v Speaker 2>talented.</v>

4212
01:47:25.861 --> 01:47:30.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of how having a quality talent scout who really is deep in the</v>

4213
01:47:30.121 --> 01:47:30.541
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

4214
01:47:30.541 --> 01:47:31.770
<v Speaker 2>who understands fighting,</v>

4215
01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:36.300
<v Speaker 2>who can go out there and recruit those guys at a young age and then have,</v>

4216
01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:37.740
<v Speaker 2>well the Japanese also,</v>

4217
01:47:37.741 --> 01:47:42.741
<v Speaker 2>there's another angle that must be considered is that the Japanese became big</v>

4218
01:47:43.050 --> 01:47:48.050
<v Speaker 2>that the organization's by having pro wrestlers fight in MMA matches like Takada</v>

4219
01:47:49.050 --> 01:47:54.050
<v Speaker 2>went to codified Hixon Gracie Hixon Gracie was the man in the fucking Brazilian</v>

4220
01:47:55.231 --> 01:47:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu world,</v>

4221
01:47:56.130 --> 01:47:56.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4222
01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:58.590
<v Speaker 2>And he was the man in the Gracie world.</v>

4223
01:47:58.591 --> 01:48:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Like when hoists Gracie was winning the UFC,</v>

4224
01:48:00.991 --> 01:48:01.591
<v Speaker 2>he always said,</v>

4225
01:48:01.591 --> 01:48:01.831
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

4226
01:48:01.831 --> 01:48:03.360
<v Speaker 2>my brother is 10 times better than me.</v>

4227
01:48:03.690 --> 01:48:04.650
<v Speaker 2>And he always said that.</v>

4228
01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:08.370
<v Speaker 2>And then his brother goes and fights for Japan valley to doe and becomes a</v>

4229
01:48:08.371 --> 01:48:09.390
<v Speaker 2>superstar in Japan.</v>

4230
01:48:09.391 --> 01:48:10.320
<v Speaker 2>And then his brother,</v>

4231
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:15.300
<v Speaker 2>people don't know Hixon fought in the very first pride Hixon fought Takata.</v>

4232
01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:18.210
<v Speaker 2>And so when Hickson was fighting in Japan,</v>

4233
01:48:18.211 --> 01:48:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Hickson was a superstar to Kata was a pro wrestling superstar.</v>

4234
01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:23.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's what made pride takeoff.</v>

4235
01:48:23.970 --> 01:48:28.950
<v Speaker 2>And then obviously they were doing these gigantic arena site Tonah super arena</v>

4236
01:48:28.951 --> 01:48:32.460
<v Speaker 2>and just a huge fucking venues in New Year's Eve shows.</v>

4237
01:48:32.461 --> 01:48:33.294
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

4238
01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.270
<v Speaker 2>they have to figure out how to rebuild that.</v>

4239
01:48:36.271 --> 01:48:40.200
<v Speaker 2>But I don't even think pro wrestling is where it's at in any more in Japan.</v>

4240
01:48:40.230 --> 01:48:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I think Japan,</v>

4241
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.300
<v Speaker 2>they get fickle.</v>

4242
01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:43.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4243
01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:43.921
<v Speaker 2>these young kids,</v>

4244
01:48:43.921 --> 01:48:44.790
<v Speaker 2>they dressed like Elvis,</v>

4245
01:48:44.791 --> 01:48:47.400
<v Speaker 2>they dye their hair purple and then next year,</v>

4246
01:48:47.610 --> 01:48:47.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4247
01:48:47.911 --> 01:48:51.090
<v Speaker 2>they become accountants and they know that's the only thing they have like these</v>

4248
01:48:51.091 --> 01:48:52.410
<v Speaker 2>weird fabs that get into,</v>

4249
01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:53.503

4304
01:49:56.831 --> 01:50:00.190
<v Speaker 3>They had guys that were fighting guys way smaller than him,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4317
01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Alkali.</v>

4318
01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:14.710
<v Speaker 3>Calculated the jumping down,</v>

4319
01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:15.573
<v Speaker 3>ran hockey,</v>

4320
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:19.540
<v Speaker 3>and then put the leg back and hitting with the heel and on the way down,</v>

4321
01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:21.130
<v Speaker 3>I think he was that way,</v>

4322
01:50:21.131 --> 01:50:26.131
<v Speaker 3>but at least 70 killers and least the least mo was all bomber too.</v>

4323
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:29.501
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

4324
01:50:29.501 --> 01:50:30.220
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>

4325
01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:30.880

4327
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:34.720
<v Speaker 3>but mighty Mo was going to,</v>

4328
01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:35.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:35.940
<v Speaker 3>put him in school.</v>

4330
01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I would fight with his hands down to,</v>

4331
01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:39.760
<v Speaker 3>he was like a taekwondo fighter.</v>

4332
01:50:39.761 --> 01:50:40.660
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>

4333
01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:42.330
<v Speaker 3>He was fighting them regularly.</v>

4334
01:50:42.331 --> 01:50:45.910
<v Speaker 3>He fought out homie and joy from the seven foot,</v>

4335
01:50:45.911 --> 01:50:47.080
<v Speaker 3>two blue hair,</v>

4336
01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.033
<v Speaker 3>one stuff,</v>

4337
01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.900
<v Speaker 3>and then should have beaten him too.</v>

4338
01:50:49.901 --> 01:50:50.081
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4339
01:50:50.081 --> 01:50:51.190
<v Speaker 3>but they wanted to create him.</v>

4340
01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:53.230
<v Speaker 3>They tried to build a man show episode,</v>

4341
01:50:53.231 --> 01:50:54.400
<v Speaker 3>become the next k one star.</v>

4342
01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:55.391
<v Speaker 3>But in theory,</v>

4343
01:50:55.391 --> 01:50:56.140
<v Speaker 3>if you watch the fight,</v>

4344

4348
01:51:05.710 --> 01:51:10.130

4510
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:06.920
<v Speaker 3>k one collapsed probably a year later because they get crazy.</v>

4511
01:55:06.921 --> 01:55:09.140
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have this dire anymore without that.</v>

4512
01:55:09.141 --> 01:55:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm without one.</v>

4513
01:55:10.221 --> 01:55:11.054
<v Speaker 3>One fighter.</v>

4514
01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:12.500
<v Speaker 3>He was the,</v>

4515
01:55:12.610 --> 01:55:13.790
<v Speaker 3>the pinnacle he was,</v>

4516
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:15.230
<v Speaker 3>and I wanted to fight him.</v>

4517
01:55:15.231 --> 01:55:16.300
<v Speaker 3>And then every single person,</v>

4518
01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:17.000
<v Speaker 3>the one of the fighting,</v>

4519
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:17.550
<v Speaker 3>because a,</v>

4520
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:18.410
<v Speaker 3>if you beat him,</v>

4521
01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:22.700
<v Speaker 3>that was going to launch it to the stratosphere of just becoming an overnight,</v>

4522
01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:23.583
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4523
01:55:23.690 --> 01:55:24.231
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>

4524
01:55:24.231 --> 01:55:25.370
<v Speaker 3>So he fought bull cow,</v>

4525
01:55:25.371 --> 01:55:26.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4526
01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:26.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4527
01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:27.800
<v Speaker 3>At the same year that I football here,</v>

4528
01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:31.250
<v Speaker 3>I fought by book out first in the first fight and then,</v>

4529
01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:31.641
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4530
01:55:31.641 --> 01:55:32.520
<v Speaker 3>it was Masada Bork,</v>

4531
01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:34.400
<v Speaker 3>our final and then Bork.</v>

4532
01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:35.473
<v Speaker 3>How</v>

4533
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:38.000
<v Speaker 3>should a one after three,</v>

4534
01:55:38.001 --> 01:55:39.980
<v Speaker 3>they called it a draw and the Masada,</v>

4535
01:55:39.981 --> 01:55:40.970
<v Speaker 3>his eyes closed.</v>

4536
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.980
<v Speaker 3>He had a limp.</v>

4537
01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:42.830
<v Speaker 3>He is probably,</v>

4538
01:55:42.831 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 3>I think he started urinating blood the next day and they called it an extension</v>

4539
01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:51.230
<v Speaker 3>and I draw one more around and Massaro has looked at borecas kind of,</v>

4540
01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.113
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

4541
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:53.460
<v Speaker 3>this isn't going to be good.</v>

4542
01:55:53.850 --> 01:55:54.860
<v Speaker 3>So then I'm bored.</v>

4543
01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:57.930
<v Speaker 3>Cows going out there and done the business for another three minutes and then</v>

4544
01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:58.830
<v Speaker 3>they've awarded the,</v>

4545
01:55:58.831 --> 01:55:59.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4546
01:55:59.110 --> 01:56:00.930
<v Speaker 3>the cow mex title to am book out.</v>

4547
01:56:00.931 --> 01:56:01.764
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

4548
01:56:01.770 --> 01:56:02.970
<v Speaker 3>then the next day you heard,</v>

4549
01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:03.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4550
01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Messiah,</v>

4551
01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:04.980
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't healthy.</v>

4552
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:06.630
<v Speaker 3>They should have stopped it,</v>

4553
01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:08.190
<v Speaker 3>but because he was Japanese,</v>

4554
01:56:08.191 --> 01:56:09.024
<v Speaker 3>I wanted,</v>

4555
01:56:09.110 --> 01:56:10.530
<v Speaker 3>they want to give them a chance to win.</v>

4556
01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

4557
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:11.783
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4558
01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:12.803
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>

4559
01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:13.771
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4560
01:56:13.771 --> 01:56:14.461
<v Speaker 3>kind of like Don,</v>

4561
01:56:14.461 --> 01:56:15.990
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that he never came back,</v>

4562
01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:16.480
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4563
01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.510
<v Speaker 3>but that's how I ended up winning the Max twice.</v>

4564
01:56:18.570 --> 01:56:19.590
<v Speaker 3>So to his credit,</v>

4565
01:56:19.591 --> 01:56:19.891
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

4566
01:56:19.891 --> 01:56:20.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4567
01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:22.360
<v Speaker 3>he'll be undeniably the,</v>

4568
01:56:22.361 --> 01:56:24.310
<v Speaker 3>the greatest depth cause uh,</v>

4569
01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:25.710
<v Speaker 3>in the heavyweights they had,</v>

4570
01:56:26.890 --> 01:56:27.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4574
01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:35.520

4577
01:56:36.641 --> 01:56:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4578
01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:41.620
<v Speaker 3>And he never sort of excel to their level where Massaro did save him from Masada</v>

4579
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:43.810
<v Speaker 3>to when the k one twice against legit,</v>

4580
01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:44.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4581
01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:45.750
<v Speaker 3>will kill us.</v>

4582
01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4583
01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:46.921
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4584
01:56:46.921 --> 01:56:47.380
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

4585
01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:47.671
<v Speaker 3>he went,</v>

4586
01:56:47.671 --> 01:56:51.180
<v Speaker 3>he was a real world championship caliber and really,</v>

4587
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:53.820
<v Speaker 3>probably the only Japanese have fought at that level.</v>

4588
01:56:53.850 --> 01:56:54.980
<v Speaker 3>I think if it wasn't for K,</v>

4589
01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:56.210
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't for side,</v>

4590
01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:57.960
<v Speaker 3>there would have been no k one max.</v>

4591
01:56:58.380 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 3>He was him.</v>

4592
01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.530
<v Speaker 3>He was the kid that shine that said,</v>

4593
01:57:00.531 --> 01:57:00.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4594
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:03.110
<v Speaker 3>we need to make this 70 kilo division because I'm,</v>

4595
01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.410
<v Speaker 3>this kid is going to take us all away and put us on the wall stage,</v>

4596
01:57:06.490 --> 01:57:07.323
<v Speaker 3>legitimate,</v>

4597
01:57:07.450 --> 01:57:07.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4598
01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:08.693
<v Speaker 3>as a country.</v>

4599
01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:13.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's unique in combat sports that he decided to stay retired.</v>

4600
01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4601
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:14.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4602
01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:18.060
<v Speaker 3>I want an a wonder what that was was just probably the punishment from some of</v>

4603
01:57:18.061 --> 01:57:20.880
<v Speaker 3>those fights just got to a point where money,</v>

4604
01:57:20.930 --> 01:57:21.763
<v Speaker 3>the fame,</v>

4605
01:57:21.930 --> 01:57:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got to the stage where he'd,</v>

4606
01:57:23.551 --> 01:57:26.780
<v Speaker 3>he'd already conquered the sport and there was,</v>

4607
01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:28.330
<v Speaker 3>there was nowhere for him to go anymore.</v>

4608
01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:31.020
<v Speaker 3>He'd already done everything and had money in the bank.</v>

4609
01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:34.500
<v Speaker 3>And then I think get the stage where you don't want to wake up at six in the</v>

4610
01:57:34.501 --> 01:57:35.131
<v Speaker 3>morning anymore.</v>

4611
01:57:35.131 --> 01:57:39.210
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to have to put ice on your knees and Yay and your shoulders after</v>

4612
01:57:39.211 --> 01:57:40.044
<v Speaker 3>every session.</v>

4613
01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4614
01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:41.910
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

4615
01:57:41.911 --> 01:57:46.110
<v Speaker 3>everybody that fights in MMA or kickboxing,</v>

4616
01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:50.880
<v Speaker 3>there's always that one person in every sport that has that life,</v>

4617
01:57:50.881 --> 01:57:53.670
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Ronda Rousey in women's MMA,</v>

4618
01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:54.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4619
01:57:54.391 --> 01:57:56.190
<v Speaker 3>and then the other girls are looking at her and they,</v>

4620
01:57:56.191 --> 01:57:56.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4621
01:57:56.521 --> 01:57:56.731
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

4622
01:57:56.731 --> 01:58:00.780
<v Speaker 3>they're struggling or whether it's Masato or whether it's Conor McGregor.</v>

4623
01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.550
<v Speaker 3>There's like this one person.</v>

4624
01:58:02.650 --> 01:58:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4625
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:03.470
<v Speaker 3>One is,</v>

4626
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:04.740
<v Speaker 3>these are a few outliers.</v>

4627
01:58:04.741 --> 01:58:05.850
<v Speaker 3>It sort of figure it out.</v>

4628
01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:08.280
<v Speaker 3>And then Holly Holmes even coming out and said,</v>

4629
01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:08.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4630
01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I want what Rhonda has.</v>

4631
01:58:10.730 --> 01:58:12.000
<v Speaker 3>I wanted what Massada had.</v>

4632
01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:12.863
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4633
01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:13.770
<v Speaker 3>I would love the,</v>

4634
01:58:13.810 --> 01:58:17.150
<v Speaker 3>to robbery doing the pull.</v>

4635
01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:18.240
<v Speaker 3>I remember one commercial,</v>

4636
01:58:18.241 --> 01:58:18.901
<v Speaker 3>he's in a Fri,</v>

4637
01:58:18.901 --> 01:58:19.470

4638
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:21.080
<v Speaker 3>you see that pull up in the door.</v>

4639
01:58:21.081 --> 01:58:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I've been like a space ship.</v>

4640
01:58:22.531 --> 01:58:24.960
<v Speaker 3>And then they're focusing on his role at the watch and it's like,</v>

4641
01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:28.110
<v Speaker 3>and he's in a suit and he's looking stylish and he's got it.</v>

4642
01:58:28.111 --> 01:58:28.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4643
01:58:28.471 --> 01:58:28.910
<v Speaker 3>He's got,</v>

4644
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:29.700

<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

4651
01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:36.960
<v Speaker 3>And as a cause you're get by playing the same game.</v>

4652
01:58:36.961 --> 01:58:37.201
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4653
01:58:37.201 --> 01:58:38.250
<v Speaker 3>how come I can't be him?</v>

4654
01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.001
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to be him.</v>

4655
01:58:39.001 --> 01:58:39.900
<v Speaker 3>That'd be so cool.</v>

4656
01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Did the guys and k one</v>

4657
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:44.080
<v Speaker 1>the heavyweight division k one,</v>

4658
01:58:44.410 --> 01:58:45.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4659
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.600
<v Speaker 1>did there those guys make good money?</v>

4660
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4661
01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:52.120
<v Speaker 1>well they'd had a eight men tournament once a year and when it was at its peak,</v>

4662
01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:53.800
<v Speaker 1>they had the Tokyo Dome,</v>

4663
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:55.230
<v Speaker 1>90,000 people in it.</v>

4664
01:58:55.290 --> 01:58:56.920
<v Speaker 1>It would sell it in two hours.</v>

4665
01:58:57.250 --> 01:58:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4666
01:58:57.450 --> 01:58:57.970
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4667
01:58:57.970 --> 01:59:00.190
<v Speaker 1>and then you'd have to fight three times in,</v>

4668
01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:04.930
<v Speaker 1>in approximately three hours in the grand prize was a 500,000 us.</v>

4669
01:59:05.410 --> 01:59:10.410
<v Speaker 1>So do you know how much profit they must've made of you have 90,000 people in an</v>

4670
01:59:11.471 --> 01:59:13.570
<v Speaker 1>arena and you're selling those,</v>

4671
01:59:13.571 --> 01:59:13.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4672
01:59:13.781 --> 01:59:14.614
<v Speaker 1>just think about it.</v>

4673
01:59:14.650 --> 01:59:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's only 10 bucks.</v>

4674
01:59:16.150 --> 01:59:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4675
01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:21.540
<v Speaker 1>That is a fuck load of money and that is a goddamn fuck load of money and you're</v>

4676
01:59:21.791 --> 01:59:24.190
<v Speaker 1>only paying out 500 grand to the winter end.</v>

4677
01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:28.510
<v Speaker 1>You have paper view and miss the issue might have forgot to pay tax or for a few</v>

4678
01:59:28.510 --> 01:59:29.343
<v Speaker 1>years in a row.</v>

4679
01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Then he had to do,</v>

4680
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I think he believed he had to do a little bit of,</v>

4681
01:59:33.071 --> 01:59:33.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4682

01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:46.150
<v Speaker 1>it's better than jail man.</v>

4701
01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:52.780
<v Speaker 1>that's when the size shows that it happened.</v>

4702
01:59:52.781 --> 01:59:54.550
<v Speaker 1>That's when the Bob Sapp started coming along.</v>

01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Main choice that are coming in.</v>

4706
01:59:56.861 --> 01:59:57.694
<v Speaker 1>That's when</v>

4707
01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:03.670
<v Speaker 1>she had this platform where everything was 90,000 people and then everything was</v>

4773
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>But Andy Hook was only like five,</v>

<v Speaker 1>10 or something like that.</v>

02:01:28.241 --> 02:01:28.391
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4776
02:01:28.391 --> 02:01:32.020
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a big guy and he had to put on a lot of muscle in order to fight those</v>

4777
02:01:32.021 --> 02:01:32.854
<v Speaker 1>heavyweights.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot of those guys in that division and um,</v>

4782
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:39.410

4785
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.070
<v Speaker 2>or knock you out and then a month later I would knock them out and then it was</v>

4786
02:01:43.071 --> 02:01:44.720
<v Speaker 2>just crazy that they fought like that.</v>

4787
02:01:45.110 --> 02:01:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4788
02:01:45.670 --> 02:01:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would fight each other six,</v>

4789
02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:47.181
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

4790
02:01:47.181 --> 02:01:48.800
<v Speaker 2>eight times and it'd be a 50,</v>

4791
02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:49.461
<v Speaker 2>50 split.</v>

4792
02:01:49.461 --> 02:01:50.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4793
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.330
<v Speaker 2>who was ever on that day was going to win and whoever didn't get knocked out and</v>

4794
02:01:53.331 --> 02:01:58.331
<v Speaker 2>training whoever who got knocked out like the furthest amount of time from that</v>

4795
02:01:58.551 --> 02:01:59.150
<v Speaker 2>tournament.</v>

4801
02:02:03.591 --> 02:02:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4802
02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:06.500
<v Speaker 2>how could you get knocked out and they get knocked out again a month later.</v>

4803

02:03:41.451 --> 02:03:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Someone says how much does it not?</v>

4865
02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:43.420
<v Speaker 2>They're not dead,</v>

4866
02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:44.253
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't matter.</v>

4867
02:03:44.730 --> 02:03:46.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not zero</v>

4868
02:03:48.190 --> 02:03:52.280
<v Speaker 2>and its entire so you're missing the point on it's not about money.</v>

4869
02:03:52.730 --> 02:03:54.020
<v Speaker 2>It's about giant checks.</v>

4870
02:03:54.130 --> 02:03:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4871
02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:55.581
<v Speaker 2>The back in the,</v>

4872
02:03:55.581 --> 02:03:56.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah Kaylen was cool.</v>

4873
02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:57.433
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

4874
02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.910
<v Speaker 2>but you think of k one the only paying out 500 grand to the winner.</v>

4875
02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4876
02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

4877
02:04:03.650 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of money.</v>

4878
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:09.170
<v Speaker 2>They're making it 90,000 seats so I dunno.</v>

4879
02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno if 90,000 times 10 is that nine million ninety million?</v>

4880
02:04:15.170 --> 02:04:15.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4881
02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:15.971
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4882
02:04:15.971 --> 02:04:16.090
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4883
02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:16.923
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4884
02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:17.751
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4885
02:04:17.751 --> 02:04:18.440
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4886
02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4887
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:21.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's more than 10 for the gate though.</v>

4888
02:04:21.321 --> 02:04:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the gate?</v>

4889
02:04:22.530 --> 02:04:22.910
<v Speaker 2>It's usually,</v>

4890
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

4891
02:04:23.630 --> 02:04:26.930
<v Speaker 2>2030 40 bucks a ticket plus concessions and parking and all that extra.</v>

4892
02:04:26.931 --> 02:04:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4893
02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:32.100
<v Speaker 2>So 90,000 times 10 is only 900,000 but it's way more than 10 bucks a ticket.</v>

4894
02:04:32.691 --> 02:04:32.991
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4895
02:04:32.991 --> 02:04:33.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4896
02:04:33.171 --> 02:04:34.004
<v Speaker 2>Your boy,</v>

4897
02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:36.860
<v Speaker 2>which is a $9 million gate,</v>

4898
02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but then ring size,</v>

4899
02:04:38.011 --> 02:04:39.570
<v Speaker 2>probably way more than a hundred bucks.</v>

4900
02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Like ring,</v>

4901
02:04:40.230 --> 02:04:43.350
<v Speaker 2>ring side of the UFC could be as much as like 500 bucks,</v>

4902
02:04:43.351 --> 02:04:44.101
<v Speaker 2>maybe even more.</v>

4903
02:04:44.101 --> 02:04:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4904
02:04:44.490 --> 02:04:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh for sure.</v>

4905
02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Like a big boxing match.</v>

4906
02:04:46.441 --> 02:04:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>

4907
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:47.221
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4908
02:04:47.221 --> 02:04:48.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot of his like scalpers too,</v>

4909
02:04:48.841 --> 02:04:48.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4910
02:04:48.991 --> 02:04:49.824
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

4911
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Mgm I paid to which a joyous babe Bavis Hendrickson.</v>

4912
02:04:53.411 --> 02:04:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I paid $500 and I was,</v>

4913
02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:55.161
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4914
02:04:55.161 --> 02:04:56.250
<v Speaker 2>is that in the bleaches?</v>

4915
02:04:56.670 --> 02:04:57.010
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

4916
02:04:57.010 --> 02:04:59.130
<v Speaker 2>my mind knows actually bled.</v>

4917
02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:00.420
<v Speaker 2>That's how high up I was.</v>

4918
02:05:00.690 --> 02:05:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Who knows actually blood.</v>

4919
02:05:01.891 --> 02:05:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4920
02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling that was because you probably got punched in that fairly</v>

4921
02:05:05.461 --> 02:05:06.180
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

4922
02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:06.481
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

4923
02:05:06.481 --> 02:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>If my nose is up there,</v>

4924
02:05:07.621 --> 02:05:08.370
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't have black.</v>

4925
02:05:08.370 --> 02:05:09.990
<v Speaker 2>The oxygen levels are so low.</v>

4926
02:05:09.991 --> 02:05:10.640
<v Speaker 2>That A,</v>

4927
02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 2>is that a getting dizzy?</v>

4928
02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:13.620
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

4929
02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck gets a nose bleed on a mountain?</v>

4930
02:05:17.881 --> 02:05:18.714
<v Speaker 2>Is it shit real?</v>

4931
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:20.280
<v Speaker 2>You get nose bleeds when you go to a mountain.</v>

4932
02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4933
02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll get nosebleeds.</v>

4934
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>You get a nosebleed on a plane and I,</v>

4935
02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:25.473
<v Speaker 2>well it's</v>

4936
02:05:26.610 --> 02:05:27.770
<v Speaker 2>pressure cabin.</v>

4937
02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4938
02:05:28.330 --> 02:05:29.163
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

4939
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.530
<v Speaker 2>But I never heard of anybody getting a nose bleed in the nose when you jumped</v>

4940
02:05:33.531 --> 02:05:33.961
<v Speaker 2>out of a plane.</v>

4941
02:05:33.961 --> 02:05:34.794
<v Speaker 2>He didn't get nose bleeds.</v>

4942
02:05:34.890 --> 02:05:35.460
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

4943
02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:36.080
<v Speaker 2>When you pass your,</v>

4944
02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:36.913
<v Speaker 2>maybe you bro.</v>

4945
02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:38.613
<v Speaker 2>I'll me bro.</v>

4946
02:05:40.170 --> 02:05:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Well you didn't know me then man.</v>

4947
02:05:41.581 --> 02:05:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I would have hooked you up with better seats.</v>

4948
02:05:43.410 --> 02:05:44.340
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

4949
02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:45.690
<v Speaker 2>It's such an important fight.</v>

4950
02:05:45.691 --> 02:05:46.524
<v Speaker 2>You want to be close.</v>

4951
02:05:46.890 --> 02:05:49.130
<v Speaker 2>I think I told you last time the lady bought me my,</v>

4952
02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 2>my ticket for free to go and be part of the cause I wasn't going to go at all.</v>

4953
02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:54.040
<v Speaker 2>And then the lady bought my ticket,</v>

4954
02:05:54.650 --> 02:05:56.060
<v Speaker 2>but then I bought the ticket there.</v>

4955
02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Watch the fight say is.</v>

4956
02:05:57.010 --> 02:05:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4957
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.990
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

4958
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.321
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

4959
02:05:58.321 --> 02:05:58.591
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

4960
02:05:58.591 --> 02:05:59.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4961
02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:03.750
<v Speaker 2>fights are so interesting live because you get this energy from being there in</v>

4962
02:06:03.751 --> 02:06:06.840
<v Speaker 2>that arena that you can't reproduce it watching it at home.</v>

4963
02:06:06.841 --> 02:06:09.030
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think people that see it at home,</v>

4964
02:06:09.031 --> 02:06:12.420
<v Speaker 2>we'll ever truly know what it's like to see a live fight.</v>

4965
02:06:12.421 --> 02:06:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Because also there's something that gets like,</v>

4966
02:06:14.971 --> 02:06:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first time I went to see a boxing match,</v>

4967
02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking like,</v>

4968
02:06:18.090 --> 02:06:18.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4969
02:06:18.301 --> 02:06:19.230
<v Speaker 2>there's no commentary.</v>

4970
02:06:19.231 --> 02:06:20.064
<v Speaker 2>This is weird.</v>

4971
02:06:20.250 --> 02:06:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something that sterilizes it a little bit about hearing Jim Lampley</v>

4972
02:06:24.391 --> 02:06:25.170
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

4973
02:06:25.170 --> 02:06:28.590
<v Speaker 2>ABC wide world of sports or whatever the fuck it was back in the day when I was</v>

4974
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:29.880
<v Speaker 2>watching boxing.</v>

4975
02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 2>And then to go see a boxing match live,</v>

4976
02:06:31.861 --> 02:06:32.101
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

4977
02:06:32.101 --> 02:06:32.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4978
02:06:32.230 --> 02:06:33.240
<v Speaker 2>there's no one talking.</v>

4979
02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:33.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4980
02:06:33.871 --> 02:06:34.900
<v Speaker 2>you just hearing thump,</v>

4981
02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:35.230
<v Speaker 2>thump,</v>

4982
02:06:35.230 --> 02:06:35.490
<v Speaker 2>thump,</v>

4983
02:06:35.490 --> 02:06:36.120
<v Speaker 2>thump,</v>

4984
02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:36.631
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

4985
02:06:36.631 --> 02:06:36.841
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4986
02:06:36.841 --> 02:06:39.090
<v Speaker 2>you've seen someone like I was there when Mickey Bork,</v>

4987
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:39.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4988
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:40.703
<v Speaker 2>Mickey Rourke,</v>

4989
02:06:40.770 --> 02:06:41.341
<v Speaker 2>Mickey work,</v>

4990
02:06:41.341 --> 02:06:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Micky Ward rather confusing people.</v>

4991
02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Mickey a ward was coming up in Lowell,</v>

4992
02:06:46.711 --> 02:06:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts before we ever had those crazy fights.</v>

4993
02:06:49.501 --> 02:06:50.500
<v Speaker 2>A series of fights with a turtle.</v>

4994
02:06:50.501 --> 02:06:50.941
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

4995
02:06:50.941 --> 02:06:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

4996
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I saw him fight when he was a real young professional and we saw him fight a in</v>

4997
02:06:55.831 --> 02:06:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Lowell,</v>

4998
02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:59.310
<v Speaker 2>me and my buddy Jimmy lawless and went to see him fight live.</v>

4999
02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:01.980
<v Speaker 2>It was just like being there in,</v>

5000
02:07:02.010 --> 02:07:04.440
<v Speaker 2>in a small arena who,</v>

5001
02:07:04.441 --> 02:07:04.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5002
02:07:04.651 --> 02:07:09.651
<v Speaker 2>with a local hometown guy and see a local boxing match and hear the slap of</v>

5003
02:07:09.781 --> 02:07:11.850
<v Speaker 2>leather on faces and bodies.</v>

5004
02:07:11.851 --> 02:07:15.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a such a different experience than watching it on television,</v>

5005
02:07:15.121 --> 02:07:16.410
<v Speaker 2>which is like so much more.</v>

5006
02:07:16.411 --> 02:07:17.244

<v Speaker 1>Your measures in the skin so that you're nice and loose and when you're shadow</v>

5059
02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:19.571

5061
02:08:19.721 --> 02:08:20.770
<v Speaker 1>your body's on fire.</v>

5062
02:08:20.770 --> 02:08:22.210
<v Speaker 1>So you feel a,</v>

5063
02:08:22.230 --> 02:08:24.250
<v Speaker 1>instead of skipping for 10 minutes,</v>

5064
02:08:24.251 --> 02:08:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you put the tile and you rub it in and then you're already warm.</v>

5065
02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:28.570
<v Speaker 1>My friend has a doctor told me,</v>

5066
02:08:28.571 --> 02:08:29.171
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

5067
02:08:29.171 --> 02:08:30.280
<v Speaker 1>if that shit did anything,</v>

5068
02:08:30.281 --> 02:08:32.680
<v Speaker 1>it would get into your muscles itself and you'd be poisoned.</v>

5069
02:08:32.970 --> 02:08:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

5070
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.731
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

5071
02:08:33.731 --> 02:08:34.031
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

5072
02:08:34.031 --> 02:08:34.271
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5073
02:08:34.271 --> 02:08:34.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5074
02:08:34.481 --> 02:08:36.520
<v Speaker 1>It's called a topical analgesic and heat up.</v>

5075
02:08:36.521 --> 02:08:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Your skin doesn't do a damn thing.</v>

5076
02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5077
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:38.833
<v Speaker 1>If you really,</v>

5078
02:08:39.150 --> 02:08:39.561
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

5079
02:08:39.561 --> 02:08:41.380
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a light sweat and you put that stuff on,</v>

5080
02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:44.370
<v Speaker 1>you want a urine fire it,</v>

5081
02:08:44.430 --> 02:08:46.190
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try and put yourself under a hose.</v>

5082
02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>

5083
02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:48.950
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

5084
02:08:49.130 --> 02:08:52.430
<v Speaker 2>how can you put that stuff on your skin and then you're clenching and if you're</v>

5085
02:08:52.431 --> 02:08:52.881
<v Speaker 2>clenching,</v>

5086
02:08:52.881 --> 02:08:54.260
<v Speaker 2>that stuff can get in someone's eyes.</v>

5087
02:08:54.261 --> 02:08:55.094
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5088
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.823
<v Speaker 1>maybe</v>

5089
02:08:58.630 --> 02:08:59.470
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>

5090
02:08:59.950 --> 02:09:02.410
<v Speaker 1>but you massage it in 15 minutes before you walked.</v>

5091
02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5092
02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:05.960
<v Speaker 1>So if you're grabbing and you're fighting for the plum,</v>

5093
02:09:06.030 --> 02:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5094
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:06.541
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5095
02:09:06.541 --> 02:09:10.200
<v Speaker 1>And you've got that shit on your forearms and it's got a turning away and it</v>

5096
02:09:10.201 --> 02:09:12.030
<v Speaker 1>gets in his eyes is that happened to you?</v>

5097
02:09:12.210 --> 02:09:13.850
<v Speaker 1>But at the time you get onto the ring gear,</v>

5098
02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:15.213
<v Speaker 1>it's absorbed.</v>

5099
02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>So in all that,</v>

5100
02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:19.380
<v Speaker 1>that's why he can't use it in the UFC.</v>

5101
02:09:19.381 --> 02:09:20.370
<v Speaker 1>UFC in the early days,</v>

5102
02:09:20.371 --> 02:09:20.611
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5103
02:09:20.611 --> 02:09:20.881
<v Speaker 1>Dude's,</v>

5104
02:09:20.881 --> 02:09:25.590
<v Speaker 1>which is goals and we can put Vaseline 11 I buddies,</v>

5105
02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:26.370
<v Speaker 1>well between the,</v>

5106
02:09:26.370 --> 02:09:28.470
<v Speaker 1>the limit and the Vaseline all over say,</v>

5107
02:09:28.471 --> 02:09:28.651
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5108
02:09:28.651 --> 02:09:29.481
<v Speaker 1>you're come out and yeah,</v>

5109
02:09:29.481 --> 02:09:31.620
<v Speaker 1>and you're shining and you're glossy and yeah,</v>

5110
02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.540
<v Speaker 1>we catch in the kicks and can pull out of the catches.</v>

5111
02:09:34.541 --> 02:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing is if you're the last fight of the night,</v>

5112
02:09:38.311 --> 02:09:42.090
<v Speaker 1>say if you teach someone in the stomach and then you put your foot on the canvas</v>

5113
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:44.310
<v Speaker 1>and then if you get oil all the time,</v>

5114
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:44.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5115
02:09:44.530 --> 02:09:45.301
<v Speaker 1>the last fight,</v>

5116
02:09:45.301 --> 02:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>the canvas is just the ice skating rink.</v>

5117
02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:48.691
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

5118
02:09:48.691 --> 02:09:49.070
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

5119
02:09:49.070 --> 02:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>and if you've got logos on the canvas as well,</v>

5120
02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Vaseline and the stickers and then,</v>

5121
02:09:54.151 --> 02:09:54.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5122
02:09:54.451 --> 02:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5123
02:09:54.690 --> 02:09:55.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a complete nightmare.</v>

5124
02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:56.521
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a,</v>

5125
02:09:56.521 --> 02:09:59.930
<v Speaker 2>that was a nightmare in MMA for a while that they would have all these ads on</v>

5126
02:09:59.931 --> 02:10:03.350
<v Speaker 2>the octagon and they would spray these ads down with,</v>

5127
02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:03.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5128
02:10:03.710 --> 02:10:06.230
<v Speaker 2>spray paint essentially or like,</v>

5129
02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:06.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5130
02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:07.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5131
02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:08.360
<v Speaker 2>like an iron on.</v>

5132
02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:09.440
<v Speaker 2>And it would be,</v>

5133
02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:11.480
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't absorb like canvas,</v>

5134
02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:14.720
<v Speaker 2>like cam for people don't know canvas.</v>

5135
02:10:14.721 --> 02:10:15.501
<v Speaker 2>When you get it wet,</v>

5136
02:10:15.501 --> 02:10:17.180
<v Speaker 2>actually you get more traction.</v>

5137
02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:18.380
<v Speaker 2>It's actually kind of Nice,</v>

5138
02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:20.180
<v Speaker 2>which is why when you watch MMA fight,</v>

5139
02:10:20.181 --> 02:10:23.480
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you see guys pour water on the ground and then they'll move their feet</v>

5140
02:10:23.481 --> 02:10:26.210
<v Speaker 2>on the water because maybe their skin is dry and they want to get their skin</v>

5141
02:10:26.211 --> 02:10:27.170
<v Speaker 2>nice and moist.</v>

5142
02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:29.140
<v Speaker 2>And it actually gives you like a little traction.</v>

5143
02:10:29.150 --> 02:10:31.610
<v Speaker 2>A dry canvas sometimes can be slippery,</v>

5144
02:10:31.850 --> 02:10:33.140
<v Speaker 2>especially a fresh canvas.</v>

5145
02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5146
02:10:33.710 --> 02:10:36.530
<v Speaker 2>But those fucking logos of the worst,</v>

5147
02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:37.970
<v Speaker 2>especially those things are terrible.</v>

5148
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.550
<v Speaker 2>It's because in that painting on this,</v>

5149
02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 2>even if there stickers that vinyl,</v>

5150
02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:43.010
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't absorb any moisture.</v>

5151
02:10:43.130 --> 02:10:44.210
<v Speaker 2>So the moisture sits on.</v>

5152
02:10:44.211 --> 02:10:44.881
<v Speaker 2>If you step on it,</v>

5153
02:10:44.881 --> 02:10:46.910
<v Speaker 2>a whip and then you're scared to throwing kicks.</v>

5154
02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:48.020
<v Speaker 2>So for our kicker,</v>

5155
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:50.180
<v Speaker 2>who's doesn't want to go to the ground?</v>

5156
02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5157
02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:51.411
<v Speaker 2>it's a nightmare.</v>

5158
02:10:51.411 --> 02:10:52.011
<v Speaker 2>It's a mess.</v>

5159
02:10:52.011 --> 02:10:52.341
<v Speaker 2>Then you're,</v>

5160
02:10:52.341 --> 02:10:54.920
<v Speaker 2>you're one of your biggest weapons has been removed.</v>

5161
02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.490
<v Speaker 2>It's is good if you're got lazier because then you can watch one canvas.</v>

5162
02:10:58.491 --> 02:10:59.380
<v Speaker 2>And then what's your opponent?</v>

5163
02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:00.233
<v Speaker 2>The same.</v>

5164
02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.360
<v Speaker 2>He's joking.</v>

5165
02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.130
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that if you have a lazy eye.</v>

5166
02:11:04.131 --> 02:11:04.341
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5167
02:11:04.341 --> 02:11:05.420
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck do you have to pick?</v>

5168
02:11:05.421 --> 02:11:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Which I looked through did.</v>

5169
02:11:06.531 --> 02:11:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5170
02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a girlfriend,</v>

5171
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.750
<v Speaker 2>had a lazy boy.</v>

5172
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.901
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5173
02:11:08.901 --> 02:11:09.500
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>

5174
02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:09.591
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5175
02:11:09.591 --> 02:11:10.310
<v Speaker 2>jokes coming.</v>

5176
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I had to get rid of her because she was seeing other people.</v>

5177
02:11:15.410 --> 02:11:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I knew that joke.</v>

5178
02:11:16.461 --> 02:11:17.570
<v Speaker 2>He fucking got me with it.</v>

5179
02:11:17.571 --> 02:11:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

5180
02:11:17.890 --> 02:11:18.890
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a bitch.</v>

5181
02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:21.200
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

5182
02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:22.633
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

5183
02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:23.860
<v Speaker 2>I knew that one common,</v>

5184
02:11:24.110 --> 02:11:24.881
<v Speaker 2>I knew that joke,</v>

5185
02:11:24.881 --> 02:11:25.714
<v Speaker 2>but I knew a job.</v>

5186
02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:26.121
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

5187
02:11:26.121 --> 02:11:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I knew a joke was coming cause you had a,</v>

5188
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:32.600
<v Speaker 2>here's a joke coming up in your face and I heard that one but I forgot it.</v>

5189
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Fucking marijuana</v>

5190
02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:37.610
<v Speaker 2>long term memory got me.</v>

5191
02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:38.533
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

5192
02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I got to try and keep my brain in tech so I can try and be funny like you.</v>

5193
02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:45.250
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>

5194
02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Another thing on longevity in this sport.</v>

5195
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Well your brain's amazingly intact for 120 fights.</v>

5196
02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:50.770
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

5197
02:11:50.770 --> 02:11:51.680
<v Speaker 2>You've taught most people,</v>

5198
02:11:51.681 --> 02:11:53.270
<v Speaker 2>what's the guy going to be like 39 years old?</v>

5199
02:11:53.271 --> 02:11:54.360
<v Speaker 2>He was 120 fights off.</v>

5200
02:11:54.361 --> 02:11:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Fucking God can't even wipe his own ass.</v>

5201
02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:57.320
<v Speaker 2>You gotta hire people to do that.</v>

5202
02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5203
02:11:57.890 --> 02:11:58.723
<v Speaker 2>you're fine.</v>

5204
02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.530
<v Speaker 2>But what do you think that that is?</v>

5205
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:01.363
<v Speaker 2>Just a,</v>

5206
02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:04.700
<v Speaker 2>because of all that sparring as well,</v>

5207
02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:05.140
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

5208
02:12:05.140 --> 02:12:05.973
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

5209
02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:06.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5210
02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:09.350
<v Speaker 2>very technical what we call playing,</v>

5211
02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:12.740
<v Speaker 2>where he'd just tapping each other and not hard,</v>

5212
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:13.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5213
02:12:13.251 --> 02:12:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Ramon Decker,</v>

5214
02:12:14.151 --> 02:12:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Dutch style fighting in the gym every day.</v>

5215
02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:18.081
<v Speaker 2>But instead,</v>

5216
02:12:18.081 --> 02:12:19.650
<v Speaker 2>just so we're working on technique work,</v>

5217
02:12:19.970 --> 02:12:20.820
<v Speaker 2>well I'll put a different tech,</v>

5218
02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:21.770
<v Speaker 2>different um,</v>

5219
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:23.120
<v Speaker 2>theories with boxes.</v>

5220
02:12:23.121 --> 02:12:23.571
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

5221
02:12:23.571 --> 02:12:26.090
<v Speaker 2>boxes we'll spar for twice a week,</v>

5222
02:12:26.091 --> 02:12:28.280
<v Speaker 2>three times a week leading up to a fight for 10 weeks.</v>

5223
02:12:28.670 --> 02:12:33.410
<v Speaker 2>And then their brain damage is caused from the sparring and not actually fight,</v>

5224
02:12:33.411 --> 02:12:36.440
<v Speaker 2>but the actual preparation and then times that by a 30,</v>

5225
02:12:36.441 --> 02:12:36.951
<v Speaker 2>40 flights.</v>

5226
02:12:36.951 --> 02:12:37.071
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

5227
02:12:37.071 --> 02:12:39.170
<v Speaker 2>how many fighters have more than 40 fights in boxing?</v>

5228
02:12:39.550 --> 02:12:40.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5229
02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:42.430
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>

5230
02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I've been hit with a lot of hot shorts.</v>

5231
02:12:43.941 --> 02:12:44.070
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

5232
02:12:44.070 --> 02:12:46.970
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people say how come a normal person would be knocked out and you</v>

5233
02:12:46.971 --> 02:12:47.360
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

5234
02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's just just luck.</v>

5235
02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:51.410
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing but luck to you have a good chin.</v>

5236
02:12:51.650 --> 02:12:51.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5237
02:12:51.951 --> 02:12:52.860

5238
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:53.230

02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

02:12:56.630 --> 02:12:56.781

02:12:56.781 --> 02:12:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Good Chin is really for,</v>

5244
02:12:59.450 --> 02:13:00.283

02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:01.280
<v Speaker 2>cause my whack me.</v>

5246
02:13:01.281 --> 02:13:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

5247
02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:02.593
<v Speaker 2>He certainly,</v>

5248
02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:03.201
<v Speaker 2>he didn't miss,</v>

5249
02:13:03.201 --> 02:13:05.540
<v Speaker 2>he got me multiple times with the flying knee man.</v>

5250
02:13:05.570 --> 02:13:05.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5251
02:13:05.871 --> 02:13:08.330
<v Speaker 2>One flying knee was at the second round and he caught you with that.</v>

5252
02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5253
02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:10.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what round it was.</v>

5254
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Second or third round.</v>

5255
02:13:11.301 --> 02:13:11.361
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5256
02:13:11.361 --> 02:13:12.410
<v Speaker 2>he would have flying knee.</v>

5257
02:13:12.411 --> 02:13:13.930
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5258
02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:15.300
<v Speaker 2>never had you heard,</v>

5259
02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:16.340
<v Speaker 2>never had you down.</v>

5260
02:13:16.341 --> 02:13:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Never had you wobbly.</v>

5261
02:13:17.570 --> 02:13:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5262
02:13:18.370 --> 02:13:18.891
<v Speaker 2>cuts hurt.</v>

5263
02:13:18.891 --> 02:13:20.290
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time I knew there was no,</v>

5264
02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:23.300
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't one point in the flight where I thought all kind of go in and it's</v>

5265
02:13:23.301 --> 02:13:23.840
<v Speaker 2>like nine,</v>

5266
02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:24.140
<v Speaker 2>nine.</v>

5267
02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Every time he hit me hard,</v>

5268
02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:26.990
<v Speaker 2>it was more so I've got to get it back.</v>

5269
02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:29.050
<v Speaker 2>And there's a difference between the,</v>

5270
02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:31.950
<v Speaker 2>the phrase had you heard and hurt</v>

5271
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:33.143
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

5272
02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:34.830
<v Speaker 1>people listen to that.</v>

5273
02:13:34.831 --> 02:13:35.101
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

5274
02:13:35.101 --> 02:13:35.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5275
02:13:35.221 --> 02:13:36.360
<v Speaker 1>of course he got hurt.</v>

5276
02:13:36.361 --> 02:13:36.901
<v Speaker 1>He got hit.</v>

5277
02:13:36.901 --> 02:13:37.500
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

5278
02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you already said he had all these stitches.</v>

5279
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:42.150
<v Speaker 1>When someone says in the fighting world,</v>

5280
02:13:42.151 --> 02:13:45.300
<v Speaker 1>he was hurt and means his body is not functioning right.</v>

5281
02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:48.690
<v Speaker 1>You got whacked and all sudden you see your legs go rubber or you see a guy</v>

5282
02:13:48.691 --> 02:13:51.780
<v Speaker 1>cover up maybe to a liver shot and you realize he's hurt.</v>

5283
02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:52.973
<v Speaker 1>He's hurt,</v>

5284
02:13:53.310 --> 02:13:57.570
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a window near the point where I thought if I get hit one more time,</v>

5285
02:13:57.571 --> 02:13:58.111
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go down.</v>

5286
02:13:58.111 --> 02:14:01.170
<v Speaker 1>There is no point whatsoever during the flight that I was getting hit at the</v>

5287
02:14:01.171 --> 02:14:02.580
<v Speaker 1>same time I,</v>

5288
02:14:02.730 --> 02:14:04.830
<v Speaker 1>there was never a moment where I thought,</v>

5289
02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't not win this fight until that bill rent.</v>

5290
02:14:07.661 --> 02:14:08.011
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

5291
02:14:08.011 --> 02:14:08.251
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5292
02:14:08.251 --> 02:14:11.490

5438
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:21.670
<v Speaker 1>going to be madness.</v>

5444
02:17:31.361 --> 02:17:34.450
<v Speaker 1>And combining those two things together is very interesting.</v>

5445
02:17:34.451 --> 02:17:36.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're talking to the knuckle boxing as well.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5468
02:18:08.710 --> 02:18:10.180
<v Speaker 1>How many fights does he do like that?</v>

5469
02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:11.103
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5470
02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:11.530
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

5471
02:18:11.530 --> 02:18:13.000
<v Speaker 1>from his Facebook record that I,</v>

5472
02:18:13.001 --> 02:18:13.940
<v Speaker 1>that I shared when I,</v>

5473
02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:14.853
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>

5474
02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:16.960
<v Speaker 1>when the match first got made,</v>

5475
02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:17.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5476
02:18:17.650 --> 02:18:18.850
<v Speaker 1>he was like 70,</v>

5477
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:19.810
<v Speaker 1>with 50 wins,</v>

5478
02:18:19.811 --> 02:18:20.830
<v Speaker 1>47 knockouts.</v>

5479
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:23.590
<v Speaker 1>So Jesus,</v>

5480
02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I believe he said a few more fights in that he said,</v>

5481
02:18:26.261 --> 02:18:26.351
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5482
02:18:26.351 --> 02:18:29.170
<v Speaker 1>that's actually my older record album and it's actually a listener.</v>

5483
02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:32.010
<v Speaker 1>But when I got off his Facebook and then people go and what,</v>

5484
02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:33.040
<v Speaker 1>you're 39,</v>

5485
02:18:33.430 --> 02:18:33.911
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5486
02:18:33.911 --> 02:18:35.980
<v Speaker 1>you're not in your prime anymore.</v>

5487
02:18:35.981 --> 02:18:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Why would you fight someone so dangerous for us?</v>

5488
02:18:37.811 --> 02:18:42.811
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to give the Australian public in the fans flights that you're</v>

5489
02:18:42.821 --> 02:18:44.410
<v Speaker 1>going to not want to miss.</v>

5490
02:18:44.470 --> 02:18:46.750
<v Speaker 1>When people say that you know your prime no,</v>

5491
02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:48.940
<v Speaker 1>you still fight like you're in your prime.</v>

5492
02:18:48.970 --> 02:18:49.803
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a number.</v>

5493
02:18:49.930 --> 02:18:51.270
<v Speaker 1>You're not fighting like,</v>

5494
02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:51.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5495
02:18:51.510 --> 02:18:52.810
<v Speaker 1>like when I watched you fight,</v>

5496
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:54.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching you fight cosmo.</v>

5497
02:18:54.431 --> 02:18:59.431
<v Speaker 1>Who's a big strong guy and you're not fighting like a guy who was over the hill.</v>

5498
02:18:59.650 --> 02:19:04.330
<v Speaker 1>You're fighting like a cautious smart veteran who's facing a very dangerous fast</v>

5499
02:19:04.331 --> 02:19:06.520
<v Speaker 1>guy and you far very well.</v>

5500
02:19:06.550 --> 02:19:07.383
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

5501
02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:08.650
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like a fire like,</v>

5502
02:19:08.651 --> 02:19:09.131
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

5503
02:19:09.131 --> 02:19:10.390
<v Speaker 1>this guy's lost a step.</v>

5504
02:19:10.450 --> 02:19:11.650
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that man,</v>

5505
02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:12.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5506
02:19:12.221 --> 02:19:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

5507
02:19:12.450 --> 02:19:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm an honest dude.</v>

5508
02:19:13.331 --> 02:19:15.160
<v Speaker 1>If I see someone losing a step,</v>

5509
02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:17.890
<v Speaker 1>it makes me very concerned because that,</v>

5510
02:19:17.891 --> 02:19:20.350
<v Speaker 1>trying to pretend that that didn't happen.</v>

5511
02:19:20.351 --> 02:19:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It's super dangerous.</v>

5512
02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:22.481
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that with,</v>

5513
02:19:22.481 --> 02:19:26.650
<v Speaker 1>the only time that I feel old is when someone asks me because in the gym I feel</v>

5514
02:19:26.651 --> 02:19:27.740
<v Speaker 1>like I'm still 25,</v>

5515
02:19:27.741 --> 02:19:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but when someone says,</v>

5516
02:19:28.611 --> 02:19:29.080
<v Speaker 1>how are Ya?</v>

5517
02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:29.913
<v Speaker 1>And then when I leave,</v>

5518
02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:32.210
<v Speaker 1>when I hear the word lead my lips and I say 39,</v>

5519
02:19:32.211 --> 02:19:32.451

<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

5521
02:19:33.050 --> 02:19:35.930
<v Speaker 1>That's to attribute that to consistency or,</v>

5522
02:19:35.931 --> 02:19:36.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:02.571
<v Speaker 1>He's talking to him,</v>

5596
02:21:02.571 --> 02:21:03.470
<v Speaker 1>he's articulate.</v>

5597
02:21:03.471 --> 02:21:05.020
<v Speaker 1>He's a gentleman entrepreneur.</v>

5598
02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:05.490
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

5599
02:21:05.490 --> 02:21:05.631
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

5600
02:21:05.631 --> 02:21:06.361
<v Speaker 1>and he's not silly.</v>

5601
02:21:06.361 --> 02:21:06.861
<v Speaker 1>He is making,</v>

5602
02:21:06.861 --> 02:21:08.990
<v Speaker 1>he's making money from a different avenues.</v>

5603
02:21:08.991 --> 02:21:10.640
<v Speaker 1>So I saw him hitting the pounds the other day.</v>

5604
02:21:10.641 --> 02:21:15.420
<v Speaker 1>He was working out with Jay Glazer scenario war does the NFL for Fox and you</v>

5605
02:21:15.421 --> 02:21:15.530

5606
02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Jay was holding the pads form and Randy was hitting them and I was like,</v>

5607
02:21:18.141 --> 02:21:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what the fuck he's doing.</v>

5608
02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he sees fade orange.</v>

5609
02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:21.521
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Cause Shit,</v>

5614
02:21:26.271 --> 02:21:27.800
<v Speaker 1>he could probably make a shit load of money.</v>

5615
02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Even Shane Mosley,</v>

5616
02:21:28.911 --> 02:21:29.744
<v Speaker 1>Shane Mosley.</v>

5617
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5618
02:21:30.470 --> 02:21:32.330
<v Speaker 1>but Randy might still be under contract.</v>

5619
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>He might still have like some UFC contract thing going on and mom didn't,</v>

5620
02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Dana expelling from UFC where he's not allowed to enter the arena is anymore or</v>

5621
02:21:41.211 --> 02:21:42.044
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

5622
02:21:44.250 --> 02:21:45.083
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5623
02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:46.820
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

5624
02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I can do whatever the fuck you want if I'm wrong,</v>

5625
02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:49.170

02:21:54.290 --> 02:21:55.670
<v Speaker 1>You always get ringside seats.</v>

5630
02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:56.391

02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he did come back.</v>

5634
02:22:01.371 --> 02:22:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It would be weird because he's,</v>

5635
02:22:02.811 --> 02:22:06.920
<v Speaker 1>he's been off for a long time and the last time he fought I believe was in</v>

5636
02:22:06.921 --> 02:22:11.921
<v Speaker 1>Toronto at the Rogers arena and he got chumping front kicked in the face by Leo</v>

5637

<v Speaker 1>Machida knocked out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that was the famous tags Stephen's ago.</v>

5640
02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:21.120
<v Speaker 1>That was the first time that anyone has ever won by a friend kick to the face</v>

5641
02:22:21.121 --> 02:22:22.550
<v Speaker 1>since Steven Seagal and vented it.</v>

5642
02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:22.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5645
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:26.130

5646
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:27.870
<v Speaker 3>by a front kick to the face before.</v>

5647
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:29.783
<v Speaker 3>I apologize.</v>

5648
02:22:29.890 --> 02:22:30.723
<v Speaker 3>It was this,</v>

5649
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:31.980
<v Speaker 3>that was the Stephen as he goes.</v>

5650
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:35.460
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried a jumping front kick to the face in a Muay Thai fight?</v>

5651
02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Jumping Frankie?</v>

5652
02:22:36.390 --> 02:22:36.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5653
02:22:36.810 --> 02:22:37.290
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

5654
02:22:37.290 --> 02:22:38.100

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5656

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5657
02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I used to try and land one frank kick to the face every fight as like a,</v>

5658
02:22:42.451 --> 02:22:42.841
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:51.270

5676
02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:01.620
<v Speaker 3>her Thai name translated was the beautiful face.</v>

5677

02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:16.130
<v Speaker 3>John [inaudible] Nah,</v>

5685
02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:17.313
<v Speaker 3>Nah.</v>

5686
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:19.740
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] her thing was,</v>

5687
02:23:19.741 --> 02:23:22.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm so much better than beautiful front kick facer</v>

5688
02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:26.353
<v Speaker 3>and then uh,</v>

5689
02:23:26.430 --> 02:23:30.600
<v Speaker 3>she broke a couple of girls noses with them at the heel striking down those and</v>

5690
02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:30.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5691
02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.261
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5692
02:23:31.261 --> 02:23:31.561
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

5693
02:23:31.561 --> 02:23:31.980
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

5694
02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:32.730
<v Speaker 3>she was um,</v>

5695
02:23:32.730 --> 02:23:33.210
<v Speaker 3>she's awesome.</v>

5696
02:23:33.210 --> 02:23:34.940
<v Speaker 3>My wife's really amazing fighting.</v>

5697
02:23:35.410 --> 02:23:37.510
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because it ties,</v>

5698
02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:41.860
<v Speaker 2>use the teeth to the face almost like the flat part of the foot more and almost</v>

5699
02:23:41.861 --> 02:23:43.000
<v Speaker 2>like a push kick.</v>

5700
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5701
02:23:43.470 --> 02:23:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I like to push you back.</v>

5702
02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Very rarely would you see someone getting actually knocked out from it that you</v>

5703
02:23:47.631 --> 02:23:50.110
<v Speaker 2>can see the head gets snapped but you wouldn't see actually getting knocked out.</v>

5704
02:23:50.111 --> 02:23:53.280
<v Speaker 2>And so they don't throw it like a karate style front kick night,</v>

5705
02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:54.670
<v Speaker 2>like a say like a semi shot.</v>

5706
02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Always used to throw it to the body.</v>

5707
02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:57.420
<v Speaker 2>He would throw it like a,</v>

5708
02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:57.960
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

5709
02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:59.260
<v Speaker 2>a thrust Kik,</v>

5710
02:23:59.630 --> 02:24:00.910
<v Speaker 2>different style of kicking.</v>

5711
02:24:01.570 --> 02:24:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Why the tires never threw it like that?</v>

5712
02:24:03.701 --> 02:24:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously when you're watch Anderson versus [inaudible],</v>

5713
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:07.480
<v Speaker 2>it's the same kick.</v>

5714
02:24:07.481 --> 02:24:11.500
<v Speaker 2>It's just done with a slightly different style and it's very effective.</v>

5715
02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:11.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5716
02:24:11.891 --> 02:24:12.760
<v Speaker 2>it was weird.</v>

5717
02:24:12.761 --> 02:24:13.120
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

5718
02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:13.691
<v Speaker 2>it was nuts.</v>

5719
02:24:13.691 --> 02:24:17.640
<v Speaker 2>And then a foreman shaded a to replicate that same kick not long later on.</v>

5720
02:24:17.650 --> 02:24:19.270
<v Speaker 2>It was like damn these things.</v>

5721
02:24:19.450 --> 02:24:21.250
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty cool and never see it again.</v>

5722
02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean you see guys attempt it but there's not been a single knockout.</v>

5723
02:24:24.581 --> 02:24:27.970
<v Speaker 2>And Justin Buckholtz got a knockout I think in ring of fire.</v>

5724
02:24:28.210 --> 02:24:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where he fought,</v>

5725
02:24:29.230 --> 02:24:30.130
<v Speaker 2>which is um,</v>

5726
02:24:30.450 --> 02:24:31.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5727
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:32.040
<v Speaker 2>an organism.</v>

5728
02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Sven beans organization in Colorado.</v>

5729
02:24:34.601 --> 02:24:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where Justin,</v>

5730
02:24:35.890 --> 02:24:36.990
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the um,</v>

5731
02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:38.073
<v Speaker 2>Alpha Male,</v>

5732
02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5733
02:24:38.650 --> 02:24:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Uriah Faber's camp,</v>

5734
02:24:39.761 --> 02:24:41.080
<v Speaker 2>one of the trainers there and one of the fighters.</v>

5735
02:24:41.230 --> 02:24:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I can really think he's a fight this weekend.</v>

5736
02:24:42.881 --> 02:24:43.900
<v Speaker 2>He might have fun this weekend.</v>

5737
02:24:44.430 --> 02:24:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5738
02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:49.630
<v Speaker 2>but you very rarely see guys knock guys out with it these days.</v>

5739
02:24:49.631 --> 02:24:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Like it was those two fights.</v>

5740
02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Justin's fight and I can't remember a,</v>

5741
02:24:54.341 --> 02:24:56.290
<v Speaker 2>another knockout since in the UFC.</v>

5742
02:24:56.291 --> 02:24:57.124
<v Speaker 2>People try it,</v>

5743
02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.080
<v Speaker 2>but it hasn't been a,</v>

5744
02:24:59.490 --> 02:25:00.460
<v Speaker 2>it been utilized,</v>

5745
02:25:00.461 --> 02:25:01.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5746
02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:01.953
<v Speaker 2>as effectively.</v>

5747
02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:02.860
<v Speaker 2>What do you got there for me?</v>

5748
02:25:03.610 --> 02:25:04.290

<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5757
02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:12.791
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

5758
02:25:12.791 --> 02:25:16.020
<v Speaker 2>That thing that they always do and when people throw kicks in,</v>

5759
02:25:16.021 --> 02:25:17.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Australia.</v>

5760
02:25:18.670 --> 02:25:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Well at a high five to the face with your foot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:23.860
<v Speaker 3>That's a little awkward.</v>

5764
02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Trying to make something a little more eloquent.</v>

5765
02:25:26.930 --> 02:25:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Come up with a better name.</v>

5766
02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Monster must like that though.</v>

5767
02:25:29.350 --> 02:25:31.510
<v Speaker 2>You go highlighted the m on your shorts.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

5769
02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:34.450
<v Speaker 2>That's a perfect picture for the wall.</v>

<v Speaker 2>for the photo shoot to let me execute the,</v>

5775
02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Frankie did that one very nice about what a gentleman he is.</v>

5776
02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:48.880
<v Speaker 2>What a gentlemen Instagram later on.</v>

5777
02:25:48.881 --> 02:25:49.720
<v Speaker 2>So everyone in get out.</v>

5778
02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:51.470
<v Speaker 2>So your fight for Cage Moy,</v>

5779
02:25:51.471 --> 02:25:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Tai,</v>

5780
02:25:52.170 --> 02:25:52.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5781
02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:56.450
<v Speaker 2>you guys are using the small gloves and using the mortar gloss.</v>

5782
02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

5783
02:25:56.730 --> 02:26:01.730
<v Speaker 2>are you the only organization that has a full striking with more with Moitai</v>

5784
02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:04.270
<v Speaker 2>rules but with a MMA gloves?</v>

5785
02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:05.051
<v Speaker 2>I believe so.</v>

5786
02:26:05.051 --> 02:26:05.950
<v Speaker 2>And then a gentleman,</v>

5787
02:26:06.010 --> 02:26:06.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5788
02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Martin Hogben,</v>

5789
02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:09.370
<v Speaker 2>a Hogan Hogan in,</v>

5790
02:26:09.371 --> 02:26:09.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5791
02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:10.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5792
02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:10.610
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>

5793
02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:11.090
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

5794
02:26:11.090 --> 02:26:13.300
<v Speaker 2>he's seen my promotion.</v>

5795
02:26:13.301 --> 02:26:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Then he started it as well.</v>

5796
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:17.830
<v Speaker 2>And then he's had done three shows so far in Ireland and his last show,</v>

5797
02:26:18.250 --> 02:26:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Conor McGregor.</v>

5798
02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:21.130
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5799
02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:22.870
<v Speaker 2>what's the other gentleman from Iceland that,</v>

5800
02:26:23.340 --> 02:26:23.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5801
02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:24.791
<v Speaker 2>that flight's going to?</v>

5802
02:26:24.791 --> 02:26:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Nelson,</v>

5803
02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Ghana,</v>

5804
02:26:25.630 --> 02:26:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Ghana was there as well.</v>

5805
02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Nobody in the crowd.</v>

5806
02:26:27.730 --> 02:26:30.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think that both blown away by the,</v>

5807
02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:34.060
<v Speaker 2>the adrenaline of the cage because it's so exciting and it's so fast and there's</v>

5808
02:26:34.061 --> 02:26:36.760
<v Speaker 2>no ground and then there's no action on the fence.</v>

5809
02:26:36.810 --> 02:26:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm within five seconds.</v>

5810
02:26:37.961 --> 02:26:38.591
<v Speaker 2>It's broken up.</v>

5811
02:26:38.591 --> 02:26:40.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's just continuous violence.</v>

5812
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:44.290
<v Speaker 2>So do you like the breaking it up though with the clench?</v>

5813
02:26:44.291 --> 02:26:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Because in my tie,</v>

5814
02:26:45.401 --> 02:26:45.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5815
02:26:45.791 --> 02:26:47.320
<v Speaker 2>in real Moitai they don't break it up.</v>

5816
02:26:47.370 --> 02:26:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5817
02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:48.610
<v Speaker 2>if there's an election,</v>

5818
02:26:48.670 --> 02:26:52.030
<v Speaker 2>so if you're throwing knees and it becomes a stalemate within two or three</v>

5819
02:26:52.031 --> 02:26:52.421
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>

5820
02:26:52.421 --> 02:26:54.490
<v Speaker 2>if there's no action that they break it straight away.</v>

5821
02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if there's no actual or is in a MMA,</v>

5822
02:26:56.981 --> 02:26:59.950
<v Speaker 2>you can press something and gets the free hold onto them and hold,</v>

5823
02:26:59.951 --> 02:27:00.221
<v Speaker 2>hold,</v>

5824
02:27:00.221 --> 02:27:00.490
<v Speaker 2>hold.</v>

5825
02:27:00.490 --> 02:27:00.830
<v Speaker 2>On.</v>

5826
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:01.341
<v Speaker 2>The UFC,</v>

5827
02:27:01.341 --> 02:27:04.750
<v Speaker 2>they usually will stop it and the separate eventually.</v>

5828
02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I honestly believe that especially in MMA since grappling such an integral part</v>

5829
02:27:09.821 --> 02:27:10.870
<v Speaker 2>of mixed martial arts,</v>

5830
02:27:10.871 --> 02:27:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should ever break things up.</v>

5831
02:27:12.910 --> 02:27:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I think if a guy's got you down and he's just holding you down,</v>

5832
02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:16.900
<v Speaker 2>that's tough shit.</v>

5833
02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:18.070
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure out how to get up.</v>

5834
02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:20.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it should score very well for the guy on top,</v>

5835
02:27:20.891 --> 02:27:21.701
<v Speaker 2>but I really don't.</v>

5836
02:27:21.701 --> 02:27:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in stand ups cause I feel like especially for a striker,</v>

5837
02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:26.680
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5838
02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:30.010
<v Speaker 2>you have five minutes and every round starts standing up.</v>

5839
02:27:30.190 --> 02:27:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Everyone starts with your advantage.</v>

5840
02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:33.910
<v Speaker 2>No round starts on the ground.</v>

5841
02:27:34.090 --> 02:27:36.520
<v Speaker 2>You'd never start where like okay this round John,</v>

5842
02:27:36.521 --> 02:27:37.360
<v Speaker 2>you're on top.</v>

5843
02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:39.040
<v Speaker 2>You know you started on top cause he was like,</v>

5844
02:27:39.041 --> 02:27:39.251
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5845
02:27:39.251 --> 02:27:43.050
<v Speaker 2>But every round starts standing up and that's the advantage of the striker.</v>

5846
02:27:43.050 --> 02:27:43.280
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

5847
02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:45.160
<v Speaker 2>the grappler has to figure out how to get ahold of them,</v>

5848
02:27:45.161 --> 02:27:45.994
<v Speaker 2>how to get them to the ground.</v>

5849
02:27:46.210 --> 02:27:47.380
<v Speaker 2>I think once you've done that,</v>

5850
02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:49.270
<v Speaker 2>it's the guy on the grounds business.</v>

5851
02:27:49.271 --> 02:27:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Try to get back up.</v>

5852
02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:52.120
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking boring.</v>

5853
02:27:52.121 --> 02:27:52.870
<v Speaker 2>You're good.</v>

5854
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:53.291
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>

5855
02:27:53.291 --> 02:27:54.280
<v Speaker 2>we're fucking guys,</v>

5856
02:27:54.281 --> 02:27:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

5857
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying there's only five minutes.</v>

5858
02:27:57.460 --> 02:27:57.881
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5859
02:27:57.881 --> 02:27:58.930
<v Speaker 2>and for grappling,</v>

5860
02:27:59.110 --> 02:28:00.310
<v Speaker 2>five minutes is not that long.</v>

5861
02:28:00.530 --> 02:28:00.800
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

5862
02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:01.300
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

5863
02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:01.991
<v Speaker 2>if he say,</v>

5864
02:28:01.991 --> 02:28:06.310
<v Speaker 2>if you were grappling with another guy who was also at your level in grappling</v>

5865
02:28:06.610 --> 02:28:09.340
<v Speaker 2>and you guys were tangling for five minutes,</v>

5866
02:28:09.970 --> 02:28:14.170
<v Speaker 2>if you're both at the same level is going to be a lot of stalemates and it takes</v>

5867
02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:19.230
<v Speaker 2>little incremental improvements and advances for you to get to a position where</v>

5868
02:28:19.751 --> 02:28:21.950
<v Speaker 2>you finally get to a mount or you finally get an Armbar,</v>

5869
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:22.910
<v Speaker 2>you finally get a choke.</v>

5870
02:28:23.390 --> 02:28:27.080
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to do and you can't do it if you keep standing people up when they</v>

5871
02:28:27.081 --> 02:28:27.914
<v Speaker 2>stale mate,</v>

5872
02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:30.530
<v Speaker 2>because that's stalemates apart of grappling.</v>

5873
02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:34.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's your job to figure out if you're on the bottom,</v>

5874
02:28:34.610 --> 02:28:36.470
<v Speaker 2>how to get up or how to submit him from your back.</v>

5875
02:28:36.650 --> 02:28:40.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the guy's job on the top to hold you down and to figure out how to get you</v>

5876
02:28:40.491 --> 02:28:43.340
<v Speaker 2>in a better position and to dominate you and to figure out how to submit you.</v>

5877
02:28:43.650 --> 02:28:45.350
<v Speaker 2>But son of time,</v>

5878
02:28:45.470 --> 02:28:46.820
<v Speaker 2>five minutes is not enough time.</v>

5879
02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5880
02:28:47.730 --> 02:28:50.870
<v Speaker 2>The same with the pressed against the fence when sometimes then they stuck there</v>

5881
02:28:50.871 --> 02:28:53.600
<v Speaker 2>for for more than two minutes.</v>

5882
02:28:53.890 --> 02:28:56.600
<v Speaker 2>And when the guys get impatient than they make mistakes.</v>

5883
02:28:56.900 --> 02:28:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Like if a guy's pressing you up against the cage and he's knee and your legs and</v>

5884
02:28:59.871 --> 02:29:00.411
<v Speaker 2>he's hitting,</v>

5885
02:29:00.411 --> 02:29:03.530
<v Speaker 2>he was short elbows and you're just waiting for the referees to separate.</v>

5886
02:29:03.531 --> 02:29:04.820
<v Speaker 2>If the referee doesn't separate,</v>

5887
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:07.280
<v Speaker 2>you might do something silly,</v>

5888
02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:08.600
<v Speaker 2>you might make a mistake,</v>

5889
02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:09.050
<v Speaker 2>you might.</v>

5890
02:29:09.050 --> 02:29:09.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they're trying to do.</v>

5891
02:29:09.951 --> 02:29:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Like Randy coture was the master at that,</v>

5892
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:13.760
<v Speaker 2>at a holding guys up against the cage,</v>

5893
02:29:13.761 --> 02:29:15.020
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't get it.</v>

5894
02:29:15.050 --> 02:29:17.780
<v Speaker 2>They didn't separate him very often because he was constantly moving.</v>

5895
02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:19.160
<v Speaker 2>He'd be constantly punching.</v>

5896
02:29:19.161 --> 02:29:21.500
<v Speaker 2>You constantly need your body needing your legs.</v>

5897
02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:25.100
<v Speaker 2>He was working you and he was pushing on you and wearing you out.</v>

5898
02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:28.430
<v Speaker 2>That was a big part of his strategy and I just feel like,</v>

5899
02:29:28.431 --> 02:29:29.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5900
02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:34.080
<v Speaker 2>you know with MMA they're trying really hard to make it more fan friendly and</v>

5901
02:29:34.401 --> 02:29:38.150
<v Speaker 2>they're trying really hard to make the action like more exciting to watch.</v>

5902
02:29:38.151 --> 02:29:42.560
<v Speaker 2>But I think in doing so your water down the art a little bit and there's an art</v>

5903
02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:46.740
<v Speaker 2>with two guys trying to figure out what to do to each other to,</v>

5904
02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:50.090
<v Speaker 2>to defend and to attack and figure out who can win.</v>

5905
02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:51.043
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

5906
02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:51.591
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

5907
02:29:51.591 --> 02:29:52.550
<v Speaker 2>that's just my feeling.</v>

5908
02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:55.250
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you're going to have pure stand up,</v>

5909
02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:56.780
<v Speaker 2>just pure stand up striking,</v>

5910
02:29:57.170 --> 02:29:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're doing is the best way to do it.</v>

5911
02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I think small gloves and I think doing it in a cage and where,</v>

5912
02:30:04.491 --> 02:30:04.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5913
02:30:04.731 --> 02:30:06.440
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to worry about guys falling through the ropes.</v>

5914
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Like I've seen that in a lot of events,</v>

5915
02:30:08.631 --> 02:30:11.780
<v Speaker 2>especially when guys start clenching and they get up against the rope and maybe</v>

5916
02:30:11.781 --> 02:30:13.640
<v Speaker 2>their buck goes through like two ropes.</v>

5917
02:30:13.690 --> 02:30:17.270
<v Speaker 2>They slid back or maybe the duck and away from a punch and they wind up falling</v>

5918
02:30:17.271 --> 02:30:17.960
<v Speaker 2>out of the ropes.</v>

5919
02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:18.980
<v Speaker 2>It happens too much.</v>

5920
02:30:19.020 --> 02:30:19.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5921
02:30:19.201 --> 02:30:20.630
<v Speaker 3>I've seen 'em how's it a,</v>

5922
02:30:20.631 --> 02:30:21.350
<v Speaker 3>a local,</v>

5923
02:30:21.350 --> 02:30:21.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5924
02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:23.520
<v Speaker 3>my two I show in the ring and the head,</v>

5925
02:30:23.521 --> 02:30:23.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5926
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:26.490
<v Speaker 3>two gentlemen Clinton away and the other guys,</v>

5927
02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:27.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5928
02:30:27.050 --> 02:30:28.500
<v Speaker 3>the full on straight through the center.</v>

5929
02:30:29.010 --> 02:30:33.930
<v Speaker 3>And then they had the judges' table right beside the ring and they had all the</v>

5930
02:30:33.931 --> 02:30:38.760
<v Speaker 3>trophies lined up and it was those trophies where the angel was on top of the</v>

5931
02:30:38.761 --> 02:30:40.440
<v Speaker 3>trophy with the hands clasped together.</v>

5932
02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:41.431
<v Speaker 3>And it was a,</v>

5933
02:30:41.431 --> 02:30:41.791
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

5934
02:30:41.791 --> 02:30:42.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5935
02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:47.120
<v Speaker 3>like raises and the guy's head miss the trophy by,</v>

5936
02:30:48.090 --> 02:30:50.340
<v Speaker 3>by inches and it flopped onto the desk.</v>

5937
02:30:50.341 --> 02:30:52.530
<v Speaker 3>And if it had been a little bit to the left,</v>

5938
02:30:52.531 --> 02:30:54.570
<v Speaker 3>he would add piece straight threes.</v>

5939
02:30:54.571 --> 02:30:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I would have been detrimental for fuck would they have sharp objects right next</v>

5940
02:30:59.491 --> 02:31:00.070
<v Speaker 3>to the rings.</v>

5941
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Hey guys are throwing each other around town would have been horrific.</v>

5942
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:04.520
<v Speaker 3>It was definitely seeking say,</v>

5943
02:31:04.530 --> 02:31:04.770
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5944
02:31:04.770 --> 02:31:07.560
<v Speaker 3>always made sure with Ashley's now I trophies or under the table,</v>

5945
02:31:07.561 --> 02:31:08.730
<v Speaker 3>but that was a learning curve.</v>

5946
02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Bernard Hopkins,</v>

5947
02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:11.150
<v Speaker 3>well known,</v>

5948
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.850
<v Speaker 3>he didn't fall,</v>

5949
02:31:11.850 --> 02:31:12.630
<v Speaker 3>he didn't fall,</v>

5950
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:14.610
<v Speaker 3>he fell and broke my shoulder.</v>

5951
02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5952
02:31:15.630 --> 02:31:16.890
<v Speaker 3>but within the cage,</v>

5953
02:31:16.920 --> 02:31:17.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5954
02:31:17.370 --> 02:31:18.570
<v Speaker 3>from a personal experience,</v>

5955
02:31:18.571 --> 02:31:20.360
<v Speaker 3>I've had a and s</v>

5956
02:31:20.610 --> 02:31:21.301
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

5957
02:31:21.301 --> 02:31:22.530
<v Speaker 1>19 fights in the ring,</v>

5958
02:31:22.700 --> 02:31:24.330
<v Speaker 1>but to be locked in that cage,</v>

5959
02:31:24.331 --> 02:31:25.530
<v Speaker 1>it as a,</v>

5960
02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:26.640
<v Speaker 1>not as a spectator,</v>

5961
02:31:26.641 --> 02:31:27.510
<v Speaker 1>but as a fighter,</v>

5962
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:31.100
<v Speaker 1>it's such a different atmosphere in a different arena.</v>

5963
02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5964
02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:34.230
<v Speaker 1>it definitely brings out a completely different beast.</v>

5965
02:31:34.231 --> 02:31:35.610
<v Speaker 1>And then when you know your opponents were,</v>

5966
02:31:35.611 --> 02:31:36.444
<v Speaker 1>and those little gloves,</v>

5967
02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:37.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5968
02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:37.891
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5969
02:31:37.891 --> 02:31:42.130
<v Speaker 1>every single sensor in your bodies is tingling because you know,</v>

5970
02:31:42.131 --> 02:31:46.680
<v Speaker 1>if you make a mistake you're going to be completely dominated or wiped out or</v>

5971
02:31:47.010 --> 02:31:47.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5972
02:31:47.650 --> 02:31:51.780
<v Speaker 1>not the end knocked unconscious or it's about bare knuckle ban a whole,</v>

5973
02:31:51.781 --> 02:31:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I haven't tried it in um,</v>

5974
02:31:54.380 --> 02:31:55.770
<v Speaker 1>sounds very painful.</v>

5975
02:31:56.820 --> 02:31:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And then cause my hands too,</v>

5976
02:31:58.411 --> 02:32:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of smacking someone in the forehead with being a who wouldn't</v>

5977
02:32:01.771 --> 02:32:03.960
<v Speaker 1>be healthy for my longevity.</v>

5978
02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:07.890
<v Speaker 1>So I like the idea with having him reps and having the small gloves and having</v>

5979
02:32:07.891 --> 02:32:09.080
<v Speaker 1>the quick cause with my mom,</v>

5980
02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:10.110
<v Speaker 1>a CMC gloves,</v>

5981
02:32:10.380 --> 02:32:10.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5982
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:11.640
<v Speaker 1>it's half,</v>

5983
02:32:11.640 --> 02:32:11.881
<v Speaker 1>half padding,</v>

5984
02:32:11.881 --> 02:32:12.714
<v Speaker 1>half Joe,</v>

5985
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:13.411
<v Speaker 1>so it's in,</v>

5986
02:32:13.411 --> 02:32:15.150
<v Speaker 1>it's almost a six ounce instead of a four.</v>

5987
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:17.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like a complete them,</v>

5988
02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:19.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's still fingerless you design them.</v>

5989
02:32:19.810 --> 02:32:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I had them talked with a company in Australia.</v>

5990
02:32:22.351 --> 02:32:25.710
<v Speaker 1>They helped design it and make them pick up because I work as a promoter.</v>

5991
02:32:25.890 --> 02:32:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to have someone dying on my show.</v>

5992
02:32:28.110 --> 02:32:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So I made a,</v>

5993
02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I made it a thicker padding because there's no taking down.</v>

5994
02:32:32.761 --> 02:32:33.594
<v Speaker 1>There's no holding.</v>

5995
02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:37.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just a complete trauma for four or five rounds.</v>

5996
02:32:37.890 --> 02:32:38.231
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5997
02:32:38.231 --> 02:32:38.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5998
02:32:38.580 --> 02:32:39.840
<v Speaker 1>well the argument is,</v>

5999
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean I see what your point is,</v>

6000
02:32:41.761 --> 02:32:42.870
<v Speaker 1>but the argument is that,</v>

6001
02:32:43.220 --> 02:32:43.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6002
02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:46.050
<v Speaker 1>you're saying you wouldn't want to break your hands on someone's forehead.</v>

6003
02:32:46.051 --> 02:32:50.820
<v Speaker 1>The argument is that you could throw it Shin kick with full power.</v>

6004
02:32:50.821 --> 02:32:51.541
<v Speaker 1>So Shin,</v>

6005
02:32:51.541 --> 02:32:54.090
<v Speaker 1>which is much more powerful than a punch Shin to the head,</v>

6006
02:32:54.091 --> 02:32:55.110
<v Speaker 1>right knee to the head,</v>

6007
02:32:55.170 --> 02:32:56.010
<v Speaker 1>elbows to the head.</v>

6008
02:32:56.040 --> 02:32:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6009
02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Why do you allow someone to tape up their wrist and form an unnatural bond?</v>

6010
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.921
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6011
02:33:01.921 --> 02:33:05.760
<v Speaker 1>And then tape up their hands and make it nice and hard so he can punch full</v>

6012
02:33:05.761 --> 02:33:06.594
<v Speaker 1>blast.</v>

6013
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the reality is the hands should be used judiciously because there's not</v>

6014
02:33:12.061 --> 02:33:13.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of room for error.</v>

6015
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:16.320
<v Speaker 1>If you do make a mistake and you punched full blast and you hit someone in an</v>

6016
02:33:16.321 --> 02:33:16.860
<v Speaker 1>elbow,</v>

6017
02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:19.080
<v Speaker 1>they cover up like that and your knuckle slamming in the elbow,</v>

6018
02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:20.250
<v Speaker 1>you might shatter your hand.</v>

6019
02:33:20.330 --> 02:33:22.020
<v Speaker 1>You might shatter your hand on their forehead,</v>

6020
02:33:22.170 --> 02:33:25.800
<v Speaker 1>you might shatter your in your hand a lot of different ways and you have to be</v>

6021
02:33:25.801 --> 02:33:30.600
<v Speaker 1>way more clean with your strikes and it makes it more realistic and they think a</v>

6022
02:33:30.601 --> 02:33:33.990
<v Speaker 1>lot of people think that that would actually alleviate a lot of the brain</v>

6023
02:33:33.991 --> 02:33:34.824
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>

6024
02:33:35.550 --> 02:33:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6025
02:33:36.210 --> 02:33:37.043
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

6026
02:33:37.350 --> 02:33:38.190
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of that?</v>

6027
02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

6028
02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:38.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6029
02:33:38.911 --> 02:33:40.830
<v Speaker 1>just the way my hands are always sorta.</v>

6030
02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I've had a little bit of difficulties in the past with them,</v>

6031
02:33:43.171 --> 02:33:43.980
<v Speaker 1>so that's nice.</v>

6032
02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:44.813
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

6033
02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It's reassuring.</v>

6034
02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:47.490
<v Speaker 1>When I had the hammer it was on that,</v>

6035
02:33:47.491 --> 02:33:48.720
<v Speaker 1>that's keeping my wrist into a,</v>

6036
02:33:48.721 --> 02:33:50.580
<v Speaker 1>a noise from a place.</v>

6037
02:33:50.610 --> 02:33:51.061
<v Speaker 1>So when I,</v>

6038
02:33:51.061 --> 02:33:53.520
<v Speaker 1>when I punch wrong that I'm just not going to break my hand.</v>

6039
02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:54.031
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6040
02:33:54.031 --> 02:33:56.370
<v Speaker 1>But it just having that cushioning at the top of the knuckles because the</v>

6041
02:33:56.371 --> 02:33:58.050
<v Speaker 1>knuckles are so sensitive that,</v>

6042
02:33:58.051 --> 02:33:58.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6043
02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I've broken them before so,</v>

6044
02:34:00.590 --> 02:34:01.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6045
02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:01.770
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

6046
02:34:01.770 --> 02:34:02.603
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

6047
02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:04.900
<v Speaker 1>and I know why my hands are wrapped properly,</v>

6048
02:34:04.901 --> 02:34:07.680
<v Speaker 1>then I can hit it with full force and not have any repercussions.</v>

6049
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Does that argument make sense to you?</v>

6050
02:34:09.121 --> 02:34:09.601
<v Speaker 1>That it does?</v>

6051
02:34:09.601 --> 02:34:09.961
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

6052
02:34:09.961 --> 02:34:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but I think it'd be more open hearted.</v>

6053
02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Open hand slaps us Rutan and that time Chris,</v>

6054
02:34:15.930 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 1>yes he stole was pretty</v>

6055
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:18.993
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

6056
02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:19.490
<v Speaker 3>The Ida,</v>

6057
02:34:19.490 --> 02:34:20.261
<v Speaker 3>the you definitely,</v>

6058
02:34:20.261 --> 02:34:21.400
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't want to punch with their clothes.</v>

6059
02:34:21.401 --> 02:34:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Fishy.</v>

6060
02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Definitely be one of the arm to the body.</v>

6061
02:34:23.591 --> 02:34:28.591
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you would right hire five someone's face with your palm and then you have</v>

6062
02:34:28.661 --> 02:34:32.080
<v Speaker 3>a lot of high pokes and so that's a real issue with MMA.</v>

6063
02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6064
02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Even when cmts had haven't few punches will.</v>

6065
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:36.880
<v Speaker 3>So yeah man,</v>

6066
02:34:36.881 --> 02:34:40.630
<v Speaker 3>I wish they figured something out to fix that drives me nicely.</v>

6067
02:34:40.750 --> 02:34:41.111
<v Speaker 3>Danger.</v>

6068
02:34:41.111 --> 02:34:43.150
<v Speaker 3>What I'm doing with the CMT gloves is a,</v>

6069
02:34:43.151 --> 02:34:45.160
<v Speaker 3>with the fingerless because they had a lot of people were saying,</v>

6070
02:34:45.161 --> 02:34:46.540
<v Speaker 3>well why are you doing it?</v>

6071
02:34:46.541 --> 02:34:48.640
<v Speaker 3>There's so many problems with the UFC and the police.</v>

6072
02:34:48.641 --> 02:34:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Where do you want to bring that same element into the what you're doing with the</v>

6073
02:34:51.131 --> 02:34:51.850
<v Speaker 3>cage,</v>

6074
02:34:51.850 --> 02:34:55.120
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time if you wear boxing gloves in the in the cage,</v>

6075
02:34:55.121 --> 02:34:55.840
<v Speaker 3>it just looks,</v>

6076
02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:57.190
<v Speaker 3>looks so dumb.</v>

6077
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:58.023
<v Speaker 3>It looks,</v>

6078
02:34:58.290 --> 02:35:02.680
<v Speaker 3>it does because you had your spent every single weekend watching UFC and then</v>

6079
02:35:02.681 --> 02:35:05.700
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to get the same respect from the MMA fans for what you're doing</v>

6080
02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:10.660
<v Speaker 3>and what we're in the w with Kate most high rules and you've got these big</v>

6081
02:35:10.661 --> 02:35:13.030
<v Speaker 3>pillows on yet the UFC guys were in the thing,</v>

6082
02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:16.840
<v Speaker 3>those ones or is it possible that you could do something that's not fingerless</v>

6083
02:35:16.841 --> 02:35:19.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's also very light that it looks like a bad glove?</v>

6084
02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:20.673
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6085
02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:21.593
<v Speaker 3>it's the visual.</v>

6086
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the visual that cells and and uh,</v>

6087
02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:25.840
<v Speaker 3>as a fighter as well.</v>

6088
02:35:25.841 --> 02:35:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I know when I put them on I feel like I'm a warrior.</v>

6089
02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:32.140
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing to try and explain,</v>

6090
02:35:32.141 --> 02:35:32.741
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

6091
02:35:32.741 --> 02:35:33.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6092
02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:34.830
<v Speaker 3>I know that when I close my fist and I,</v>

6093
02:35:34.831 --> 02:35:35.770
<v Speaker 3>and then when I clench,</v>

6094
02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:37.500
<v Speaker 3>I know that I have my fingers and I can catch the,</v>

6095
02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:40.960
<v Speaker 3>the kicks a lot it and manipulate the guard so I can throw elbows easier as</v>

6096
02:35:40.961 --> 02:35:41.740
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

6097
02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:42.760
<v Speaker 3>So it's um,</v>

6098
02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:45.070
<v Speaker 3>you also read a different element of finding.</v>

6099
02:35:45.071 --> 02:35:45.251
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

6100
02:35:45.251 --> 02:35:46.240
<v Speaker 3>I've had so many fights,</v>

6101
02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:49.900
<v Speaker 3>gloves and then you put these little things on and then the bell rings and then</v>

6102
02:35:49.901 --> 02:35:50.530
<v Speaker 3>I feel,</v>

6103
02:35:50.530 --> 02:35:52.540
<v Speaker 3>I feel free because when I'm training,</v>

6104
02:35:52.570 --> 02:35:54.730
<v Speaker 3>I trained for 10 weeks with no gloves.</v>

6105
02:35:54.731 --> 02:35:55.331
<v Speaker 3>When I'm clinching,</v>

6106
02:35:55.331 --> 02:35:59.440
<v Speaker 3>I train when I play spar with the kicks and then when all of a sudden I'm a</v>

6107
02:35:59.441 --> 02:35:59.771
<v Speaker 3>strictly,</v>

6108
02:35:59.771 --> 02:36:01.810
<v Speaker 3>when I put boxing gloves on and then I'm not,</v>

6109
02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:06.310
<v Speaker 3>I can't execute the same game plan when I'm training to win on fighting if it,</v>

6110
02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:07.210
<v Speaker 3>does that make sense?</v>

6111
02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:08.291
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense,</v>

6112
02:36:08.291 --> 02:36:10.300
<v Speaker 3>but why wouldn't you just train with the gloves,</v>

6113
02:36:12.850 --> 02:36:14.140
<v Speaker 3>the boxing gloves,</v>

6114
02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:15.933
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6115
02:36:18.490 --> 02:36:18.850
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

6116
02:36:18.850 --> 02:36:19.060
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

6117
02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:19.331
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

6118
02:36:19.331 --> 02:36:20.164
<v Speaker 3>in the cage,</v>

6119
02:36:20.350 --> 02:36:21.310
<v Speaker 3>in the cages.</v>

6120
02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:21.611
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

6121
02:36:21.611 --> 02:36:22.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6122
02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:23.320
<v Speaker 3>I see your point.</v>

6123
02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:24.273
<v Speaker 3>You're not looking right.</v>

6124
02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.943
<v Speaker 3>I see your point.</v>

6125
02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6126
02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:27.670
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

6127
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:30.790
<v Speaker 3>I want the MMA people to look at my promotion and say,</v>

6128
02:36:30.791 --> 02:36:31.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6129
02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:31.391
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>

6130
02:36:31.391 --> 02:36:32.224
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>

6131
02:36:32.410 --> 02:36:32.851
<v Speaker 3>It's wall.</v>

6132
02:36:32.851 --> 02:36:34.960
<v Speaker 3>It's everything that they want out of MMA.</v>

6133
02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6134
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:37.630
<v Speaker 3>That especially people that don't like the ground game,</v>

6135
02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:38.530
<v Speaker 3>it's everything they want.</v>

6136
02:36:38.730 --> 02:36:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Wild,</v>

6137
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.370
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

6138
02:36:39.370 --> 02:36:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Still not going to get their respect.</v>

6139
02:36:40.571 --> 02:36:41.500
<v Speaker 3>If I wear boxing gloves,</v>

6140
02:36:41.530 --> 02:36:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I need to make it this,</v>

6141
02:36:42.980 --> 02:36:45.520
<v Speaker 3>the same environment with everything the same,</v>

6142
02:36:45.730 --> 02:36:46.840
<v Speaker 3>just eliminate the ground.</v>

6143
02:36:46.841 --> 02:36:48.220
<v Speaker 3>So there was strikers have a,</v>

6144
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:52.530
<v Speaker 3>a platform node to fight in that same arena because of so many gods.</v>

6145
02:36:52.531 --> 02:36:55.390
<v Speaker 3>So I get so many emails from people that want to fight on the show because they</v>

6146
02:36:55.391 --> 02:36:55.720
<v Speaker 3>want to,</v>

6147
02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:57.250
<v Speaker 3>they want to feel that Russia the cage,</v>

6148
02:36:57.251 --> 02:36:58.750
<v Speaker 3>they want to feel that rush at MMA gloves.</v>

6149
02:36:59.050 --> 02:36:59.381
<v Speaker 3>But there's,</v>

6150
02:36:59.381 --> 02:37:01.230
<v Speaker 3>there's no platform platform for,</v>

6151
02:37:01.290 --> 02:37:01.430
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

6152
02:37:01.430 --> 02:37:01.631
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

6153
02:37:01.631 --> 02:37:02.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6154
02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:02.320
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

6155
02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:03.430
<v Speaker 3>to do it besides mine.</v>

6156
02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:05.420
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

6157
02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:07.113
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>

6158
02:37:07.250 --> 02:37:07.620
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6159
02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:10.150
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting sort of a transition.</v>

6160
02:37:10.390 --> 02:37:13.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like the gladiator days where you're fighting in the coliseum.</v>

6161
02:37:14.050 --> 02:37:15.010
<v Speaker 3>Don't they do that in?</v>

6162
02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 3>They do like</v>

6163
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.330
<v Speaker 1>one what they wrap the hands.</v>

6164
02:37:17.331 --> 02:37:19.280
<v Speaker 1>They all do like big crazy hand wraps.</v>

6165
02:37:19.281 --> 02:37:19.551
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6166
02:37:19.551 --> 02:37:19.771
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

6167
02:37:19.771 --> 02:37:19.981
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

6168
02:37:19.981 --> 02:37:21.500
<v Speaker 1>they've just had of that in the last few years.</v>

6169
02:37:21.501 --> 02:37:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

6170
02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:23.060
<v Speaker 1>typhoid is called,</v>

6171
02:37:23.410 --> 02:37:23.691
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6172
02:37:23.691 --> 02:37:25.790
<v Speaker 1>the same deal with the hand reps as well.</v>

6173
02:37:25.791 --> 02:37:26.420
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

6174
02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:29.810
<v Speaker 1>but a sinner rings still say you said a ring and they have a big giant hand</v>

6175
02:37:29.811 --> 02:37:30.230
<v Speaker 1>wraps.</v>

6176
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:31.580
<v Speaker 1>They're not totally,</v>

6177
02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:33.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6178
02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I've heard rumors that there,</v>

6179
02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:36.830
<v Speaker 1>there may or may not be an MMA glove,</v>

6180
02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:41.860
<v Speaker 1>similar sort of stall underneath or if it's a softer cotton or it's not like</v>

6181
02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:43.480
<v Speaker 1>pure big.</v>

6182
02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:43.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6183
02:37:43.701 --> 02:37:44.440
<v Speaker 1>it's big.</v>

6184
02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Those are big hand wraps.</v>

6185
02:37:45.621 --> 02:37:48.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not like as simple as like the regular wrap that you would wear when you're</v>

6186
02:37:48.861 --> 02:37:49.460
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>

6187
02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:49.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6188
02:37:49.701 --> 02:37:50.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's on the calendar go out.</v>

6189
02:37:50.830 --> 02:37:51.021
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6190
02:37:51.021 --> 02:37:51.854
<v Speaker 1>it's not an aesthetic.</v>

6191
02:37:52.010 --> 02:37:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you think how the cage is a big selling element?</v>

6192
02:37:54.450 --> 02:37:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6193
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I know when I walk into arena and I see a ring,</v>

6194
02:37:57.410 --> 02:37:57.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

6195
02:37:57.800 --> 02:37:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Yay,</v>

6196
02:37:58.490 --> 02:37:59.110
<v Speaker 1>the flight's tonight.</v>

6197
02:37:59.110 --> 02:37:59.550
<v Speaker 1>You beauty.</v>

6198
02:37:59.550 --> 02:38:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited.</v>

6199
02:38:00.380 --> 02:38:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I walk into arena and I see a cage and it's like,</v>

6200
02:38:03.260 --> 02:38:04.390
<v Speaker 1>oh she's,</v>

6201
02:38:04.391 --> 02:38:05.870
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to get fucked up tonight.</v>

6202
02:38:06.890 --> 02:38:07.723
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be,</v>

6203
02:38:07.810 --> 02:38:08.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6204
02:38:08.330 --> 02:38:08.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6205
02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:09.410
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6206
02:38:09.410 --> 02:38:10.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a different base.</v>

6207
02:38:10.281 --> 02:38:10.661
<v Speaker 1>You're walking.</v>

6208
02:38:10.661 --> 02:38:11.091
<v Speaker 1>Did I read it?</v>

6209
02:38:11.091 --> 02:38:11.721
<v Speaker 1>And it's a different,</v>

6210
02:38:11.721 --> 02:38:12.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a different animal.</v>

6211
02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to see that because that was always like a thing that people thought</v>

6212
02:38:16.011 --> 02:38:19.670
<v Speaker 1>was holding him and me back examine may was in a cage and people didn't like the</v>

6213
02:38:19.671 --> 02:38:21.500
<v Speaker 1>idea of cage fighting in quotes,</v>

6214
02:38:21.501 --> 02:38:22.600
<v Speaker 1>cage fighting it.</v>

6215
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Now it's $1 billion business.</v>

6216
02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:25.250
<v Speaker 1>It's well,</v>

6217
02:38:25.250 --> 02:38:26.990
<v Speaker 1>UFC UFC is not MMA.</v>

6218
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:28.671
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>

6219
02:38:28.671 --> 02:38:31.700
<v Speaker 1>you know there was an article that was recently out about the world series of</v>

6220
02:38:31.701 --> 02:38:32.151
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>

6221
02:38:32.151 --> 02:38:35.480
<v Speaker 1>which has some really good fighters in the world series of fighting.</v>

6222
02:38:35.810 --> 02:38:36.621
<v Speaker 1>You know there's some,</v>

6223
02:38:36.621 --> 02:38:40.160
<v Speaker 1>there's some super high level guys in in the world series of fighting.</v>

6224
02:38:40.161 --> 02:38:44.150
<v Speaker 1>You watch some real good fights and they're not making any money.</v>

6225
02:38:44.180 --> 02:38:44.991
<v Speaker 1>They're losing money.</v>

6226
02:38:44.991 --> 02:38:46.340
<v Speaker 1>They're on NBC sports,</v>

6227
02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:46.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6228
02:38:46.761 --> 02:38:48.680
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know how much NBC sports pays them,</v>

6229
02:38:48.681 --> 02:38:52.400
<v Speaker 1>but it was some article on the underground about them losing money and being in</v>

6230
02:38:52.401 --> 02:38:52.850
<v Speaker 1>dire,</v>

6231
02:38:52.850 --> 02:38:54.200
<v Speaker 1>dire financial straits.</v>

6232
02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:55.760
<v Speaker 1>And for me as a fan,</v>

6233
02:38:56.330 --> 02:38:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I hate hearing that because I want guys to have options because when guys get</v>

6234
02:38:59.781 --> 02:39:00.890
<v Speaker 1>cut from the UFC,</v>

6235
02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:03.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they'll go to world tour as a fighting one of these other</v>

6236
02:39:03.651 --> 02:39:06.620
<v Speaker 1>organizations like Jake shields or John Fitch and you know,</v>

6237
02:39:06.621 --> 02:39:09.410
<v Speaker 1>they're build up when a few fights over there and maybe they can come back to</v>

6238
02:39:09.411 --> 02:39:09.921
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>

6239
02:39:09.921 --> 02:39:11.180
<v Speaker 1>And I like hearing that.</v>

6240
02:39:11.181 --> 02:39:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

6241
02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:12.463
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that.</v>

6242
02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:14.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened to our Lawsky Anthony Johnson,</v>

6243
02:39:14.690 --> 02:39:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Johnson,</v>

6244
02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:17.360
<v Speaker 1>he fought Arlovski in the world series of fighting.</v>

6245
02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6246
02:39:18.170 --> 02:39:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

6247
02:39:19.290 --> 02:39:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I that has to be available and it can't be available if these guys aren't making</v>

6248
02:39:23.181 --> 02:39:23.570
<v Speaker 1>any money.</v>

6249
02:39:23.570 --> 02:39:25.900
<v Speaker 1>It's the same in Australia that the eye,</v>

6250
02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:28.220
<v Speaker 1>I love UFC.</v>

6251
02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:29.031
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

6252
02:39:29.031 --> 02:39:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm there every single weekend.</v>

6253
02:39:30.621 --> 02:39:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm balling a little paper views.</v>

6254
02:39:31.731 --> 02:39:32.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching all the replays.</v>

6255
02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I love your commentary.</v>

6256
02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6257
02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I love every single thing about it.</v>

6258
02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:41.690
<v Speaker 1>And then I go to a local MMA show and I'm bored shitless.</v>

6259
02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6260
02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:44.830
<v Speaker 1>they got two guys that are in it.</v>

6261
02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:45.561
<v Speaker 1>It's in Australia too,</v>

6262
02:39:45.561 --> 02:39:46.280
<v Speaker 1>cause we didn't wrestle.</v>

6263
02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Said say within 10 seconds,</v>

6264
02:39:47.971 --> 02:39:50.750
<v Speaker 1>they're both on the ground and they don't have the skillset to stand back up.</v>

6265
02:39:50.751 --> 02:39:52.460
<v Speaker 1>And they sort of get stuck for five minutes.</v>

6266
02:39:53.390 --> 02:39:53.950
<v Speaker 1>But wait,</v>

6267
02:39:53.950 --> 02:39:54.950
<v Speaker 1>when you watch UFC there,</v>

6268
02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:56.160
<v Speaker 1>it's such a high level that it's,</v>

6269
02:39:56.161 --> 02:39:57.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like two worms.</v>

6270
02:39:57.371 --> 02:39:58.400
<v Speaker 1>The next minute they're up again.</v>

6271
02:39:58.401 --> 02:40:00.110
<v Speaker 1>They're down the Jujitsu.</v>

6272
02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:00.891
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

6273
02:40:00.891 --> 02:40:01.461
<v Speaker 1>The striking.</v>

6274
02:40:01.461 --> 02:40:02.241
<v Speaker 1>So amazing.</v>

6275
02:40:02.241 --> 02:40:03.980
<v Speaker 1>You've got the Surooney's and it's,</v>

6276
02:40:03.981 --> 02:40:04.311
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6277
02:40:04.311 --> 02:40:04.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6278
02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:05.560
<v Speaker 1>it's such a,</v>

6279
02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:09.530
<v Speaker 1>and then what I want to do with the CMT two on for Dana white saying in</v>

6280
02:40:09.531 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 1>interviews if any competition promotion was that it had any</v>

6281
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:14.550
<v Speaker 3>brains,</v>

6282
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:18.990
<v Speaker 3>they'd steal everything that I'm doing in the UFC and try and replicate that for</v>

6283
02:40:18.991 --> 02:40:21.330
<v Speaker 3>their own promotion because what we're doing is a winning formula.</v>

6284
02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:23.370
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I want to try and do with my show.</v>

6285
02:40:23.371 --> 02:40:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to bring in the nationals in,</v>

6286
02:40:24.751 --> 02:40:29.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to decorate the every single aspect as much as I can.</v>

6287
02:40:29.221 --> 02:40:31.320
<v Speaker 3>Similar but in the striking world.</v>

6288
02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:35.400
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that that's what you'll be your primary focus when you retire</v>

6289
02:40:35.401 --> 02:40:38.010
<v Speaker 3>and promoting and promoting like cage Moitai I,</v>

6290
02:40:38.250 --> 02:40:38.491
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6291
02:40:38.491 --> 02:40:42.240
<v Speaker 3>my life is fighting whether I'm doing an o promoting it or teaching it or</v>

6292
02:40:42.241 --> 02:40:47.241
<v Speaker 3>seminars or I have no other interest outside of fighting.</v>

6293
02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:49.770
<v Speaker 3>That ad is all I do.</v>

6294
02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:50.633
<v Speaker 3>And then that's my,</v>

6295
02:40:50.910 --> 02:40:52.770
<v Speaker 3>my wife's life as well between us.</v>

6296
02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:53.633
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6297
02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:54.533
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6298
02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:55.520
<v Speaker 3>that's the eighth.</v>

6299
02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:56.393
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

6300
02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:58.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know that there is a world outside of fighting.</v>

6301
02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:04.620
<v Speaker 3>When you watch MMA and so you watch like UFC a high level UFC,</v>

6302
02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:05.280
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

6303
02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:08.880
<v Speaker 3>what is the one thing that you think that,</v>

6304
02:41:08.881 --> 02:41:09.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6305
02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:11.190
<v Speaker 3>when you see a little striking,</v>

6306
02:41:11.590 --> 02:41:15.330
<v Speaker 3>is there anything that bugs you is you think that things that you watch it,</v>

6307
02:41:15.331 --> 02:41:19.620
<v Speaker 3>you see people doing wrong or things you would like to see them improve upon?</v>

6308
02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:21.133
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy,</v>

6309
02:41:21.210 --> 02:41:22.350
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy worries.</v>

6310
02:41:22.410 --> 02:41:25.170
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy people that are willing to put it all on the line.</v>

6311
02:41:25.530 --> 02:41:26.311
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6312
02:41:26.311 --> 02:41:27.120
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>

6313
02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:27.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6314
02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:30.090
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen such as Diego Sanchez,</v>

6315
02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:33.600
<v Speaker 3>like he's striking to me isn't elite,</v>

6316
02:41:33.601 --> 02:41:34.820
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time he,</v>

6317
02:41:35.140 --> 02:41:35.550
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

6318
02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:37.050
<v Speaker 3>he drops his hands,</v>

6319
02:41:37.051 --> 02:41:38.280
<v Speaker 3>he causes his opponent on,</v>

6320
02:41:38.430 --> 02:41:40.410
<v Speaker 3>he screams and he runs in.</v>

6321
02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:40.981
<v Speaker 3>For me.</v>

6322
02:41:40.981 --> 02:41:41.671
<v Speaker 3>That's excitement.</v>

6323
02:41:41.671 --> 02:41:42.070
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

6324
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:44.040
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to be technical or textbook,</v>

6325
02:41:44.370 --> 02:41:45.450
<v Speaker 3>but to have that,</v>

6326
02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:45.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6327
02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:48.720
<v Speaker 3>that adrenaline dump of sitting there and watching him for a whole round just</v>

6328
02:41:48.721 --> 02:41:50.400
<v Speaker 3>going crazy to me,</v>

6329
02:41:50.401 --> 02:41:50.651
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

6330
02:41:50.651 --> 02:41:50.900
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

6331
02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:51.570
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

6332
02:41:51.570 --> 02:41:53.070
<v Speaker 3>He's one of my all time favorites for sure.</v>

6333
02:41:53.430 --> 02:41:54.030
<v Speaker 3>Because of that.</v>

6334
02:41:54.030 --> 02:41:55.170
<v Speaker 3>And then John Jones,</v>

6335
02:41:55.171 --> 02:41:55.441
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

6336
02:41:55.441 --> 02:41:56.274
<v Speaker 3>like you're saying,</v>

6337
02:41:56.430 --> 02:41:58.710
<v Speaker 3>different elements of his elbow strikes a goof.</v>

6338
02:41:58.711 --> 02:42:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Listen for another example,</v>

6339
02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:01.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6340
02:42:01.390 --> 02:42:01.800
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

6341
02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:03.630
<v Speaker 3>everyone has their Anthony Johnson,</v>

6342
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:06.090
<v Speaker 3>he's boxing.</v>

6343
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:08.040
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't say his textbook boxing,</v>

6344
02:42:08.041 --> 02:42:09.960
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time if he hit you year out.</v>

6345
02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:11.550
<v Speaker 3>So I love that.</v>

6346
02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:12.413
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

6347
02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:15.720
<v Speaker 3>That's why I love it because I'm on the edge of my seat every single,</v>

6348
02:42:15.721 --> 02:42:17.430
<v Speaker 3>if that's what UFC so good too.</v>

6349
02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:20.370
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to wait until the main event to watch the fight.</v>

6350
02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.180
<v Speaker 3>She can sit there from the prelims to the last fight and enjoy every single</v>

6351
02:42:24.181 --> 02:42:26.880
<v Speaker 3>fight because you know that every single fight is going to be completely</v>

6352
02:42:26.881 --> 02:42:27.151
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

6353
02:42:27.151 --> 02:42:29.160
<v Speaker 3>To the last question about that,</v>

6354
02:42:29.250 --> 02:42:30.690
<v Speaker 3>but as a world class striker,</v>

6355
02:42:30.691 --> 02:42:32.130
<v Speaker 3>when you watch guys in the UFC,</v>

6356
02:42:32.131 --> 02:42:33.480
<v Speaker 3>do you see holes in their,</v>

6357
02:42:33.481 --> 02:42:34.680
<v Speaker 3>their style or do,</v>

6358
02:42:34.681 --> 02:42:35.850
<v Speaker 3>when you watch MMA,</v>

6359
02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:37.200
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even have to be UFC,</v>

6360
02:42:37.230 --> 02:42:39.150
<v Speaker 3>like just any MMA.</v>

6361
02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:40.051
<v Speaker 3>Do you see,</v>

6362
02:42:40.051 --> 02:42:40.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

6363
02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:44.870
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about the level when you come from a world championship Muay</v>

6364
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:45.870
<v Speaker 3>Thai fighters perspective,</v>

6365
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:48.690
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about the level of kickboxing and MMA?</v>

6366
02:42:48.770 --> 02:42:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6367
02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:49.690
<v Speaker 3>if it,</v>

6368
02:42:49.690 --> 02:42:51.120
<v Speaker 3>if it was pure kickboxing rules.</v>

6369
02:42:51.121 --> 02:42:51.570
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

6370
02:42:51.570 --> 02:42:51.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6371
02:42:51.811 --> 02:42:52.001
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6372
02:42:52.001 --> 02:42:52.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6373
02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:54.060
<v Speaker 3>it's different kettle of fish,</v>

6374
02:42:54.090 --> 02:42:54.271
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

6375
02:42:54.271 --> 02:42:54.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6376
02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:54.691
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6377
02:42:54.691 --> 02:42:54.990
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6378
02:42:54.990 --> 02:42:55.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6379
02:42:55.440 --> 02:42:56.273
<v Speaker 3>it's entertaining.</v>

6380
02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:57.360
<v Speaker 3>I watch it for then.</v>

6381
02:42:57.390 --> 02:42:58.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6382
02:42:58.420 --> 02:42:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

6383
02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I can't say it's good or bad because what they're do works.</v>

6384
02:43:02.310 --> 02:43:06.020
<v Speaker 3>And also you have to consider the fact that they're avoiding take downs and</v>

6385
02:43:06.021 --> 02:43:06.830
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

6386
02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:08.700
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different elements for me,</v>

6387
02:43:08.730 --> 02:43:09.563
<v Speaker 3>for me to say,</v>

6388
02:43:09.930 --> 02:43:10.471
<v Speaker 3>this is good,</v>

6389
02:43:10.471 --> 02:43:11.290
<v Speaker 3>this is bad.</v>

6390
02:43:11.290 --> 02:43:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6391
02:43:11.860 --> 02:43:13.300
<v Speaker 3>I would be disrespecting the sports,</v>

6392
02:43:13.301 --> 02:43:16.060
<v Speaker 3>so I'd rather I,</v>

6393
02:43:16.380 --> 02:43:17.680
<v Speaker 3>it's in the day.</v>

6394
02:43:17.740 --> 02:43:17.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6395
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:22.030
<v Speaker 3>it's entertainment and that's why I invested my money every single weekend.</v>

6396
02:43:22.031 --> 02:43:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Cause I love it.</v>

6397
02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I think it's amazing.</v>

6398
02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:24.610
<v Speaker 3>And I'm a,</v>

6399
02:43:24.610 --> 02:43:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Moitai guy.</v>

6400
02:43:25.810 --> 02:43:26.680
<v Speaker 3>I love UFC.</v>

6401
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:28.090
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

6402
02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I just wish I was</v>

6403
02:43:31.490 --> 02:43:32.440
<v Speaker 3>a young teenager.</v>

6404
02:43:32.470 --> 02:43:33.303
<v Speaker 3>They're just letting you know.</v>

6405
02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:34.233
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

6406
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:35.321
<v Speaker 3>I know which path.</v>

6407
02:43:35.321 --> 02:43:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I definitely go.</v>

6408
02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:37.690
<v Speaker 3>You'd go down the MMA path.</v>

6409
02:43:37.730 --> 02:43:38.520
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

6410
02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:38.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6411
02:43:38.890 --> 02:43:39.970
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't so big.</v>

6412
02:43:40.090 --> 02:43:42.100
<v Speaker 3>I want to be the Anthony Pettis on the Wheaties box.</v>

6413
02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:42.940
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to,</v>

6414
02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:44.740
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to be the George St Ph</v>

6415
02:43:46.980 --> 02:43:51.980
<v Speaker 3>in living in a penthouse and being in the UN unlost commercials in the run the</v>

6416
02:43:52.031 --> 02:43:52.511
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

6417
02:43:52.511 --> 02:43:54.210
<v Speaker 3>And then there's,</v>

6418
02:43:54.550 --> 02:43:54.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6419
02:43:54.940 --> 02:43:55.290
<v Speaker 3>it's be,</v>

6420
02:43:55.290 --> 02:43:57.340
<v Speaker 3>do you plan on training MMA fighters?</v>

6421
02:43:57.350 --> 02:43:57.971
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean,</v>

6422
02:43:57.971 --> 02:43:59.590
<v Speaker 3>I know you work with George quite a bit.</v>

6423
02:43:59.620 --> 02:43:59.951
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6424
02:43:59.951 --> 02:44:01.420
<v Speaker 3>I've worked with him once for the two weeks.</v>

6425
02:44:01.421 --> 02:44:02.254
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty cool.</v>

6426
02:44:02.530 --> 02:44:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6427
02:44:03.010 --> 02:44:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I worked with a couple of gentlemen in Australia that are coming up,</v>

6428
02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:08.500
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

6429
02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:11.760
<v Speaker 3>but if the opportunity arose and someone would like to to,</v>

6430
02:44:12.050 --> 02:44:12.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6431
02:44:12.460 --> 02:44:13.211
<v Speaker 3>shoot me an email,</v>

6432
02:44:13.211 --> 02:44:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to know all those training sessions that you did with George over the</v>

6433
02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:17.260
<v Speaker 3>two weeks.</v>

6434
02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:18.800
<v Speaker 3>Which fight was that for Hendrix?</v>

6435
02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Hendrix.</v>

6436
02:44:19.270 --> 02:44:20.103
<v Speaker 3>He's very last one.</v>

6437
02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:23.230
<v Speaker 3>And w what did you guys basically work on?</v>

6438
02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Was Hendrick was a southpaw.</v>

6439
02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:25.870
<v Speaker 3>So we're working on,</v>

6440
02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:26.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6441
02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:30.280
<v Speaker 3>keeping everything basic and then lots of right hand left hooks,</v>

6442
02:44:30.281 --> 02:44:30.971
<v Speaker 3>lots of insight.</v>

6443
02:44:30.971 --> 02:44:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Like he's with the right leg for the,</v>

6444
02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:34.540
<v Speaker 3>the tech yet that lead Southport leg,</v>

6445
02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:35.673
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6446
02:44:35.710 --> 02:44:38.620
<v Speaker 3>moving away from the power left hand because he's a monster.</v>

6447
02:44:39.070 --> 02:44:39.521
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6448
02:44:39.521 --> 02:44:44.380
<v Speaker 3>and then every time we'd spa I replicate a Johnny spiring style.</v>

6449
02:44:44.381 --> 02:44:44.891
<v Speaker 3>So lots of,</v>

6450
02:44:44.891 --> 02:44:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I'd throw lots of overhand lefts and just being that,</v>

6451
02:44:47.981 --> 02:44:49.570
<v Speaker 3>that craziness exploding in.</v>

6452
02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6453
02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:51.260
<v Speaker 3>and then Georgia was,</v>

6454
02:44:51.260 --> 02:44:51.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6455
02:44:51.970 --> 02:44:52.803
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6456
02:44:53.050 --> 02:44:53.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6457
02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:54.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6458
02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:55.173
<v Speaker 3>John Denver here,</v>

6459
02:44:55.220 --> 02:44:55.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6460
02:44:55.930 --> 02:44:58.030
<v Speaker 3>after a week of having George on the pads,</v>

6461
02:44:58.200 --> 02:44:58.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6462
02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:00.840
<v Speaker 3>he was blown away about how much power I,</v>

6463
02:45:00.890 --> 02:45:01.600
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6464
02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:03.070
<v Speaker 3>I was starting to get out of George's,</v>

6465
02:45:03.071 --> 02:45:03.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6466
02:45:03.730 --> 02:45:07.120
<v Speaker 3>punches and kicks and then freestyling and the pads that he never number four.</v>

6467
02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:08.240
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

6468
02:45:08.860 --> 02:45:09.221
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6469
02:45:09.221 --> 02:45:09.730
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

6470
02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:11.170
<v Speaker 3>we had such a good time.</v>

6471
02:45:11.230 --> 02:45:11.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6472
02:45:11.950 --> 02:45:14.170
<v Speaker 3>but then I came to la,</v>

6473
02:45:14.590 --> 02:45:15.880
<v Speaker 3>I came too early in the camp.</v>

6474
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:19.840
<v Speaker 3>There was still 14 weeks between our training session and the fight.</v>

6475
02:45:19.841 --> 02:45:21.490
<v Speaker 3>So by the time I went back to Australia,</v>

6476
02:45:21.870 --> 02:45:22.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6477
02:45:22.370 --> 02:45:22.670
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

6478
02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:25.990
<v Speaker 3>he sort of went back to the old training regime.</v>

6479
02:45:26.020 --> 02:45:28.430
<v Speaker 3>And then what was the difference between your training?</v>

6480
02:45:28.431 --> 02:45:31.450
<v Speaker 3>When I had the pleasure of working out with you and one of the things that I</v>

6481
02:45:31.451 --> 02:45:34.450
<v Speaker 3>found was really interesting is that even when you throw a jab,</v>

6482
02:45:34.451 --> 02:45:36.310
<v Speaker 3>you're throwing a jab almost like a right hand.</v>

6483
02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:37.211
<v Speaker 3>He's throwing a jab,</v>

6484
02:45:37.211 --> 02:45:40.570
<v Speaker 3>like you're pulling back with your right hand and fucking thrusting with your</v>

6485
02:45:40.571 --> 02:45:41.200
<v Speaker 3>left hand.</v>

6486
02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:42.033
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6487
02:45:42.130 --> 02:45:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Was that like the style that I had,</v>

6488
02:45:44.381 --> 02:45:45.140
<v Speaker 3>George George,</v>

6489
02:45:45.140 --> 02:45:48.370
<v Speaker 3>when George was double jabbing before it was a long Jab,</v>

6490
02:45:48.371 --> 02:45:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Short Jab was I had him cocking that shoulder for both jabs.</v>

6491
02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:52.450
<v Speaker 3>So both of them were,</v>

6492
02:45:52.451 --> 02:45:53.230
<v Speaker 3>were um,</v>

6493
02:45:53.230 --> 02:45:56.380
<v Speaker 3>and I'll make them big cracking was Bam Bam.</v>

6494
02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:57.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6495
02:45:57.110 --> 02:46:01.840
<v Speaker 3>That you were trying to get him to be more aggressive with his power or is that</v>

6496
02:46:01.841 --> 02:46:03.580
<v Speaker 3>what you were concentrating on joining to execute?</v>

6497
02:46:03.610 --> 02:46:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6498
02:46:04.090 --> 02:46:04.391
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6499
02:46:04.391 --> 02:46:07.510
<v Speaker 3>well a lot more power shots and just keeping it simple.</v>

6500
02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:08.373
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

6501
02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:08.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6502
02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:11.760
<v Speaker 3>keeping it down to four or five different techniques against a southpaw,</v>

6503
02:46:11.780 --> 02:46:12.760
<v Speaker 3>because against the South Pole,</v>

6504
02:46:12.761 --> 02:46:12.901
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

6505
02:46:12.901 --> 02:46:14.390
<v Speaker 3>you can't do the crazy tricks.</v>

6506
02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:15.740
<v Speaker 3>You've got to keep it basic.</v>

6507
02:46:15.741 --> 02:46:19.580
<v Speaker 3>But I'm smart so you don't want to run into that left power hand either.</v>

6508
02:46:19.970 --> 02:46:21.380
<v Speaker 3>And then I believe,</v>

6509
02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:22.281
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6510
02:46:22.281 --> 02:46:23.780
<v Speaker 3>he fought the wrong fight against Johnny.</v>

6511
02:46:23.781 --> 02:46:27.530
<v Speaker 3>He was moving into the hand instead of away from the hand and then he took a lot</v>

6512
02:46:27.531 --> 02:46:28.100
<v Speaker 3>of damage.</v>

6513
02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6514
02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:30.680
<v Speaker 3>and I believe we talked about this last time as well.</v>

6515
02:46:30.910 --> 02:46:31.111
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6516
02:46:31.111 --> 02:46:34.100
<v Speaker 3>I believe George marginally just won that fight,</v>

6517
02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:34.963
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

6518
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6519
02:46:35.450 --> 02:46:36.210
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

6520
02:46:36.210 --> 02:46:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I think if I had stayed there for a little bit longer or closer to the fight,</v>

6521
02:46:39.141 --> 02:46:39.310
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6522
02:46:39.310 --> 02:46:39.580
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6523
02:46:39.580 --> 02:46:42.050
<v Speaker 3>I could have gotten away with them.</v>

6524
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.863
<v Speaker 3>Less damage.</v>

6525
02:46:44.290 --> 02:46:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6526
02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:45.830
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

6527
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the punishment,</v>

6528
02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:47.691
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

6529
02:46:47.691 --> 02:46:48.201
<v Speaker 3>do you think that he,</v>

6530
02:46:48.201 --> 02:46:52.670
<v Speaker 3>maybe he had one foot out the door because he was kind of saying after that fire</v>

6531
02:46:52.671 --> 02:46:53.421
<v Speaker 3>through is really,</v>

6532
02:46:53.421 --> 02:46:53.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6533
02:46:53.820 --> 02:46:54.390
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

6534
02:46:54.390 --> 02:46:57.710
<v Speaker 3>it's probably wants to take some time on any one of retiring,</v>

6535
02:46:57.860 --> 02:47:00.830
<v Speaker 3>but he wanted to take some time away and that this was just a,</v>

6536
02:47:00.831 --> 02:47:01.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6537
02:47:01.430 --> 02:47:02.390
<v Speaker 3>it was too much for him.</v>

6538
02:47:02.391 --> 02:47:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that coming into that fight,</v>

6539
02:47:04.041 --> 02:47:05.390
<v Speaker 3>maybe he had that in his head?</v>

6540
02:47:06.020 --> 02:47:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Possibly.</v>

6541
02:47:06.820 --> 02:47:08.780
<v Speaker 3>It's always a bad spot for a fighter to be at.</v>

6542
02:47:08.790 --> 02:47:09.110
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

6543
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:10.340
<v Speaker 3>I have one foot out the door.</v>

6544
02:47:10.380 --> 02:47:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6545
02:47:10.700 --> 02:47:11.930
<v Speaker 3>I was saying to my friend Kevin,</v>

6546
02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:12.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6547
02:47:13.370 --> 02:47:14.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6548
02:47:14.130 --> 02:47:14.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6549
02:47:14.660 --> 02:47:15.980
<v Speaker 3>it was the highlight of my,</v>

6550
02:47:15.981 --> 02:47:16.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6551
02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:20.720
<v Speaker 3>training as a person who was training George first two weeks and the first three</v>

6552
02:47:20.721 --> 02:47:21.650
<v Speaker 3>days that I was with him,</v>

6553
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:25.880
<v Speaker 3>it was so mind blowing that how famous he was.</v>

6554
02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:28.680
<v Speaker 3>People coming up morning taken further is we,</v>

6555
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:29.623
<v Speaker 3>we're eating.</v>

6556
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:31.670
<v Speaker 3>And then after the third day,</v>

6557
02:47:31.671 --> 02:47:32.420
<v Speaker 3>fourth day fee,</v>

6558
02:47:32.420 --> 02:47:33.920
<v Speaker 3>then you realize this thing,</v>

6559
02:47:33.950 --> 02:47:34.161
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

6560
02:47:34.161 --> 02:47:35.810
<v Speaker 3>the machine doesn't turn off.</v>

6561
02:47:36.290 --> 02:47:36.920
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

6562
02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:37.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6563
02:47:37.310 --> 02:47:40.400
<v Speaker 3>he can't go to the chemist to buy shampoo.</v>

6564
02:47:40.401 --> 02:47:41.660
<v Speaker 3>He can't chemist,</v>

6565
02:47:42.430 --> 02:47:45.730
<v Speaker 3>let's call a pharmacy,</v>

6566
02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:47.110
<v Speaker 3>call the cameras.</v>

6567
02:47:47.110 --> 02:47:47.943
<v Speaker 3>Do you go,</v>

6568
02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:49.700
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck are you getting your champion?</v>

6569
02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:53.481
<v Speaker 3>He might go,</v>

6570
02:47:53.481 --> 02:47:57.140
<v Speaker 3>he might go into the toilets to pass stool and you've got people waiting at the</v>

6571
02:47:57.141 --> 02:47:59.540
<v Speaker 3>side of the cubicle to wait to get a photo with him.</v>

6572
02:47:59.541 --> 02:48:00.290
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

6573
02:48:00.290 --> 02:48:01.123
<v Speaker 3>and then we've got to,</v>

6574
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:02.180
<v Speaker 3>every time we went somewhere,</v>

6575
02:48:02.181 --> 02:48:03.890
<v Speaker 3>it always have to be through the VIP entrance.</v>

6576
02:48:03.891 --> 02:48:05.120
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't walk through the front door,</v>

6577
02:48:05.330 --> 02:48:05.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6578
02:48:05.810 --> 02:48:06.700
<v Speaker 3>especially Montreal.</v>

6579
02:48:06.701 --> 02:48:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

6580
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:11.390
<v Speaker 3>So one time we went to a nightclub and then we've got in through the VIP and</v>

6581
02:48:11.391 --> 02:48:11.791
<v Speaker 3>then we'll,</v>

6582
02:48:11.791 --> 02:48:12.890
<v Speaker 3>we'll walk into our,</v>

6583
02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:13.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6584
02:48:13.270 --> 02:48:14.103
<v Speaker 3>our table.</v>

6585
02:48:14.210 --> 02:48:17.670
<v Speaker 3>And then we're about maybe 15 feet from their table and someone says,</v>

6586
02:48:17.730 --> 02:48:20.400
<v Speaker 3>Jews Birger as p and would,</v>

6587
02:48:20.410 --> 02:48:21.530
<v Speaker 3>where the word of a lie.</v>

6588
02:48:21.610 --> 02:48:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6589
02:48:22.010 --> 02:48:23.960
<v Speaker 3>the whole dance force stopped dancing.</v>

6590
02:48:24.290 --> 02:48:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's looked at us turn and the whole club's walk towards that table.</v>

6591
02:48:28.650 --> 02:48:29.370
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

6592
02:48:29.370 --> 02:48:30.203
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6593
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:31.280
<v Speaker 3>without losing a beat,</v>

6594
02:48:31.390 --> 02:48:33.710
<v Speaker 3>we've turned straight back around and walked straight back out.</v>

6595
02:48:33.711 --> 02:48:34.250
<v Speaker 3>And that club,</v>

6596
02:48:34.250 --> 02:48:34.611
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

6597
02:48:34.611 --> 02:48:35.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6598
02:48:35.330 --> 02:48:39.890
<v Speaker 3>it was like a tsunami of fans that had just come into real sit down.</v>

6599
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:40.431
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

6600
02:48:40.431 --> 02:48:40.551
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6601
02:48:40.551 --> 02:48:42.630
<v Speaker 3>we'll come back here in a couple of years later when that,</v>

6602
02:48:42.631 --> 02:48:43.970
<v Speaker 3>when they're distracted.</v>

6603
02:48:44.290 --> 02:48:44.601
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6604
02:48:44.601 --> 02:48:47.300
<v Speaker 3>I can't come in right now because of this.</v>

6605
02:48:47.350 --> 02:48:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Every day is this doesn't,</v>

6606
02:48:48.990 --> 02:48:49.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6607
02:48:49.430 --> 02:48:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6608
02:48:49.700 --> 02:48:50.211
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

6609
02:48:50.211 --> 02:48:51.140
<v Speaker 3>this is normal.</v>

6610
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:52.191
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>

6611
02:48:52.191 --> 02:48:56.210
<v Speaker 3>what he has is a good friends that are his body bodyguards that stand around in</v>

6612
02:48:56.211 --> 02:48:57.050
<v Speaker 3>the whole time because,</v>

6613
02:48:57.051 --> 02:48:57.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6614
02:48:57.690 --> 02:48:58.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6615
02:48:58.010 --> 02:48:58.421
<v Speaker 3>people said,</v>

6616
02:48:58.421 --> 02:48:59.240
<v Speaker 3>can I get a photo?</v>

6617
02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:00.800
<v Speaker 3>And the body guys will step in and say,</v>

6618
02:49:00.810 --> 02:49:01.160
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

6619
02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:01.580
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6620
02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:01.761
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

6621
02:49:01.761 --> 02:49:02.131
<v Speaker 3>Flashy.</v>

6622
02:49:02.131 --> 02:49:03.260
<v Speaker 3>As soon as the flash goes off,</v>

6623
02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:04.580
<v Speaker 3>then the whole club's going to come.</v>

6624
02:49:05.090 --> 02:49:06.260
<v Speaker 3>And then Georgia say yes,</v>

6625
02:49:06.500 --> 02:49:07.141
<v Speaker 3>and then the body goes,</v>

6626
02:49:07.141 --> 02:49:07.291
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

6627
02:49:07.291 --> 02:49:07.860
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

6628
02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

6629
02:49:08.030 --> 02:49:08.670
<v Speaker 1>but George say,</v>

6630
02:49:08.670 --> 02:49:08.850
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

6631
02:49:08.850 --> 02:49:09.683
<v Speaker 1>look me.</v>

6632
02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:10.321
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand.</v>

6633
02:49:10.321 --> 02:49:11.460
<v Speaker 1>If the camera goes in,</v>

6634
02:49:11.461 --> 02:49:16.461
<v Speaker 1>we got a problem and everybody's gonna want to photo in any,</v>

6635
02:49:17.281 --> 02:49:18.420
<v Speaker 1>even at a red light.</v>

6636
02:49:18.421 --> 02:49:19.290
<v Speaker 1>We're driving in the car.</v>

6637
02:49:19.300 --> 02:49:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Me and George got the radio,</v>

6638
02:49:21.430 --> 02:49:22.263
<v Speaker 1>big jar.</v>

6639
02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:23.121
<v Speaker 1>We stopped,</v>

6640
02:49:23.121 --> 02:49:24.270
<v Speaker 1>we stopped at a red light.</v>

6641
02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And the way he was GSP,</v>

6642
02:49:25.441 --> 02:49:28.800
<v Speaker 1>GSP and four t's credit champion,</v>

6643
02:49:28.810 --> 02:49:33.690
<v Speaker 1>easy always Luke's wave smalls and then certainly just juice for just a fraction</v>

6644
02:49:33.691 --> 02:49:36.180
<v Speaker 1>just so he's out of eyesight of of the fans.</v>

6645
02:49:36.181 --> 02:49:37.350
<v Speaker 1>But it's um,</v>

6646
02:49:37.380 --> 02:49:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but that's every,</v>

6647
02:49:38.670 --> 02:49:43.500
<v Speaker 1>every single he'd rather from your car park even he'd catch a taxi from the</v>

6648
02:49:43.501 --> 02:49:48.501
<v Speaker 1>front gate to the back gate because it from walking a hundred feet would be a</v>

6649
02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:49.590
<v Speaker 1>half an hour,</v>

6650
02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:50.423
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6651
02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:53.160
<v Speaker 1>with photos and handshakes and high fives and,</v>

6652
02:49:53.490 --> 02:49:54.510
<v Speaker 1>and people are rude.</v>

6653
02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:55.590
<v Speaker 1>People are crazy.</v>

6654
02:49:55.591 --> 02:49:58.410
<v Speaker 1>People would just come up and they stick their phone in his face like this and</v>

6655
02:49:58.810 --> 02:50:03.090
<v Speaker 1>then you know what it's like you're a superstar and you'd have this every single</v>

6656
02:50:03.091 --> 02:50:03.570
<v Speaker 1>day as well.</v>

6657
02:50:03.570 --> 02:50:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Surely you don't have any my sticking their phone directly in my face too often,</v>

6658
02:50:07.951 --> 02:50:09.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's happened a few times.</v>

6659
02:50:09.151 --> 02:50:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6660
02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I think with George is a totally different thing because he's a national hero as</v>

6661
02:50:13.081 --> 02:50:13.800
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

6662
02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean he won sportsman of the year award in Canada where hockey is like their</v>

6663
02:50:17.851 --> 02:50:18.810
<v Speaker 1>national sport.</v>

6664
02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6665
02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:21.210
<v Speaker 1>And he went over hockey players.</v>

6666
02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:21.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6667
02:50:21.451 --> 02:50:22.410
<v Speaker 1>he was on the fucking,</v>

6668
02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:24.600
<v Speaker 1>he was in these Gatorade commercials.</v>

6669
02:50:24.601 --> 02:50:24.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6670
02:50:24.841 --> 02:50:27.300
<v Speaker 1>he had transcended the sport to the,</v>

6671
02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:28.230
<v Speaker 1>to the fact,</v>

6672
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:32.460
<v Speaker 1>the point where he was a international superstar and he's from Canada and</v>

6673
02:50:32.461 --> 02:50:33.900
<v Speaker 1>they're so proud of that in Canada.</v>

6674
02:50:33.901 --> 02:50:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Canada's such a proud country.</v>

6675
02:50:35.420 --> 02:50:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6676
02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:39.210
<v Speaker 1>But a guy like George is probably a hundred times more famous than me.</v>

6677
02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:41.310
<v Speaker 1>We'll wait till we went to New York for the,</v>

6678
02:50:41.311 --> 02:50:41.881
<v Speaker 1>for one week,</v>

6679
02:50:41.881 --> 02:50:42.511
<v Speaker 1>the train with them,</v>

6680
02:50:42.511 --> 02:50:43.230
<v Speaker 1>John Dana here.</v>

6681
02:50:43.230 --> 02:50:45.390
<v Speaker 1>And I'm at the Gracies as academy.</v>

6682
02:50:45.630 --> 02:50:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And even in New York it was,</v>

6683
02:50:46.741 --> 02:50:47.491
<v Speaker 1>it was no different.</v>

6684
02:50:47.491 --> 02:50:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Montreal and New York was just as insane as each other that it was just,</v>

6685
02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:51.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6686
02:50:51.250 --> 02:50:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I would think metro,</v>

6687
02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll be probably a little bit more crazy.</v>

6688
02:50:53.821 --> 02:50:54.391
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

6689
02:50:54.391 --> 02:50:55.200
<v Speaker 1>at that level,</v>

6690
02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:55.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6691
02:50:55.411 --> 02:50:56.070
<v Speaker 1>George,</v>

6692
02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:57.030
<v Speaker 1>when he was a champion,</v>

6693
02:50:57.031 --> 02:50:57.511
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

6694
02:50:57.511 --> 02:50:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he could get around now a little bit better.</v>

6695
02:50:59.520 --> 02:50:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6696
02:50:59.970 --> 02:51:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

6697
02:51:01.050 --> 02:51:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6698
02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:02.730
<v Speaker 1>people just ask them questions.</v>

6699
02:51:02.731 --> 02:51:03.331
<v Speaker 1>When are you coming back,</v>

6700
02:51:03.331 --> 02:51:04.164
<v Speaker 1>George?</v>

6701
02:51:04.170 --> 02:51:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to find it as a silver George?</v>

6702
02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:07.213
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6703
02:51:07.410 --> 02:51:08.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

6704
02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:09.690
<v Speaker 1>And then even the websites,</v>

6705
02:51:09.691 --> 02:51:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you notice all the,</v>

6706
02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:11.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6707
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I read the MMA websites,</v>

6708
02:51:12.961 --> 02:51:13.710
<v Speaker 1>said Bree single day,</v>

6709
02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:16.680
<v Speaker 1>and then there's always at least once a week there's something about George is</v>

6710
02:51:16.681 --> 02:51:19.230
<v Speaker 1>doing this or he might come back or this is happening.</v>

6711
02:51:19.231 --> 02:51:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And so he's still,</v>

6712
02:51:20.340 --> 02:51:21.100
<v Speaker 1>he's still relevant.</v>

6713
02:51:21.100 --> 02:51:22.410
<v Speaker 1>He's still hasn't disappeared yet.</v>

6714
02:51:22.411 --> 02:51:23.040
<v Speaker 1>There's still that.</v>

6715
02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:24.840
<v Speaker 1>They still need him in that circle.</v>

6716
02:51:24.990 --> 02:51:28.440
<v Speaker 1>We still training Norco was a in,</v>

6717
02:51:28.441 --> 02:51:28.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6718
02:51:28.890 --> 02:51:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Tristar recently and he had done some training with George and I think,</v>

6719
02:51:32.371 --> 02:51:32.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6720
02:51:32.611 --> 02:51:34.200
<v Speaker 1>George still has a little bit of the Itch,</v>

6721
02:51:34.201 --> 02:51:35.034
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

6722
02:51:35.070 --> 02:51:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I'd love for him to come back.</v>

6723
02:51:36.001 --> 02:51:36.541
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>

6724
02:51:36.541 --> 02:51:36.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6725
02:51:36.890 --> 02:51:37.590
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

6726
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:38.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6727
02:51:38.020 --> 02:51:40.890
<v Speaker 1>he is UFC and he's such a great ambassador as well.</v>

6728
02:51:40.891 --> 02:51:42.430
<v Speaker 1>He's not just the gentleman,</v>

6729
02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:43.500
<v Speaker 1>not just a great fighter,</v>

6730
02:51:43.501 --> 02:51:45.060
<v Speaker 1>but he represents everything good.</v>

6731
02:51:45.061 --> 02:51:46.470
<v Speaker 1>That's about combat sports.</v>

6732
02:51:47.010 --> 02:51:47.843
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

6733
02:51:47.970 --> 02:51:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Everything good about martial arts.</v>

6734
02:51:49.261 --> 02:51:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And he started as a martial artist.</v>

6735
02:51:51.031 --> 02:51:51.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6736
02:51:51.181 --> 02:51:52.230
<v Speaker 1>that's really what he is.</v>

6737
02:51:52.350 --> 02:51:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6738
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:54.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's why he would always go to the,</v>

6739
02:51:54.860 --> 02:51:56.810
<v Speaker 1>and to the octagon with his key on.</v>

6740
02:51:56.811 --> 02:51:57.211
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

6741
02:51:57.211 --> 02:51:57.901
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>

02:51:57.901 --> 02:51:58.620
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

6743
02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:02.070
<v Speaker 1>he's a real unique guy and no better ambassador.</v>

6744
02:52:02.100 --> 02:52:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Like in,</v>

6745
02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:05.190
<v Speaker 1>in his time to carry the flag.</v>

6746
02:52:05.320 --> 02:52:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6747
02:52:05.770 --> 02:52:06.161

6754
02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:16.330
<v Speaker 1>whereas George has always stayed grounded and then people would come up and</v>

6778
02:52:56.380 --> 02:52:57.101
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't like it,</v>

6779
02:52:57.101 --> 02:52:59.320
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time he does it well.</v>

02:53:03.370 --> 02:53:06.670
<v Speaker 1>He's a very open minded to have watched him train with people.</v>

6785
02:53:06.671 --> 02:53:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen you in a few confrontations on Youtube where people are a bit</v>

6786
02:53:10.121 --> 02:53:11.080
<v Speaker 1>aggressive when it comes.</v>

6787
02:53:11.090 --> 02:53:15.220
<v Speaker 1>The comes to asking for your stuff and you give half to give them a slight,</v>

6788
02:53:15.221 --> 02:53:15.610

6791
02:53:17.140 --> 02:53:20.200

6792
02:53:20.201 --> 02:53:20.950
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

6799
02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst drug in the world for people to make mistakes under pressure too</v>

02:54:48.071 --> 02:54:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It was cool.</v>

6861
02:54:48.820 --> 02:54:50.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a highlight of a,</v>

6862
02:54:50.171 --> 02:54:51.820
<v Speaker 1>we should have probably recorded the whole thing.</v>

6863
02:54:51.850 --> 02:54:52.050
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

6864
02:54:52.050 --> 02:54:53.950
<v Speaker 1>there was a highlight of like an whatever,</v>

6865
02:54:53.951 --> 02:54:55.630
<v Speaker 1>an hour and a half of us training together.</v>

6866
02:54:55.780 --> 02:54:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

6867
02:54:56.470 --> 02:55:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I was really impressed with the lot of the variations of techniques you do.</v>

6868
02:55:01.811 --> 02:55:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Like the way you throw the knee.</v>

6869
02:55:03.291 --> 02:55:04.124
<v Speaker 1>Especially,</v>

6870
02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I never saw anybody throw a knee with like it completely sideways the way you</v>

6871
02:55:08.211 --> 02:55:10.640
<v Speaker 2>did it and the combinations in which you did it.</v>

6872
02:55:10.641 --> 02:55:14.180
<v Speaker 2>So I think in MMA or an in any martial art,</v>

6873
02:55:14.810 --> 02:55:19.430
<v Speaker 2>it's always cool when you get a chance to work with people and learn a bunch of</v>

6874
02:55:19.431 --> 02:55:24.170
<v Speaker 2>different shit and at the end of it like throwing some light kicks and and you</v>

6875
02:55:24.171 --> 02:55:24.411
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

6876
02:55:24.411 --> 02:55:26.450
<v Speaker 2>and punches and stuff and moving around with each other.</v>

6877
02:55:26.451 --> 02:55:27.380
<v Speaker 2>To me it was just fun.</v>

6878
02:55:27.410 --> 02:55:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6879
02:55:27.570 --> 02:55:29.430
<v Speaker 2>The suspected a bulging disc.</v>

6880
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6881
02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Well it's definitely something with it,</v>

6882
02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:34.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's better now that take it like,</v>

6883
02:55:34.311 --> 02:55:35.720
<v Speaker 2>like we were competing like,</v>

6884
02:55:36.110 --> 02:55:37.370
<v Speaker 2>like a UFC title.</v>

6885
02:55:38.060 --> 02:55:41.450
<v Speaker 2>It was a place by or in your garage for shits and giggles.</v>

6886
02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:42.890
<v Speaker 2>You can't read that though,</v>

6887
02:55:42.891 --> 02:55:43.230
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6888
02:55:43.230 --> 02:55:43.620
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

6889
02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:44.720
<v Speaker 2>You're reading the comments.</v>

6890
02:55:44.721 --> 02:55:45.554
<v Speaker 2>You can't read those.</v>

6891
02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:48.050
<v Speaker 2>That's like open yourself up to the retards of the world.</v>

6892
02:55:48.051 --> 02:55:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

6893
02:55:48.410 --> 02:55:49.243
<v Speaker 2>Hey retards.</v>

6894
02:55:49.490 --> 02:55:49.761
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

6895
02:55:49.761 --> 02:55:50.090
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

6896
02:55:50.090 --> 02:55:52.580
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel I should govern my life?</v>

6897
02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:53.570
<v Speaker 2>What should I do differently?</v>

6898
02:55:56.620 --> 02:55:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6899
02:55:57.260 --> 02:55:58.580
<v Speaker 2>good news or</v>

6900
02:56:01.140 --> 02:56:02.180
<v Speaker 2>some shit.</v>

6901
02:56:03.250 --> 02:56:03.981
<v Speaker 2>You just can't,</v>

6902
02:56:03.981 --> 02:56:04.930
<v Speaker 2>you can't listen to that.</v>

6903
02:56:04.931 --> 02:56:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I remember I sent you a private message about two weeks,</v>

6904
02:56:07.571 --> 02:56:08.404
<v Speaker 2>let us gun do.</v>

6905
02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:09.020
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

6906
02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:09.860
<v Speaker 2>how do you put up with it?</v>

6907
02:56:09.861 --> 02:56:10.400
<v Speaker 2>And you said,</v>

6908
02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:12.240
<v Speaker 2>you said just read it.</v>

6909
02:56:12.670 --> 02:56:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Your hook or folk don't go to good to be a world trip.</v>

6910
02:56:14.811 --> 02:56:18.760
<v Speaker 2>But if it was balled me bro and open them up and then,</v>

6911
02:56:18.820 --> 02:56:19.141
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6912
02:56:19.141 --> 02:56:20.600
<v Speaker 2>then directing your technique.</v>

6913
02:56:20.601 --> 02:56:21.434
<v Speaker 2>It was hilarious.</v>

6914
02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Was just please shut the fuck up.</v>

6915
02:56:24.030 --> 02:56:29.030
<v Speaker 2>There was a segment of you showing me a particular combination and someone was</v>

6916
02:56:29.661 --> 02:56:31.100
<v Speaker 2>saying that you were showing it wrong.</v>

6917
02:56:31.250 --> 02:56:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

6918
02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I was reading that and I was like,</v>

6919
02:56:32.871 --> 02:56:33.704
<v Speaker 2>what am I reading this?</v>

6920
02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:34.521
<v Speaker 2>What am I,</v>

6921
02:56:34.521 --> 02:56:34.971
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>

6922
02:56:34.971 --> 02:56:35.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

6923
02:56:35.151 --> 02:56:35.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

6924
02:56:35.290 --> 02:56:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even taking my own advice.</v>

6925
02:56:37.250 --> 02:56:38.180
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile if you,</v>

6926
02:56:38.181 --> 02:56:40.910
<v Speaker 2>if you found that guy probably weighs six pounds,</v>

6927
02:56:41.180 --> 02:56:42.560
<v Speaker 2>he's in his mom's basement,</v>

6928
02:56:42.561 --> 02:56:43.580
<v Speaker 2>shit in his own pants.</v>

6929
02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Like who knows who you're listening when you read a sentence on the Internet and</v>

6930
02:56:48.951 --> 02:56:51.050
<v Speaker 2>it starts with a letter and it ends with a period,</v>

6931
02:56:51.051 --> 02:56:54.050
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a normal person wrote it and you just read it.</v>

6932
02:56:54.051 --> 02:56:59.051
<v Speaker 2>Like if you wrote a sentence or if he wrote a sentence or some crazy dude who</v>

6933
02:56:59.241 --> 02:57:02.210
<v Speaker 2>has no fucking grasp of reality at all,</v>

6934
02:57:02.330 --> 02:57:06.170
<v Speaker 2>it still looks the same because it's a sentence and you don't know.</v>

6935
02:57:06.171 --> 02:57:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Like when you read someone's opinion,</v>

6936
02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:08.150
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what the,</v>

6937
02:57:08.150 --> 02:57:08.983
<v Speaker 2>what's that guy like?</v>

6938
02:57:09.140 --> 02:57:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the thing about opinions.</v>

6939
02:57:10.731 --> 02:57:11.480
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

6940
02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:13.010
<v Speaker 2>there's always guys and you know them,</v>

6941
02:57:13.011 --> 02:57:13.820
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows him.</v>

6942
02:57:13.820 --> 02:57:16.850
<v Speaker 2>There's always guys in the gym that will see someone and they probably don't</v>

6943
02:57:16.851 --> 02:57:17.990
<v Speaker 2>know what the fuck they're doing,</v>

6944
02:57:18.140 --> 02:57:21.110
<v Speaker 2>but they'll see someone hitting the bag or they see someone doing the technique</v>

6945
02:57:21.111 --> 02:57:22.340
<v Speaker 2>and they'll come over and correct them.</v>

6946
02:57:22.490 --> 02:57:22.731
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6947
02:57:22.731 --> 02:57:24.350
<v Speaker 2>There's always those fucking morons,</v>

6948
02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:24.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6949
02:57:24.711 --> 02:57:26.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a million of those fucking morons,</v>

6950
02:57:26.391 --> 02:57:27.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6951
02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6952
02:57:27.770 --> 02:57:31.490
<v Speaker 2>when you meet that guy and you know he's an idiot and you know that guy from the</v>

6953
02:57:31.491 --> 02:57:32.060
<v Speaker 2>gym,</v>

6954
02:57:32.060 --> 02:57:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you can just go,</v>

6955
02:57:32.930 --> 02:57:33.231
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6956
02:57:33.231 --> 02:57:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Mike is the guy who gave you advice.</v>

6957
02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Mike's half retarded.</v>

6958
02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:38.750
<v Speaker 2>He got shot in the head when he was two.</v>

6959
02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:39.793
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

6960
02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:41.060
<v Speaker 2>This is a difference.</v>

6961
02:57:41.061 --> 02:57:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Treat that and like seeing the guy's written words.</v>

6962
02:57:44.250 --> 02:57:49.070
<v Speaker 2>It's the beautiful thing about the Internet is that anybody can say anything.</v>

6963
02:57:49.250 --> 02:57:50.270
<v Speaker 2>They can just that you,</v>

6964
02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:50.630
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

6965
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:51.020
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

6966
02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:52.970
<v Speaker 2>you have a full open,</v>

6967
02:57:52.971 --> 02:57:55.370
<v Speaker 2>free forum for expressing yourself.</v>

6968
02:57:55.400 --> 02:57:58.910
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is if you have a million people,</v>

6969
02:57:58.940 --> 02:57:59.773
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

6970
02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:04.410
<v Speaker 2>at least 1% of those people are going to be out of their fucking minds.</v>

6971
02:58:04.890 --> 02:58:07.950
<v Speaker 2>At least 1% so if you've got a hundred people,</v>

6972
02:58:07.951 --> 02:58:09.060
<v Speaker 2>that's one person.</v>

6973
02:58:09.270 --> 02:58:13.200
<v Speaker 2>But if you've got a million people or 100 million people,</v>

6974
02:58:13.410 --> 02:58:14.191
<v Speaker 2>look at the United States,</v>

6975
02:58:14.191 --> 02:58:15.540
<v Speaker 2>300 million people,</v>

6976
02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:18.870
<v Speaker 2>how many of those people are out of their fucking mind?</v>

6977
02:58:18.900 --> 02:58:20.250
<v Speaker 2>It's at least 3 million.</v>

6978
02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:23.430
<v Speaker 2>At least 3 million douchebag.</v>

6979
02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:27.090
<v Speaker 2>They're leaving comments on Youtube and they get in John Wayne part and talk</v>

6980
02:58:27.091 --> 02:58:27.924
<v Speaker 2>about them.</v>

6981
02:58:28.860 --> 02:58:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I was right.</v>

6982
02:58:30.270 --> 02:58:31.103
<v Speaker 2>It was right.</v>

6983
02:58:31.140 --> 02:58:31.451
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

6984
02:58:31.451 --> 02:58:32.400
<v Speaker 2>say it all you want,</v>

6985
02:58:32.401 --> 02:58:34.350
<v Speaker 2>you'll fucking techniques dog shit.</v>

6986
02:58:35.340 --> 02:58:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you got to be a world champion Brown.</v>

6987
02:58:38.690 --> 02:58:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

6988
02:58:39.210 --> 02:58:40.110
<v Speaker 2>not on my watch.</v>

6989
02:58:42.730 --> 02:58:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what,</v>

6990
02:58:44.720 --> 02:58:46.020
<v Speaker 2>it's switch gonna get man.</v>

6991
02:58:46.050 --> 02:58:46.620
<v Speaker 2>It's the world,</v>

6992
02:58:46.620 --> 02:58:47.453
<v Speaker 2>the world we live in.</v>

6993
02:58:47.600 --> 02:58:48.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful world though.</v>

6994
02:58:48.960 --> 02:58:51.350
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful and it's chaos and it's,</v>

6995
02:58:51.351 --> 02:58:52.110
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

6996
02:58:52.110 --> 02:58:53.020
<v Speaker 2>But you got to,</v>

6997
02:58:53.190 --> 02:58:57.060
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all learning how to navigate this world and the world of comments</v>

6998
02:58:57.061 --> 02:58:57.710
<v Speaker 2>on like,</v>

6999
02:58:57.710 --> 02:59:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that won't go on the underground anymore.</v>

7000
02:59:00.331 --> 02:59:00.541
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7001
02:59:00.541 --> 02:59:01.021
<v Speaker 2>fighters,</v>

02:59:01.021 --> 02:59:01.741
<v Speaker 2>they just won't go.</v>

7003
02:59:01.741 --> 02:59:02.130
<v Speaker 2>The Guy,</v>

7004
02:59:02.130 --> 02:59:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

7005
02:59:02.880 --> 02:59:03.840
<v Speaker 2>it hurts my feelings.</v>

7006
02:59:04.010 --> 02:59:04.290
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

7007
02:59:04.290 --> 02:59:04.711
<v Speaker 2>I'll read it,</v>

7008
02:59:04.711 --> 02:59:06.630
<v Speaker 2>but which people are saying about me and it hurts me,</v>

7009
02:59:06.631 --> 02:59:08.530
<v Speaker 2>but it only hurts you if you don't know that.</v>

7010
02:59:08.550 --> 02:59:09.180
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

7011
02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:10.860
<v Speaker 2>if you knew that guy wouldn't hurt you,</v>

7012
02:59:11.250 --> 02:59:11.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7013
02:59:11.641 --> 02:59:13.140
<v Speaker 2>if you were around him when he was saying that,</v>

7014
02:59:13.141 --> 02:59:13.530
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

7015
02:59:13.530 --> 02:59:14.363
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7016
02:59:14.580 --> 02:59:16.200
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking idiot.</v>

7017
02:59:16.410 --> 02:59:18.030
<v Speaker 2>You're an idiot with a typewriter.</v>

7018
02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:18.650
<v Speaker 2>You get it.</v>

7019
02:59:18.650 --> 02:59:19.530
<v Speaker 2>The type keys.</v>

7020
02:59:19.620 --> 02:59:20.011
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7021
02:59:20.011 --> 02:59:20.341
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

7022
02:59:20.341 --> 02:59:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

7023
02:59:21.150 --> 02:59:22.050
<v Speaker 2>But you don't get it.</v>

7024
02:59:22.051 --> 02:59:23.310
<v Speaker 2>When you see this a sentence,</v>

7025
02:59:23.311 --> 02:59:23.821
<v Speaker 2>a sentence.</v>

7026
02:59:23.821 --> 02:59:27.950
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a normal person wrote that Diego Sanchez written wrote on Twitter</v>

7027
02:59:27.951 --> 02:59:28.784
<v Speaker 2>and saying,</v>

7028
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:30.150
<v Speaker 2>you bag me up.</v>

7029
02:59:30.151 --> 02:59:31.740
<v Speaker 2>But I bet if we met in person,</v>

7030
02:59:31.741 --> 02:59:33.750
<v Speaker 2>you'd be the first one to me for my gruff.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

7033
02:59:35.010 --> 02:59:36.150
<v Speaker 2>They would just say that to him.</v>

7034
02:59:36.170 --> 02:59:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7036
02:59:37.890 --> 02:59:39.720
<v Speaker 2>How can you talk shit about Diego Sanchez?</v>

7042
02:59:54.421 --> 02:59:57.210

7043
02:59:57.211 --> 03:00:00.810

<v Speaker 2>almost has 'em out.</v>

7052
03:00:16.380 --> 03:00:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with Jake Ellenberger.</v>

7053
03:00:17.521 --> 03:00:19.660
<v Speaker 2>He's back to take his bag.</v>

7054

<v Speaker 2>Man Diego's a warrior that guys my respect forever.</v>

03:00:27.511 --> 03:00:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Losing his fucking face is falling off in the third round.</v>

7060
03:00:30.961 --> 03:00:32.760
<v Speaker 2>He's chasing Martin Kampmann down.</v>

7061
03:00:33.030 --> 03:00:34.350
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

7062
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7063
03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:36.630
<v Speaker 2>you got to good ears.</v>

7064
03:00:36.660 --> 03:00:37.493
<v Speaker 2>Pick worries is,</v>

7065
03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:38.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7066
03:00:38.371 --> 03:00:39.150
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

7067
03:00:39.150 --> 03:00:42.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of disrespectful shitheads out there.</v>

7068
03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:43.470
<v Speaker 2>And just do you think,</v>

7069
03:00:43.471 --> 03:00:44.640
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's because of the,</v>

7070
03:00:44.641 --> 03:00:45.474
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

7071
03:00:45.690 --> 03:00:46.351
<v Speaker 2>with my toy,</v>

7072
03:00:46.351 --> 03:00:47.184
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

7073
03:00:47.220 --> 03:00:52.220
<v Speaker 2>we have a culture that's very Buddhism and is very sweaty cop and everything.</v>

7074
03:00:52.951 --> 03:00:53.790
<v Speaker 2>The whole business.</v>

7075
03:00:53.791 --> 03:00:56.550
<v Speaker 2>It isn't that it's pain that that means what you're saying.</v>

7076
03:00:56.600 --> 03:00:56.801
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

7077
03:00:56.801 --> 03:00:57.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

7078
03:00:57.121 --> 03:00:58.090
<v Speaker 2>it's an hour and put it in.</v>

7079
03:00:58.091 --> 03:01:00.520
<v Speaker 2>But most of these people full time to time,</v>

7080
03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:01.070
<v Speaker 2>the class,</v>

7081
03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:02.390
<v Speaker 2>the whole prayer,</v>

7082
03:01:02.440 --> 03:01:02.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

7083
03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:04.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a way of showing that I'm anomaly.</v>

7084
03:01:04.540 --> 03:01:05.850
<v Speaker 2>That's the original,</v>

7085
03:01:06.370 --> 03:01:10.210
<v Speaker 2>instead of shaking hands or toys and then the males aren't touching the females</v>

7086
03:01:10.211 --> 03:01:10.481
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

7087
03:01:10.481 --> 03:01:11.314
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a,</v>

7088
03:01:11.340 --> 03:01:11.770
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

7089
03:01:11.770 --> 03:01:15.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a real humility in a real honest appreciation of each other.</v>

7090
03:01:15.860 --> 03:01:19.060
<v Speaker 2>And they had this century old culture,</v>

7091
03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:23.110
<v Speaker 2>whereas the MMA is so tapping out written,</v>

7092
03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:23.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7093
03:01:24.010 --> 03:01:24.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7094
03:01:24.450 --> 03:01:25.230
<v Speaker 2>bad wise,</v>

7095
03:01:25.230 --> 03:01:25.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7096
03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:26.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7097
03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:27.870
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

7098
03:01:27.990 --> 03:01:29.130
<v Speaker 2>the fans are,</v>

7099
03:01:29.380 --> 03:01:31.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a different sort of culture.</v>

7100
03:01:31.900 --> 03:01:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe it's Sorta,</v>

7101
03:01:33.310 --> 03:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>well that bro Dude,</v>

7102
03:01:34.391 --> 03:01:36.400
<v Speaker 2>bullshit was frowned upon and talk window.</v>

7103
03:01:36.401 --> 03:01:36.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7104
03:01:36.641 --> 03:01:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in talk window and which is very,</v>

7105
03:01:39.250 --> 03:01:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I always spoke to my instructor.</v>

7106
03:01:40.751 --> 03:01:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I called him Sir or mister,</v>

7107
03:01:42.970 --> 03:01:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Kim or sir,</v>

7108
03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:45.671
<v Speaker 2>he said what?</v>

7109
03:01:45.671 --> 03:01:46.510
<v Speaker 2>He said something to me,</v>

7110
03:01:46.511 --> 03:01:47.260
<v Speaker 2>there was no question.</v>

7111
03:01:47.260 --> 03:01:48.130
<v Speaker 2>It was always yes sir.</v>

7112
03:01:48.340 --> 03:01:49.090
<v Speaker 2>And it was always,</v>

7113
03:01:49.090 --> 03:01:54.090
<v Speaker 2>there was this bowing respect type admiration that you had for your instructor</v>

7114
03:01:54.821 --> 03:01:56.110
<v Speaker 2>and for fellow competitors.</v>

7115
03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:57.311
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

7116
03:01:57.311 --> 03:01:58.990
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part of what martial arts is.</v>

7117
03:01:58.991 --> 03:02:00.460
<v Speaker 2>This is respect for each other.</v>

7118
03:02:00.820 --> 03:02:01.451
<v Speaker 2>And on the other hand,</v>

7119
03:02:01.451 --> 03:02:02.950
<v Speaker 2>I like the shit talking.</v>

7120
03:02:02.980 --> 03:02:03.401
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

7121
03:02:03.401 --> 03:02:04.870
<v Speaker 2>like with Conor McGregor does,</v>

7122
03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I like the just bleed guy in the audience.</v>

7123
03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:10.180
<v Speaker 2>It's fun too,</v>

7124
03:02:10.181 --> 03:02:13.480
<v Speaker 2>but I think you lose something where there's a,</v>

7125
03:02:13.481 --> 03:02:15.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a beautiful respect to [inaudible].</v>

7126
03:02:15.580 --> 03:02:17.050
<v Speaker 2>And there's another thing about ties.</v>

7127
03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:18.670
<v Speaker 2>The audiences are respectful.</v>

7128
03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:20.200
<v Speaker 2>When you go to those events,</v>

7129
03:02:20.350 --> 03:02:23.200
<v Speaker 2>like you very rarely hear stupid shipping yelled at,</v>

7130
03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:24.820
<v Speaker 2>even though people were drinking.</v>

7131
03:02:24.970 --> 03:02:25.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

7132
03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:29.920
<v Speaker 2>there's applause for both the winner and the loser is a tremendous amount of</v>

7133
03:02:29.921 --> 03:02:31.600
<v Speaker 2>respect that's involved in it because,</v>

7134
03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:34.660
<v Speaker 2>because it's not that popular because it's not mainstream.</v>

7135
03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Those people in the audience have a deep appreciation for the art of Moitai.</v>

7136
03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7137
03:02:39.670 --> 03:02:40.240
<v Speaker 2>They hide.</v>

7138
03:02:40.240 --> 03:02:41.073
<v Speaker 2>They are there for,</v>

7139
03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:42.050
<v Speaker 2>because they want to see it.</v>

7140
03:02:42.051 --> 03:02:45.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's on TV and then just watching it for the sake of watching that</v>

7141
03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:45.430
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

7142
03:02:45.430 --> 03:02:47.550
<v Speaker 2>because they want to be there now.</v>

7143
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:48.700
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason.</v>

7144
03:02:48.701 --> 03:02:49.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not a scene.</v>

7145
03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:52.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're there to see Moy Tai.</v>

7146
03:02:52.590 --> 03:02:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7147
03:02:53.020 --> 03:02:53.411
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

7148
03:02:53.411 --> 03:02:54.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

7149
03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:54.221
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

7150
03:02:54.221 --> 03:02:55.620
<v Speaker 2>they call the MMA culture.</v>

7151
03:02:55.660 --> 03:02:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Just say,</v>

7152
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

7153
03:02:56.840 --> 03:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of fucking posing and fake and assholes and my friends,</v>

7154
03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll get my friends tickets,</v>

7155
03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:04.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7156
03:03:04.301 --> 03:03:07.000
<v Speaker 2>and they'll go to the fights and they'll sit beside some guys like,</v>

7157
03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:07.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

7158
03:03:07.570 --> 03:03:12.570
<v Speaker 2>does the fucking punk fucking kick people just yell out advice and they get</v>

7159
03:03:14.651 --> 03:03:16.020
<v Speaker 2>drunk and they're stupid.</v>

7160
03:03:16.030 --> 03:03:18.310
<v Speaker 2>They're posing because they're insecure.</v>

7161
03:03:18.311 --> 03:03:21.130
<v Speaker 2>So they're drunk at these events and they're trying to pretend that they know</v>

7162
03:03:21.131 --> 03:03:21.970
<v Speaker 2>more than the fighter.</v>

7163
03:03:22.010 --> 03:03:22.843
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

7164
03:03:23.670 --> 03:03:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

7165
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Overwhelming.</v>

7166
03:03:24.970 --> 03:03:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7167
03:03:25.420 --> 03:03:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that the human race survives this era.</v>

7168
03:03:28.530 --> 03:03:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7169
03:03:28.750 --> 03:03:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm really hoping that we just,</v>

7170
03:03:30.041 --> 03:03:33.700
<v Speaker 2>this Internet era enlightens us to our douchey ways and we just,</v>

7171
03:03:33.701 --> 03:03:38.590
<v Speaker 2>we just slowly but surely rise from the ashes of what we've created.</v>

7172
03:03:38.591 --> 03:03:40.690
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know when I read comments,</v>

7173
03:03:40.691 --> 03:03:41.530
