<v Speaker 1>A bunch of different colors there has.</v>

57
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.930

<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

128
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.480
<v Speaker 2>The idea that I show American Werewolf </v>
<v Speaker 2>in London got me hooked.</v>

129
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was 1981 and I was aware will fan.</v>

130
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I was done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still do other shit like Lon </v>

131
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Chaney member.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the problem with this wolf man </v>

132
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.030
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went with a mask.</v>

133
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 2>It's Benicia del Toro and a mask and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

134
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.570
<v Speaker 2>and his lower jaw sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I show the transformation with the arms </v>

135
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 2>and the fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of,</v>

137
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of cool CGI in the </v>

138
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the final product just looks.</v>

139
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.220
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't look right because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like he tried to use the old wolf man </v>

140
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 2>from like the 19 forties or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it was.</v>

141
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 2>He was at Claude rains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

142
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 2>to try to use that version of the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 2>man and just make a more modern,</v>

143
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 2>updated look after you go to American </v>
<v Speaker 2>Werewolf in London,</v>

144
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:19.541

<v Speaker 2>You can't because American Werewolf in </v>

<v Speaker 2>London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking thing was evil man.</v>

146
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:25.991

<v Speaker 2>Demon thing was on a four legs because </v>

00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:32.271
<v Speaker 2>and you just see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did that movie so well.</v>

150
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:36.911
<v Speaker 2>You don't really get to see it that much</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the technology was not that </v>

151
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:40.391
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only one time you get to actually </v>

152
00:06:40.391 --> 00:06:42.281
<v Speaker 2>see the Werewolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going through the streets of </v>

00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:44.291
<v Speaker 2>London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snap and people's heads off from </v>

154
00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:44.291

<v Speaker 2>streets.</v>

155
00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's freaking out and car accidents </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

156
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.750

<v Speaker 2>moving around every other time in the </v>

157
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.750
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're barely see it,</v>

158
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 2>but you see it enough that it's fucking </v>

233
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:06.700
<v Speaker 2>They used to have like songs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would play songs.</v>

234
00:10:06.701 --> 00:10:08.240
<v Speaker 2>They would do like sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

235
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.840
<v Speaker 2>it was a dumb ass show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was a kid I enjoyed it.</v>

236
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.900
<v Speaker 2>I used to go there for boobs also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember Benny Hill and he hollered my</v>

237
00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:15.400
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 2>They had the blogs with Benny Hill would</v>
<v Speaker 2>show you it as something and they </v>

240
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.680
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't catch it on channel nine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those days.</v>

241
00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:24.970
<v Speaker 2>So he got away with murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

242
00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:29.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying Benny Hill was the first guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have like a real silly showing him </v>

243
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:33.571

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

246
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Benny Hill always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's because there's too many people.</v>

247
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that when when there gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>overpopulation naturally people get more</v>

248
00:10:50.141 --> 00:10:52.270
<v Speaker 2>reluctant to hide shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We took,</v>

249
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.420
<v Speaker 2>we disregarded the heartland because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got cialis.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was a big deal because you can take </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking pills.</v>

347
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 2>human face I've ever seen in my life or </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so hilarious.</v>

348
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Let me go back to Seattle with brody </v>
<v Speaker 2>brody when they used to drive his car to</v>

349
00:15:35.221 --> 00:15:38.250
<v Speaker 2>the Gig harbor and he used to cry that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was speeding in this car.</v>

350
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Tell us a classic brody story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put them in the truck and drove to </v>

351
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.321
<v Speaker 2>Gig harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me they would take them two </v>

352
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:47.321
<v Speaker 2>hours and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll bet you any amount of money I could</v>

353
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:47.321
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not when.</v>

354
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no you can't.</v>

355
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.560
<v Speaker 2>And we put them in the backseat with </v>
<v Speaker 2>soundgarden blast and they kept saying,</v>

356
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.860
<v Speaker 2>global people don't live like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing fucking right hand lane,</v>

357
00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.880
<v Speaker 2>cutting off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

358
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Stop Joe Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not want to be in the car with </v>

361
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.600
<v Speaker 2>that's tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He stopped the show because there was a </v>

362
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.881
<v Speaker 2>bunch of head shots on the wall and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped the show because there was no </v>

363
00:16:12.881 --> 00:16:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Jews on the wall.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Brody gets these bad late nights spots </v>

367
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:23.651
<v Speaker 2>or at least he used to at the store and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:25.820
<v Speaker 2>sometimes he'd get up there and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd would be dead.</v>

369
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:26.870
<v Speaker 2>There'd be no one left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

370
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

371
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:31.370

<v Speaker 2>And Brody would be on like after 1:00</v>

372
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.870
<v Speaker 2>AM 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

373
00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:35.570
<v Speaker 2>He'd go on and he would just start </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the drums.</v>

374
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:40.571
<v Speaker 2>He would pull chairs up and pull out as </v>
<v Speaker 2>drumsticks and start playing the drums </v>

375
00:16:40.571 --> 00:16:41.210
<v Speaker 2>and just start ad libbing and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

376

<v Speaker 2>And before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

377
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:44.420

<v Speaker 2>eight people there,</v>

<v Speaker 2>one in the audience and people barely </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention.</v>

383
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 2>But every now and then someone would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and just do something magical in that</v>

384
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.360
<v Speaker 2>zero crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight people was all I needed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's these magical moments where,</v>

413
00:18:27.221 --> 00:18:30.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dude just hit some rare place on stage</v>

<v Speaker 4>And that place,</v>

415
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.870
<v Speaker 4>that place at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was so many of those moments.</v>

416
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.230
<v Speaker 4>When did you,</v>

419
00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.680
<v Speaker 4>It was so real because there was no one </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

420
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.800
<v Speaker 4>there was no one there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like you could see large </v>

421
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:49.800
<v Speaker 4>audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you can trick them,</v>

422
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.170
<v Speaker 4>you can sing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they clap and they love you.</v>

425
00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.760

<v Speaker 4>standing ovation.</v>

426
00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.830
<v Speaker 4>But it's really a bunch of dumb shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>sufficiently,</v>

428
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.990
<v Speaker 4>but you're not going to get that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>response at all.</v>

429
00:19:04.991 --> 00:19:07.480
<v Speaker 4>Like five people when there's only five </v>
<v Speaker 4>people there.</v>

430
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.800

<v Speaker 4>inside you when there's like five or six</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

432
00:19:14.561 --> 00:19:19.561
<v Speaker 4>There can be no fat in your act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where your jokes sounds so gross </v>

433
00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:22.170

436
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It teaches you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing I give the comedy </v>

<v Speaker 1>I never hit magical moments like that in</v>

439
00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:38.371
<v Speaker 1>another club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The original room and the main room </v>

440
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:39.220

443
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:49.180

<v Speaker 1>there and do what the fuck I want to do.</v>

444
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Which is really what comedy really isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way.</v>

445
00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:53.080
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unprepared.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Five hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my world for five people on </v>

454
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere at the sentence.</v>

455
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.900
<v Speaker 1>That's as fun as it gets.</v>

456
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Start laughing and rocking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so genuine.</v>

457
00:20:17.231 --> 00:20:19.300
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those moments are so genuine.</v>

458
00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.710
<v Speaker 4>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no fat,</v>

459

<v Speaker 4>no small crowds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

460
00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:27.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally different style of comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's something I realized when I </v>

461
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.301
<v Speaker 4>started doing larger venues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's harder sometimes to get </v>

462
00:20:30.301 --> 00:20:34.040
<v Speaker 4>you to be like one-on-one reel with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>large venue because like you don't want </v>

463
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.800
<v Speaker 4>to give them too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dead air taught him.</v>

464
00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.420
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to give them too much </v>
<v Speaker 4>time to contemplate.</v>

465
00:20:37.421 --> 00:20:42.421
<v Speaker 4>There's too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just too hard to control all of </v>

466
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:42.421
<v Speaker 4>them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more,</v>

467
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:43.090
<v Speaker 4>it becomes more of like a show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like if you're doing it for like</v>

468
00:20:43.091 --> 00:20:48.091
<v Speaker 4>just a few people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something fucking crazy about </v>

469
00:20:48.091 --> 00:20:51.091
<v Speaker 4>that man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every is dangerfield story where we did </v>

470
00:20:51.091 --> 00:20:52.090
<v Speaker 4>call me like four different guys did </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy for two people.</v>

471
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.960
<v Speaker 4>We were at dangerfield show as part </v>
<v Speaker 4>started,</v>

472
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.620
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

473
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.620

<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

474
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.190
<v Speaker 4>My spot was at like 9:30.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got there at 9:00</v>

475
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 4>and everybody's just waiting in the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

476
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:03.730
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

477
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 4>no one's here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one,</v>

478
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 4>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no crowd at all.</v>

479
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.770
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do we do?</v>

480
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 4>We leave now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna wait for people to show up,</v>

481
00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:11.080
<v Speaker 4>see if nobody shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we went,</v>

482
00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:16.081
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And were there for maybe 15 minutes and </v>

483
00:21:16.081 --> 00:21:18.230
<v Speaker 4>a couple walks in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now there was a guy bobby who was </v>

484
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 4>the dorm and this big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerlifting,</v>

485
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Scottish guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was this guy who used to do power </v>

486
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.071
<v Speaker 4>lifting with fucking bags of cement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would take bags of cement and pour </v>

487
00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:30.121
<v Speaker 4>them into those big white plastic </v>
<v Speaker 4>buckets and do fucking power lifting </v>

488
00:21:30.121 --> 00:21:30.121
<v Speaker 4>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

489
00:21:30.121 --> 00:21:30.121
<v Speaker 4>it's just just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

491
00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:38.371
<v Speaker 4>of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the people who've probably way </v>

492
00:21:38.371 --> 00:21:40.861
<v Speaker 4>funnier than 99 percent of the comedians</v>

494
00:21:40.861 --> 00:21:41.820

<v Speaker 4>how come this guy is the doorman?</v>

495

511
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:17.430
<v Speaker 4>The next act is a half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it brings up the next act and he </v>

512
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.401

513
00:22:20.401 --> 00:22:23.371
<v Speaker 4>and I brought on until all these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>people sat there and watched a whole </v>

514
00:22:23.371 --> 00:22:24.370
<v Speaker 4>comedy show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just two people and they sat through the</v>

515
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:24.700
<v Speaker 4>whole thing.</v>

516
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.330
<v Speaker 4>They probably felt trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they probably had a blast too.</v>

517
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.390
<v Speaker 4>They had a blast event from a different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some good comics.</v>

518
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.930
<v Speaker 4>There were some good comics that night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Danger fields was a good place to work </v>

519
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.221
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very similar to the comedy store </v>

520
00:22:40.221 --> 00:22:40.221
<v Speaker 4>and nobody was there that was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch you.</v>

521
00:22:40.221 --> 00:22:40.221
<v Speaker 4>There was no industry people there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

522
00:22:40.221 --> 00:22:42.760
<v Speaker 4>danger fields is not where you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet your manager or your agent.</v>

523
00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:47.761
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird little club that only </v>
<v Speaker 4>the comics like because in a place like </v>

524
00:22:47.761 --> 00:22:51.781
<v Speaker 4>the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the good thing about like a lot of </v>

525
00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:51.781
<v Speaker 4>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

526
00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:51.781
<v Speaker 4>industry won't come to the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

527
00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 4>well you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get this kind of a club.</v>

528
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.360
<v Speaker 4>This kind of an atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the agencies want to come here,</v>

529
00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.070
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to come to this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

530
00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.470
<v Speaker 4>They want to come to the kind of place </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're taken care of.</v>

531
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.680
<v Speaker 4>It's very professional and the manager </v>
<v Speaker 4>takes care of their tab and seats them </v>

532
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.970
<v Speaker 4>and shake their hand and kiss their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The comedy store never gave a fuck about</v>

533
00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:12.060
<v Speaker 4>the agents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck about you.</v>

534
00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.780
<v Speaker 4>You don't even get free tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

535
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.940
<v Speaker 4>And the only way they get free tickets </v>
<v Speaker 4>have you call in.</v>

536
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:16.300
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

537
00:23:16.301 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 4>I need two tickets from my agent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the agent gets free tickets.</v>

538
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.190
<v Speaker 4>If the agents on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fucked.</v>

539
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.790
<v Speaker 4>You know you're going to have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 4>costs 20 bucks and this guy over here,</v>

540
00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:26.100
<v Speaker 4>he's going to take your money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

541
00:23:26.101 --> 00:23:28.720
<v Speaker 4>they don't do that in other clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because of that,</v>

542
00:23:28.721 --> 00:23:32.620
<v Speaker 4>that place was just this place where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>just saw wild shit.</v>

543
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.380
<v Speaker 4>I saw your deck there at least 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

544
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.610
<v Speaker 4>There was at least a hundred times with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

545
00:23:37.611 --> 00:23:42.611
<v Speaker 4>He pulled his dick out as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the way I got to tell this.</v>

546
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:45.230
<v Speaker 4>The first time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girl,</v>

<v Speaker 2>A female comic or the one that sued on </v>

549
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:51.260
<v Speaker 2>barrel name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judy.</v>

550
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Judy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judy can see it.</v>

551
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is what happens.</v>

552
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.330
<v Speaker 2>She goes on to state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't have said her name.</v>

553
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 2>She goes onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's.</v>

554
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.880
<v Speaker 2>She's on stage and she's not doing very </v>
<v Speaker 2>well and we're all barbecued.</v>

555
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.240
<v Speaker 2>We're high as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's eight people.</v>

556
00:24:05.241 --> 00:24:08.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a Monday night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday night know there's nobody there.</v>

557
00:24:08.051 --> 00:24:09.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no one there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a small crowd.</v>

558
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.060
<v Speaker 2>So she's on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey goes into the back area.</v>

559
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:18.440
<v Speaker 2>There's like this backstage area that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the or the or is a small room.</v>

560
00:24:18.441 --> 00:24:23.441
<v Speaker 2>It only seats about a buck 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does have a stage with a little </v>

561
00:24:23.441 --> 00:24:23.830
<v Speaker 2>backstage area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Joey goes into the back stair,</v>

562
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Jj area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes to the backstage area.</v>

563
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:31.121
<v Speaker 2>It takes off all his clothes and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>waits and so she's doing her act and </v>

564
00:24:31.121 --> 00:24:35.651
<v Speaker 2>when she gets to her punchlines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she hits the punchline and Joey opens </v>

565
00:24:35.651 --> 00:24:39.821
<v Speaker 2>the curtains and shakes his dick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then closes them up real quick and the </v>

566
00:24:39.821 --> 00:24:43.271
<v Speaker 2>people go crazy and you see this spark </v>
<v Speaker 2>in her eye like working.</v>

567
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I can finally doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

568
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Now I see what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do it all.</v>

569
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 2>You could see her loosen up and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>confident.</v>

570
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.070
<v Speaker 2>You could see her relax and every time </v>
<v Speaker 2>she had a punchline,</v>

571
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.080
<v Speaker 2>joy would pop up in their current shakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>closer and the people were fucking just </v>

572
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:06.230
<v Speaker 2>stopping their feet laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slapping their tables.</v>

573
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.070
<v Speaker 2>She'd never did know that you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she ever knew she never needed them,</v>

574
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.400
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't break her heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She thought that she was on the phone.</v>

575
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.040
<v Speaker 2>She had so much confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next time you remember the last,</v>

576
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.740
<v Speaker 2>the next time we saw her on stage at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same jokes,</v>

577
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:20.780
<v Speaker 2>just just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't work.</v>

578
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.080
<v Speaker 2>It was like the same day she had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>magic that she had for one night and she</v>

579
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:29.180
<v Speaker 2>didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if she's like,</v>

580
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:31.320
<v Speaker 2>thinking back to what she ate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

581
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I got to eat the same food everyday</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's been eating Heiko Baloney </v>

582
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.520
<v Speaker 2>sandwiches for the last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to talk shit about any booze </v>

583
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.131
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny because nobody's fighting in the </v>

584
00:25:42.131 --> 00:25:42.131
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

585
00:25:42.131 --> 00:25:44.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like how come some people figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to be funny and some people </v>

586
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.950
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

587
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:45.950
<v Speaker 2>funny is a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some folks that,</v>

588
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be intelligent,</v>

589
00:25:47.571 --> 00:25:50.660
<v Speaker 2>they might be cooled and met with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about them that's just</v>

590
00:25:50.661 --> 00:25:52.250
<v Speaker 2>not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

591
00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:55.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's just that no matter how hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>they try for whatever reason,</v>

592
00:25:55.101 --> 00:26:00.101
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't seem to connect with.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's kind of Kinda weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good though,</v>

622
00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.380

<v Speaker 2>The first season and now I can talk </v>

623
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

624
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I thought that John Lift goes season was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best season.</v>

625
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was.</v>

626
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:20.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I said it was only based on the </v>

627
00:27:20.151 --> 00:27:22.341
<v Speaker 2>very first episode that I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted I was getting a little tired of </v>

628
00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:22.800
<v Speaker 2>the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every week somebody gets murdered,</v>

629
00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:27.801
<v Speaker 2>thing for whatever is a formula to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you get caught with 20 minutes </v>

630
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:30.970
<v Speaker 2>late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes left in the show,</v>

631
00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:31.920
<v Speaker 2>who's going to kill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

632
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you what,</v>

633
00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:34.130
<v Speaker 2>that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the smiths,</v>

634
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Speaker 2>third season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever his name is,</v>

635
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Smith or whatever his name is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don thought that was the worst season.</v>

636
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I hated that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

637
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I did not like that season in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the best.</v>

638
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 2>The best season was the first one.</v>

639
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.510
<v Speaker 2>The first one was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

640
00:27:45.511 --> 00:27:50.511
<v Speaker 2>the first one was a motherfucker because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand the guy got sick and you </v>

641
00:27:50.511 --> 00:27:51.090
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had some health problems,</v>

642
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.670
<v Speaker 2>but the first one he looked like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>killer.</v>

643
00:27:53.671 --> 00:27:58.671
<v Speaker 2>Like he was built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't buy him when he lost all that </v>

644
00:27:58.671 --> 00:27:58.671
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

645
00:27:58.671 --> 00:27:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

646
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm like your Jujitsu and people and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like a skinny athletic.</v>

647
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.610
<v Speaker 2>I never even thought he had muscle to </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>

648
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it looks like to me,</v>

649
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 2>like there's dudes that you go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu with and you see him and they're</v>

650
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:13.020
<v Speaker 2>like purple belts or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

651
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:15.240
<v Speaker 2>and you look at me like this fucking guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to be a pain in the ass.</v>

652
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be hard to roll with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got like a big neck,</v>

653
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:18.770
<v Speaker 2>strong shoulders.</v>

654
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be a battle.</v>

655
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:24.950
<v Speaker 2>You just look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what he looked like in </v>

656
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.351
<v Speaker 2>the first season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked like a dude who's like a </v>

657
00:28:27.351 --> 00:28:27.351
<v Speaker 2>sturdy dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

658
00:28:27.351 --> 00:28:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I bought that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like this killer that he made him</v>

659
00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:31.170
<v Speaker 2>look just a little more sinister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though he was polite.</v>

660
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:36.350
<v Speaker 2>He looked so much like a victim yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe that's why they picked </v>

661
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Lithgo because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

662
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.790
<v Speaker 2>he could be him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my problem and this is.</v>

663
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted,</v>

664
00:28:39.961 --> 00:28:42.060

<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>

665
00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:45.200
<v Speaker 2>but when John Lithgo caught her in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weak ass rear naked choke,</v>

666
00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ain't cook put.</v>

693
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.830
<v Speaker 1>But that's how you feel when someone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>choking you to death in a bathtub.</v>

694
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't just always got me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>about just the,</v>

701
00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.360
<v Speaker 1>that the choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can't buy that fucking cell phone.</v>

702
00:30:13.361 --> 00:30:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it was made in paintbrush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:20.001
<v Speaker 1>like incoming call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you at when you look at the </v>

704
00:30:20.001 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 1>graphics?</v>

705
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fried.</v>

706
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Makes that crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tech cell tech is not a real phone </v>

707
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:29.140
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.140
<v Speaker 1>to me that that scene where he kills a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

710
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:38.150
<v Speaker 1>the tub is just as unrealistic as spock </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbing people by the neck and putting </v>

711
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.140
<v Speaker 1>them asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just just like a Ninja deft touch</v>

712
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:45.180
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People freaked the fuck out when you're </v>

713
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:45.180
<v Speaker 1>choking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

714
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 1>They hyperventilate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kick,</v>

715
00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:47.900
<v Speaker 1>they spazz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

716
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:52.000
<v Speaker 1>that's made by someone who's never seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody get choked and the guy was doing</v>

717
00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:54.120
<v Speaker 1>it to never choked anybody and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>no girls.</v>

718
00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Never been a show that nobody should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been freaking the fuck out.</v>

719
00:30:57.761 --> 00:31:00.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't just choke someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go crazy,</v>

720
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to survive.</v>

723
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You'd be fighting for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point.</v>

724
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I would be more believable that he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>move his blood samples out of the air </v>

725
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:15.850
<v Speaker 1>conditioning unit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>third,</v>

727
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:17.330

<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

731
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Little thing that evidence the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that he,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the trophies didn't need that,</v>

733
00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:31.270

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.260
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden now they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

813
00:34:54.261 --> 00:34:56.870
<v Speaker 1>So if I was a smart man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone should like bet money.</v>

814
00:34:56.871 --> 00:34:58.830
<v Speaker 1>What the next monster is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

815
00:34:58.831 --> 00:35:01.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's not going to be vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the next thing?</v>

816
00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:03.420
<v Speaker 1>And Big Foot's going to come back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a comeback or.</v>

817
00:35:03.421 --> 00:35:04.760
<v Speaker 1>So there's another</v>

818
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.360
<v Speaker 4>vampire thing by Google Eramo del Toro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to say his name,</v>

819
00:35:09.361 --> 00:35:12.150
<v Speaker 4>how you say his name is Guillermo del </v>
<v Speaker 4>Toro.</v>

820
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.490
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a book called the strain and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>saw,</v>

821
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.770
<v Speaker 4>I read the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that good.</v>

822
00:35:16.771 --> 00:35:18.840
<v Speaker 4>It started off really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It started off like,</v>

823
00:35:18.841 --> 00:35:20.610
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a crazy ass vampire movie.</v>

824
00:35:20.611 --> 00:35:25.611
<v Speaker 4>Like this is like really suspenseful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then towards the end it was almost </v>

825
00:35:25.611 --> 00:35:25.710
<v Speaker 4>like he was just trying to finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

826
00:35:25.711 --> 00:35:27.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the guy jumps out of the car,</v>

827
00:35:27.241 --> 00:35:28.200
<v Speaker 4>the guy killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

828
00:35:28.201 --> 00:35:30.570
<v Speaker 4>it was really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The end towards the end,</v>

829
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 4>like it's almost like he was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>jam a six series book or a two or three </v>

830
00:35:35.731 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 4>series book rather into one book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

831
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it dies,</v>

832
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do something with that.</v>

833
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:43.890
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make that some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big event,</v>

834
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:46.380
<v Speaker 2>but at least he's a murderous evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking vampire.</v>

835
00:35:46.381 --> 00:35:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he runs,</v>

836
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like takes over New York City.</v>

837
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:55.520
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just ends bad and maybe if they </v>

838
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.420
<v Speaker 2>can fix the ending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the in the writing in the script and</v>

839
00:35:56.421 --> 00:35:59.700
<v Speaker 2>it maybe it was creatively directed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they did a good job with it,</v>

840
00:35:59.701 --> 00:36:02.490
<v Speaker 2>but the writing was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of clumsy at the end,</v>

841
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.630
<v Speaker 2>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

842
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:08.631
<v Speaker 2>What is it about people that are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with vampires and all the </v>

843
00:36:08.631 --> 00:36:09.300
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all monsters,</v>

844
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:11.100
<v Speaker 2>all the things to be worried about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

845
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Why would it be vampire?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's none of the obsessed.</v>

846
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.290
<v Speaker 2>It's the hot thing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In two years,</v>

847
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:17.850
<v Speaker 2>this vampire then will be gone.</v>

848
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Twilight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those two fucking half of fags will be </v>

849
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:22.880
<v Speaker 2>dead somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

850
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.751
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why I think it's going to keep </v>

851
00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:26.751
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sex in the city.</v>

852
00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand sex and the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe that.</v>

853
00:36:28.771 --> 00:36:30.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched it a couple times.</v>

854
00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

855
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a cool show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just that people like it,</v>

856
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.940
<v Speaker 2>but they go fucking crazy for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grills,</v>

857
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:42.360
<v Speaker 2>they respond to it like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It resonates in them in a way that a guy</v>

858
00:36:42.361 --> 00:36:43.670
<v Speaker 2>can understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

859
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.890
<v Speaker 2>took out like Uri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watching.</v>

860
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's funny.</v>

861
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to them it's like a movement.</v>

862
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like something that validates them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this fucking movie.</v>

863
00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:51.840
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last one,</v>

864
00:36:51.841 --> 00:36:56.841
<v Speaker 2>when they went to Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw more people get fired up about </v>

865
00:36:56.841 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 2>going to city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

866
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.120
<v Speaker 2>you sought though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

867
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.900
<v Speaker 2>We talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a terrible bad.</v>

868
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:05.901
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first one on cable when the second </v>

<v Speaker 2>it wasn't back.</v>

871
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I think with that is when we talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it for two hours.</v>

872
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.480
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of resonating to </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment for women.</v>

873
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.260

<v Speaker 2>there's a family of vampires and they </v>

884
00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:51.740

<v Speaker 2>Like the read the book is all about him </v>

887
00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.000
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really romantic.</v>

888
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:05.420
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's this guy that lived hundreds of </v>

889
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:05.420
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile he's a fucking Pedo is banging</v>

890
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:09.110
<v Speaker 2>some high school chick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the whole thing is kind of creepy </v>

891
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.690
<v Speaker 2>when you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy's fucking 300 years old </v>

892
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.690
<v Speaker 2>and he's hanging out with some 17 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old trick.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of somebody that just turns into a dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>once in a while,</v>

998
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:54.270

<v Speaker 1>to sell it.</v>

1020
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Now it's doing that whole shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Britney Spears at people did this </v>

1021
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:44.271

<v Speaker 1>They're fucking putting fake throws out </v>

1022
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:46.050
<v Speaker 1>to cover up fake or real photos or </v>
<v Speaker 1>snopes or something grabs it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's probably love to do the opposite.</v>

1025
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:54.300
<v Speaker 1>It's presence people probably to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they should be.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he owns a giant website.</v>

1028
00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Even if you put up a photo of a fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina on a 17 year old,</v>

1029
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1030
00:44:02.371 --> 00:44:04.980
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal more.</v>

<v Speaker 1>girl's pussy can get you locked up.</v>

1037
00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 1>You can read a lot of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>President's a fucking retard.</v>

1038
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.300
<v Speaker 1>When he used to make fun of Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandler's kid and doing all that </v>

<v Speaker 2>them afterwards was so ridiculous.</v>

1045
00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 2>When you sit on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got violence is never the answer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human beings want us.</v>

1052
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:59.180
<v Speaker 2>They want to pass that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to just find a way around </v>

1053
00:44:59.180 --> 00:44:59.180
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to cause you pain.</v>

1054
00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.781
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're putting out a lot of </v>

1055
00:45:02.781 --> 00:45:02.781
<v Speaker 2>negative energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1056
00:45:02.781 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 2>I want to see Jonathan Lithgo and pres </v>

<v Speaker 2>So I say that.</v>

1058
00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that he would struggle?</v>

1059
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:08.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even just let it go.</v>

1060
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Let it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think his butt hole would open up</v>

1061
00:45:11.011 --> 00:45:16.011
<v Speaker 2>like a flower fleshlight and just lock a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold of with cow's body and pull them </v>

1062
00:45:16.011 --> 00:45:19.791

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1068
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:38.970
<v Speaker 2>I think we could all benefit from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little less negativity in the world.</v>

1069
00:45:38.971 --> 00:45:43.971

1081
00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:05.740
<v Speaker 2>They're the people that don't feel bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone shitting on someone's kids </v>

<v Speaker 2>have another dude on them taken out in </v>

<v Speaker 2>can be.</v>

00:47:36.461 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 2>You have the option to be a nice person </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're choosing not to be and you're</v>

1119
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:44.821
<v Speaker 2>making it a pain in the ass for all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of us and someone's going to punch </v>

<v Speaker 2>kitchen with plastic and when he's going</v>

1126
00:47:57.401 --> 00:48:02.401
<v Speaker 2>inside the kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to come up from behind him </v>

1127
00:48:02.401 --> 00:48:02.401
<v Speaker 2>with a syringe and the neck and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to wake up,</v>

1128
00:48:02.401 --> 00:48:06.271
<v Speaker 2>covered up and part of that movement </v>

1165
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:26.400
<v Speaker 2>hometown on facebook couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

1166
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.720
<v Speaker 2>a Bible breather 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was stuck.</v>

1167
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.760
<v Speaker 2>He was selling me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite alludes that he's telling me that </v>

1168
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't curse on facebook a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers.</v>

1169
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I hate all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to hear some negativity in the </v>

1170
00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.821
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a hilarious story and this </v>

1171
00:49:40.821 --> 00:49:42.751
<v Speaker 2>happened this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Vancouver for the UFC and </v>

1172
00:49:42.751 --> 00:49:47.230
<v Speaker 2>apparently I got an elevator with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude and the dude didn't say hi to me or</v>

1173
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:52.231
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said I gave him this look like I </v>

1174
00:49:52.231 --> 00:49:52.231
<v Speaker 2>didn't like him or like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1175
00:49:52.231 --> 00:49:55.360
<v Speaker 2>like back the fuck off look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he says that.</v>

1176
00:49:55.361 --> 00:50:00.361
<v Speaker 2>He said take care guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we said nothing and then he </v>

1177
00:50:00.361 --> 00:50:01.210
<v Speaker 2>left the elevator like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan's a fucking hassle.</v>

1178
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:06.330
<v Speaker 2>So he goes online and makes us whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thread about me being in an elevator </v>

1179
00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 2>with him and no conversation taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>place at all,</v>

1180
00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.870
<v Speaker 2>but me being an asshole like I'm giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>him this look,</v>

1181
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm a bad ass and I got short </v>
<v Speaker 2>man syndrome and you know,</v>

1182
00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:16.720
<v Speaker 2>and then fucking I got problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating with people.</v>

1183
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Like it was crazy shit and I'm like if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw you,</v>

1184
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.210
<v Speaker 2>if you said something to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

1185
00:50:22.211 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 2>if you said you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of,</v>

1186
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I would have definitely said you too </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1187
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I always say that I not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could fucking hate you.</v>

1188
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.460
<v Speaker 2>And if you said take care man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a good day.</v>

1189
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Bye Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right dude.</v>

1190
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Take it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would fucking respond to you.</v>

1191
00:50:35.001 --> 00:50:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't just stand there stone faced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I fucking hated you,</v>

1192
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I would say something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a mean person.</v>

1193
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the type of person that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>

1194
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's either one or two things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either he said it and I didn't hear it </v>

1195
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.670
<v Speaker 2>or I responded like our dude take care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't hear that either one.</v>

1196
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:51.680
<v Speaker 2>And the dude was high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those the other thing,</v>

1197
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 2>so he was probably a little bit paranoid</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a little bit star struck,</v>

1198
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:58.100
<v Speaker 2>but he makes this crazy fucking thread </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I tell him,</v>

1199
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get on,</v>

1200
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1201
00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:02.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry you had a bad experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was probably a misunderstanding.</v>

1202
00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out.</v>

1203
00:51:02.971 --> 00:51:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're nice to me,</v>

1204
00:51:04.701 --> 00:51:05.850
<v Speaker 2>if you're not retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1205
00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:07.610
<v Speaker 2>and you're cool to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be holding you back.</v>

1206
00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:10.190
<v Speaker 2>I tried to be cool to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was just a misunderstanding.</v>

1207
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the threat.</v>

1208
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:12.050
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1209
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 2>cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1210
00:51:12.681 --> 00:51:13.430
<v Speaker 2>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1211
00:51:13.431 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 2>the thread keeps going on and on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he keeps commenting on it,</v>

1212
00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 2>like it keeps going back to it and back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1213
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Like I did something to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then finally I come back,</v>

1214
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

1215
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out of line.</v>

1216
00:51:22.941 --> 00:51:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happened.</v>

1217
00:51:24.051 --> 00:51:26.960
<v Speaker 2>You're making this thread about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation that didn't take place.</v>

1218
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even say a word to each other </v>

1219
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:32.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

1220
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:32.200
<v Speaker 2>You're still going on about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he comes back,</v>

1221
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:33.650
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out of line.</v>

1222
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:35.280
<v Speaker 2>You fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1223
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.960
<v Speaker 2>You fucking short man syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like one of those Chachi's </v>

1224
00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.840
<v Speaker 2>window's tight shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you walk around like you're fucking </v>

1225
00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:43.840
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

1226
00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.860
<v Speaker 2>And I'm why you can't back down now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know he has like,</v>

1227
00:51:45.861 --> 00:51:47.940
<v Speaker 2>this was not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:51:47.941 --> 00:51:49.340
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is out of nowhere.</v>

1229
00:51:49.341 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying anything negative.</v>

1230
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying he's out of line for other </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1231
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Have you elevated with three other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

1232
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Me and Eddie Bauer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

1233
00:51:58.530 --> 00:51:59.330
<v Speaker 2>is he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1234
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the phone on the way here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped.</v>

1235
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I've totally somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the next thing you know,</v>

1236
00:52:04.651 --> 00:52:05.820
<v Speaker 2>somebody comes up to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1237
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.980
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've never come up to somebody.</v>

1238
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.810
<v Speaker 2>But that's the little tread over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your Joe Broken.</v>

1239
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.610
<v Speaker 2>So you have to say something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he was that.</v>

1240
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:16.040
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was a little high.</v>

1241
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.290
<v Speaker 2>It was a little paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think he's a little sensitive.</v>

1242
00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:20.690
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people think that people think</v>

1243
00:52:20.691 --> 00:52:22.370
<v Speaker 2>they're better than you and that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>

1244
00:52:22.371 --> 00:52:27.371
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to be around some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm around someone like an actor or </v>

1245
00:52:27.371 --> 00:52:27.950
<v Speaker 2>someone and they get Douchey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say something stupid to them,</v>

1246
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:29.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm around some asshole actors,</v>

1247
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.550
<v Speaker 2>one of the reason why I don't like being</v>
<v Speaker 2>around actors,</v>

1248
00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:34.880
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them play fucking games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say stupid shit to you.</v>

1249
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:40.120
<v Speaker 2>They said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a set with this one guy once </v>

1250
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:40.120
<v Speaker 2>and we were about to do the scene and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1251
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:40.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being cool with them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1252
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.030
<v Speaker 2>All right dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's about to walk away.</v>

1253
00:52:42.031 --> 00:52:43.400
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have almost no hair.</v>

1254
00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And he walks away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1255
00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:45.890
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you say?</v>

1256
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just walks away like he said </v>

1257
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:51.230
<v Speaker 2>something to try to fuck with my head </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I did the scene,</v>

1258
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 2>like picking on my hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falling out to so and so.</v>

1259
00:52:55.070 --> 00:53:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Then I saw him the next day and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>still in my head and so he started to </v>

1260
00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:01.780
<v Speaker 2>try to fuck with me again and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1261
00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.330
<v Speaker 2>I just said something to him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1262
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.000
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking get stupid with me,</v>

1263
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1264
00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:07.310
<v Speaker 2>don't like play little insult games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

1265
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I will never have a real </v>

1266
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:12.430
<v Speaker 2>conversation ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1267
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:12.430
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're a fucking idiot.</v>

1268
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I was nice to you and you came with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1269
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:13.800
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1270
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:19.230
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like he said something like a </v>

1271
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 2>little slightly insulting thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked away.</v>

1272
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that like,</v>

1273
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:22.220
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hair's falling out.</v>

1274
00:53:22.221 --> 00:53:22.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

1275
00:53:22.791 --> 00:53:27.791
<v Speaker 2>you ugly bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta mirror and there will be </v>

1276
00:53:27.791 --> 00:53:27.791
<v Speaker 2>joking with each other and we can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

1277
00:53:27.791 --> 00:53:28.470
<v Speaker 2>But when I know that someone's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck with me,</v>

1278
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 2>like why are you doing that?</v>

1279
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.980
<v Speaker 2>This isn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're trying to be shitty with me.</v>

1280
00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:36.000
<v Speaker 2>That happens with actors all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With actors,</v>

1281
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 2>you're always dealing with little </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological bullshit.</v>

1282
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:44.210
<v Speaker 2>They're all fucking tweaked out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaked out because they don't create </v>

1283
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:47.421
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to have someone come to them </v>

1284
00:53:47.421 --> 00:53:47.421
<v Speaker 2>with scripts and ideas and pick them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose them.</v>

1285
00:53:47.421 --> 00:53:52.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like the only art form where </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody has to pick you so you can </v>

1286
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:52.250
<v Speaker 2>perform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1287
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a fucking musician,</v>

1288
00:53:52.351 --> 00:53:53.700
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do your goddamn music,</v>

1289
00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:55.230
<v Speaker 2>you make your own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your comic,</v>

1290
00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you write your own jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're an actor,</v>

1291
00:53:56.911 --> 00:53:59.190
<v Speaker 2>you have to sit around and wait for </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to give you a role,</v>

1292
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.530
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1293
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:05.540
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could put together your own </v>

1294
00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:05.540
<v Speaker 2>shit and throw it up on youtube if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get crazy.</v>

1295
00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran into something that goes along </v>

1296
00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:08.840
<v Speaker 2>this whole line at the same a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>days ago.</v>

1297
00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.550
<v Speaker 2>This guy I know wrote something to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine that was so fucked up </v>

1298
00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I took a screenshot of it.</v>

1299
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 2>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a dirty fucking whore.</v>

<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get a light.</v>

1302
00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Three minutes later he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are so desperate for attention.</v>

1303
00:54:24.571 --> 00:54:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Your tits.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Anthony,</v>

1308
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.820
<v Speaker 2>not really sure how yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I go through it and he has this</v>

<v Speaker 2>address and so dexter style,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking took a picture of his house and </v>

1311
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.360
<v Speaker 2>on another twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send it to them and goes,</v>

1312
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:49.240
<v Speaker 2>that's a very rude thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he deleted all those photos,</v>

1313
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 2>a post and stuff like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I feel really sick.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Instead you them the fuck out.</v>

1316
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.970
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy because he has like his </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures and his whole twitter is a real</v>

1317
00:55:05.971 --> 00:55:08.230
<v Speaker 2>twitter and he's a family guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His daughter,</v>

1318
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:13.240
<v Speaker 2>he's a sign nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do this when you have a </v>

1319
00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.711
<v Speaker 2>daughter too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really interested in finding out </v>

1320
00:55:15.711 --> 00:55:15.711
<v Speaker 2>what his connection to the open anthony </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1321
00:55:15.711 --> 00:55:17.220
<v Speaker 2>It's because he has all these shots from</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the studio with Jim Norton,</v>

1322
00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:17.760
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah.</v>

1323
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can find out you got pictures of him</v>

1324
00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:22.110
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1325
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:23.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1326
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Well tell us what Jimmy will tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1327
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy people.</v>

1328
00:55:28.471 --> 00:55:33.471
<v Speaker 2>So this guy I got on afterwards and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes back and forth and starts bringing </v>

1329
00:55:33.471 --> 00:55:37.941
<v Speaker 2>up a video of me being an asshole to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy from like nine years ago as </v>

1330
00:55:37.941 --> 00:55:37.950
<v Speaker 2>proof that I'm a Douche bag.</v>

1331
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to distract from our </v>

1332
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.950
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we didn't have a conversation,</v>

1333
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:43.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing.</v>

1334
00:55:43.441 --> 00:55:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Nothing took place and you've made this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thread about it.</v>

1335
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Now you're screaming and swearing at me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and insulting me like this is craziness.</v>

1336
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:54.231
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he actually came on and </v>

1337
00:55:54.231 --> 00:55:54.270
<v Speaker 2>apologized and then I came on and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all good,</v>

1338
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no harm done.</v>

1339
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it sucks when the thread by this</v>

1340
00:55:59.191 --> 00:56:01.860
<v Speaker 2>time everyone's piling on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is like,</v>

1341
00:56:01.861 --> 00:56:04.410
<v Speaker 2>you insecure a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

1342
00:56:04.411 --> 00:56:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like?</v>

1343
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.560
<v Speaker 2>So many people are saying the guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1344
00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.510
<v Speaker 2>And a few people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1345
00:56:09.511 --> 00:56:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I met Joe Rogan introduce bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are like making up stories.</v>

1346
00:56:11.991 --> 00:56:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I just told us to sign my autograph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just crazy horse shit.</v>

1347
00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:22.070
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dude he apologizes and I say it's </v>

1348
00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:22.070
<v Speaker 2>all good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1349
00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 2>I think that we all learn from a being </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticized.</v>

1350
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:29.670
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel good to say people need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to hear people say you suck at and to </v>

1351
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.670
<v Speaker 4>hear people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1352
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:31.510
<v Speaker 4>call you piece of shit and criticize </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1353
00:56:31.511 --> 00:56:36.511
<v Speaker 4>But it's good because when you realize </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're having a negative effect on </v>

1354
00:56:36.511 --> 00:56:36.511
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you think like,</v>

1355
00:56:36.511 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 4>what is this a fact that I'm not seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking I'm doing the right thing.</v>

1356
00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:43.891
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking I'm living my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I doing that's making people so </v>

1357
00:56:43.891 --> 00:56:43.891
<v Speaker 4>upset with me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1358
00:56:43.891 --> 00:56:43.891
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it real now?</v>

1359
00:56:43.891 --> 00:56:44.620
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

1360
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 4>is there is a jealousy issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a,</v>

1361
00:56:47.441 --> 00:56:49.730
<v Speaker 4>as an Alpha male issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a,</v>

1362
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.320
<v Speaker 4>am I being too insensitive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is it?</v>

1363
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:56.560
<v Speaker 4>I think it sucks to admit that we all </v>
<v Speaker 4>have like little,</v>

1364
00:56:56.561 --> 00:57:01.561
<v Speaker 4>little issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but being criticized like especially </v>

1365
00:57:01.561 --> 00:57:04.051
<v Speaker 4>online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it accelerates your social </v>

1366
00:57:04.051 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 4>development because it makes you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit more aware of what a bunch of</v>

1367
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:07.300
<v Speaker 4>anonymous people really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>truly feel about what you say.</v>

1368
00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:12.940
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get that too much in real </v>

1369
00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:12.940
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in real life.</v>

1370

1389
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.160

<v Speaker 4>fucking letter about your experience at </v>
<v Speaker 4>a comedy club?</v>

<v Speaker 4>here's a lady that wrote a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever tell you the time to.</v>

1395
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:09.430
<v Speaker 4>The lady wrote about my retarded Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 4>joke.</v>

1396
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:13.660
<v Speaker 4>Remember my retirement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a joke about cloning because there</v>

1397
00:58:13.661 --> 00:58:18.661
<v Speaker 4>was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a group called the second </v>

1398
00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:20.170
<v Speaker 4>coming project and the second coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>project they were going to take some DNA</v>

1399
00:58:20.171 --> 00:58:25.171
<v Speaker 4>from the shroud of Turin or some other </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious artifacts and try to clone </v>

1400
00:58:25.171 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Jesus and they thought that that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be the bringing back of the Messiah.</v>

1401
00:58:27.611 --> 00:58:32.611
<v Speaker 4>That would be the second coming would </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually be through science and that </v>

1402
00:58:32.611 --> 00:58:32.611
<v Speaker 4>they would clone Jesus.</v>

1403
00:58:32.611 --> 00:58:32.680
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote this joke about,</v>

1404
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:37.690
<v Speaker 4>well cloning is not been perfected yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Dolly the sheep shed all sorts of </v>

1405
00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.820
<v Speaker 4>genetic issues and she died young and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1406
00:58:39.821 --> 00:58:42.430
<v Speaker 4>that was considered a success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of failures,</v>

1407
00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:47.431
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that we never heard about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like horrible genetic </v>

1408
00:58:47.431 --> 00:58:47.431
<v Speaker 4>disasters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking monsters and shit.</v>

1409
00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if they clone Jesus?</v>

1410
00:58:49.271 --> 00:58:54.271
<v Speaker 4>And the first one comes out retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's possible because that down</v>

1411
00:58:54.351 --> 00:58:54.970
<v Speaker 4>syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do they do?</v>

1412
00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:57.430
<v Speaker 4>They kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start from scratch or.</v>

1413
00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:00.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's a test.</v>

1414
00:59:00.101 --> 00:59:02.680
<v Speaker 4>It's a test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's testing us instead of turning water</v>

1415
00:59:02.681 --> 00:59:07.681
<v Speaker 4>into wine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He turned like dog shit in the cookies </v>

1416
00:59:07.681 --> 00:59:08.230
<v Speaker 4>home thing where they were following </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus everywhere.</v>

1417
00:59:08.231 --> 00:59:10.510
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to go into the park today.</v>

1418
00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:12.380
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you think we should seal the hip,</v>

1419
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>heal the sick or help.</v>

1421
00:59:14.191 --> 00:59:15.010
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The park.</v>

1422
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:18.130
<v Speaker 4>So they were all waiting for him to come</v>
<v Speaker 4>up with,</v>

1423
00:59:18.131 --> 00:59:19.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well this woman got so mad.</v>

1426
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.130
<v Speaker 2>She gets so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wrote this fucking shoot.</v>

1427
00:59:24.131 --> 00:59:25.700

<v Speaker 2>I thought it was really funny about it.</v>

1428
00:59:25.701 --> 00:59:29.570
<v Speaker 2>She said not only did he tell this </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible job,</v>

1429
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:34.600
<v Speaker 2>but when the audience didn't respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he insisted on talking about the same </v>

1430
00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:38.621
<v Speaker 2>subject instead of moving on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was upset that I wouldn't move on.</v>

1431
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Like her version of comedy is you got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what the audience wants.</v>

1432
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to be coming from </v>

<v Speaker 2>righteous because she thinks that she </v>

1444
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:12.560
<v Speaker 2>can get away with telling people what to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say and what not to say.</v>

1445
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.030

1459
01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he wrote a letter a couple of days </v>

1460
01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.690
<v Speaker 2>later and we've had a bunch of letters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does the phrase,</v>

1461
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.300
<v Speaker 2>when you say science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did that originally come from?</v>

1462
01:00:56.630 --> 01:01:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Dolby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Thomas told she blinded me with </v>

1463
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.630
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever seen the video.</v>

1466
01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:08.930
<v Speaker 2>If you see the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would just yell science.</v>

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.960
<v Speaker 2>That guy's a real.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean the stupidest thing about it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to make like idols </v>

1485
01:01:58.691 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 2>of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that like even in the Bible you're</v>

1486
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:02.330
<v Speaker 2>not supposed to like make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make churches even.</v>

1487
01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that say in the Bible that he'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather have you do it under a tree than </v>

1488
01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:07.570
<v Speaker 2>break would or something like that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>a church or something,</v>

1489
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.290
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

1490
01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot quote the Bible here.</v>

1491
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Can I just have no fucking at the part </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying I don't know a goddamn </v>

1492
01:02:16.511 --> 01:02:18.200
<v Speaker 2>thing in it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it when I was younger.</v>

1493
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 2>When I lived Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made us read</v>

1494
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:20.970
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't make us read it,</v>

1495
01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:23.700
<v Speaker 4>but they gave it to us and they gave us </v>
<v Speaker 4>an opportunity to read it.</v>

1496
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:29.270
<v Speaker 4>They handed out bibles in the class and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I went from San Francisco to Florida in </v>

1497
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.460
<v Speaker 4>San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super Liberal,</v>

1498
01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:34.610
<v Speaker 4>had gay neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My aunt used to go next door and smoke </v>

1499
01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:35.160
<v Speaker 4>weed with gay neighbors and they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>get naked and play the bongos together.</v>

1500
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:40.250
<v Speaker 4>So I was like around all these hippies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and war protest type people in San </v>

1501
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I moved from there to like Super </v>

1502
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:47.510
<v Speaker 4>Religious Retard Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like right around retards and </v>

1503
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 4>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're handed out bibles and this one </v>

1504
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 4>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets his Bible.</v>

1505
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.660
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God the word fucking 11.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets his Bible.</v>

1506
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:55.050
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes to read the Bible.</v>

1507
01:02:56.010 --> 01:03:01.010
<v Speaker 4>That's what he said to read the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he sits there all like crazy,</v>

1508
01:03:01.501 --> 01:03:03.120
<v Speaker 4>like excited to be reading this book.</v>

1509
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1510
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:07.050
<v Speaker 4>what that fucking kid's face and what he</v>
<v Speaker 4>said.</v>

1511
01:03:07.051 --> 01:03:09.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it burned into my head.</v>

1512
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.370
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely lochner.</v>

1513
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:17.030
<v Speaker 4>I went to Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember shit from that Bible </v>

1514
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 4>for years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to Catholic school and I went to </v>

1515
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 4>a Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucked up that the people should</v>

1516
01:03:22.651 --> 01:03:25.770
<v Speaker 4>allow anyone to push any ideology on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>

1517
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.900
<v Speaker 4>Everybody thinks that like having your </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids grow up.</v>

1518
01:03:27.901 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 4>Religion is no big deal and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good for them.</v>

1519
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:35.480
<v Speaker 4>I agree to give some kids some morals </v>
<v Speaker 4>and set some standards of behavior and </v>

1520
01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:40.251
<v Speaker 4>to tell them that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about communicating with people that </v>

1521
01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:40.251
<v Speaker 4>what's important is you be positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do good things,</v>

1522
01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:41.220
<v Speaker 4>be a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1523
01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:46.221
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and spread out that good energy spread </v>

1524
01:03:46.221 --> 01:03:47.070
<v Speaker 4>out love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to make the kid to go to any fucking</v>

1525
01:03:47.071 --> 01:03:52.071
<v Speaker 4>super religious school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to fuck their programming </v>

1526
01:03:52.071 --> 01:03:52.071
<v Speaker 4>up so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1527
01:03:52.071 --> 01:03:56.481
<v Speaker 4>but no one is objective enough to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people just want to have good kids </v>

1528
01:03:56.481 --> 01:03:57.510
<v Speaker 4>and they want to carry on the tradition </v>
<v Speaker 4>that their family has.</v>

1529
01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:02.720
<v Speaker 4>Religion as a child should start off as </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a different religion and then move </v>

1530
01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 4>onto Christianity or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I should start off as Buddhist,</v>

1531
01:04:04.681 --> 01:04:09.681
<v Speaker 4>like just teaching to be a good person </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you get into like that that </v>

1532
01:04:09.681 --> 01:04:13.610
<v Speaker 4>they should do is teach you the </v>
<v Speaker 4>different principles of each religion </v>

1533
01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:14.280
<v Speaker 4>and not say either one of them is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking answer,</v>

1534
01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:16.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's too many of them.</v>

1535
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:19.410
<v Speaker 4>You look at all the good aspects of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the different religions and say,</v>

1536
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:20.610
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where did all this come from?</v>

1537
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.730
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know where it came from.</v>

1538
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.760
<v Speaker 4>We assume it came from some wise people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that got through a lot of conflict and </v>

1539
01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.991
<v Speaker 4>figured out some way to live life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they wrote it down and some of it </v>

1540
01:04:32.991 --> 01:04:33.480
<v Speaker 4>makes a lot of sense even today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when,</v>

1541
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.870
<v Speaker 4>when the book that you're basing </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything on includes treating women as</v>

1542
01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:39.480
<v Speaker 4>second class citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>condoning slavery,</v>

1543
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.600
<v Speaker 4>murder a fucking angry God who punishes </v>
<v Speaker 4>people by death and you're gonna burn </v>

1544
01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.410
<v Speaker 4>into fucking fiery hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

1545
01:04:46.411 --> 01:04:48.330
<v Speaker 4>just shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just stop it.</v>

1546
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.080
<v Speaker 4>You're talking goofy nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you,</v>

1547
01:04:51.081 --> 01:04:54.360
<v Speaker 4>you got to show me something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to show me up fucking youtube</v>

1548
01:04:54.361 --> 01:04:59.361
<v Speaker 4>clip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to show me something before I </v>

1549
01:04:59.361 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 4>went and believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this kind of goofy shit is silly.</v>

1550
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 4>But in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we still let that slide.</v>

1551
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.640
<v Speaker 4>We still say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1552
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:10.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone has their own freedom of </v>

1553
01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:10.641
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do whatever you want.</v>

1554
01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:11.580
<v Speaker 4>But if you start saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop,</v>

1555
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.600
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying your way is the only way </v>

1556
01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 4>you're saying people should die if they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying</v>

1557
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.080
<v Speaker 2>you know people can't be gay and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>married.</v>

1558
01:05:20.081 --> 01:05:25.081
<v Speaker 2>You're saying you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're imposing all your bullshit on </v>

1559
01:05:25.081 --> 01:05:27.310
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we still accept it in 2010 except at</v>

1560
01:05:27.311 --> 01:05:29.800
<v Speaker 2>the Church of what's happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I'm from,</v>

1561
01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.140
<v Speaker 2>church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That matters in my book.</v>

1562
01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.410
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to get past this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When are we going to get past?</v>

1563
01:05:35.411 --> 01:05:37.750
<v Speaker 2>When were you going to step up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knows.</v>

1564
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.040
<v Speaker 2>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

1565
01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you can't say,</v>

1566
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:41.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say,</v>

1567
01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 2>you know you're crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me your experiences.</v>

1568
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throw it in the pile.</v>

1569
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's all sort this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell me that you know this is </v>

1570
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:51.910
<v Speaker 2>the way and you're the chosen people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just shut the fuck up.</v>

1571
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Stop your all your Joseph Smith and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking nutty.</v>

1572

<v Speaker 2>Scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's all crazy.</v>

1574
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:04.230
<v Speaker 2>You're awkward and it's fucking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything because when people pretend </v>

1575
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.230
<v Speaker 2>they have the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucks up.</v>

1576
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:08.491
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else had searched for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer because there's an option to not </v>

1577
01:06:08.491 --> 01:06:08.491
<v Speaker 2>even think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an option to like,</v>

1578
01:06:08.491 --> 01:06:12.100
<v Speaker 2>fuck joining the search to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to live the life the best way.</v>

1579
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Let's just fucking follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These douche bags are doing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got thrown out of there.</v>

1583
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I got thrown out of there before my </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fifth grade,</v>

1588
01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:38.050
<v Speaker 1>and my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with these two little twins </v>

1589
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:41.400
<v Speaker 1>and the one kid's mother was having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby and he wanted to call and then </v>

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 1>we'll let them fucking call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's crying.</v>

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Pay Your Bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you not let somebody call the </v>

1597
01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 1>hospital?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't like a corridor.</v>

1598
01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I this your mother and the none wouldn't</v>

1599
01:06:58.841 --> 01:06:59.080
<v Speaker 1>let him.</v>

1600
01:06:59.080 --> 01:06:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1601
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:05.130
<v Speaker 1>fucking get up and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she'd made me in the two other guys </v>

1602
01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:08.011
<v Speaker 1>get up and wait outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she took me into the stationery </v>

1603
01:07:08.011 --> 01:07:10.480
<v Speaker 1>closet and she beat him up first and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could hear it outside.</v>

1604
01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the fourth grade now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom used to always say,</v>

1605
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:15.180
<v Speaker 1>don't let people hit you if they hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1606
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:20.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she takes me to the closet and she </v>

1607
01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:20.590
<v Speaker 1>turned her ring around and she just </v>
<v Speaker 1>started hitting me,</v>

1608
01:07:20.591 --> 01:07:22.030
<v Speaker 1>hitting fucking hit me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit me,</v>

1609
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:24.460
<v Speaker 1>hit me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit me in the face and shit,</v>

1610
01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:29.461
<v Speaker 1>and I like a taste of blood in my lip </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when I couldn't take it no </v>

1611
01:07:29.461 --> 01:07:33.811
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking grabbed her and took her </v>

1612
01:07:33.811 --> 01:07:34.240
<v Speaker 1>around and I didn't know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hold it by the fucking throat and</v>

1613
01:07:34.241 --> 01:07:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling my mother.</v>

1614
01:07:35.411 --> 01:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>This is going to fucking stop it real </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

1615
01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's what's crazy.</v>

1616
01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:42.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a disciplinary in there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked around with a stick and he hit me</v>

1617
01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:45.940
<v Speaker 1>in the leg and his name was Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had gone to the school.</v>

1618
01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:50.980
<v Speaker 1>He had stayed there as a teacher's </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant and he's the one that lit you </v>

1619
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.821
<v Speaker 1>on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every once in awhile he would light you </v>

1620
01:07:53.821 --> 01:07:53.821
<v Speaker 1>on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1621
01:07:53.821 --> 01:07:57.060
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean he will hit you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know he was punching or smell hunch </v>

1622
01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:57.060
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1623
01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.840
<v Speaker 1>And I fucking would punch you oprah on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chest and shit,</v>

1624
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:03.841
<v Speaker 1>and I had that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you went home and told your </v>

1625
01:08:03.841 --> 01:08:03.841
<v Speaker 1>mother you were kind of scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't,</v>

1626
01:08:03.841 --> 01:08:05.020
<v Speaker 1>couldn't take people hitting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never liked that.</v>

1627
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.000
<v Speaker 1>So I grabbed her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He threatened to call.</v>

1628
01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:12.060
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even threaten to call the cops </v>

1629
01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:12.060
<v Speaker 1>because I had blood coming out of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

1630
01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:12.550
<v Speaker 1>So I said I'm getting to the payphone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and called my mother.</v>

1631
01:08:12.551 --> 01:08:14.820
<v Speaker 1>She's going to come here and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to straighten this up.</v>

1632
01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>But the funny thing is my mother came</v>

1633
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.310
<v Speaker 2>with like 20 dudes from the bar so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we made a deal.</v>

1634
01:08:19.311 --> 01:08:21.410
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't expel me because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do nothing.</v>

1635
01:08:21.411 --> 01:08:26.411
<v Speaker 2>I just protected myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was my fucking lip hanging like </v>

1636
01:08:26.411 --> 01:08:26.411
<v Speaker 2>chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does your mother,</v>

1637
01:08:26.411 --> 01:08:26.600
<v Speaker 2>you're mad at him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1638
01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:28.790
<v Speaker 2>my mother went off and then that's when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we made an agreement.</v>

1639
01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:31.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stay till June.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This happened in April.</v>

1640
01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:34.090
<v Speaker 2>So for two months at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack got close to him.</v>

1641
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Remember when my mother said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking kill you motherfucker.</v>

1642
01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:39.110
<v Speaker 2>So for the last two months of my fourth </v>
<v Speaker 2>grade,</v>

1643
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.440
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't even say nothing to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started revolting having other </v>

1644
01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 2>kids telling their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's just such a joyless religion.</v>

1645
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>How can you go back and see her pulling </v>
<v Speaker 2>my ear or give me a punch to the back or</v>

1646
01:08:52.401 --> 01:08:54.290
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to Catholic schools.</v>

1647
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I went to Catholic school from first </v>
<v Speaker 2>grade.</v>

1648
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I was very religious when I was a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

1649
01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:00.710
<v Speaker 2>When I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents got divorced when I was five.</v>

1650
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.590
<v Speaker 2>They separated and I was really lost and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really scared.</v>

1651
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.630
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad's not around anymore.</v>

1652
01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:07.790
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just me and my mom and my sister.</v>

1653
01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:09.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very unsettling.</v>

1654
01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:14.261
<v Speaker 2>My mom had to work all day and we had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in different people's houses while </v>

1655
01:09:14.261 --> 01:09:14.261
<v Speaker 2>they babysat us or grandparents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1656
01:09:14.261 --> 01:09:17.000
<v Speaker 2>It was unsettling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while this was all going on,</v>

1657
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 2>I went to Catholic school and it was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>first year in Catholic school,</v>

1658
01:09:20.361 --> 01:09:23.510
<v Speaker 2>first grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were so fucking mean.</v>

1659
01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember shit about first grade.</v>

1660
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:31.331
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember anything about being </v>

1661
01:09:31.331 --> 01:09:31.331
<v Speaker 2>six years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1662
01:09:31.331 --> 01:09:33.911
<v Speaker 2>I remember sister Mary Josephine at Our </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lady of Chester Hova in Paterson,</v>

1663

<v Speaker 2>Patterson or NORC.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that experience.</v>

1666
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 2>I lived there for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1667
01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:47.381
<v Speaker 2>I went to that school for a year and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that year I went to school everyday </v>

1668
01:09:47.381 --> 01:09:48.260
<v Speaker 2>terrified and everyday that was just </v>

<v Speaker 2>Every day it was always yelling at you.</v>

1672
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.590
<v Speaker 2>I would cry like I missed my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the first day I cry.</v>

1673

<v Speaker 2>And if you didn't do your work right or </v>

<v Speaker 2>It was like a fucking pink floyd video.</v>

1678
01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Is that just east coast religion or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that?</v>

<v Speaker 2>get the fuck they're not happy.</v>

1681
01:10:26.211 --> 01:10:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>End of discussion.</v>

1682

<v Speaker 2>You don't come at all.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What kind of a life is that?</v>

1687
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:40.970
<v Speaker 2>That's a horrible existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not love.</v>

1688
01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:42.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emotion,</v>

1689
01:10:42.411 --> 01:10:46.190
<v Speaker 2>celebration of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's all just do what I tell you.</v>

1690
01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Follow my rules or you burn in Hell and </v>
<v Speaker 2>let me touch a cock.</v>

1691
01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to go back and talk to them,</v>

1692
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.920

<v Speaker 2>That school was closed up.</v>

1695
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:04.060
<v Speaker 2>It was when I got older and I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing stories about kids getting </v>

1696
01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:04.060
<v Speaker 2>molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get fucking angry.</v>

1697
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I got angry at my mom.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It got covered up fast,</v>

1702
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:18.850
<v Speaker 2>but there was almost like this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they deserve it though.</v>

1703

01:16:05.221 --> 01:16:06.370
<v Speaker 2>can't be based on some nonsense.</v>

1822
01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:09.550
<v Speaker 2>It has to be based on just positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and success.</v>

1823
01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Success as a race success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a neighborhood success,</v>

1824
01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:17.221
<v Speaker 2>as a group of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a way to live your </v>

1825
01:16:17.221 --> 01:16:17.221
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a way to be positive and there's</v>

1826
01:16:17.221 --> 01:16:20.971
<v Speaker 2>way to figure out a way to spread the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most positive energy and the way they'd </v>

1827
01:16:20.971 --> 01:16:24.391
<v Speaker 2>be the most honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they'd be the most creative and </v>

1828
01:16:24.391 --> 01:16:25.210
<v Speaker 2>the most friendly and the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive and the most satisfied.</v>

1829
01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a way to do that and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>through religions currently.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1912
01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.480

<v Speaker 3>Cup of ice.</v>

1913

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1914

<v Speaker 3>You get sugar free syrups like root beer</v>
<v Speaker 3>or grape or something like that.</v>

1919
01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.750
<v Speaker 2>cup of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's no calories in it.</v>

1920
01:20:11.530 --> 01:20:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I restrict myself to one diet coke a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

1921

1925
01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:24.780
<v Speaker 2>tastes sweet and it's not really sweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't have any calories,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you want diabetes or do you want </v>

1935
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.370
<v Speaker 2>maybe a ankle cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a water.</v>

1936
01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.980
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to have a coke.</v>

1937
01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.380
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't have water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1938
01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:55.380
<v Speaker 2>If you were just forced to drink coca </v>
<v Speaker 2>cola every day and then someone gave you</v>

1939
01:20:55.381 --> 01:20:57.150
<v Speaker 2>a nice ice cold water and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1940
01:20:57.151 --> 01:20:59.910
<v Speaker 2>this tastes so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If water was like super precious,</v>

1941
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:01.380
<v Speaker 2>I know like there wasn't that much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1942
01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:04.400
<v Speaker 2>So you'd go to like a fucking restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 2>and buy some water and you know,</v>

1943
01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.560
<v Speaker 2>for real good water it would cost you </v>
<v Speaker 2>$100 a bottle,</v>

1944
01:21:07.561 --> 01:21:09.630
<v Speaker 2>like a bottle of wine and you drink it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>

1945
01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:10.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is delicious.</v>

1946
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.630
<v Speaker 2>It's so satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to end anyway.</v>

1947
01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:14.460
<v Speaker 2>You just take it for granted.</v>

1948
01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:16.410
<v Speaker 2>You open up a bottle but a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little drink it.</v>

1949
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.620
<v Speaker 2>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Water Tastes fucking awesome.</v>

1950
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:24.800
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't think it tastes awesome </v>

1951
01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.661
<v Speaker 2>because we want that goofy sugar rush </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that Goofy Coca Cola sugars </v>

1952
01:21:26.661 --> 01:21:28.080

<v Speaker 2>Caffeine rush.</v>

1953
01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:33.620

<v Speaker 2>feels better than your hand?</v>

1989
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.560
<v Speaker 2>I know I do because I know when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbating at least half of my body </v>

1990
01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:06.560
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1991
01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:11.010
<v Speaker 4>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a dick in your hand and it </v>

1992
01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:12.991
<v Speaker 4>doesn't feel as good when you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're thinking about that and you </v>

1993
01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:12.991
<v Speaker 4>think about the fact you got a dick in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your hand,</v>

1994
01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:13.970
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't feel as good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what I proposed last gentleman,</v>

<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1997
01:23:17.111 --> 01:23:20.110
<v Speaker 4>You got to get past the embarrassment </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I tell you from personal experience,</v>

1998
01:23:20.111 --> 01:23:24.010
<v Speaker 4>because I knew about the shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd heard about it on TV and on TV ads.</v>

1999
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:29.040
<v Speaker 4>I heard about it on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard about people talking about a </v>

2000
01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:29.040
<v Speaker 4>little Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Told me his flashlight story before.</v>

2001
01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:32.020
<v Speaker 4>He's had a flashlight for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was too proud to walk into a store</v>

2002
01:23:32.021 --> 01:23:37.021
<v Speaker 4>or order one online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will approve too proud to even admit </v>

2003
01:23:37.021 --> 01:23:37.021
<v Speaker 4>that I masturbate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit's ridiculous.</v>

2004
01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:41.600
<v Speaker 3>So my dad told me about this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that he's hooked onto right now.</v>

2005
01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Cut a reserve or a patrol was vera </v>
<v Speaker 3>trawl.</v>

2006

2007
01:23:49.710 --> 01:23:54.710
<v Speaker 4>Dioxin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very potent antioxidant that exists in </v>

2008
01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:54.710
<v Speaker 4>wine and I've been taking it for years.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's been doing like this huge.</v>

2010
01:23:56.501 --> 01:23:59.050
<v Speaker 3>He's like crazy research guy when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets hooked on something,</v>

2011
01:23:59.230 --> 01:24:04.230
<v Speaker 3>it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes from plants when it's stressed </v>

2012
01:24:04.230 --> 01:24:04.270
<v Speaker 3>by parasites or various infections like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the plants,</v>

2013
01:24:04.271 --> 01:24:07.510
<v Speaker 3>like a release like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fucking chemical or whatever.</v>

2014
01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.540
<v Speaker 3>So people are taking this a chemical and</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it,</v>

2015
01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:12.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go to Gnc and stuff,</v>

2016
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:15.910
<v Speaker 3>but then there's kinds that are mixed </v>
<v Speaker 3>with other things that uh,</v>

2017
01:24:16.170 --> 01:24:20.410
<v Speaker 3>but if you get it as pure as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that benefits from it or like insane.</v>

2018
01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:23.710
<v Speaker 3>It's saying that this is all in like </v>
<v Speaker 3>rats.</v>

2019
01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:28.300
<v Speaker 3>They found that the rats have like </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer gone away from it.</v>

2020
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:33.630
<v Speaker 3>A lot that in person routes of cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like bus route and they're saying that </v>

2021
01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:39.820
<v Speaker 3>it will block colon cancer in humans and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You live longer and stuff like that.</v>

2024
01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:50.580
<v Speaker 3>It's also saying there a difficulty in </v>
<v Speaker 3>absorption that we were talking about </v>

2025
01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:50.580
<v Speaker 3>this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2026
01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:55.231
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that your body absorbs very </v>

2027
01:24:55.231 --> 01:24:55.231
<v Speaker 3>little of most of the brands that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>bought.</v>

2028
01:24:55.231 --> 01:24:57.520
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to find out how pure it is.</v>

2029
01:24:57.670 --> 01:25:02.470
<v Speaker 3>And if you look on the bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look to see how pure it is.</v>

2030
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:05.740
<v Speaker 3>You want about 200 or 2:50</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 500,</v>

2031
01:25:05.741 --> 01:25:10.741
<v Speaker 3>it goes up to $500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look how the pure of the actual </v>

2032
01:25:10.741 --> 01:25:11.440
<v Speaker 3>chemical of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So two to 5,500</v>

2033
01:25:12.370 --> 01:25:13.820
<v Speaker 3>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it isn't?</v>

2034
01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:17.440
<v Speaker 3>So milligrams milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the higher the milligram,</v>

2035
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:21.580
<v Speaker 3>the more pure it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the higher it's just that chemical mixed</v>

2036
01:25:21.581 --> 01:25:26.581
<v Speaker 3>with other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it a mix with what are the other </v>

2037
01:25:26.581 --> 01:25:26.581
<v Speaker 3>things that they put in with it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2038
01:25:26.581 --> 01:25:27.910
<v Speaker 3>I like grape grape seed extract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2039
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is also an anti.</v>

2040
01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:30.020
<v Speaker 3>Have you been taking the Brian?</v>

2041
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:35.310

<v Speaker 3>but my dad's been taking it for about a </v>

2042
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.530
<v Speaker 3>month now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says a couple things.</v>

2043
01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:40.531
<v Speaker 3>He said that he feels like he is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonstop energy from when he wakes up to </v>

2044
01:25:40.531 --> 01:25:42.700
<v Speaker 3>something that he hasn't had in years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also said that his hip pain,</v>

2045
01:25:42.701 --> 01:25:44.170
<v Speaker 3>he has a bad pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took,</v>

2046
01:25:44.171 --> 01:25:47.260
<v Speaker 3>stopped taking it for a week and his hip</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're looking into it and a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>research are finding is all positive.</v>

2069
01:26:40.611 --> 01:26:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's definitely a connection</v>

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:47.920
<v Speaker 2>with camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of shit that mammals </v>

<v Speaker 2>that they can.</v>

2072
01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Like dogs can't even eat chocolate.</v>

2080
01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.080

<v Speaker 2>they melt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's all my dad.</v>

2086
01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:32.081
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's the one that first told me </v>
<v Speaker 2>there were about splendor like seven </v>

2087
01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:34.811
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about all the bad shit about bad </v>

2088
01:27:34.811 --> 01:27:34.811
<v Speaker 2>when people are just getting on splenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2089
01:27:34.811 --> 01:27:37.350
<v Speaker 2>send me reports about how the brain like</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like sugar,</v>

2090
01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.890
<v Speaker 2>and this is seven years ago he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sending me this shit.</v>

2091
01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.380
<v Speaker 2>So He's pretty coke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sucralose.</v>

2092
01:27:42.381 --> 01:27:43.520
<v Speaker 2>One's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2093
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Splenda what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>SPLENDA as any of those chemicals tricks</v>

2094
01:27:47.181 --> 01:27:52.181
<v Speaker 2>the brain into thinking it's sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it does the ship that it does do </v>

2095
01:27:52.181 --> 01:27:53.060
<v Speaker 2>fight a burn off the sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not there,</v>

2096
01:27:53.150 --> 01:27:58.150
<v Speaker 2>so it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it has a lot of bad negative </v>

2097
01:27:58.150 --> 01:27:58.150
<v Speaker 2>side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty critical.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Aspartame is a bunch of them now.</v>

2099
01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think actually sugar is probably the </v>

2100
01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:06.640
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best one for you.</v>

2101
01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.150

<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what I believe it's called a,</v>

2163
01:30:19.321 --> 01:30:21.210
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it's called now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vizio or something.</v>

2169
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.550
<v Speaker 3>something I think we're ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to reality helmets,</v>

2170
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:36.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like alternate reality helmets.</v>

2171
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Remember when they had those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were trying to do that for </v>

2172
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:42.950
<v Speaker 3>awhile though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The virtual reality there were there,</v>

2173
01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:47.980
<v Speaker 3>there was like a big thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someday we're going to be able to put a </v>

2174
01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:48.900
<v Speaker 3>helmet on and you'll know if it's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be like that.</v>

2175
01:30:48.901 --> 01:30:50.100
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in Vegas,</v>

2176
01:30:50.101 --> 01:30:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to all these,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2184
01:31:08.581 --> 01:31:10.850
<v Speaker 3>he says some of the technologies coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2187
01:31:12.601 --> 01:31:15.660
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be big where you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>just lay in bed with no pants on and you</v>

2188
01:31:15.661 --> 01:31:17.680
<v Speaker 3>feel like the legs are wrapping around </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2189
01:31:17.681 --> 01:31:22.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're fucking sitting there with </v>

2190
01:31:22.681 --> 01:31:22.681
<v Speaker 3>their flashlight on and you're immersed </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it like a helmet.</v>

2191
01:31:22.681 --> 01:31:23.090
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's going to be big.</v>

2192
01:31:23.130 --> 01:31:25.380
<v Speaker 3>He said the TVS weren't even that </v>
<v Speaker 3>impressive.</v>

2193
01:31:25.381 --> 01:31:30.381
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was impressive this year at this </v>

2194
01:31:30.381 --> 01:31:30.900
<v Speaker 3>convention was the digital projection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three Ds.</v>

2195
01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:32.880
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was just amazing.</v>

2196
01:31:32.890 --> 01:31:34.890
<v Speaker 3>That's like some help me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be one time shit.</v>

2197
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2198
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.880
<v Speaker 3>Imagine having this whole wall behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>you be three d,</v>

2199
01:31:38.881 --> 01:31:43.881
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just fucking sitting there in </v>

2200
01:31:43.881 --> 01:31:45.141
<v Speaker 3>this chair over here and you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are in Lord of the rings or </v>

2201
01:31:45.141 --> 01:31:45.141
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2202
01:31:45.141 --> 01:31:46.860
<v Speaker 3>you got to flinch and next thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be way more immersive.</v>

2203
01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Every step is coming to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The TV is going to be your wall and it's</v>

2204
01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:54.801
<v Speaker 3>probably gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Greedy when it moves past the flat </v>

2205
01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:57.530
<v Speaker 3>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when it's going to get really </v>

2206
01:31:57.530 --> 01:31:59.181
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When somehow know that they figured out </v>

2207
01:31:59.181 --> 01:32:00.921
<v Speaker 3>a way to bring you more into the action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some some invention that allows you to </v>

2208
01:32:00.921 --> 01:32:00.921
<v Speaker 3>be</v>

2209
01:32:00.921 --> 01:32:02.590
<v Speaker 2>like a virtual reality type situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you watch movies.</v>

2210
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:07.620
<v Speaker 2>So the guy said at that convention they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a 40 inch tv that didn't require </v>

2211
01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:08.710
<v Speaker 2>glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it kind of sucked,</v>

2212
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:13.950
<v Speaker 2>but he said he saw just looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>how eventually that is going to be huge </v>

2213
01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.880
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be three d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to add a depth.</v>

2214
01:32:15.881 --> 01:32:18.180
<v Speaker 2>So you walk into your room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have a picture on the wall,</v>

2215
01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.330
<v Speaker 2>this long hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're gonna.</v>

2216
01:32:19.331 --> 01:32:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Feel like that's a long hallway in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

2217
01:32:21.011 --> 01:32:26.011
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a thing I went to at the </v>

2218
01:32:26.011 --> 01:32:28.201
<v Speaker 2>planetarium the other day was one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those science shows where you lie on </v>

2219
01:32:28.201 --> 01:32:30.931
<v Speaker 2>your back and they take on a tour of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different astrological </v>

2220
01:32:30.931 --> 01:32:34.860
<v Speaker 2>configurations in the sky and </v>
<v Speaker 2>constellations and stuff and so they </v>

2221
01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:38.061
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were taking you on this tour and </v>

2222
01:32:38.061 --> 01:32:38.061
<v Speaker 2>all this different shit and space and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2223
01:32:38.061 --> 01:32:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how intense is this?</v>

2224
01:32:38.471 --> 01:32:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole ceiling is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen and you're lying back.</v>

2225
01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Like almost like a lazy boy chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lay all the way back.</v>

2226
01:32:44.981 --> 01:32:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I fell asleep even so I was tired </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was there.</v>

2227
01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm an old man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fall asleep with the movies,</v>

2228
01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:52.750
<v Speaker 2>so I'm standing up there watching this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing and I'm like,</v>

2229
01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:55.360
<v Speaker 2>well this is so much more immersive than</v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

2230
01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what the next step is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

2231
01:32:57.641 --> 01:32:59.260
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go to the movies,</v>

2232
01:32:59.261 --> 01:33:01.120
<v Speaker 2>but the movie is going to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ride.</v>

2233
01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.800
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like some space,</v>

2234
01:33:02.801 --> 01:33:07.801
<v Speaker 2>mountain type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to just going to be used </v>

2235
01:33:07.801 --> 01:33:08.170
<v Speaker 2>sitting there and everybody gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>strapped into a seat and you know,</v>

2236
01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:13.220
<v Speaker 2>you put a helmet on captain fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>chair moves and Shit and you go on a </v>

2237
01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:13.630
<v Speaker 2>ride through the movie.</v>

2238
01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:19.180
<v Speaker 2>I think they have similar things </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably already at like Disney and </v>

2239
01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:22.631
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not only for a couple minutes till </v>

2240
01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:22.631
<v Speaker 2>the ride starts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2241
01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:22.950
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2242
01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.610
<v Speaker 2>did you ever go in the Jurassic Park </v>
<v Speaker 2>ride?</v>

2243
01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Jurassic Park rides a dope one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>

2244
01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.920
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the one I'm thinking of.</v>

2245
01:33:30.090 --> 01:33:31.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost all our score.</v>

01:35:28.241 --> 01:35:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Blah is looking bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next thing is like,</v>

2298
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:31.520
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talk to Johnny Knoxville.</v>

<v Speaker 2>called in the past?</v>

<v Speaker 2>you were way ahead of the curve.</v>

2303
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one that there was like this </v>

2304
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:46.541
<v Speaker 2>really horrible fight and somebody had </v>
<v Speaker 2>filmed it and it looked like a dude was </v>

<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2306
01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:53.291
<v Speaker 2>I think the added sound effects to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real fight totally added sound effects </v>

2307
01:35:53.291 --> 01:35:56.711
<v Speaker 2>to a real fight and it looked really bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was the same noise didn't </v>

2308
01:35:56.711 --> 01:35:56.870
<v Speaker 2>sync over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not sinked up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>watching dudes get fucked up.</v>

2313
01:36:09.431 --> 01:36:09.431
<v Speaker 2>was unconscious and his whole body move </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:53.520
<v Speaker 4>These are great fights to sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but standup is good.</v>

2387
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:58.550
<v Speaker 4>His fucking Jujitsu's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How dare do they think of in the middle </v>

2388
01:38:58.550 --> 01:39:00.750
<v Speaker 4>of the Goddamn POC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They knew that they shut that shit off.</v>

2389
01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:06.200
<v Speaker 4>That's probably my manager.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's probably thinking about like </v>

2390
01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:06.270
<v Speaker 4>calling me to tell me that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about the flashlight too much.</v>

2391
01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.540
<v Speaker 4>That was a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2392
01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:14.470
<v Speaker 4>that was a good fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some good pricing.</v>

2393
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:17.290
<v Speaker 4>What's up with pat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Barry's shit.</v>

2394
01:39:17.291 --> 01:39:19.380
<v Speaker 4>He broke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He broke his foot and he broke his hand.</v>

2395
01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.560
<v Speaker 4>He broke his neck when he punched cro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cop in the first round and then dropped </v>

2396
01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:24.740
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The second punch he hit him with,</v>

2397
01:39:24.741 --> 01:39:25.980
<v Speaker 4>he said he felt is not going to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2398
01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:31.010
<v Speaker 4>And then he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently broke his foot somewhere in </v>

2399
01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:33.171
<v Speaker 4>the fight to his foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Swole up like an elephant foot took </v>

2400
01:39:33.171 --> 01:39:35.960
<v Speaker 4>pictures of it online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he has the two feet together and </v>

2401
01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:35.960
<v Speaker 4>one of them's like literally twice the </v>
<v Speaker 4>size.</v>

2402
01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:36.960
<v Speaker 4>It's nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a great fight though.</v>

2403
01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was fun.</v>

2404
01:39:38.490 --> 01:39:43.490
<v Speaker 4>That was a fun fight and fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comeback to watching cro cop turn it on </v>

2405
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:44.820
<v Speaker 4>at the end of Glasgow and then take us </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and choke him and then Cro,</v>

2406
01:39:44.821 --> 01:39:46.650
<v Speaker 4>cop campaign for the submission of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

2407
01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:48.130
<v Speaker 4>That was a good article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Tell him what do you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strategy.</v>

2409
01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was funny.</v>

2410
01:39:52.710 --> 01:39:53.730
<v Speaker 4>There was a for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2411
01:39:53.731 --> 01:39:55.800
<v Speaker 4>I hope that's his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

2412
01:39:55.801 --> 01:39:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Because he's been talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>retiring.</v>

2413
01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:02.180
<v Speaker 4>I hope he chooses to go out that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nice to see a guy go out on a high </v>

2414
01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:02.180
<v Speaker 4>note,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2415
01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:03.210
<v Speaker 4>that was a high note.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was an awesome performance.</v>

2416
01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:08.420
<v Speaker 4>At the end he addressed the crowd and </v>
<v Speaker 4>address the Croatian fans and it's </v>

2417
01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:08.700
<v Speaker 4>pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave him the microphone.</v>

2418
01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just gave it to him.</v>

2419
01:40:09.991 --> 01:40:12.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it felt like I said something to him.</v>

2420
01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.840
<v Speaker 4>He was so proud and so happy and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could feel and I was happy for the guy </v>

2421
01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.230
<v Speaker 4>and the crowd was going nuts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody was happy and I said I looked </v>

2422
01:40:21.230 --> 01:40:24.951
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw was Croatian flags and I remember </v>

2423
01:40:24.951 --> 01:40:26.991
<v Speaker 4>him talking about how many Croatian fans</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to be here in Vancouver </v>

2424
01:40:26.991 --> 01:40:27.420
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of Croatian people lived </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and I said,</v>

2425
01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:29.950
<v Speaker 4>do you have anything to say to your a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Croatian fans out there?</v>

2426
01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:34.970
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got a lot of support and the crowd </v>

2427
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:36.261
<v Speaker 4>goes nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the correlations go fucking ape </v>

2428
01:40:36.261 --> 01:40:36.261
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I just knew I was going to give</v>

2429
01:40:36.261 --> 01:40:36.840
<v Speaker 4>him the mic and he knew I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>give him the mic.</v>

2430
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:39.000
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say anything to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't say anything to me.</v>

2431
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:40.800
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just handed him the mic and he took it</v>

2432
01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:45.801
<v Speaker 4>and he started walking and pacing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking in his native language and the </v>

2433
01:40:45.801 --> 01:40:45.960
<v Speaker 4>crowd went nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a beautiful ending.</v>

2434
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he,</v>

2435
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:48.840
<v Speaker 4>if he decides that he doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>compete anymore,</v>

2436
01:40:48.841 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

2437
01:40:49.411 --> 01:40:54.411
<v Speaker 4>He might decide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might be saying that now because it </v>

2438
01:40:54.411 --> 01:40:54.411
<v Speaker 4>was a lot of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they'll get up and get back in there</v>

2439
01:40:54.411 --> 01:40:56.410
<v Speaker 4>again because it was one of his best </v>
<v Speaker 4>performances in a long time.</v>

2440
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:58.390
<v Speaker 4>He looked real good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in that third round.</v>

2441
01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:03.570
<v Speaker 4>You know when he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he had barry backed up and he was </v>

2442
01:41:03.570 --> 01:41:03.570
<v Speaker 4>nailing and with punches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

2443
01:41:03.570 --> 01:41:04.600
<v Speaker 4>he was looking sharp dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was nailing them.</v>

2444
01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:05.920
<v Speaker 4>What's the fucking hands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2445
01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:06.970
<v Speaker 4>So who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2446
01:41:06.971 --> 01:41:11.971
<v Speaker 4>He might decide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might decide to keep it light and </v>

2447
01:41:11.971 --> 01:41:11.971
<v Speaker 4>heartbreak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My doubt broke my fucking heart,</v>

2448
01:41:11.971 --> 01:41:11.971
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2449
01:41:11.971 --> 01:41:12.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good,</v>

2450
01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:15.260
<v Speaker 3>but this does seem to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's happened.</v>

2451
01:41:15.261 --> 01:41:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Like the last three fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's broken my heart.</v>

2452
01:41:16.881 --> 01:41:18.860
<v Speaker 3>I thought I didn't know he was even </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fight again.</v>

2453
01:41:18.861 --> 01:41:19.490
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

2454
01:41:19.491 --> 01:41:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's been getting knocked out.</v>

2455
01:41:20.931 --> 01:41:22.440
<v Speaker 3>What the last three fights he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked down.</v>

2456
01:41:22.441 --> 01:41:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like,</v>

2457
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:26.030
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2458
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.190
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>

2459
01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.100
<v Speaker 4>Well you got to look at it two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One way is the last four fights actually</v>

2460
01:41:29.370 --> 01:41:32.840
<v Speaker 4>now he had one in there with vandelay in</v>
<v Speaker 4>between and they keep charging.</v>

2461
01:41:32.850 --> 01:41:34.820
<v Speaker 4>One actually was after the rampage last </v>
<v Speaker 4>two weeks for two.</v>

2462
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:35.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2463
01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:37.110
<v Speaker 4>you got to look at it two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

2464
01:41:37.111 --> 01:41:42.111
<v Speaker 4>you got to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that the guys fighting top </v>

2465
01:41:42.111 --> 01:41:42.111
<v Speaker 4>level talent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2466
01:41:42.111 --> 01:41:45.470
<v Speaker 4>rampage knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got knocked out by Rashad and he got </v>

2467
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:48.750
<v Speaker 4>knocked out by Shogun and he got knocked</v>
<v Speaker 4>out by ace rich Franklin.</v>

2468
01:41:48.751 --> 01:41:51.060
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to think about these are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are four killers,</v>

2469
01:41:51.090 --> 01:41:52.500
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2470
01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:54.000
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's unfortunate.</v>

2471
01:41:54.001 --> 01:41:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2472
01:41:54.531 --> 01:41:56.910
<v Speaker 4>it's very hard to watch him lose like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2473
01:41:56.911 --> 01:41:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you grew up like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2474
01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:01.070
<v Speaker 4>basically I came up in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watched that guy fight.</v>

2475
01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.120
<v Speaker 4>One of the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first fight that he ever had in </v>

2476
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:06.120
<v Speaker 4>1998.</v>

2477
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:06.120
<v Speaker 4>I was there live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw him fighting.</v>

2478
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.910
<v Speaker 4>I think he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the dude's name was Louis </v>

2479
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:13.170
<v Speaker 4>Hernandez know Econ Zalas knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing your man is no Hernandez.</v>

2480
01:42:13.171 --> 01:42:18.171
<v Speaker 4>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comedian Louis Gonzalez is the </v>

2481
01:42:18.171 --> 01:42:18.171
<v Speaker 4>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's known as the fighter.</v>

2482
01:42:18.171 --> 01:42:18.171
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Guy,</v>

2483
01:42:18.171 --> 01:42:19.950
<v Speaker 4>the guy had really said that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always go,</v>

2484
01:42:19.951 --> 01:42:21.420
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fought a boxer,</v>

2485
01:42:21.421 --> 01:42:26.421
<v Speaker 4>a real good boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was a good fucking fight and I'd </v>

2486
01:42:26.421 --> 01:42:26.700
<v Speaker 4>seen a bunch of chuck's fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw the fight that he had.</v>

2487
01:42:26.701 --> 01:42:31.701
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't there live of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I saw the fight that he had in </v>

2488
01:42:31.701 --> 01:42:34.011
<v Speaker 4>Brazil against Palae in Valley Tudo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is back when Paleo was in its </v>

2489
01:42:34.011 --> 01:42:37.731
<v Speaker 4>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paleo was one of the baddest </v>

2490
01:42:37.731 --> 01:42:39.171
<v Speaker 4>motherfucking Muay Thai guys to ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>come out of Brazil and he's one of the </v>

2491
01:42:39.171 --> 01:42:42.051
<v Speaker 4>guys that helped train Anderson Silva </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was the best shoot box guy </v>

2492
01:42:42.051 --> 01:42:43.560
<v Speaker 4>knocked out Matt Hughes when he knocked </v>
<v Speaker 4>out a lot of dudes.</v>

2493
01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.910
<v Speaker 4>He was a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

2494
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:47.220
<v Speaker 4>Palae his fight and chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dell,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Some ba boom.</v>

2496
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:52.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean with a shot that would kill a </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal man.</v>

2497
01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Chuckles down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets right back up.</v>

2498
01:42:55.170 --> 01:42:56.400
<v Speaker 4>He had kicked him twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2499
01:42:56.401 --> 01:42:57.570

01:43:00.150 --> 01:43:03.090
<v Speaker 4>Bare knuckle into the netting on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom of the rope.</v>

2502
01:43:03.091 --> 01:43:04.920
<v Speaker 4>The bottom of the rope has a net.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2503
01:43:04.921 --> 01:43:07.560
<v Speaker 4>so that you can't slide out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to get stuck in there,</v>

2504
01:43:07.561 --> 01:43:12.561
<v Speaker 4>take your beating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Chuck's on top of them just fucking </v>

2505
01:43:12.561 --> 01:43:12.561
<v Speaker 4>punched him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>audience has shoes on.</v>

2522
01:43:40.051 --> 01:43:42.120
<v Speaker 4>Henzel Gracie got stabbed in one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And so of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2526
01:43:52.281 --> 01:43:53.560
<v Speaker 4>old school,</v>

<v Speaker 4>lights go out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2530
01:43:59.241 --> 01:44:00.650
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who did it?</v>

2531
01:44:00.651 --> 01:44:02.300
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they thought that someone was </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting their ass kicked.</v>

2532
01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:04.330
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a fucking crazy mats.</v>

2533
01:44:04.331 --> 01:44:05.900
<v Speaker 4>Couple goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Henzle gets stabbed.</v>

2534
01:44:05.901 --> 01:44:10.901
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking people are stabbing people in </v>

2535
01:44:10.901 --> 01:44:10.901
<v Speaker 4>the audience.</v>

2536
01:44:10.901 --> 01:44:13.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are the kinds of fights that that </v>

2537
01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:13.840
<v Speaker 4>chocolate Dell went through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2538
01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:14.540
<v Speaker 4>he did it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fought in the early days.</v>

2539
01:44:14.541 --> 01:44:19.541
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he found the first time in the UFC was </v>

2540
01:44:19.541 --> 01:44:19.541
<v Speaker 4>wearing shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was wearing wrestling shoes,</v>

2541
01:44:19.541 --> 01:44:19.541
<v Speaker 4>kicking dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2542
01:44:19.541 --> 01:44:20.960
<v Speaker 4>there was very few rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2543
01:44:20.961 --> 01:44:24.530
<v Speaker 4>things were totally different back then </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that has been through so much.</v>

2544
01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.540
<v Speaker 4>He's been through it all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2545
01:44:26.630 --> 01:44:28.730
<v Speaker 4>it's just the last few guys that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>fought,</v>

2546
01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.350
<v Speaker 4>he's a step below,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2547
01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:32.360
<v Speaker 4>always a step behind where he used to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

2548
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:34.310
<v Speaker 4>If he was fighting lower level </v>
<v Speaker 4>competition,</v>

2549
01:44:34.311 --> 01:44:37.070
<v Speaker 4>like say if they put chuck against,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say some of the guys that fight at two,</v>

2550
01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:42.071
<v Speaker 4>oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the ultimate fighter or some guys </v>

2551
01:44:42.071 --> 01:44:42.071
<v Speaker 4>that are like lower level guys don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the kind of standup up the ass,</v>

2552
01:44:42.071 --> 01:44:44.200
<v Speaker 4>he'll be fucking a lot of dudes up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think though that brain,</v>

2553
01:44:44.290 --> 01:44:47.060
<v Speaker 4>his brain just wants to go to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 4>though I it knows that like,</v>

2554
01:44:47.061 --> 01:44:49.040
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know when a knockout is now I,</v>

2555
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:51.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's lost his chin.</v>

2556
01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:54.260
<v Speaker 4>That is what everybody says and that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens with fighters.</v>

2557
01:44:55.310 --> 01:45:00.310
<v Speaker 4>That is what happened with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no getting away from that at a </v>

2558
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.310
<v Speaker 4>certain point in time made it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

2559
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:03.860
<v Speaker 4>He knows that it happens with football </v>
<v Speaker 4>players once they got hooked on it.</v>

2560
01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:05.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>

2561
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.320
<v Speaker 4>when guys start getting knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just when you've taken a certain </v>

2562
01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.890
<v Speaker 4>amount of concussions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sidewalk bathrooms,</v>

2563
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:18.950
<v Speaker 4>you got hit on the side and he went out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll talk afterwards because </v>

2564
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.950
<v Speaker 4>nobody's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not miked up.</v>

2565
01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.880
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2566
01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:22.610
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a legend.</v>

2567
01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:27.940
<v Speaker 4>He's a guy who's had a gigantic career </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was one of these when he was in </v>

2568
01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:28.460
<v Speaker 4>his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the scariest guys.</v>

2569
01:45:28.461 --> 01:45:30.080
<v Speaker 4>Every one of the most exciting fighters </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

2570
01:45:30.081 --> 01:45:35.081
<v Speaker 4>When you went to see a chocolate Delphi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you knew that someone was going to get </v>

2571
01:45:35.081 --> 01:45:35.081
<v Speaker 4>their fucking ass kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2572
01:45:35.081 --> 01:45:35.510
<v Speaker 4>and it was going to be brutal.</v>

2573
01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:36.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was going to smash somebody,</v>

2574
01:45:36.921 --> 01:45:39.140
<v Speaker 4>he was going to get a hold of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to kick you and punch you and</v>

2575
01:45:39.141 --> 01:45:44.141
<v Speaker 4>smash you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember the first time he knocked out </v>

2576
01:45:44.141 --> 01:45:44.141
<v Speaker 4>randy couture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

2577
01:45:44.141 --> 01:45:44.690
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can knock out randy.</v>

2578
01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:47.210
<v Speaker 4>Randy had been in there with Pedro </v>
<v Speaker 4>Huizar.</v>

2579
01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:49.190
<v Speaker 4>Randy had been in there with Maury </v>
<v Speaker 4>Smith.</v>

2580
01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:51.830
<v Speaker 4>Randy had been in there with big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strong knockout,</v>

2581
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.160
<v Speaker 4>high level kickboxer heavyweights and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had knocked him out,</v>

2582
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:59.510
<v Speaker 4>but to get in there with chuck and Chuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>blast to orbit with one punch.</v>

2583
01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:02.000
<v Speaker 4>So like the way he could knock dudes out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was.</v>

2584
01:46:02.001 --> 01:46:07.001
<v Speaker 4>There was very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very few human beings that could stand </v>

2585
01:46:07.001 --> 01:46:07.001
<v Speaker 4>in front of the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy when he blasts,</v>

2586
01:46:07.001 --> 01:46:10.370
<v Speaker 4>but like a lot of guys who have a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular style.</v>

2587
01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:12.290
<v Speaker 4>Once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once,</v>

2588
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:14.660
<v Speaker 4>once your reflux it start to go a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

2589
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:18.680
<v Speaker 4>Once you've taken too much punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have other ways to win.</v>

2590
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:22.250
<v Speaker 4>The more ways you have the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more unpredictable you are,</v>

2591
01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:24.740
<v Speaker 4>the more successful you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I got to like GSP,</v>

2592
01:46:24.741 --> 01:46:27.500
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't even hardly get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mean got hurt by Matt Serra,</v>

2593
01:46:27.501 --> 01:46:29.720
<v Speaker 4>but he got clipped and he says he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>take Sarah.</v>

2594
01:46:29.930 --> 01:46:32.120
<v Speaker 4>He took Sarah a little bit lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you,</v>

2595
01:46:32.150 --> 01:46:34.940
<v Speaker 4>if you're the type of guy that nobody </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows what the fuck are you going to do,</v>

2596
01:46:34.941 --> 01:46:39.941
<v Speaker 4>where they're going to shoot and go for </v>
<v Speaker 4>a take down or are going to in the bang </v>

2597
01:46:39.941 --> 01:46:42.881
<v Speaker 4>if you're cautious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know when to attack and went to </v>

2598
01:46:42.881 --> 01:46:45.011
<v Speaker 4>move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to be like always one step </v>

2599
01:46:45.011 --> 01:46:47.381
<v Speaker 4>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can't just be just run in there and </v>

2600
01:46:47.381 --> 01:46:47.381
<v Speaker 4>brawl and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and chuck was so fucking good at running</v>

2601
01:46:47.381 --> 01:46:49.170
<v Speaker 4>there and brawl and he had such a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>chin.</v>

2602
01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:53.880
<v Speaker 4>It was such a good counter puncher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know he based his whole style on that.</v>

2603
01:46:53.881 --> 01:46:58.881
<v Speaker 4>And because of that he was the most one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the most successful guys and one of </v>

2604
01:46:58.881 --> 01:46:59.160
<v Speaker 4>the most exciting guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2605
01:46:59.370 --> 01:47:02.150
<v Speaker 4>that's not the style that allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep going deep into your forties.</v>

2606
01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:07.200
<v Speaker 4>Like Randy coture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a safer style like you stands </v>

2607
01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.611
<v Speaker 4>with guides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he just wants to get a hold of your </v>

2608
01:47:10.611 --> 01:47:10.611
<v Speaker 4>ass and went to get a hold of your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pressing up against the cage,</v>

2609
01:47:10.611 --> 01:47:12.030
<v Speaker 4>beat the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You kick your knees,</v>

2610
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:17.270
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kick your legs rather knee you in the </v>

2611
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.270
<v Speaker 4>legs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elbow you punch,</v>

2612
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:20.421
<v Speaker 4>you get that dirty box and going and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then hopefully get your ass on the </v>

2613
01:47:20.421 --> 01:47:23.421
<v Speaker 4>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beat the shit out of you down there and </v>

2614
01:47:23.421 --> 01:47:23.421
<v Speaker 4>then choke you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2615
01:47:23.421 --> 01:47:23.421
<v Speaker 4>That's how randy's rocking it these </v>
<v Speaker 4>days,</v>

2616
01:47:23.421 --> 01:47:24.210
<v Speaker 4>especially in the coalmine fight.</v>

2617
01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.640
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in the coalmine fight.</v>

2618
01:47:26.641 --> 01:47:27.870
<v Speaker 4>You get to see him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2619
01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:29.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the coalmine fight,</v>

2620
01:47:29.101 --> 01:47:30.510
<v Speaker 4>like he had a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 4>strategy.</v>

2621
01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Beat Coleman standing up and then took </v>
<v Speaker 4>home and down choked him.</v>

2622
01:47:33.391 --> 01:47:33.720
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2623
01:47:33.721 --> 01:47:36.210
<v Speaker 4>he's diversifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adding more shit to his game.</v>

2624
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:39.870
<v Speaker 4>I think of chuck had done that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight who had been a lot better off,</v>

2625
01:47:39.871 --> 01:47:42.390
<v Speaker 4>but I think he hits so fucking hard and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2626
01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:47.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's so used to blast and guys and </v>

2627
01:47:47.410 --> 01:47:47.410
<v Speaker 4>there's so much success that it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>feels good to them.</v>

2628
01:47:47.410 --> 01:47:51.531
<v Speaker 4>And once it starts going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just chases these motherfucker down </v>

2629
01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:51.531
<v Speaker 4>chase's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these motherfuckers down.</v>

2630
01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:55.080
<v Speaker 4>He wants a blast them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Franklin condom with that really </v>

2631
01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:58.101
<v Speaker 4>well timed right hand a current </v>
<v Speaker 4>overcommitting so chuck was moving </v>

2632
01:47:58.101 --> 01:47:59.190
<v Speaker 4>forward and he just catches him with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that counter.</v>

2633
01:47:59.310 --> 01:48:02.070
<v Speaker 4>So even though it didn't look like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hardest punch in the world,</v>

2634
01:48:02.650 --> 01:48:07.650
<v Speaker 4>rich has a hard puncher and chuck was </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving forward and so it was a hard </v>

2635
01:48:07.650 --> 01:48:07.650
<v Speaker 4>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

2636
01:48:07.650 --> 01:48:09.270
<v Speaker 4>It busted open his lip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you see what his lip looked like?</v>

2637
01:48:09.930 --> 01:48:10.860
<v Speaker 4>It looked bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A big,</v>

2638
01:48:10.890 --> 01:48:12.120
<v Speaker 4>big cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't like.</v>

2639
01:48:12.121 --> 01:48:14.120
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2640
01:48:14.190 --> 01:48:16.890
<v Speaker 4>a shot that shouldn't have dropped him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Shaka dropped anybody.</v>

2641
01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.180
<v Speaker 4>It was a hard shot.</v>

2642
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Sick two years ago we'll have dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would have rattled him a </v>

2643
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:24.030
<v Speaker 2>little more maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's gotten this in his head and</v>

2644
01:48:24.031 --> 01:48:24.830
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2645
01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I had to sleep apnea first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you first have an extreme,</v>

2646
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:29.670
<v Speaker 2>you wake up like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

2647
01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:33.790
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is every time you lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>your breath,</v>

2648
01:48:33.791 --> 01:48:38.791
<v Speaker 2>when I was 400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I chase you or walk and I </v>

2649
01:48:38.791 --> 01:48:39.690
<v Speaker 2>lose my breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body was going through anxiety.</v>

2650
01:48:40.290 --> 01:48:41.760
<v Speaker 2>That's how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I had to go to the ICU.</v>

2651
01:48:41.770 --> 01:48:46.770
<v Speaker 2>So your body would start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trauma that you've had in the past </v>

2652
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:46.770
<v Speaker 2>and when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have sleep apnea,</v>

2653
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:51.741
<v Speaker 2>you wake up choking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wake up on your feet going like </v>

2654
01:48:51.741 --> 01:48:52.530
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no grasping for air.</v>

2655
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:55.710
<v Speaker 2>So every time I ran on the air for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>

2656
01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:57.960
<v Speaker 2>even on planes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was just a connection,</v>

2657
01:48:58.050 --> 01:48:59.610
<v Speaker 2>just the connection and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2658
01:48:59.610 --> 01:49:01.620
<v Speaker 2>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of it,</v>

2659
01:49:01.621 --> 01:49:04.920
<v Speaker 2>just the raw data that we know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that take concussions,</v>

2660
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:06.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot take too many concussions.</v>

2661
01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to.</v>

2662
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to know that putting the </v>

2663
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:13.000
<v Speaker 2>finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I told Eddie,</v>

2664
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Eddie goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2665
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
<v Speaker 2>soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert came back and he just started </v>

2666
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.861
<v Speaker 2>covering him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stuff like all the way chuck is right </v>

2667
01:49:18.861 --> 01:49:20.541
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody will just hit his hand and he </v>

2668
01:49:20.541 --> 01:49:20.541
<v Speaker 2>could hit themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock himself out.</v>

2669
01:49:20.541 --> 01:49:22.280
<v Speaker 2>That's how sensitive that switching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a shame.</v>

2670
01:49:22.281 --> 01:49:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm as big as four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took a couple of shots before that.</v>

2671
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:29.130
<v Speaker 2>Before that Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took one to the head.</v>

2672
01:49:29.131 --> 01:49:32.250
<v Speaker 2>He took one to go back to watch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight again.</v>

2673
01:49:32.251 --> 01:49:33.900
<v Speaker 2>But I remember him getting clipped a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of times.</v>

2674
01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got clipped a couple times.</v>

2675
01:49:35.041 --> 01:49:36.840
<v Speaker 2>I heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole place smelled like weed.</v>

2676
01:49:36.850 --> 01:49:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Was that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2677
01:49:37.981 --> 01:49:39.120

<v Speaker 2>When I went to the bathroom,</v>

2678
01:49:39.121 --> 01:49:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I went to go take a leak and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running back to the bathroom.</v>

2679
01:49:41.101 --> 01:49:44.250
<v Speaker 2>It just stunk of weed in this one area </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the same area.</v>

<v Speaker 2>walk through the tunnel on the way to </v>

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:16.550
<v Speaker 2>or got Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Damon My.</v>

2712
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:17.650
<v Speaker 2>This is what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2713
01:51:17.651 --> 01:51:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I respect Anderson as a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't respect them as a person.</v>

2714
01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck that means to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson.</v>

2715
01:51:21.881 --> 01:51:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2716
01:51:22.721 --> 01:51:27.721
<v Speaker 2>But that made him crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got so angry and so we never seen </v>

2717
01:51:27.721 --> 01:51:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Anderson standing in front of a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling and screaming,</v>

2718
01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:32.020
<v Speaker 2>screaming at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling him rich boy and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>saying all these different squares and </v>

2720
01:51:37.021 --> 01:51:37.021
<v Speaker 2>then just beating his ass and mocking </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2721
01:51:37.021 --> 01:51:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Never seen to Anderson do that before to</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

2722
01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:44.850
<v Speaker 2>And Demian Maia is generally known as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice guy and respectful guy in a </v>

2723
01:51:44.850 --> 01:51:45.070
<v Speaker 2>martial artist.</v>

01:51:45.071 --> 01:51:47.470
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it meant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threw him into a tizzy.</v>

2725
01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:50.560
<v Speaker 2>What is gonna happen when he gets in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cage with channel Sunnen?</v>

2726
01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Charles Center has talked so much shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them making sacrifices to pick me </v>

2727
01:51:56.171 --> 01:51:58.700
<v Speaker 2>God's and fucking all kinds of knots.</v>

2728
01:51:58.700 --> 01:51:59.620
<v Speaker 2>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2729
01:51:59.621 --> 01:52:02.820
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't stop.</v>

2730
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:06.550
<v Speaker 2>He goes to Pailin certain Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his twitter is just rampant with it,</v>

2731
01:52:06.810 --> 01:52:09.100
<v Speaker 2>whose twitter is all like him talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2732
01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:13.250
<v Speaker 2>But I have not even seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for opening up my house.</v>

2733
01:52:13.330 --> 01:52:16.390
<v Speaker 2>He does these questions and answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed the one he did in Vancouver.</v>

2734
01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed the other one before that,</v>

2735
01:52:18.041 --> 01:52:23.041
<v Speaker 2>but everybody was talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It said it was the funniest fucking q </v>

2736
01:52:23.041 --> 01:52:23.041
<v Speaker 2>and a by far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My facebook.</v>

2737
01:52:23.041 --> 01:52:27.721
<v Speaker 2>Somebody say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Fogle the Guy Willie bar setup </v>

2738
01:52:27.721 --> 01:52:27.721
<v Speaker 2>broke his nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emailed it to me.</v>

2739
01:52:27.721 --> 01:52:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just did another one.</v>

2740
01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.470
<v Speaker 2>It just did another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2741
01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:34.560
<v Speaker 2>This is the second q and a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then two of them so far pumping up the </v>

2742
01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Anderson fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2743
01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:39.091
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he fucked up when he's told that as </v>

2744
01:52:39.091 --> 01:52:41.551
<v Speaker 2>he's Antasari joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to do the Internet is </v>

2745
01:52:41.551 --> 01:52:43.351
<v Speaker 2>not going to let them ride that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been to a website called a </v>

2746
01:52:43.351 --> 01:52:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Wolfram?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wolfram Alpha.</v>

2747
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 2>This Wolfram Alpha</v>

2748
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:51.220
<v Speaker 4>for people who aren't aware of it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just project where they're trying to </v>

2749
01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:53.651
<v Speaker 4>take the next step after Google and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to be a website literally that </v>

2750
01:52:53.651 --> 01:52:54.320
<v Speaker 4>you ask it a question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gives you an answer.</v>

2751
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:59.350
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so cool because like I put in my </v>

2752
01:52:59.350 --> 01:53:01.841
<v Speaker 4>birthday in the weather and I got the </v>
<v Speaker 4>exact temperature when I was born to the</v>

2753
01:53:02.091 --> 01:53:04.100
<v Speaker 4>exact hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the lows,</v>

2754
01:53:04.101 --> 01:53:09.101
<v Speaker 4>the highs during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That cloud cover the population of </v>

2755
01:53:09.101 --> 01:53:09.101
<v Speaker 4>Columbus at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the humidity,</v>

2756
01:53:09.101 --> 01:53:13.961
<v Speaker 4>the pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wind's blowing so much shit that if </v>

2757
01:53:13.961 --> 01:53:17.081
<v Speaker 4>I was with doc from back to the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could totally get to the right second </v>

2758
01:53:17.081 --> 01:53:17.990
<v Speaker 4>of the day that I needed to go back in </v>
<v Speaker 4>time with,</v>

2759
01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:22.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this will give you the information </v>

2760
01:53:22.991 --> 01:53:22.991
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2761
01:53:22.991 --> 01:53:25.661
<v Speaker 4>it's really funny that you just brought </v>
<v Speaker 4>that up and then you're talking about </v>

2762
01:53:25.661 --> 01:53:28.181
<v Speaker 4>this because there was a subject that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was on the message board the other day </v>

2763
01:53:28.181 --> 01:53:28.181
<v Speaker 4>that I thought was really interesting.</v>

2764
01:53:28.181 --> 01:53:31.450
<v Speaker 4>There's this new scientific discovery </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they found where they do believe </v>

2765
01:53:31.450 --> 01:53:35.561
<v Speaker 4>that it's possible that the universe </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be far older than 14 billion </v>

2766
01:53:35.561 --> 01:53:35.600
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they think it is.</v>

2767
01:53:35.601 --> 01:53:40.601
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think it's like 150 billion and </v>

2768
01:53:40.601 --> 01:53:41.570
<v Speaker 4>it's just this small group of scientists</v>
<v Speaker 4>and astronomers,</v>

2769
01:53:41.590 --> 01:53:44.990
<v Speaker 4>the that have this possibility in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>head and you know,</v>

2770
01:53:44.991 --> 01:53:49.991
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't been sold yet entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you start thinking about stuff </v>

2771
01:53:49.991 --> 01:53:49.991
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2772
01:53:49.991 --> 01:53:53.390
<v Speaker 4>There was like an argument on the board </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the argument was there's some things</v>

2773
01:53:53.391 --> 01:53:55.400
<v Speaker 4>about the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're never going to be able to know.</v>

2774
01:53:55.430 --> 01:54:00.430
<v Speaker 4>It's pointless to even try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never got to know when the universe </v>

2775
01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:00.530
<v Speaker 4>began.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck do they know that?</v>

2776
01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.120
<v Speaker 4>How do you know that you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever be able to know?</v>

2777
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:07.390
<v Speaker 4>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If our understanding is constantly </v>

2778
01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.390
<v Speaker 4>increasing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2779
01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:10.260
<v Speaker 4>What we know today is so much more </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced than what we knew just 100 </v>

2780
01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:11.450
<v Speaker 4>years ago or 200 years ago or 300 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

2781
01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:16.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple hundred years ago to get </v>

2782
01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:16.740
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

2783
01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:16.740
<v Speaker 4>You have to be on a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2784
01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:17.390
<v Speaker 4>You wanted an image of someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to draw it,</v>

2785
01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.410
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no cameras.</v>

2786
01:54:18.411 --> 01:54:19.250
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about that.</v>

2787
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:24.310
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just a couple of hundred years </v>

2788
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:26.020
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what the fuck kind of </v>

2789
01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:27.311
<v Speaker 4>innovations going to come up a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 years from now or a couple thousand </v>

2790
01:54:27.311 --> 01:54:30.611
<v Speaker 4>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might very well be possible that not </v>

2791
01:54:30.611 --> 01:54:32.600
<v Speaker 4>only can we decipher exactly how the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe began,</v>

2792
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:37.750
<v Speaker 4>but we can probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're probably going to be able to get </v>

2793
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:40.571
<v Speaker 4>an accurate map of the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>planet from the very beginning to now </v>

2794
01:54:40.571 --> 01:54:43.370
<v Speaker 4>much more detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more precise than we have today.</v>

2795
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:48.550
<v Speaker 4>We're probably going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>recreate or capture every single moment </v>

2796
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:51.350
<v Speaker 4>of every single day of every single hour</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's ever existed.</v>

2797
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:54.770
<v Speaker 4>That's it's all very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to get crazier and crazier</v>

2798
01:54:54.771 --> 01:54:55.340
<v Speaker 4>with time.</v>

2799
01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:00.110
<v Speaker 4>They're going to get crazier and crazier</v>
<v Speaker 4>with breaking down the quantum mechanics</v>

2800
01:55:00.111 --> 01:55:01.040
<v Speaker 4>of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2801
01:55:01.041 --> 01:55:05.330
<v Speaker 4>when you start getting into like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy subatomic particles that disappear</v>

2802
01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:10.331
<v Speaker 4>and reappear and exist in two different </v>
<v Speaker 4>places at the same time or in a </v>

2803
01:55:10.331 --> 01:55:10.970
<v Speaker 4>superposition and these things that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't understand well.</v>

2804
01:55:10.971 --> 01:55:15.971
<v Speaker 4>As we get more and more understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>and know more and more about the </v>

2805
01:55:15.971 --> 01:55:16.820
<v Speaker 4>weirdness of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be able to figure out how</v>

2806
01:55:16.821 --> 01:55:18.590
<v Speaker 4>to fucking decipher it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2807
01:55:18.591 --> 01:55:20.100
<v Speaker 4>and it might be that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2808
01:55:20.110 --> 01:55:25.110
<v Speaker 4>like a time machine when the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they invent a time machine or </v>

2809
01:55:25.110 --> 01:55:27.431
<v Speaker 4>something like that or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever the fuck you want to call </v>

2810
01:55:27.431 --> 01:55:27.431
<v Speaker 4>this next stage of understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

2811
01:55:27.431 --> 01:55:32.110
<v Speaker 4>When they invented the idea of a time </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine is the only way you're gonna be </v>

2812
01:55:32.110 --> 01:55:35.321
<v Speaker 4>able to travel back in time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's once the first time machines </v>

2813
01:55:35.321 --> 01:55:37.640
<v Speaker 4>invented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're going to invent a time </v>

2814
01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:39.551
<v Speaker 4>machine and you can't go before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what you can do is anything from </v>

2815
01:55:39.551 --> 01:55:43.031
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll be able to come back to that </v>

2816
01:55:43.031 --> 01:55:43.031
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so everything that exists from now until</v>

2817
01:55:43.031 --> 01:55:45.210
<v Speaker 4>whenever you can access it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as they invent a time machine,</v>

2818
01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:46.920
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>

2819
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Why fucking not shit's going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

2820
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:52.290
<v Speaker 4>If you can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody would have ever thought you could</v>

2821
01:55:52.291 --> 01:55:57.291
<v Speaker 4>be able to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you talked to someone in </v>

2822
01:55:57.291 --> 01:55:58.671
<v Speaker 4>Shakespeare's day and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think there's ever going to be </v>

2823
01:55:58.671 --> 01:56:00.420
<v Speaker 4>able to time where I've take something </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of my pocket and through the air,</v>

2824
01:56:00.421 --> 01:56:03.450
<v Speaker 4>I ask it a question like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could mean Wolfram Alpha.</v>

2825
01:56:03.451 --> 01:56:04.980
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can do that with Google.</v>

2826
01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:10.100
<v Speaker 4>You can google voice it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what year did the Sistine </v>

2827
01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:10.100
<v Speaker 4>Chapel get built?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

2828
01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:14.990
<v Speaker 4>They tell you instantly and if you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it gets to a point and it's gone to </v>

2829
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.480
<v Speaker 4>if they've got the google,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it gets all Wolfram Alpha point,</v>

2830
01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:17.160
<v Speaker 4>we can have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can ask it a question,</v>

2831
01:56:17.161 --> 01:56:22.161
<v Speaker 4>you can give any answer or it can give </v>
<v Speaker 4>you any answer on any question of </v>

2832
01:56:22.161 --> 01:56:25.790
<v Speaker 4>anything that's ever happened ever that </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings are aware of and you'll </v>

2833
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:28.611
<v Speaker 4>have all the information right there </v>
<v Speaker 4>were you told that to people that lived </v>

2834
01:56:28.611 --> 01:56:28.611
<v Speaker 4>in Shakespeare's Day.</v>

2835
01:56:28.611 --> 01:56:28.611
<v Speaker 4>They were told you about her fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

2836
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:32.970
<v Speaker 4>It's going to get crazier than this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to because everything gets crazy.</v>

2837
01:56:34.710 --> 01:56:39.710
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is next?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I just drive in my car and I </v>

2838
01:56:39.710 --> 01:56:40.620
<v Speaker 4>sit in traffic and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is next?</v>

2839
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:44.040
<v Speaker 4>Is there going to be some crazy new </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that's going to change everything?</v>

2840
01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:49.280
<v Speaker 4>Like is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are we in a race between human beings </v>

2841
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:52.730
<v Speaker 4>figuring out what the next thing is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next crazy innovation is or us just </v>

2842
01:56:52.730 --> 01:56:57.411
<v Speaker 4>completely fucking everything up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>polluting the fucking ocean and you </v>

2843
01:56:57.411 --> 01:56:59.400
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear explosions and wars and all that</v>

2844
01:56:59.401 --> 01:57:04.401
<v Speaker 4>other crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like are we in a race between like </v>

2845
01:57:04.401 --> 01:57:05.250
<v Speaker 4>Schumann retarded chimpanzee instincts </v>
<v Speaker 4>and technology?</v>

2846
01:57:05.970 --> 01:57:10.970
<v Speaker 4>You ever thought about it like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when we talk about like the peak </v>

2847
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:12.240
<v Speaker 4>oil documentary that we watched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we thought it was bullshit,</v>

2848
01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:15.210
<v Speaker 4>but the idea of peak oil is a terrifying</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

2849
01:57:15.210 --> 01:57:20.210
<v Speaker 4>If it was true and if there was a finite</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of oil and they do bust into it </v>

2850
01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:20.210
<v Speaker 4>and then we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're fucked,</v>

2851
01:57:20.230 --> 01:57:25.230
<v Speaker 4>we have no oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things could get really crazy like that </v>

2852
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:25.710
<v Speaker 4>is really possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they going to come up with something</v>

2853
01:57:25.711 --> 01:57:30.711
<v Speaker 4>that's going to replace that and make </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything better and make everything </v>

2854
01:57:30.711 --> 01:57:30.711
<v Speaker 4>even more advanced and more simple and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

2855
01:57:30.711 --> 01:57:32.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more natural to the,</v>

2856
01:57:32.970 --> 01:57:37.970
<v Speaker 4>to the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they going to figure that out first </v>

2857
01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:38.190
<v Speaker 4>or are we going to run out of supplies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and resources first?</v>

2858
01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:43.340
<v Speaker 4>Like is that a battle is a battle </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the human retarded monkey </v>

2859
01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:43.340
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzee behavior of take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take,</v>

2860
01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:48.231
<v Speaker 4>take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't think about the future and </v>

2861
01:57:48.231 --> 01:57:48.231
<v Speaker 4>technology and innovation and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to harness matter.</v>

2862
01:57:48.231 --> 01:57:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I think whatever happens is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen during our lifetimes.</v>

2863
01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2864
01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I think something crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lifetime.</v>

2865
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years ago when you were finger </v>
<v Speaker 1>banging,</v>

2866
01:57:57.061 --> 01:57:59.250
<v Speaker 1>that chick behind boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston high school,</v>

2867
01:57:59.810 --> 01:58:04.810
<v Speaker 1>that was going to be a milkshake thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same shit that is every year </v>

2868
01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:10.410
<v Speaker 1>something new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every year,</v>

2869
01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:15.860
<v Speaker 1>every year there's going to be after we </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the reaction to all this oil in </v>

2870
01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:16.860
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a rehab.</v>

2871
01:58:16.861 --> 01:58:18.270
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be innovation.</v>

2872
01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible,</v>

2873
01:58:19.231 --> 01:58:22.260
<v Speaker 1>horrible disaster.</v>

2877
01:58:33.891 --> 01:58:35.250
<v Speaker 1>summer it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too much of a drug to go from.</v>

2878
01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Problem with that show is there's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people like that and now think they</v>

3028
02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:13.410
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>will they do it in a movie theater when </v>

3031
02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:25.051
<v Speaker 1>someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did he get away with that shit?</v>

3032
02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Just put a little fucking tripod on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3033
02:05:26.710 --> 02:05:30.090
<v Speaker 1>A little thing where those soda sets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put a tripod in there,</v>

3034
02:05:30.091 --> 02:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Jack that sucker up and keep an eye out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the door.</v>

3035
02:05:33.050 --> 02:05:34.590
<v Speaker 1>People who've gotten caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got caught.</v>

3036
02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:36.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go into a theater in Chicago.</v>

3037
02:05:36.631 --> 02:05:41.631
<v Speaker 1>So the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the became took codes and you have them </v>

3038
02:05:41.631 --> 02:05:42.480
<v Speaker 1>on the top side of your screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3039
02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Narrows it down to the theater and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they know,</v>

3040
02:05:45.781 --> 02:05:50.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can break down the images and </v>

3041
02:05:50.781 --> 02:05:50.781
<v Speaker 1>they could find in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3042
02:05:50.781 --> 02:05:54.060
<v Speaker 1>They go to the top feeder out of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do we go?</v>

3043
02:05:54.061 --> 02:05:59.061
<v Speaker 1>What's that club we went to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't Chicago but it was the one </v>

3044
02:05:59.061 --> 02:06:02.661
<v Speaker 1>with the older Sharpsburg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right in that area because I don't </v>

3045
02:06:02.661 --> 02:06:04.620
<v Speaker 1>want them showing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was an AMC and AMC said fuck it.</v>

3046
02:06:04.621 --> 02:06:07.230
<v Speaker 1>So they put codes on the film then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how they know who did it,</v>

3047
02:06:07.610 --> 02:06:12.610
<v Speaker 2>they don't know who did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I guess the theater is getting </v>

3048
02:06:12.610 --> 02:06:14.920
<v Speaker 2>charged for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have to make sure they have </v>

3049
02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:14.920
<v Speaker 2>ushers that go in and look for cameras </v>
<v Speaker 2>and grow.</v>

3050
02:06:15.290 --> 02:06:16.900
<v Speaker 2>They find the theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3051
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3053
02:06:22.590 --> 02:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how they knew that it was the </v>

3054
02:06:27.590 --> 02:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I used to buy old school</v>

3055
02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:33.410
<v Speaker 2>back in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could walk down the street and be </v>

3056
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:33.410
<v Speaker 2>walking home from a comedy club and </v>

<v Speaker 2>Canada is always a good time.</v>

3078
02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:39.340

3083
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Canada is and let you in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they don't let you in.</v>

3086
02:07:54.731 --> 02:07:56.440

3089
02:08:01.441 --> 02:08:02.680

02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:42.820
<v Speaker 2>They wanted me to not do it totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They moved to UFC from Utah because they</v>
