1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.560
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:01.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:01.771 --> 00:00:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I always assumed we would be hanging out all the time from now on from,</v>

4
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.440
<v Speaker 1>from that point on.</v>

5
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>But it really didn't work out that way.</v>

6
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.013
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

8
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.353
<v Speaker 1>it never does,</v>

9
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

10
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

11
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>that's true because everybody goes in such different directions.</v>

13
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I've ran into Maura a once or twice.</v>

14
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I know rents are once we had a good time at one of those NBC functions and I was</v>

15
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>on Newsradio or fear factor and she was on er and we got drunk together.</v>

16
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It was a great time.</v>

17
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>It was all like the old days.</v>

18
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>The mind is always fun to get drunk.</v>

19
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.551
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

20
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>She's one of the best ever.</v>

21
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>she was the one who convinced me to kick in the craft service door.</v>

23
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>We're all hungry.</v>

24
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.343
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

26
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>We had some good times on that set after the set.</v>

27
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.501
<v Speaker 1>After filming,</v>

28
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>we would basically just drink all night,</v>

29
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>filming would be done at whatever and we all have our mini fridge is stocked in</v>

31
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>our coolers and we would just get hammered and just shoot the shit and have fun</v>

32
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>and laugh and go over Dave's room and listen to some weird music.</v>

33
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Dave always had some weird chicks that made you want to cry laying in a few of</v>

34
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:00.991
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

35
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:01.824
<v Speaker 1>The dated.</v>

36
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

39
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.973
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>

41
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>somber women voices and a,</v>

42
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:09.191
<v Speaker 1>and then we,</v>

43
00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:09.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

44
00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>somebody would be there till,</v>

45
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>till it was time to go to Denny's.</v>

46
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

47
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Or we would go to a,</v>

48
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>down the street when we were at sunset Gower,</v>

49
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>we would go down to that bar.</v>

50
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.271
<v Speaker 1>What was it called?</v>

51
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>There was like a liquor in the industry bar look really catered to people that</v>

52
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>were leaving the set.</v>

53
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.533
<v Speaker 1>right next to the</v>

57
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>peanut.</v>

58
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Was that what it was?</v>

59
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>it was to be the Columbia bar and grill.</v>

61
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

62
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

65
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like all the people from a Fraser and a dal is weird.</v>

66
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>It'd be there.</v>

67
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

68

<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

69
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And he wouldn't be stiff as fuck.</v>

70
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>We would be hammered and they would be all still like doing their actor thing.</v>

71
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:41.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

72
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a marvelous performance.</v>

73
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I think he was quite lovely.</v>

74
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that it's on Broadway now.</v>

77
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I've got to see it.</v>

78
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>they were just all completely full of shit and he would come in and try and grab</v>

80
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>everybody's Dick and you know,</v>

81
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Dave and I would be hammered more hammered.</v>

82
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And Julie being and certainly being,</v>

84
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:00.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

85
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>we'd all be laughing and joking around.</v>

86
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a great,</v>

88
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>great group of humans.</v>

89
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the most fun times of my entire life,</v>

90
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>those years.</v>

91
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.941
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

92
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>There was one time I remember we were about to go and do it.</v>

93
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>There was a live audience there and everybody was getting written,</v>

94
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>getting ready and we were standing in that little back hallway where they would</v>

95
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>introduce us and I said,</v>

96
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>that this is going to be one of those days.</v>

98
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look back,</v>

99
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>when we're older and we're going to go,</v>

101
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I didn't enjoy this more.</v>

102
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I didn't appreciate how crazy.</v>

103
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:29.424
<v Speaker 1>This is more.</v>

104
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't realize what a random stroke of luck it is to get so many cool people</v>

105
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>all together in one group.</v>

106
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.350
<v Speaker 1>The fact that yeah,</v>

108
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>we all want it to spend time together.</v>

109
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

110
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

111
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>like when work was done,</v>

112
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>nobody wanted to go.</v>

113
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wanted to stay.</v>

114
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>We'd also get the feeds from other,</v>

115
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.451
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

116
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

117
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

118
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>The other shows and other sets we get to watch other horrible sitcoms.</v>

119
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Greg Geraldo had had a show that was a good one actually.</v>

120
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>And so to Joey Lawrence,</v>

122
00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>do you remember that?</v>

123
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.631
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

124
00:02:58.631 --> 00:02:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I only,</v>

125
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I mostly just remember him sitting in his convertible playing his own cds really</v>

126
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>loud.</v>

127
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>He always had bad ass cars.</v>

128
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Like Joey Lawrence always had like the newest Ferrari or the newest Bentley or</v>

129
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.101
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell it was.</v>

130
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>But he'd sit there playing his own music loud,</v>

131
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>super loud with a Bandanna on.</v>

132
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Where is he now?</v>

133
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.711
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

134
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Intentionally ripped jeans.</v>

135
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>He was just in dancing with the stars recently?</v>

136
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Well I think Dave said it best even back then was that someone needs to tell</v>

137
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>that young man that he's gay.</v>

138
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly how you said it too.</v>

139
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 1>We stopped and we were looking there and there was a couple of them and you,</v>

140
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:33.911
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

141
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>you just stopped and paused and said,</v>

142
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>someone needs to tell that young man he's gay.</v>

143
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.463
<v Speaker 1>We went into work.</v>

144
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean he would be right.</v>

145
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:42.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where these,</v>

146
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>where these cars were parked and right directly in front of the building.</v>

147
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>So you'd open up the door and you know,</v>

148
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>you basically be on the set and right behind that is this fucking guy in his car</v>

149
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>blaring his own music from isn't some insane stereo system.</v>

150
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:54.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

151
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>and if your music is the is great,</v>

152
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong to sit there and listen to your own music in the car.</v>

153
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Robert Plant is in his car fucking beating the drums to his steering wheel.</v>

155
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.531
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>

156
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.050
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

157
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Robbery.</v>

158
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

159
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't get enough attention.</v>

160
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.191
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>

161
00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:11.024
<v Speaker 1>Joey Lawrence,</v>

162
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>now you've just started to stand up recently,</v>

163
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>which is a fascinating thing to me because I always thought you'd be a brilliant</v>

164
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>standing up because you're a great writer.</v>

165
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>And when we used to do those little things in the audience,</v>

166
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>you remember where we would talk to the audience before you would fuck around</v>

167
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>with them every now and then and you wouldn't like do it.</v>

168
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Like Phil had a routine that he was doing,</v>

169
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>like Phil actually started doing standup because of,</v>

170
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>wanting to entertain the audience.</v>

172
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>So he had a bunch of bits that he would do like Clinton impressions and they</v>

173
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>were really good and it was like,</v>

174
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

175
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:40.421
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Dude.</v>

177
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Like you're a standup.</v>

178
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like Kinda thinking about doing.</v>

179
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Phil was like this really unusual human being.</v>

201
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.430

202
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:19.170
<v Speaker 1>broadcast booth.</v>

222
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:46.990

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

230

231
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:55.361
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

232
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>we would have these parties.</v>

233
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:56.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

234
00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Paul had one party once and I remember we were all at this bar somewhere and</v>

235
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Phil showed up with the wife and she was saying the creepiest shit insulting him</v>

236
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:08.211
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

237
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>talking about how she likes pickup trucks because they reminder of,</v>

238
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.620
<v Speaker 1>boys that she used to bang back when she was younger and just,</v>

240
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.160
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

241
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 1>just torturing him,</v>

242
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.370
<v Speaker 1>just torture and talking about,</v>

243
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.440
<v Speaker 1>oh well you're not fail.</v>

244
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

245
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>it feels too old and he's just like women thrown on him all the time.</v>

246
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>It seems like if he was miserable that you would have just,</v>

247
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.691
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter man,</v>

248
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>when you have children with somebody,</v>

249
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you're inexorably attached forever.</v>

250
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Was the thought of being separated from his kids and I understand because at the</v>

251
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>time I was separated from my kids.</v>

252
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

254
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

255
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

256
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I completely see where he was coming from.</v>

257
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want a divorce.</v>

258
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>He thought his wife is with all her flaws,</v>

259
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>was still very good to the kids and you know,</v>

260
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>and he felt,</v>

261
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 1>felt like he could work it out and then he really got into pot,</v>

262
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 1>that was his thing.</v>

264
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 1>He would just get,</v>

265
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.973
<v Speaker 1>he's lazy.</v>

266
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

267
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I was luck.</v>

268
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:56.890
<v Speaker 1>You'd be sitting in his Mercedes in the parking space with his one hitter baked</v>

270
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>baked to the gills stone.</v>

271
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 1>And you weren't smoking weed,</v>

272
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed with Phil Hartman.</v>

273
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.374
<v Speaker 1>That would barely,</v>

274
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.891
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

275
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

276
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.631
<v Speaker 1>You didn't do any,</v>

277
00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>any drugs?</v>

278
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Just get drunk.</v>

279
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And so I would do,</v>

280
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.451
<v Speaker 1>people don't know,</v>

281
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't even realize news radio wasn't a hit,</v>

282
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>but why we were on the air.</v>

283
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.701
<v Speaker 1>We were on the air.</v>

284
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 1>We moved nine times,</v>

285
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 1>nine times over the course of five seasons.</v>

286
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:20.140
<v Speaker 1>And the guy had the head of programming at,</v>

287
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.451
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

288
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:20.940
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

289
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

290
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.690
<v Speaker 1>scheduling at NBC.</v>

291
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.533
<v Speaker 1>Hated us.</v>

292
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.463
<v Speaker 1>Why was that?</v>

293
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.921
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

294
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:25.161
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

295
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:26.200
<v Speaker 1>there's that whole thing with,</v>

296
00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:26.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

297
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 1>the rolling stone article.</v>

298
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.493
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

299
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 1>but that was when we were already floundering.</v>

300
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.411
<v Speaker 1>But it was also,</v>

301
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:33.990
<v Speaker 1>but the guy,</v>

302
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.561
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

303
00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

304
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 1>we should tell people what that means.</v>

305
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.600
<v Speaker 1>What's the rolling the rolling start out.</v>

306
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Nicole Paul Stanley or Paul Stanley.</v>

307
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

308
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Kiss Paul Simms,</v>

309
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 1>who was the creator of the show called,</v>

310
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

311
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 1>nbcs Thursday night lineup,</v>

312
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 1>which was their big friends lineup.</v>

313
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>They called it a shit sandwich.</v>

314
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.361
<v Speaker 1>He called.</v>

315
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:50.901
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>

316
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:55.190
<v Speaker 1>it should have been shit was the bun because they're real sandwich was friends</v>

317
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>and then you would have friends on and then you would have this terrible show</v>

318
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>and it was always on after friends.</v>

319
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>And obviously NBC was very upset that Paul was calling sex in the city or the</v>

320
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 1>single guy to pieces of shit.</v>

321
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.851
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

322
00:08:07.851 --> 00:08:08.301
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

323
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 1>they were terrible shows.</v>

324
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And then friends was as brilliant show that everybody tuned into.</v>

325
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>So they sort of watch those other shows just because they were on.</v>

326
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>But I guess it guy,</v>

327
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.393
<v Speaker 1>the cantors,</v>

328
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Preston Beckmann hated our show.</v>

329
00:08:17.871 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Even when we did the pilot,</v>

330
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:21.570
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want it picked up well because we were originally supposed to get a</v>

331
00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Thursday slot ourselves.</v>

332
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>But this guy who was in charge of the MVC schedule wouldn't let us have it</v>

333
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Thursday slot.</v>

334
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.470
<v Speaker 1>So then he basically kept trying to find a slot that would kill us.</v>

335
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 1>So that's why they put us on,</v>

336
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

337
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>what we are the leading we're,</v>

338
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.440
<v Speaker 1>we're on with wings and Fraser,</v>

339
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

340
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>phrasing and those shows were both doing poorly when we came along and he put us</v>

341
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:45.100
<v Speaker 1>on with those shows and we are our,</v>

342
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 1>we boosted the ratings of both shows.</v>

343
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Well all of sudden it became like a decent lineup for,</v>

344
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:51.111
<v Speaker 1>for comedies,</v>

345
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>but it was a different time then man.</v>

346
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.930
<v Speaker 1>There was no dvrs and shows couldn't exist in a,</v>

347
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>in a non popular spot.</v>

348
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>It had to be a spot where people are already looking for the ratings.</v>

349
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>We were getting in those,</v>

350
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 1>we're getting like 10 million people tuning in and those ratings and those days</v>

351
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>were considered a ratings failure.</v>

352
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.161
<v Speaker 1>Like today,</v>

353
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>if you've got those ratings here,</v>

354
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>the number one show on TV,</v>

355
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

356
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 1>And then because there's so many channels now,</v>

357
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time,</v>

358
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

359
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Lou Martin used to show up at our writer's meetings at the rather at the table</v>

360
00:09:20.391 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>read was t with a t shirt on with the number of whatever we were in,</v>

361
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>what place are in.</v>

362
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.350
<v Speaker 1>And he showed up and it was 84 84th place and we're like,</v>

363
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:31.771
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>

364
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:33.020
<v Speaker 1>84 88 and my name.</v>

365
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.741
<v Speaker 1>And that's when,</v>

366
00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 1>when they finally,</v>

367
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.670
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

368
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 1>they put us up against Drew Carey and we have Warren Littlefield actually came</v>

369
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>down to a table read to let us know that they still loved us.</v>

370
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 1>They surface Turkey dinner.</v>

371
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

372
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:49.071
<v Speaker 1>you never learn or like there was there carving Turkey and Warren Littlefield</v>

373
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.110
<v Speaker 1>who was a nice guy or a network head.</v>

374
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:55.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

375
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:55.990
<v Speaker 1>He was very nice.</v>

376
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.460
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

377
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I always remember a 95 Warren Littlefield dancing on the bar in New York at when</v>

378
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 1>we went for the upfronts and it was like Jay Leno had had just hit number was</v>

379
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 1>the number one late night show.</v>

380
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

381
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.670
<v Speaker 1>And have more of a standing on this bar doing shots and shouting.</v>

382

383
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.101
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

385
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.730
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

386
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Was that the one where,</v>

387
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 1>which one did you guys get drunk at?</v>

388
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go and you guys get the rock every event.</v>

389
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.450
<v Speaker 1>But we got kicked out where we weren't allowed to go.</v>

390
00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>It was at the Sag awards.</v>

391
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers got so hammered.</v>

392
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.040
<v Speaker 1>They caused so much damage at the sag awards.</v>

393
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't go anymore.</v>

394
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>We weren't allowed to go.</v>

395
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I've still never been back.</v>

396
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.853
<v Speaker 1>Here's a great one.</v>

397
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 1>And we were at the Emmy's and this is after Phil had been murdered and we're</v>

398
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 1>sitting there and you know,</v>

399
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Phil was nominated for something and,</v>

400
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

401

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

402
00:10:45.581 --> 00:10:47.850
<v Speaker 1>the nominations go and I think the guy from Frasier,</v>

403
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:48.200
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

404
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 1>David Hyde Pierce and Dave turns to me and goes,</v>

405
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.530
<v Speaker 1>what does Phil have to do to win?</v>

406
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.483
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

407
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.560
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

408

00:10:59.151 --> 00:10:59.984
<v Speaker 1>it was so,</v>

410
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>it was in David.</v>

411
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 1>David Hyde Pierce looks so embarrassed to be winning.</v>

412
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.851
<v Speaker 1>He was literally up there,</v>

413
00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:06.051
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

414
00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:08.040
<v Speaker 1>is all the blood drained out of his face?</v>

415
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.933
<v Speaker 1>He was just going,</v>

416
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

417
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.190

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.831
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't,</v>

420
00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:16.520
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't even put a sentence together.</v>

421
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 1>He was wonder what the choice behind that was.</v>

422
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 1>That was weird.</v>

423
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.423
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

424
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.091
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

425
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:25.800
<v Speaker 1>don't kill someone and then expect them to win sort of message you're sending</v>

426
00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:26.790
<v Speaker 1>out to Burger's eating.</v>

427
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:27.763
<v Speaker 1>It's cheating.</v>

428
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Being murdered as a cheat.</v>

429
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

430

431
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:34.044

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.410
<v Speaker 1>So what did you guys do at the Sag awards that got us kicked out forever?</v>

433
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

434

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.551
<v Speaker 1>at the time I guess,</v>

438
00:11:43.551 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 1>cause we all thought what a stupid awards show,</v>

439
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

440
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.610
<v Speaker 1>just the first year of the SAG awards.</v>

441
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And we said this is ridiculous.</v>

442
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Why actors voting about other and giving awards,</v>

443
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 1>saying who's best.</v>

444
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:57.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

445
00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

446
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.010
<v Speaker 1>our union is deciding who is best and it creates this weird,</v>

447
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.820
<v Speaker 1>this like culture of ass kissing and fakery.</v>

448
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:06.921
<v Speaker 1>They're all like,</v>

449
00:12:06.921 --> 00:12:08.300
<v Speaker 1>what a wonderful project.</v>

450
00:12:08.301 --> 00:12:08.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

451
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.323
<v Speaker 1>an amazing,</v>

452
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.313
<v Speaker 1>and I think what we do,</v>

453
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.101
<v Speaker 1>I think more,</v>

454
00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:12.360
<v Speaker 1>and I found where the,</v>

455
00:12:12.361 --> 00:12:12.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

456
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:12.961
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

457
00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:13.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

458
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:18.290
<v Speaker 1>the service bar was and you would have had like the big industrial corkscrew and</v>

459
00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:20.030
<v Speaker 1>everything sweet.</v>

460
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.300
<v Speaker 1>So we're going back there just opening up bottles of wine and bringing them up</v>

461
00:12:24.301 --> 00:12:25.590
<v Speaker 1>to the table and I think,</v>

462
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

463
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:26.540
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

464
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:26.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:27.930
<v Speaker 1>we had to Andy with this too.</v>

466
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

467
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

468
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.250
<v Speaker 1>which was so who did what and we do anything notable that got us kicked out.</v>

469
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:34.711
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

470
00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:35.401
<v Speaker 1>I don't really remember.</v>

471
00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I think we were just noisy and rude and uh,</v>

472
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:39.241
<v Speaker 1>stealing.</v>

473
00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:43.380
<v Speaker 1>We were applauding inappropriately and he's really where it was a cast where you</v>

474
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.120
<v Speaker 1>regularly hear people say,</v>

475
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you know what might joke doesn't work.</v>

476
00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:48.990
<v Speaker 1>We should cut my joke that his joke is the better joke.</v>

477
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

478
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.251
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

479
00:12:50.251 --> 00:12:50.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

480
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.660
<v Speaker 1>it was really amazing environment.</v>

481
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 1>And you would also hear,</v>

482
00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 1>don't put that pencil in my cunt.</v>

483
00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

484
00:12:59.340 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

485
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 1>I would just say the most fucked up shit ever.</v>

486
00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we were,</v>

487
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.620
<v Speaker 1>do you remember the time we had the,</v>

488
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>we actually had to sit down and we,</v>

489
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:05.681
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

490
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 1>they played that presentation for us.</v>

491
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh the,</v>

492
00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:08.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

493
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.170
<v Speaker 1>the sex sexual harassment.</v>

494
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

495
00:13:10.381 --> 00:13:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I felt so badly for that person read it was that,</v>

496
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't know,</v>

497
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't know the group of people you've just walked in front of.</v>

498
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.040
<v Speaker 1>It was so ridiculous.</v>

499
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.250
<v Speaker 1>They have to go over this whole thing of what's appropriate and what's not</v>

500
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:23.971
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>

501
00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:28.650
<v Speaker 1>And it would have meant basically what it cut down about 98% of all conversation</v>

502
00:13:28.651 --> 00:13:29.484
<v Speaker 1>on our sex.</v>

503
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean we all just sort of,</v>

504
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

505
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

506
00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:34.380
<v Speaker 1>just made an agreement that we wouldn't so each other</v>

507
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

508
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.003
<v Speaker 1>okay</v>

509
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.411

00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

511
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause what if anybody wanted to,</v>

512
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's been many times on sets where,</v>

513
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:42.530

00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:47.710
<v Speaker 1>actresses feel like there's too much of that shit going on and they just fucking</v>

00:13:50.661 --> 00:13:52.070
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like a big issue.</v>

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.450
<v Speaker 1>You make a lot of money.</v>

526
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.053
<v Speaker 1>Vicky.</v>

527
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Vicky would be laughing the very first time I met Andy again,</v>

528
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd been acting for a fucking month.</v>

529
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

530
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd done no new,</v>

531
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.400
<v Speaker 1>no one like that.</v>

532
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with fighters and pool hustlers.</v>

533
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:17.641
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

534
00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:21.420
<v Speaker 1>those are the two worlds that I was most entrenched in and crazy standup</v>

535
00:14:21.421 --> 00:14:21.901
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>

536
00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:22.501
<v Speaker 1>They're all nuts,</v>

537
00:14:22.501 --> 00:14:22.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

538
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.020
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden I'm in this,</v>

539
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>this dressing room with Andy and Andy is sitting cross legged and he has clogs.</v>

540
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

541
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.070
<v Speaker 1>And he's got these weird brown corduroy pants and he's like flipping his foot</v>

542
00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:35.761
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>

543
00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

544
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.500
<v Speaker 1>do you think you're going to be famous?</v>

545
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.241
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

546
00:14:39.241 --> 00:14:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

547
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.650
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

548
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.483
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

549
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.533
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to be,</v>

550
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.323
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to be,</v>

551
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I've already decided I'm going to be so famous.</v>

552
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.633
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait.</v>

553
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to be really,</v>

554
00:14:48.541 --> 00:14:50.730
<v Speaker 1>really famous to think this is going to be the show for you.</v>

555
00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe like,</v>

556
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.391
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

557
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

558
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

559
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be famous Amos from this.</v>

560
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

561
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's already happening.</v>

562
00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

563
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the arc of your friendship with Andy was the most interesting of the</v>

564
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:02.774
<v Speaker 1>whole cast.</v>

565
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.030
<v Speaker 1>It only wish I hadn't marijuana back then.</v>

566
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

567
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

568
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I would have found him so much more fascinating because I had a testosterone and</v>

569
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:12.620
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline and that was just every day was just don't kill Andi.</v>

570
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.883
<v Speaker 1>Don't be,</v>

571
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking kill him.</v>

572
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Cause he was just so out of control.</v>

573
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I've never met someone so out of control,</v>

574
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 1>but on set.</v>

575
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Nobody enjoyed Andy more than you did.</v>

576
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I loved him.</v>

577
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

578
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:27.470
<v Speaker 1>and scenes like Joe had so much trouble getting through scenes with Angie cause</v>

579
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:28.060
<v Speaker 1>they would laugh.</v>

580
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.810
<v Speaker 1>He would bust you up constantly.</v>

581
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I can't just say that,</v>

582
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:32.661
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

583
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:32.991
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>

584
00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:35.170
<v Speaker 1>my emotional attachment though to news radio is that,</v>

585
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 1>that is fucked up is he is,</v>

586
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:37.370
<v Speaker 1>he'll always,</v>

587
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I'll always consider him to be family.</v>

588
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:39.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

589
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.890
<v Speaker 1>like everyone from news radio,</v>

590
00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I always considered to me everyone from these radios,</v>

591
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 1>his family to me.</v>

593
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

594
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.423
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

595
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

596
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.810
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

597
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.111
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

598
00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:48.381
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

599
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:50.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a very unusual bond that we all have.</v>

600
00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

601
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Steven road call me a while back for some party that he was throwing and I</v>

602
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:55.290
<v Speaker 1>couldn't make it.</v>

603
00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I was going out of town and I was like,</v>

604
00:15:56.451 --> 00:15:56.781
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

605
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 1>how good is it to talk to this guy again?</v>

606
00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

607
00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like,</v>

608
00:15:59.160 --> 00:15:59.691
<v Speaker 1>I think some of this,</v>

609
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 1>we won't see each other for years,</v>

610
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:01.610
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

611
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.091
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

612
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 1>but it never feels like,</v>

613
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 1>but whenever I see anyone from news radio,</v>

614
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:06.080
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like any time is pat.</v>

615
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Ah.</v>
