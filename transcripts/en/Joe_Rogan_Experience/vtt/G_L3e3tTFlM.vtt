00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.231
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do they have a list of enhanced breath for a woman's MMA?</v>

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.033
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

7
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll need to ask somebody.</v>

8
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:14.191
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

9
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>this is too long of a Google search.</v>

10
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>I need to call up a big John McCarthy or um,</v>

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.411
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

12
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

13
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>can't kick the ball,</v>

14
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>but you can grab it.</v>

15
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:22.861
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird.</v>

16
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:27.861
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys grab that black guys do what they call oil check excuse when oil</v>

17
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>check is sometimes in the middle of the grappling.</v>

18
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>The guy will literally have his fingers deep into guys asshole.</v>

19
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Just digging in there and you know,</v>

20
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>it forces the guy to move,</v>

21
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>forced to got to move in a way to get away from that grip.</v>

22
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.811
<v Speaker 1>And I don't see,</v>

23
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's in,</v>

24
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's illegal.</v>

25
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:45.031
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

26
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's illegal in wrestling either.</v>

27
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't start making MMA butt plugs.</v>

28
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.741
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

29
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>that would just shove something deeper in your ass and you have to have like a</v>

30
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>

31
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>But what if you don't know a flat?</v>

32
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>the problem is you need movement like you're to,</v>

34
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>you're asking us to be able to move.</v>

35
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>So anything that you do that would like protect your ass hole would be</v>

36
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 1>restrictive.</v>

37
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.581
<v Speaker 1>It would be like,</v>

38
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>it would restrict your ability to move left and right.</v>

39
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It would be a messenger boy.</v>

40
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>It would mess with your athleticism to our oil checks.</v>

43
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.703
<v Speaker 1>Legal.</v>

44
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.863
<v Speaker 2>What if it's like,</v>

45
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.131
<v Speaker 2>like this though,</v>

46
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:19.820
<v Speaker 2>like if it's as a flat center.</v>

47
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:20.061
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

48
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

49
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.781
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

50
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:21.614
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

51
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.591
<v Speaker 1>things in your ass.</v>

52
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>So I need to find out if this is all.</v>

53
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>So what about,</v>

54
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

55
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

56
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 2>I've got to go to the bathroom and here's that.</v>

57
00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's the one where he's checked.</v>

58
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

59
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Dudes do this all the time.</v>

60
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Chris Tufts is NC.</v>

61
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 2>So I was on camera and says,</v>

62
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 2>oops,</v>

63
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.673
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

64
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.203
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

65
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.560
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

66
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 2>he even said something on the end of it.</v>

67
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.011
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>one guy,</v>

69
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>actually got a rape charge from a wrestling match.</v>

71
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

72
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

73
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.563
<v Speaker 1>when was this?</v>

74
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>17 year old Jerome hunt faces 21 counts of rape and attempted rape.</v>

75
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Each count carries with him up to 25 years in prison.</v>

76
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Hunt's lawyer,</v>

77
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Mike Butler crank claims that complaints came from fellow Parker wrestlers who</v>

78
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>were simply victims of a legitimate wrestling move bottler.</v>

79
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Just file a motion to move the case of juvenile court on that court document.</v>

80
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>He lays out a lot of information presented to the grand jury before they</v>

81
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>indicted hunt on the rape charges while he's indicted on the rape charges.</v>

82
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.403
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

83
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Former state champion wrestler,</v>

84
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Jerome Hunt's lawyer says that all but two of the incidents reported happened in</v>

85
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>the Parker high school wrestling room before the practice during last year's</v>

86
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:33.091
<v Speaker 1>wrestling session.</v>

87
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Before practice.</v>

88
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Before practice.</v>

89
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Before practice rape.</v>

90
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>It possibly came from a wrestling move called a but drag or skinning.</v>

92
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Before practice,</v>

94
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.153
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

95
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Dragging before practice,</v>

96
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not something illegal or not being taught.</v>

97
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>It's being taught all over one accuser even testified to a grand jury.</v>

98
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take it as a sexual move.</v>

99
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I took it as him just messing around.</v>

100
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>La Who?</v>

101
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Who charged then a prude.</v>

102
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.953
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

103
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>This is interesting because that is the oil check is like a legitimate wrestling</v>

104
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>move if that's what he's doing.</v>

105
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like people have been doing whether or not you think they should be able to</v>

106
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:12.281
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

107
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they should be able to do that.</v>

108
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 1>But people have been doing that for a long time.</v>

109
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Like in actual legitimate wrestling,</v>

110
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.111
<v Speaker 1>like bill,</v>

111
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>look up oil check wrestling,</v>

112
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>find a video for oil check wrestling because that's something that guys have</v>

113
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>done like for a long ass time.</v>

114
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:28.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

115
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I would even say that's like gladiator days.</v>

116
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they did that well.</v>

117
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not the most effective way to control a person.</v>

118
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like something that someone does for a long time or on a regular</v>

119
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

120
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just when you're in a wrestling match with someone,</v>

121
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to do is win.</v>

122
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.490
<v Speaker 1>And if you spend time fingerings,</v>

123
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>but you could've been doing other things that would actually get you to win the</v>

124
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.251
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>

125
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like something that comes up all the time.</v>

126
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

127
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I call that a Friday.</v>

128
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.150
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

129
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.153

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>some people who don't know wrestling,</v>

134
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>who found out that this guy's oil checking people and you know,</v>

135
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe being a dick about it.</v>

136
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.860

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

142
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.051
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

143
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:11.201
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:16.624
<v Speaker 1>checking.</v>

149
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Just listening to Google oil check wrestling.</v>

150
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

151
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.494
<v Speaker 2>I got some right here.</v>

152
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 2>That was about it though.</v>

153
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to drag you so you ain't safe.</v>

154
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

156
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.983
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

157
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.660
<v Speaker 1>totally legal.</v>

158
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.930
<v Speaker 1>See how he's doing this and the referee's not getting angry at him and no one's</v>

159
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:42.764
<v Speaker 1>going to jail.</v>

160
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.611
<v Speaker 1>See this is,</v>

161
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:45.590
<v Speaker 1>it is actually a legal wrestling move.</v>

162
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.060
<v Speaker 1>That guy putting his hands in.</v>

163
00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:47.811
<v Speaker 1>That guy's an asshole.</v>

164
00:04:47.811 --> 00:04:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Like that is totally legal.</v>

165
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it totally legal,</v>

166
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.060
<v Speaker 1>it's so common.</v>

167
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Who made this video?</v>

168
00:04:55.401 --> 00:04:56.234
<v Speaker 1>Like who,</v>

169
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.021
<v Speaker 1>who is like,</v>

170
00:04:57.021 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm going to do today?</v>

171
00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

172
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.960
<v Speaker 1>it's common,</v>

173
00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:02.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the most common thing.</v>

174
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Like wrestling is all about.</v>

175
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.981
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

176
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:06.670
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

177
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best way to control a guy all the time though.</v>

178
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>So when it does come up,</v>

179
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.081
<v Speaker 1>guys do it,</v>

180
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like the only way to do it and it's not like if you,</v>

181
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.310
<v Speaker 1>if you concentrate on that when you should be doing something else,</v>

182
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lose the wrestling match.</v>

183
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

184
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

185
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing is using it as a whole.</v>

186
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>He's literally trying to grapple by holding onto the guy like that.</v>

187
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>He's not necessarily,</v>

188
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>he might be sexual or you might also be trying to inflict pain and discomfort,</v>

189
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's been going on forever.</v>

190
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh those damn oil checkers.</v>

191
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>So take this one kid and calm a rapist for that stuff.</v>

192
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing was then said Doris before practice.</v>

193
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem like that before practice that that disturbs me.</v>

194
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:47.741
<v Speaker 1>Like wait a minute,</v>

195
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:47.991
<v Speaker 1>wait minute,</v>

196
00:05:47.991 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

197
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Like hours before practice,</v>

198
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>like five minutes before practice where you're warming up like in the locker</v>

199
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:54.551
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

200
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Like hey check this out.</v>

201
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>You're going over techniques like what exact exact,</v>

202
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is going on and how many counts did say like was it just one</v>

203
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:02.161
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>

204
00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I think they said like 40 Jesus.</v>

205
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

206
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 1>it's 40 people.</v>

207
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>40 40 churches while I'll read it again.</v>

208
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

209
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't talk about this kid,</v>

210
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.241
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

211
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>this was a several years ago,</v>

212
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>2006 actually,</v>

213
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>but I'm 21 counts.</v>

214
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

215
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.941
<v Speaker 1>That if,</v>

217
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

218
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that kid did,</v>

219
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just talking out of my ass.</v>

220
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>But if the kid did what's in those videos,</v>

221
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>you better go watch those videos because there's videos of people doing that,</v>

222
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>but drag or oil check forever.</v>

223
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It's been going on for as long as he's been wrestling.</v>

224
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the most effective thing to do always.</v>

225
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not in every match,</v>

226
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.051
<v Speaker 1>but shit,</v>

227
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fucking common.</v>

228
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.713
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

230
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>and then they put plugs.</v>

231
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.751
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't help,</v>

232
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

233
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.251
<v Speaker 1>Stupid idea.</v>

234
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to go deeper in and you bleed.</v>

235
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to stop the guy from holding onto it.</v>

236
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I get a little tail on the end.</v>

237
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

238
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 1>it's got good idea.</v>

239
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Make it a decorative,</v>

240
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>but pull that out and the guy gets embarrassing.</v>

241
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:57.434
<v Speaker 1>It's happened.</v>

242
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Comes out of a loud pop pop.</v>

243
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.671
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

244
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.301
<v Speaker 1>sorry about that.</v>

245
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>A tech could take that.</v>

246
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

248
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>This man.</v>

249
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Did I hear that?</v>

250
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

251
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar's thinking about coming back to the UFC.</v>

252
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

253
00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:10.144
<v Speaker 1>it's bullshit.</v>

254
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

255
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:11.474
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>

256
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.030
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

257
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>there's one hype story when they were trying to hype it up because the WWE was</v>

258
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 1>saying that Brock Lesnar was in Vegas and they may might've big announcement,</v>

259
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just a publicity move to talk about Brock Lesnar's wrestling</v>

260
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:23.954
<v Speaker 1>appearance.</v>

261
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>So there was a little bit of hype on that.</v>

262
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Some guys tweeting me that the,</v>

263
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>but drag just not go into the butthole.</v>

264
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the,</v>

268
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>but track does not go into that.</v>

269
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.020
<v Speaker 1>They're saying it's a,</v>

270
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a nerve back there pulling.</v>

271
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

272
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

273
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.140
<v Speaker 1>But tell me the dude's don't sometimes put fingers in people's assholes.</v>
