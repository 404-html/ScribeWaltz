00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Hm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hm hm.</v>

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I put it in airplane mode?</v>

3
00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so God is dead.</v>

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>we about a bunch of people that are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday cake for God.</v>

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do I do with this now?</v>

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's infinity candles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how fucking bad ass </v>

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche he felt when he said that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time where he was like,</v>

9
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:29.001
<v Speaker 1>God is dead when it meant something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you say and people are like </v>

10
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:29.001
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

11
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>

12
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>But like it was like a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a nuclear bomb going off the</v>

13
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>declaration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is dead.</v>

14
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you not understand these dad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did meet you wrote that?</v>

15
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

16
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Actually I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

18
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>must've been the 19 hundreds or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when he was,</v>

19
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche was around.</v>

20
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>He's in my call young pile while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>always like,</v>

21
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>one day I'm going to really get into his</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

22
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

23
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.210
<v Speaker 1>he's good because he gets into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking head man because he like Carl </v>

24
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>young getting your habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more subtle.</v>

25
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're reading,</v>

26
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>you ever read a Philip k Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

27
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>So you know how like you're getting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of 18,</v>

28
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>82.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

29
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philip k Dot Dick.</v>

30
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was genius.</v>

31
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>So when you read his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fiction,</v>

32
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like you stop reading it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel a little crazy for a second because</v>

33
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>something about the way he's writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>just isn't normally something off man.</v>

34
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same way.</v>

35
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:34.551
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you stop reading him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to like spend the next few </v>

36
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>days like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like burroughs.</v>

37
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>

38
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An outsider artists kind of like,</v>

39
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading some of burrows stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking like I might get high just </v>

40
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>reading this.</v>

41
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like naked lunch.</v>

43
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>That was him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.270
<v Speaker 1>That Terence Mckenna at the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

45
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>You just start tripping when you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading his writing.</v>

46
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Like could you just start to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

47
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could write like that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could.</v>

48
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean you would have to spend a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

50
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's all it is,</v>

51
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing that's holding you</v>

52
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>back because the amount of time that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would've spent writing,</v>

53
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>you would love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would enjoy it.</v>

54
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saw Mckenna had some fascinating </v>

55
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food of the Gods.</v>

56
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some crazy fucking theories that </v>

57
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.991
<v Speaker 1>he pitched that I've seen scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>like bow the especially the doubling of </v>

58
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:28.131
<v Speaker 1>the human brain size one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a really fascinating theory </v>

59
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:28.131
<v Speaker 1>that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he.</v>

60
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:29.840
<v Speaker 1>He connected it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm she,</v>

61
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if he was right in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the climate of logical data,</v>

62
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>but his contention for those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you aware of it?</v>

63
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a monkey's had come down from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees and they experimented with new </v>

64
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.431
<v Speaker 1>food sources and they started flipping </v>
<v Speaker 1>over cow patties to get the books </v>

65
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.791
<v Speaker 1>because that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And along the line they discovered </v>

66
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>silicide mushrooms and he thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grasslands,</v>

67
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.350
<v Speaker 1>the rain forest becoming grasslands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the changing climate led to these </v>

68
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these monkeys,</v>

69
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever our ancestors</v>

70
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 2>were led to them becoming more </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimental.</v>

71
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.580
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that qbe coincided with a bunch of </v>

72
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.731
<v Speaker 2>different things that they know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms or it could be a sort of </v>

73
00:03:11.731 --> 00:03:11.731
<v Speaker 2>confirmed with a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

74
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.740
<v Speaker 2>One with that mushrooms increased visual</v>
<v Speaker 2>acuity and they shown this like in </v>

75
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>actual actual test with real scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were experimenting with it.</v>

76
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Who was the other guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one German guy,</v>

77
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 2>a straight guy to that experimented with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

78
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to remember his name,</v>

79
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 2>but he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a really funny line.</v>

80
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean a straight gas straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>

81
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Meaning he wasn't a drug guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't a drug culture guy.</v>

82
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean straight like homosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heterosexual.</v>

83
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:44.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't like Timothy leary or Mckenna </v>

84
00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:47.911
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of these guys are like clear </v>

85
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 2>proponents of psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just,</v>

86
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm a researcher.</v>

87
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 2>And they had found out that in low doses</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Psilocybin,</v>

88
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.700
<v Speaker 2>like say if you change an angle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have two parallel lines and you </v>

89
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 2>made one just varied it ever so slightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Psilocybin,</v>

90
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.080
<v Speaker 2>they could tell when the angle was ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>so slightly varied quicker than they </v>

91
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 2>could naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can remember.</v>

93
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a visual acuity acuity and the in </v>

94
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.801
<v Speaker 2>the periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like expanding your peripheral </v>

95
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 2>vision by a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny little bit.</v>

96
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the test pertained to </v>

97
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.421
<v Speaker 2>periphery only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might've been peripherally as well </v>

98
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 2>because I do remember that one specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>task,</v>

99
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 2>that one specific thing where they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out,</v>

100
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how quickly you could recognize one of </v>

101
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 2>the angles changed and you could do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>quicker when you were high.</v>

102
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

103
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 2>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the horniness mushrooms</v>

104
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 2>have known to make people horny.</v>

105
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 2>So that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are known for that.</v>

106
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 2>The creativity aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>

107
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

108
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 2>the tapping into alternative ways of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and that would lead to a lot of</v>

109
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 2>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also possible that,</v>

110
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.300
<v Speaker 2>that it's really possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's silicide been in some ways is a </v>

111
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 2>nutrient mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

112
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 2>it's an intoxicant for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an a hallucinogenic,</v>

113
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means,</v>

114
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be a nutrient to.</v>

115
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.450
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase in visual acuity and this,</v>

116
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this horniness that it gives you in this</v>

117
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.170
<v Speaker 2>connection to nature and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

118
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 2>intense creativity like you're tapping </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a river of ideas and like scooping </v>

119
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 2>out buckets of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

120
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.150
<v Speaker 2>like all that might also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be something that when you're </v>

121
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:35.191
<v Speaker 2>consuming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually beneficial to the body or </v>

122
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:37.591
<v Speaker 2>beneficial to your brain if it's having </v>
<v Speaker 2>all those crazy positive effects on the </v>

123
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:41.341
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might have like a beneficial long </v>

124
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.390
<v Speaker 2>term effect on the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've been doing these studies on </v>

125
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.671
<v Speaker 2>neurons on repairing neurons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psilocybin and psilocybin bins role in </v>

126
00:05:47.671 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 2>repairing brain disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain brain issues.</v>

127
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Brain trauma might not have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurons.</v>

128
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 2>So you could find that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

129
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.940
<v Speaker 2>the most recent studies with psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and brain damage and they think it might</v>

130
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 2>in some ways be able to repair brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>

131
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

132
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:09.521
<v Speaker 2>what if these monkeys were just eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>them all the time and their brains just </v>

133
00:06:09.521 --> 00:06:09.521
<v Speaker 2>grew?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

134
00:06:09.521 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 2>what if Mckenna was right?</v>

135
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

136
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

137
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it is pretty safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A safe bet that a monkeys are what I </v>

138
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monkey isn't the right word.</v>

139
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Proto Hominids right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are wandering the planes are gonna.</v>

140
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Like if we're omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're definitely going to be eating </v>

141
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

142
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can find that.</v>

143
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 3>It gives us nutrition that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutritional value.</v>

144
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're out in the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hungry.</v>

145
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 3>The thing you're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitting food is growing out of it.</v>

146
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

147
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

148
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think they were hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

149
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they could hunt something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that big.</v>

150
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they had weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

151
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Think what they were doing was they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering,</v>

152
00:06:46.651 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 2>they were eating a lot of bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were insectivore.</v>

153
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.790
<v Speaker 3>I thought his idea was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's climate change and so we start </v>

154
00:06:54.671 --> 00:06:58.060
<v Speaker 3>moving into the grasslands and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

155
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.990
<v Speaker 3>we're hunting bovine animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're like.</v>

156
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.000
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contention.</v>

157
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Contention was flipping over the cow </v>
<v Speaker 2>patties.</v>

158
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.670
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was that because the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're hunting is going to be </v>

159
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 3>shitting things that grow mushrooms.</v>

160
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

161
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it was way later when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>started doing that.</v>

162
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things.</v>

163
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Here's a study that Jamie pulled up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says psilocybin mushrooms stimulate </v>

164
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.010
<v Speaker 2>the growth of brain cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelic mushrooms have already had a</v>

165
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:32.011
<v Speaker 2>reputation for helping people open their</v>
<v Speaker 2>minds and broaden their perspectives in </v>

166
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:36.211
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some have shown the ability to combat </v>

167
00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:36.211
<v Speaker 2>mental disorders like depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

168
00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:40.111
<v Speaker 2>and now research is showing that magic </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms can actually help physically </v>

169
00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 2>rebuild a damaged brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

170
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:46.951
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a case that it can physically </v>

171
00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:49.240
<v Speaker 2>help rebuild a damaged brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe over longterm consumption.</v>

172
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:54.270
<v Speaker 2>It can actually make a brain grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm almost positive that </v>

173
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna's idea was not that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting these things,</v>

174
00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.870
<v Speaker 2>but they were flipping over cow patties </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for beetles and forums and </v>

175
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.210
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think we're talking about like</v>

176
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 2>really small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient hominids.</v>

177
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really hunted until we figured out </v>

178
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 2>tools or I mean not like large scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>large animal type hunting.</v>

179
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was way later than the </v>

180
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 2>human brain size growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when they,</v>

181
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.400
<v Speaker 2>when they develop like the adult adult </v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever seen someone use that?</v>

182
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Now it's the precursor to the bow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow before the bow and arrow,</v>

183
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:24.790
<v Speaker 2>they figured out a thing called an adult</v>
<v Speaker 2>adult.</v>

184
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

185
00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:31.081
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got a handle on it and you put a </v>

186
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:33.241
<v Speaker 2>spear in it and you launch the spear </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a handle like almost like it's a </v>

187
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.450
<v Speaker 2>crazy lacrosse ball that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>

188
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.850
<v Speaker 2>There's guys that make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

189
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.140
<v Speaker 2>and there's videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

190
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:43.900
<v Speaker 2>you could see a guy that made his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>and used it.</v>

191
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of them actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

192
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people take those things and they,</v>

193
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.210
<v Speaker 2>they throw them at targets and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not very accurate.</v>

194
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Accurate in comparison to I guess if you</v>

195
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:02.121
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't skilled and you try to hit </v>

196
00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:05.511
<v Speaker 2>it with a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably more accurate than </v>

197
00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:05.511
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you could sneak up on an animal,</v>

198
00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 2>you could probably get some good </v>
<v Speaker 2>penetration and they probably got really</v>

199
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:12.861
<v Speaker 2>good at it eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was the first of many weapons </v>

200
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.650
<v Speaker 2>that could launch things through the air</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they figured out.</v>

201
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

202
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm that weird ritual that chimpanzees </v>

203
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:24.100
<v Speaker 3>are doing where they throw rocks at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree if you seen that?</v>

204
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that or they don't know.</v>

205
00:09:26.051 --> 00:09:31.051
<v Speaker 3>It just is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the idea that like they're </v>

206
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:31.420
<v Speaker 3>developing their own weird culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own superstition or something,</v>

207
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.210
<v Speaker 3>something that they just feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

208
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.760
<v Speaker 3>they're doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we don't understand what it is,</v>

209
00:09:36.761 --> 00:09:41.761
<v Speaker 3>but it's a thing where you throwing </v>
<v Speaker 3>rocks at trees and then there's all </v>

210
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:44.890
<v Speaker 3>these rocks that are kind of like laying</v>
<v Speaker 3>around certain trees because chimps have</v>

211
00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:47.440
<v Speaker 3>decided to just start lobbing rocks at </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

212
00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:52.441
<v Speaker 3>And they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this like some emerging chimpanzee </v>

213
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:54.430
<v Speaker 3>religion or culture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

214
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very weird man.</v>

215
00:09:56.501 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing?</v>

216
00:09:59.201 --> 00:09:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Why</v>

217
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.840
<v Speaker 2>do you know that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of been agreed upon by a lot </v>

218
00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:08.330
<v Speaker 2>of the people that study these animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're entering to the Stone Age,</v>

219
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is,</v>

220
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.980
<v Speaker 2>this is the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they're talking about </v>

221
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.540
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees and they're looking at their</v>
<v Speaker 2>growth in their learning,</v>

222
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.350
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking they're in a new place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking they're starting to use</v>

223
00:10:21.351 --> 00:10:26.351
<v Speaker 2>tools and they're starting to use stones</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other great apes are using tools as </v>

224
00:10:26.351 --> 00:10:28.610
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we knew that they would get not we,</v>

225
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:30.230
<v Speaker 2>like you and I are out there doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>research</v>

226
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 3>as we predicted it,</v>

227
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 2>as we predicted Duncan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

228
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we always knew that you sticks to get </v>

229
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.100
<v Speaker 2>like termites and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now they're figuring out a way to do</v>

230
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:45.101
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the one orangutan </v>

231
00:10:45.101 --> 00:10:45.101
<v Speaker 2>that figured out how to spearfish?</v>

232
00:10:45.101 --> 00:10:49.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did see that shit fucking picture of </v>

233
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:49.670
<v Speaker 3>him hanging over the river with a spirit</v>
<v Speaker 3>is easy.</v>

234
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.200
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me.</v>

235
00:10:51.201 --> 00:10:56.201
<v Speaker 3>What's really particularly interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that as well as our society and our </v>

236
00:10:56.211 --> 00:11:00.410
<v Speaker 3>species is moving into some new era as </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're moving into some.</v>

237
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.890
<v Speaker 3>God knows what the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys are too.</v>

238
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.400
<v Speaker 3>They're moving for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That what?</v>

239
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:09.050
<v Speaker 3>That state of the art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's some high.</v>

240
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.080
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at God in my Elon Musk </v>

241
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.230
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the Elan Musk have a rank.</v>

242
00:11:14.231 --> 00:11:16.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

243
00:11:16.781 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

244
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.560
<v Speaker 3>fucking using that thing to get fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a genius.</v>

245
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.710
<v Speaker 3>That's genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in the same way that like we have </v>

246
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.741
<v Speaker 3>people sending things to Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's funny that the two are </v>

247
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:30.800
<v Speaker 3>coinciding like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny that it appears now.</v>

248
00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:32.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long has it been going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

249
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.720
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like this sort of trickle </v>
<v Speaker 3>in of stories of monkeys suddenly doing,</v>

250
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.160
<v Speaker 3>doing things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be related to just more people </v>

251
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.740
<v Speaker 3>researching and getting more data that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>always been there.</v>

252
00:11:45.741 --> 00:11:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

253
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.690
<v Speaker 2>One Jamie or the same chip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same orangutan is the same guy.</v>

254
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole of them doing it.</v>

255
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>

256
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Orangutang fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

257
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Ha Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just funny.</v>

258
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.960
<v Speaker 1>You're your leap forward in evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

259
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:09.961
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to see huge hairy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're looking at them sitting there </v>

260
00:12:09.961 --> 00:12:14.671
<v Speaker 1>hanging on this rock looking over at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this little puddle that they have </v>

261
00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>fishing and it's obviously set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think they probably taught him how </v>

262
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.440
<v Speaker 1>to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not fishing in the wild.</v>

263
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like he's getting groceries.</v>

264
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a very small little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

265
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 1>like a puddle of with fish in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 1>like they just taught him how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of cheating.</v>

267
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cheating.</v>

268
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.910
<v Speaker 1>The other orangutan was doing it hanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a flowing river like he was.</v>

269
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 1>He was really figuring out as he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going along.</v>

270
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.850
<v Speaker 1>It was this guy there and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking picking at ropes.</v>

271
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.730
<v Speaker 1>This is a puddle.</v>

272
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like this is something new or </v>

273
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:53.730
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

274
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:58.321
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like something they did for </v>

275
00:12:58.321 --> 00:12:58.321
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they figured out a way to teach him</v>

276
00:12:58.321 --> 00:13:03.091
<v Speaker 1>how to stab those fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you just teach them that that's </v>

277
00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 1>where the fish are and you get it with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick that's not as impressive.</v>

278
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.650
<v Speaker 1>That's like you can teach a dog to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

279
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

280
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's birds that use that there's</v>

281
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:16.051
<v Speaker 1>some video of a bird like putting bait </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and then catching something with </v>

282
00:13:16.051 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like other creatures,</v>

283
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use bait to fish.</v>

284
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.970
<v Speaker 1>There are others that do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that too.</v>

285
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen birds do it.</v>

286
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

287
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orcas do it to have an orchestra on it.</v>

288
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know they use bait.</v>

289
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I feel like orchesis I've done it</v>

290
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

291
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

292
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Look at that smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

293
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting,</v>

294
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:41.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

295
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:46.320
<v Speaker 1>He just sits there and waits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He waits for the fish to come near the </v>

296
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:46.320
<v Speaker 1>bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like baiting.</v>

297
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Like how did he figure it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's did.</v>

298
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Did he see something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it or did he like innovate this </v>

299
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.870
<v Speaker 1>himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He a real good question.</v>

300
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Taught them that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't even like one of the most</v>

301
00:13:57.191 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>clever birds like ravens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ravens are the most clever.</v>

302
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to,</v>

303
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.200
<v Speaker 1>gives bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes too far away.</v>

304
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.240
<v Speaker 1>See it gets away and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bitch.</v>

305
00:14:07.241 --> 00:14:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Nobody rides for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring them back.</v>

306
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Keep it right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

307
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to move away with it.</v>

308
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Got Too far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

309
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:15.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

310
00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:15.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

311
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:16.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

312
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

313
00:14:18.201 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 1>They're right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen.</v>

314
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that that just snatched that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

315
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.050
<v Speaker 1>That's such as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck just happened?</v>

316
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.500
<v Speaker 1>The thing about it is it snatched it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the thing.</v>

317
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.500
<v Speaker 1>That bird is not that much bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fish.</v>

318
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And it did it like it was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how creepy birds are.</v>

319
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Hooky snacked them and just walked away </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

320
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Like no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have an like a small puppy</v>

321
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.620
<v Speaker 1>in your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I walked away with it.</v>

322
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean bigger than a puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that thing's bigger than his head.</v>

323
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>That's like a full sized dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

324
00:14:50.861 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>For.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying like</v>

325
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 2>the way he held it was the way you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>puppy,</v>

326
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.700
<v Speaker 2>like you'd have no problem walking with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my light,</v>

327
00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.120
<v Speaker 2>but that thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

328
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 2>probably 25 percent of its body weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's mostly feathers.</v>

329
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take away all of his feathers.</v>

330
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.580
<v Speaker 2>That fish might be at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be like 15 percent of its body </v>

331
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

332
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard the idea of like a,</v>

333
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we smack a,</v>

334
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an aunt or something,</v>

335
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:21.500
<v Speaker 3>he smashed Nat and that Dan has no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no idea what.</v>

336
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 3>There's no way that could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehend what has happened to it.</v>

337
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Like when Irwin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

338
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.420
<v Speaker 3>you have a line of ants going into your </v>
<v Speaker 3>sink or whatever,</v>

339
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.370
<v Speaker 3>that line of ants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't comprehend what you are like,</v>

340
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:39.371
<v Speaker 3>you walk by the line of ants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have some instinct may be to run </v>

341
00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:43.181
<v Speaker 3>away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times they don't even run away </v>

342
00:15:43.181 --> 00:15:44.711
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He turned the scene on kill like 30 of </v>

343
00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:45.340
<v Speaker 3>them in a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't,</v>

344
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.380
<v Speaker 3>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there whatever way they used to </v>

345
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:50.380
<v Speaker 3>think they can't process it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

346
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.431
<v Speaker 3>So death to that ant it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be processing its </v>

347
00:15:54.431 --> 00:15:56.720
<v Speaker 3>extinction in some way that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even understand.</v>

348
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this idea from my friend was </v>

349
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 3>telling me that I'm the same way when a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human dies,</v>

350
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.110
<v Speaker 3>what we process is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

351
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.210
<v Speaker 3>he got in a car accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

352
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.400
<v Speaker 3>What really happened was some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like hyper dimensional event that we can</v>

353
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:18.401
<v Speaker 3>only see one tiny piece of that looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a car accident in the way our minds</v>

354
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:23.681
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing being wiped off the face of </v>

355
00:16:23.681 --> 00:16:24.410
<v Speaker 3>this dimension is by like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

356
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>red car wreck.</v>

357
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 3>But really there's like all these other </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels involved.</v>

358
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:34.871
<v Speaker 3>So it's like maybe some hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimensional entity just squashed your </v>

359
00:16:34.871 --> 00:16:36.950
<v Speaker 3>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way it manifested is like,</v>

360
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.670
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a car wreck.</v>

361
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.650
<v Speaker 3>It was a car wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really no.</v>

362
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.860
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way our brains process </v>
<v Speaker 3>that event from where we're at currently</v>

363
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:50.230
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our ability to like comprehend </v>

364
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.230
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

365
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.420
<v Speaker 2>People listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean I can text and drive?</v>

366
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Texting and driving is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>

367
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the way they see when they see </v>
<v Speaker 2>you doing that.</v>

368
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 2>They smash you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

369
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What maybe death.</v>

370
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the accidents or just accidents.</v>

371
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not a hyper dimensional being</v>
<v Speaker 2>squished down on you.</v>

372
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like things are not like that </v>

373
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.390
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we don't.</v>

374
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean really we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

375
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.430
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

376
00:17:14.431 --> 00:17:19.431
<v Speaker 3>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that did the same way these chimps </v>

377
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:20.940
<v Speaker 3>are like doing these things at times </v>
<v Speaker 3>seem like pretty cute.</v>

378
00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Really cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the same way like,</v>

379
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:30.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is this idea that we're going to </v>

380
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.230
<v Speaker 3>sort of go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

381
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could remember who explained </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

382
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:31.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

383
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.800
<v Speaker 3>human existence up until the point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>flight was completely based on like </v>

384
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.480
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you would climb a mountain and then</v>

385
00:17:39.481 --> 00:17:42.360
<v Speaker 3>you could see the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're from an airplane,</v>

386
00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:44.760
<v Speaker 3>but that's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Climb up a tree.</v>

387
00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:49.761
<v Speaker 3>I guess you get some altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see this whole new perspective </v>

388
00:17:49.761 --> 00:17:53.570
<v Speaker 3>on what look like from a high place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you certainly couldn't get the </v>

389
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:57.231
<v Speaker 3>perspective of flying through the air </v>
<v Speaker 3>and looking down at all this stuff that </v>

390
00:17:57.231 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 3>formerly in front of you is like looming</v>
<v Speaker 3>over you.</v>

391
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

392
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have two little dogs,</v>

393
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 3>adorable door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a little babies,</v>

394
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 3>but you picked them up and like for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's no big deal,</v>

395
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 3>but for that dog it seeing what's on top</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the fucking counters man,</v>

396
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't see that.</v>

397
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:17.481
<v Speaker 3>Usually it's looking up at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it transforms it's reality a little </v>

398
00:18:17.481 --> 00:18:21.291
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So flight transformed human reality and </v>

399
00:18:21.291 --> 00:18:25.611
<v Speaker 3>this intense way and now the satellites </v>
<v Speaker 3>floating around our planet if </v>

400
00:18:25.611 --> 00:18:28.530
<v Speaker 3>transformed it even more because we see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

401
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're on a planet where like it's a ball</v>

402
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 3>that were floating around or a flat </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth or whatever.</v>

403
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.090
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

404
00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:37.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in the same way,</v>

405
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:43.130
<v Speaker 3>the next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next sort of lift off is to somehow </v>

406
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.691
<v Speaker 3>rise above the time space continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that time itself becomes an object </v>

407
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:53.961
<v Speaker 3>instead of a thing that we're stuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of that's the next big liftoff </v>

408
00:18:53.961 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Speaker 3>and that there are already things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

409
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.830
<v Speaker 3>see time as an object instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a river that were currently being </v>

410
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.930
<v Speaker 3>rolled around in.</v>

411
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.430
<v Speaker 3>And for them we look totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the next.</v>

412
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:10.460
<v Speaker 3>That's what like maybe Mckenna was </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the idea of the time </v>

413
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 3>machine or the singularity or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that like once we figure that out,</v>

414
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 3>I know there's never going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking time.</v>

415
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 3>He said no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane,</v>

416
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:19.590
<v Speaker 3>but that theoretically it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

417
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:24.591
<v Speaker 3>people do say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be possible like there's no </v>

418
00:19:24.591 --> 00:19:26.460
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no reason for us to be stuck in</v>

419
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:31.461
<v Speaker 3>the current way that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least that's from the fucking a </v>

420
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:34.090
<v Speaker 3>documentary I saw when I was super stone</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years ago.</v>

421
00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Like they were saying you could use the </v>
<v Speaker 3>power of a star or something to.</v>

422
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to remember who was German </v>

423
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.241
<v Speaker 3>mathematician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a German mathematician that </v>

424
00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:50.960
<v Speaker 3>theorized about the time machine time </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine would have to be.</v>

425
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 3>I want to say the machine would have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like as big as the solar system to be</v>

426
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:58.610
<v Speaker 3>spinning at the speed of light and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transversus access or something.</v>

427
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.940
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

428
00:19:59.941 --> 00:20:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Insane.</v>

429
00:20:01.051 --> 00:20:02.490
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

430
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously for where we're at right now,</v>

431
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.220
<v Speaker 3>this isn't a feasible option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it's possible and we exist in an </v>

432
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:15.471
<v Speaker 3>infinite universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then why wouldn't things have </v>

433
00:20:15.471 --> 00:20:17.700
<v Speaker 3>potentially figured out a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get beyond the time space continuum.</v>

434
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:18.230
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

435
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.190
<v Speaker 3>we're looking for aliens inside of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and space,</v>

436
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:26.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe there's like the thing we </v>

437
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.091
<v Speaker 3>should be that we're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't even have the technology to </v>

438
00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:32.451
<v Speaker 3>scan outside of past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>present and future because that's what </v>

439
00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:34.290
<v Speaker 3>we're in right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things are like way outside of our</v>

440
00:20:34.291 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 3>understanding of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

441
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.600
<v Speaker 3>of what this even is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't even fucking see them.</v>

442
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Like the ants can't see us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we can't even see him.</v>

443
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.700
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't talk to them and aunt can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to you,</v>

444
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:50.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saved to be from my swimming pool and </v>

445
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:50.050
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like it was thanking me.</v>

446
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.390
<v Speaker 3>Like I pulled it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you one to 10?</v>

447
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.140
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when am I not have is the question.</v>

448
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 3>But I pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pulled the,</v>

449
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:03.181
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pulled the bumblebee out and I put it </v>

450
00:21:03.181 --> 00:21:03.181
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like watching it,</v>

451
00:21:03.181 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 3>it's really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

452
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:07.390
<v Speaker 3>it's like dried itself off and went </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this whole thing.</v>

453
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like watching a dog dry itself off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I,</v>

454
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.570
<v Speaker 3>and then it did this cool little like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear it was like a little dance in </v>

455
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.111
<v Speaker 3>front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this weird little cool little </v>

456
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:19.111
<v Speaker 3>bobbing dance thing and then flew away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

457
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 3>did that fucking be just like thanked me</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like,</v>

458
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:25.600
<v Speaker 3>was that like some form of attempting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with me?</v>

459
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean bs certainly communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

460
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:33.510
<v Speaker 3>There is communication among insects and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they're aware that we </v>

461
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they talk to each other,</v>

462
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.370
<v Speaker 3>isn't it possible they might try to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>to us.</v>

463
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Did I ever tell you about the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time on fear factor where the bees </v>

464
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:42.830
<v Speaker 2>communicated with local bees to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't tell.</v>

465
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:47.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a fascinating moment because </v>

466
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.700
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy who was a beekeeper and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was doing as he was a,</v>

467
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.370
<v Speaker 2>it was at the sage brush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sage brush rent.</v>

468
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the name of the ranch,</v>

469
00:21:55.071 --> 00:22:00.071
<v Speaker 2>but it just burnt down in Santa Clarita.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This big ranch they used to film TV </v>

470
00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:00.590
<v Speaker 2>shows out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

471
00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.560
<v Speaker 2>they put these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put them,</v>

472
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.800
<v Speaker 2>they attached them to like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this rope and then they made him stand,</v>

473
00:22:09.211 --> 00:22:12.470
<v Speaker 2>like connected to this pole and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered them with bs,</v>

474
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:17.530
<v Speaker 2>like covered them from head to toe with </v>
<v Speaker 2>bees and they had to stand there for a </v>

475
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.080
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people didn't get stung at all.</v>

476
00:22:18.081 --> 00:22:20.720
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting like this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>really knew some people got stung.</v>

477
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:25.750
<v Speaker 2>I got stung just being around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this guy really knew how to take </v>

478
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.090
<v Speaker 2>care of these beats is really like I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>covered in bees at one point in time and</v>

479
00:22:29.091 --> 00:22:33.440
<v Speaker 2>you just stay calm and eventually blows </v>
<v Speaker 2>them off you with smoking shit.</v>

480
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while they're doing this,</v>

481
00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:37.070
<v Speaker 2>he's got his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a beekeeper.</v>

482
00:22:37.071 --> 00:22:42.071
<v Speaker 2>So he's got his own hive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This local group of bees came over and </v>

483
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:46.871
<v Speaker 2>they met in the sky above us and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his bees went up to talk to all those </v>

484
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:48.710
<v Speaker 2>beats and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta get Outta here.</v>

485
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.530
<v Speaker 2>We have to stand back and let them work </v>
<v Speaker 2>this out.</v>

486
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.740
<v Speaker 2>We have to stop filming with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand back and let us work this out.</v>

487
00:22:54.741 --> 00:22:57.710
<v Speaker 2>So it was me and my friend David </v>
<v Speaker 2>Horowitz,</v>

488
00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.950
<v Speaker 2>who was a producer show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were looking at each other like </v>

489
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.950
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna talk it out like what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck?</v>

490
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.400
<v Speaker 2>And we're sitting there watching these </v>
<v Speaker 2>bees above us just getting together.</v>

491
00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:11.420
<v Speaker 2>And they were literally trying to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>out who these new beads were,</v>

492
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.850
<v Speaker 2>what their plans were on fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

493
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.600
<v Speaker 2>can you get me on that show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you in Sag?</v>

494
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Crazy dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

495
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.360
<v Speaker 2>It was really interesting and it lasted </v>
<v Speaker 2>for about a half an hour,</v>

496
00:23:26.361 --> 00:23:31.361
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talked it out for half an hour and </v>

497
00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:31.970
<v Speaker 2>then the other bees went their separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and then everybody figured out.</v>

498
00:23:31.971 --> 00:23:36.971
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knew where everybody belonged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those tiny little itsy bitsy </v>

499
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:41.120
<v Speaker 2>pinhead brains had decided these are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>their friends.</v>

500
00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:46.180
<v Speaker 2>These are their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where they belong there in this </v>

501
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.180
<v Speaker 2>traveling hive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

502
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.340
<v Speaker 2>for some reason</v>

503
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 3>is in the middle of Santa Clarita right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

504
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

505
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:55.421
<v Speaker 3>all the levels of communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening around us at any given moment </v>

506
00:23:55.421 --> 00:23:56.290
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's astounding.</v>

507
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 3>We can't deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just too much to handle.</v>

508
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:04.030
<v Speaker 3>So we sort of get focused on our own </v>
<v Speaker 3>little lives as human beings or </v>

509
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But fuck man,</v>

510
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.050
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot more going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

511
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:07.640
<v Speaker 3>just that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

512
00:24:07.641 --> 00:24:10.610
<v Speaker 3>that if that's happening with bees </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's didn't.</v>

513
00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.810
<v Speaker 3>It's probably happening with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then we're in this like,</v>

514
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.450
<v Speaker 3>and we talk about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that means we really are in a matrix</v>

515
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:22.451
<v Speaker 3>of intelligence and we've just decided </v>
<v Speaker 3>to focus on this one the way that we're </v>

516
00:24:22.451 --> 00:24:23.760
<v Speaker 3>doing it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

517
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.220
<v Speaker 3>which is a pretty uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sad in a weird way because we do,</v>

518
00:24:28.221 --> 00:24:32.240
<v Speaker 3>you do cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cut yourself out of a whole other,</v>

519
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

520
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.730
<v Speaker 3>That's what one of the things I like </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

521
00:24:35.731 --> 00:24:38.810
<v Speaker 3>like the native American mythology is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>

522
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:40.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

523
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 3>it seems like they had less of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinction between humans and animals.</v>

524
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are our brothers to.</v>

525
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm confused of what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

526
00:24:47.781 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 3>You're cutting yourself out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

527
00:24:49.581 --> 00:24:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

528
00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:52.130
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

529
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.920
<v Speaker 3>let's just take it from the human love </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

530
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:57.140
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even mean to be,</v>

531
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 3>but they're snobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

532
00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:00.920
<v Speaker 3>So they'll see humans snaps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

533
00:25:00.921 --> 00:25:04.150
<v Speaker 3>So a human snob is exclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

534
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:09.160
<v Speaker 3>So they have this exclusive relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the world where they allow into </v>

535
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 3>their periphery or in their circle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

536
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm letting you into my circle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

537
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:18.190
<v Speaker 3>So I have this tight circle of friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then other people based on whatever </v>

538
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 3>their particular metric is for </v>
<v Speaker 3>determining who they want around them,</v>

539
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit snobs are the ones who will happen.</v>

540
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:29.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people who happen to only be </v>

541
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.171
<v Speaker 3>friends with successful people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're only friends with </v>

542
00:25:32.171 --> 00:25:35.591
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like celebrities and their own for like </v>

543
00:25:35.591 --> 00:25:38.771
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird coincidence out of that </v>

544
00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:38.771
<v Speaker 3>APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

545
00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:38.771
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

546
00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 3>so there's that which is like for them </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to interact into,</v>

547
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.680
<v Speaker 3>in this particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like part of the societal ecosystem,</v>

548
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.310
<v Speaker 3>which means they're excluding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excluding,</v>

549
00:25:49.311 --> 00:25:54.311
<v Speaker 3>excluding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excluding all these other fucking </v>

550
00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:54.311
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

551
00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:57.520
<v Speaker 3>And so the moment you stop your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you started experimenting with not </v>

552
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.061
<v Speaker 3>excluding people as much as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you let annoying people </v>

553
00:26:01.061 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 3>around or people who have their don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have your,</v>

554
00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.450
<v Speaker 3>your good intentions with you around or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

555
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.330
<v Speaker 3>You sound like you're giving advice to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck up Hollywood elites.</v>

556
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving advice.</v>

557
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just in Hollywood.</v>

558
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's the elites in general.</v>

559
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.970
<v Speaker 3>There's actually some book I heard about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and read it.</v>

560
00:26:17.971 --> 00:26:21.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a really cool idea that would just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Galapagos Islands here.</v>

561
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:26.531
<v Speaker 3>We have these beings that have evolved </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a certain way because they're </v>

562
00:26:26.531 --> 00:26:26.531
<v Speaker 3>completely separated from everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

563
00:26:26.531 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the same way,</v>

564
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.290
<v Speaker 3>there's a kind of economic galapagos </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens with wealthy people,</v>

565
00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:38.291
<v Speaker 3>which is that they only get around each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and so they start mating within </v>

566
00:26:38.291 --> 00:26:41.810
<v Speaker 3>their own circles and they started </v>
<v Speaker 3>exchanging only information that wealthy</v>

567
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:45.540
<v Speaker 3>people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this creates a kind of hybrid,</v>

568
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:50.160
<v Speaker 3>a weird new form of human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the elite wealthy class,</v>

569
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.310
<v Speaker 3>not a new idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kings and Queens would only like </v>

570
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.630
<v Speaker 3>fuck with him blood lines and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use an intentional form of like wealth</v>

571
00:26:57.631 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 3>eugenics or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

572
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.230
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

573
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.400
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what ends up happening when you're doing</v>

574
00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:07.401
<v Speaker 3>that is you end up cutting off all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>other forms of information that come in.</v>

575
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:13.260
<v Speaker 3>And then also you start living according</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a pretty ridiculous fucking idea,</v>

576
00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:17.220
<v Speaker 3>which is that all these other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever they're doing,</v>

577
00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 3>whoever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

578
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just not really worth it.</v>

579
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that person really have to </v>

580
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:26.730
<v Speaker 3>tell me that I need to hear you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is?</v>

581
00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:31.731
<v Speaker 3>Or is it that they feel like they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get along with those other people </v>

582
00:27:31.731 --> 00:27:34.791
<v Speaker 3>because the other people going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand them because people do find </v>

583
00:27:34.791 --> 00:27:38.091
<v Speaker 3>like minded groups of people and hang </v>
<v Speaker 3>out together and if you're like some </v>

584
00:27:38.091 --> 00:27:41.370
<v Speaker 3>super wealthy rothschild guy and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>become friends with some weirdo painter,</v>

585
00:27:41.371 --> 00:27:42.530
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

586
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.570
<v Speaker 3>how much do you guys have in common?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you have so much in </v>

587
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:47.570
<v Speaker 3>common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much.</v>

588
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

589
00:27:47.641 --> 00:27:48.240
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

590
00:27:48.241 --> 00:27:51.760
<v Speaker 3>You have the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have that gravity.</v>

591
00:27:51.761 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 3>You're both dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gravitational field.</v>

592
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:58.580
<v Speaker 3>He wrote in a fucking body that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn melting down with the </v>

593
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.210
<v Speaker 3>progression of time you're a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably going to have to.</v>

594
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Both of you are going to have to bury </v>
<v Speaker 3>your mom.</v>

595
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.840
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to bury your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're both.</v>

596
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.020
<v Speaker 3>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things you have in </v>

597
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.121
<v Speaker 3>common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they would have to completely open </v>

598
00:28:11.121 --> 00:28:13.431
<v Speaker 3>their mind up to accept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these things have to change the way </v>

599
00:28:13.431 --> 00:28:14.730
<v Speaker 3>a person thinks and you have to change </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in essence who they are.</v>

600
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people just don't have any </v>

601
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.000
<v Speaker 3>desire to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's the problem.</v>

602
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.721
<v Speaker 3>And what's even worse is when that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that kind of idea is the.</v>

603
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.460
<v Speaker 3>The is like encouraged when that's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at as like,</v>

604
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.210
<v Speaker 3>oh this is just a totally normal way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

605
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:35.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the club up Kanga town were cheap </v>

606
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.970
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

607
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that exclusivity,</v>

608
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:48.810
<v Speaker 3>even from a human perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cuts you off to all these.</v>

609
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.990
<v Speaker 3>A lot of data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Admittedly some of that data is probably</v>

610
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:56.991
<v Speaker 3>going to suck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of the data is going to be </v>

611
00:28:56.991 --> 00:28:57.750
<v Speaker 3>you're really fucking good information </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can make your life better.</v>

612
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Stuff's gonna come to you that you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>never expect when you stopped being a.</v>

613
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Speaker 3>When you reduce your exclusivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that same way humans as a species </v>

614
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.870
<v Speaker 3>are exclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

615
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:14.871
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We place ourselves as the top of the </v>

616
00:29:14.871 --> 00:29:15.600
<v Speaker 3>food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>

617
00:29:15.601 --> 00:29:20.601
<v Speaker 3>and underneath this is all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this incredible biomass filled with </v>

618
00:29:20.601 --> 00:29:23.520
<v Speaker 3>all these other forms of life that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have managed.</v>

619
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Many people have managed to reduced to </v>
<v Speaker 3>being some kind of meat machine or </v>

620
00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.360
<v Speaker 3>vegetable or vegetable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

621
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Or plant life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

622
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:34.140
<v Speaker 3>It's all life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all life.</v>

623
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.620
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

624
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.430
<v Speaker 3>and anytime you start talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

625
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not positive about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I can with</v>

626
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.710
<v Speaker 4>this plant in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I'm watering my plants,</v>

627
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.050
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

628
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.910
<v Speaker 4>Some little piece of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they know I'm watering them.</v>

629
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 4>Like I think there's an awareness here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's really either,</v>

630
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.440
<v Speaker 4>but it does feel interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

631
00:29:54.441 --> 00:29:59.441
<v Speaker 4>I've been in grow rooms before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go grow rooms or like it's </v>

632
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 4>like you walked into a room full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy aliens.</v>

633
00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 4>It's really what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey guys,</v>

634
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:09.010
<v Speaker 4>doing it really feels like you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>hi to all these plants.</v>

635
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.480
<v Speaker 4>It might be a hundred percent bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be 100 percent in my </v>

636
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.510
<v Speaker 4>imagination I might've concocted out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thin air.</v>

637
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.780
<v Speaker 4>But going back to what you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier about ants and the system that </v>

638
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:26.581
<v Speaker 4>ants live under and bees are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These bees can communicate with each </v>

639
00:30:26.581 --> 00:30:26.710
<v Speaker 4>other through pheromones and some other </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

640
00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly how they're sorting</v>

641
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:29.830
<v Speaker 4>out who's who and which.</v>

642
00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which clan belongs in what part of the </v>

643
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.920
<v Speaker 4>woods or you know who the fuck that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing that we know about human </v>

644
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 4>beings is that there are signals that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are around us constantly,</v>

645
00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:47.860
<v Speaker 4>that we can't detect wifi and radio and </v>
<v Speaker 4>television and satellite.</v>

646
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff is broadcasting around </v>
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

647
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:54.430
<v Speaker 4>through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>around us constantly and we can't detect</v>

648
00:30:54.431 --> 00:30:59.050
<v Speaker 4>it and we also know that all throughout </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature of these animals that are blind,</v>

649
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 4>there's animals that can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's worms.</v>

650
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:02.470
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of things that have no</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

651
00:31:02.471 --> 00:31:07.471
<v Speaker 4>You're there no idea that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching television and there's no no </v>

652
00:31:07.471 --> 00:31:07.720
<v Speaker 4>idea that you're about to get in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

653
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:11.170
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know what the fuck a car</v>
<v Speaker 4>is because they don't have the senses to</v>

654
00:31:11.171 --> 00:31:12.110
<v Speaker 4>detect it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

655
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:17.180
<v Speaker 4>Why would we assume that we hit the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking bonanza with the senses and </v>

656
00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:17.180
<v Speaker 4>we've got it all down.</v>

657
00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:17.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous.</v>

658
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.860
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's probably like.</v>

659
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:26.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what those quantum </v>

660
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.230
<v Speaker 4>physicist guys are up to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

661
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 4>Didn't they say that they were up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like they believe there's more than 30 </v>

662
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.491
<v Speaker 4>different dimensions now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We used to think it was 11 and now </v>

663
00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:33.190
<v Speaker 4>there's some schools of thought that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like 30 dimension.</v>

664
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:38.950
<v Speaker 4>Fuck knows it could be infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the point is these could be worlds </v>

665
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.710
<v Speaker 4>that are in our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our midst,</v>

666
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:45.250
<v Speaker 4>just in a nonphysical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the same way,</v>

667
00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:50.251
<v Speaker 4>ideas are nonphysical the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagination is nonphysical the same way.</v>

668
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain forms of communication.</v>

669
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 4>You're just saying something to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

670
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you I love you and you're my</v>

671
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:02.200
<v Speaker 4>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a nonphysical thing.</v>

672
00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.540
<v Speaker 4>It gives you a physical reaction like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aw,</v>

673
00:32:04.541 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 4>thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you too.</v>

674
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:11.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're friends that that's some sort of </v>

675
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 4>weird nonphysical energy exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just as simple as,</v>

676
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:13.960
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

677
00:32:13.961 --> 00:32:16.090
<v Speaker 4>two people showing affection for each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other to friends,</v>

678
00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:16.990
<v Speaker 4>showing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love that.</v>

679
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:19.510
<v Speaker 4>There's something else going on too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

680
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:20.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>

681
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.870
<v Speaker 4>There's an energy exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's both.</v>

682
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 4>People get happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I tell someone I love them,</v>

683
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 4>I get happy too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get happy.</v>

684
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.270
<v Speaker 4>The whole everybody boosts up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a very underrated thing.</v>

685
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.920
<v Speaker 4>Telling your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

686
00:32:32.921 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 4>it's shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're not even supposed to do</v>

687
00:32:35.171 --> 00:32:36.550
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like again,</v>

688
00:32:36.551 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 4>because we live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why so much what we live in</v>

689
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.100
<v Speaker 3>is like very advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so much of it as like ridiculously </v>

690
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.791
<v Speaker 3>barbaric and primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to tell your friend you love them </v>

691
00:32:48.791 --> 00:32:48.791
<v Speaker 3>can be a shocking</v>

692
00:32:48.791 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Ari shaffir still stammers alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you dude.</v>

693
00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:57.790
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Joey Diaz,</v>

694
00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love your dog.</v>

695
00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:59.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

696
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 4>Joe is like the most loving guy of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

697
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo is a very loving guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

698
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know a lot of loving people,</v>

699
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 4>jobs loving.</v>

700
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.910
<v Speaker 3>I think we are love and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

701
00:33:11.911 --> 00:33:15.340
<v Speaker 3>the thing that I've been thinking lately</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just playing around this idea is like</v>

702
00:33:15.341 --> 00:33:18.670
<v Speaker 3>what if I have all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>versions?</v>

703
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't quite know the right way to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>

704
00:33:20.591 --> 00:33:25.591
<v Speaker 3>But like so imagine like directly behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>you is a window that opens up into a </v>

705
00:33:29.411 --> 00:33:31.000
<v Speaker 3>universe where everything is made of </v>
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>

706
00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:36.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're standing in front of the </v>

707
00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.030
<v Speaker 3>window blocking that White,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

708
00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:40.150
<v Speaker 3>You're standing in front of the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like the human condition.</v>

709
00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just a thought experiment and </v>

710
00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:45.640
<v Speaker 3>admittedly a very high thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment that I had,</v>

711
00:33:45.641 --> 00:33:47.530
<v Speaker 3>but I can't get it out of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

712
00:33:47.531 --> 00:33:49.930
<v Speaker 3>and I've heard Rom Dass give different </v>
<v Speaker 3>versions of this too,</v>

713
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.640
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is like,</v>

714
00:33:51.641 --> 00:33:54.610
<v Speaker 3>here's this window opening up into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternate.</v>

715
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't want even want to call them </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternate universe.</v>

716
00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:01.710
<v Speaker 3>The actual universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's kind of like Plato's </v>

717
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.801
<v Speaker 3>allegory of the cave to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're standing in front of this </v>

718
00:34:04.801 --> 00:34:06.730
<v Speaker 3>fucking window blocking the love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your ego is right.</v>

719
00:34:06.731 --> 00:34:11.731
<v Speaker 3>Your ego is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the more opaque your ego becomes,</v>

720
00:34:12.161 --> 00:34:17.161
<v Speaker 3>the more you allow yourself to become </v>
<v Speaker 3>less and less of a thing stuck to </v>

721
00:34:17.161 --> 00:34:20.971
<v Speaker 3>anything at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more the light from that universe </v>

722
00:34:20.971 --> 00:34:21.610
<v Speaker 3>shines into this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

723
00:34:21.611 --> 00:34:24.070
<v Speaker 3>So when you're with someone who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you,</v>

724
00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:29.370
<v Speaker 3>I really love you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've gotten over their ego enough to </v>

725
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:34.051
<v Speaker 3>let the light from that window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just kind of like managed the let </v>

726
00:34:34.051 --> 00:34:35.380
<v Speaker 3>that light shine through them for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second into this dementia,</v>

727
00:34:35.381 --> 00:34:40.381
<v Speaker 3>which is why it's so shocking and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe why babies are so entrancing </v>

728
00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:41.890
<v Speaker 3>because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no ego there.</v>

729
00:34:41.891 --> 00:34:46.891
<v Speaker 3>They're just a pure blast of love or </v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs in the same way or cats or anything</v>

730
00:34:48.191 --> 00:34:53.191
<v Speaker 3>that loves you is so incredible because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they actually are are like windows </v>

731
00:34:53.711 --> 00:34:58.300
<v Speaker 3>are portals into their reality of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>our universe is,</v>

732
00:34:58.301 --> 00:35:03.301
<v Speaker 3>which is love and so if you're blocking </v>
<v Speaker 3>the window then that means that like </v>

733
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.610
<v Speaker 3>you're mostly living in a world of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shadows.</v>

734
00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like a person who's like very </v>
<v Speaker 3>egotistical is like living in a shadowy </v>

735
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:15.241
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you spent way too much time at </v>

736
00:35:15.241 --> 00:35:16.480
<v Speaker 3>burning man fry your brand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't spend enough time Friday,</v>

737
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

738
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Shotgun windows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>love living things.</v>

739
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Are you starting your cult?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I joined?</v>

740
00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:26.880
<v Speaker 4>I want to join.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we join each other's?</v>

741
00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.910
<v Speaker 4>I was just thinking when you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about dimensions,</v>

742
00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 4>like is that an egotistical point of </v>
<v Speaker 4>view that we have,</v>

743
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Speaker 4>that there is like a portal to another </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimension and is it really just that </v>

744
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 4>these dimensions are constantly around </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

745
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:50.841
<v Speaker 4>We just don't have the ability to access</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like they're there all the </v>

746
00:35:50.841 --> 00:35:53.511
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's like legitimately why no </v>

747
00:35:53.511 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 4>one like the Fermi paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

748
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:55.880
<v Speaker 4>the Fermi Paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is um,</v>

749
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 4>if there's so many stars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many planets were there,</v>

750
00:35:58.501 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 4>all the aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's The fucking aliens?</v>

751
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:06.470
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they get so smart that they never </v>

752
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe no one does that.</v>

753
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.850
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're liking this rudimentary thing,</v>

754
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:14.030
<v Speaker 4>like these stupid Fox are still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're still making metal dicks and </v>

755
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:17.450
<v Speaker 4>trying to fuck the sky shooting rockets </v>
<v Speaker 4>up into space and they're landing people</v>

756
00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:19.890
<v Speaker 4>on is they're still doing it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they,</v>

757
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.920
<v Speaker 4>they lack the ability to transcend space</v>
<v Speaker 4>and time and to just pass through other,</v>

758
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:30.650
<v Speaker 4>through other dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like as a species we're like a </v>

759
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.650
<v Speaker 4>crazy</v>

760
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.750
<v Speaker 3>person and a bus station staring at it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>at his hand and being like,</v>

761
00:36:33.751 --> 00:36:38.751
<v Speaker 3>where are the aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see the aliens in my hand when </v>

762
00:36:38.751 --> 00:36:40.680
<v Speaker 3>it's like all he has to do is look up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's surrounded by it</v>

763
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:45.910
<v Speaker 4>and you know the ultimate mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck when it comes to the time travel </v>

764
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:48.671
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate mind fuck when it comes to </v>

765
00:36:48.671 --> 00:36:52.361
<v Speaker 4>time travel is that one day they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have a time machine and it's </v>

766
00:36:52.361 --> 00:36:54.890
<v Speaker 4>probably likely it might take 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

767
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:58.970
<v Speaker 4>Who knows how long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about when was the first tool,</v>

768
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.980
<v Speaker 4>like what was it a couple hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand years ago.</v>

769
00:37:00.981 --> 00:37:05.981
<v Speaker 4>The data now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was I think the first tools </v>

770
00:37:05.981 --> 00:37:06.110
<v Speaker 4>or somewhere around and have to look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>my calendar.</v>

771
00:37:06.111 --> 00:37:10.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So from the first tool to now,</v>

772
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.600
<v Speaker 4>a couple hundred thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think from now to a time machine,</v>

773
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.780
<v Speaker 4>if we stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we don't blow ourselves up,</v>

774
00:37:17.781 --> 00:37:20.090
<v Speaker 4>we don't get hit by an asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We keep improving.</v>

775
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.400
<v Speaker 4>They're going to figure it out and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>day they figured out what becomes crazy </v>

776
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.441
<v Speaker 4>is then all time travel from any point </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the future to that moment is possible</v>

777
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:37.690
<v Speaker 4>and to any place else on the scale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see the ideas that you could only travel</v>

778
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:42.380
<v Speaker 4>where there's a road so once the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine is invented,</v>

779
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:46.610
<v Speaker 4>time ceases to be linear and everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens all at once.</v>

780
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:51.640
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like literally anyone can come back to </v>

781
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.941
<v Speaker 4>any point in time and go back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could smack someone and then you go </v>

782
00:37:54.941 --> 00:37:59.471
<v Speaker 4>back in time before you smack them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kiss them and then go back in time and </v>

783
00:37:59.471 --> 00:38:00.050
<v Speaker 4>smack them and they'll go back in time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and kiss him.</v>

784
00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 4>You could pull their pants down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can pull the pants up and do </v>

785
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.530
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You literally could go back and forth in</v>

786
00:38:06.531 --> 00:38:09.680
<v Speaker 4>time and it would have never happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'd be communicating with the same</v>

787
00:38:09.681 --> 00:38:14.681
<v Speaker 4>person once it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So once it does happen and people have </v>

788
00:38:14.681 --> 00:38:14.780
<v Speaker 4>access to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which that access,</v>

789
00:38:14.781 --> 00:38:19.781
<v Speaker 4>like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's cell phones or automobiles </v>

790
00:38:19.781 --> 00:38:19.781
<v Speaker 4>or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the accents,</v>

791
00:38:19.781 --> 00:38:22.580
<v Speaker 4>the access starts in a limited way or </v>
<v Speaker 4>very few people could afford it and then</v>

792
00:38:22.581 --> 00:38:27.581
<v Speaker 4>it becomes worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did we talk about directed Panspermia </v>

793
00:38:27.581 --> 00:38:29.180
<v Speaker 4>already as it related to time travel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

794
00:38:29.181 --> 00:38:32.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like the idea of Panspermia mean</v>

795
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 4>intentional like aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

796
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is like,</v>

797
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:40.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

798
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

799
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.960
<v Speaker 3>so I know this idea where you need the </v>
<v Speaker 3>road to travel,</v>

800
00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:45.760
<v Speaker 3>so we need to build the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the.</v>

801
00:38:45.761 --> 00:38:49.450
<v Speaker 3>So let's say I do invent the technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a time machine,</v>

802
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.430
<v Speaker 3>which basically means I have point a now</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to point B,</v>

803
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the point B A,</v>

804
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.620
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get the further out.</v>

805
00:38:59.621 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 3>The point B is I guess the more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more,</v>

806
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.450
<v Speaker 3>the more powerful the time machine would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

807
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the idea of direct parents.</v>

808
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Sperming as a means of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Travel is assuming you are the super </v>

809
00:39:14.711 --> 00:39:19.711
<v Speaker 3>advanced species than what you do is you</v>
<v Speaker 3>create these genetic,</v>

810
00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:21.700
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

811
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 3>you create like Dna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You create a kind of packaged thing that</v>

812
00:39:26.651 --> 00:39:28.900
<v Speaker 3>when it lands in the right environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could live in,</v>

813
00:39:28.901 --> 00:39:33.901
<v Speaker 3>has the tendency to evolve into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological civilization that will </v>

814
00:39:33.901 --> 00:39:36.490
<v Speaker 3>build a time machine that is actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>point b for your time machine.</v>

815
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:41.490
<v Speaker 3>So you released from your planet just </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite blasts of this,</v>

816
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:47.101
<v Speaker 3>a DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know that when it lands on the </v>

817
00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:47.560
<v Speaker 3>road and then the seed finds the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>soil,</v>

818
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:52.740
<v Speaker 3>it's going to grow into a technological </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree that at the end of its growth is </v>

819
00:39:53.481 --> 00:39:58.030
<v Speaker 3>going to flower with your point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the end of your time machine.</v>

820
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:03.060
<v Speaker 3>So if you were this kind of interstellar</v>
<v Speaker 3>traveler then for you,</v>

821
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:07.690
<v Speaker 3>you would send these seeds out into time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the moment of time that they've</v>

822
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.840
<v Speaker 3>got to the point where they built a time</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine for you,</v>

823
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:13.310
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like it happened instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's your point b.</v>

824
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.580
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what it's going to lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

825
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.110
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

826
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be at least a habitable </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet because you've developed this,</v>

827
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

828
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.360
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

829
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 3>genetic machines to only take root and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet that you could live on.</v>

830
00:40:26.711 --> 00:40:31.711
<v Speaker 3>So what we are are these genetic robots </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are compelled to build technology </v>

831
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:37.320
<v Speaker 3>because we're opening up the point b in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of interstellar time machine </v>

832
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 3>and that's what the singularity is.</v>

833
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.900
<v Speaker 3>It's when our creator masters come </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the time portal that we've </v>

834
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.110
<v Speaker 3>opened up on this planet and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

835
00:40:44.111 --> 00:40:44.920
<v Speaker 3>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did it.</v>

836
00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

837
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.620
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty interesting as it seems like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it works.</v>

838
00:40:50.621 --> 00:40:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Seems so science fictiony though that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really got to a point like imagine if</v>

839
00:40:54.881 --> 00:40:59.881
<v Speaker 3>our civilization and gotten to a point </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we could transcend space and time </v>

840
00:40:59.881 --> 00:41:02.590
<v Speaker 3>and travel through the universe and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to any place at any point in time and</v>

841
00:41:02.591 --> 00:41:07.250
<v Speaker 3>even drop the seeds of life on a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that term that they were going</v>

842
00:41:07.251 --> 00:41:08.770
<v Speaker 3>to use on Mars?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where the,</v>

843
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.350
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it called?</v>

844
00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.430
<v Speaker 3>What's the term when you take care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

845
00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.230
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

846
00:41:14.231 --> 00:41:19.231
<v Speaker 3>thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that they had done this like and </v>

847
00:41:19.231 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 3>then they're gonna come back like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>silver surfer and fucking like,</v>

848
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're them.</v>

849
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.570
<v Speaker 3>I think we are them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything else.</v>

850
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:30.750
<v Speaker 3>This is what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is a ridiculous way to </v>

851
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:31.820
<v Speaker 3>look at it too because a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know and I'm talking shit show,</v>

852
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 3>but I think it is entirely</v>

853
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 4>possible that we're number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning that we're the first.</v>

854
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.300
<v Speaker 4>We're the first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were the first of all these things to</v>

855
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:45.230
<v Speaker 4>achieve this state and that when these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things achieve this state,</v>

856
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:49.610
<v Speaker 4>they they either blow themselves up or </v>
<v Speaker 4>they keep going and they become more and</v>

857
00:41:49.611 --> 00:41:54.611
<v Speaker 4>more advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it happens very often </v>

858
00:41:54.611 --> 00:41:54.611
<v Speaker 4>and I might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might be totally wrong,</v>

859
00:41:54.611 --> 00:41:59.410
<v Speaker 4>but it hasn't happened anywhere near us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's pretend that the galaxy that we</v>

860
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:03.290
<v Speaker 4>look at right now that we can see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's pretend that's the universe.</v>

861
00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:08.291
<v Speaker 4>What if we find out that out of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>galaxy of hundreds of millions of stars </v>

862
00:42:08.291 --> 00:42:11.500
<v Speaker 4>were the only intelligent life that </v>
<v Speaker 4>drastically narrows the possibility for </v>

863
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 4>intelligent life everywhere else in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe,</v>

864
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.790
<v Speaker 4>except for the fact that the universe is</v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite,</v>

865
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.390
<v Speaker 4>which means that not only is there </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent life in the universe,</v>

866
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.820
<v Speaker 4>there's a Duncan trussell somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the universe.</v>

867
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.850
<v Speaker 4>Not only is there a Duncan trussell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a Duncan trussell that said </v>

868
00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:29.330
<v Speaker 4>everything that you said in the exact </v>
<v Speaker 4>same order with every pause,</v>

869
00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:34.540
<v Speaker 4>every time you dribbled piss on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>toilet seat and you all take care of </v>

870
00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.661
<v Speaker 4>that later and you shut the lid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It did that to the exact t an infinite </v>

871
00:42:37.661 --> 00:42:39.200
<v Speaker 4>number of times throughout space and </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

872
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:44.470
<v Speaker 4>so like not only is there one of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's an infinite number of use </v>

873
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:49.121
<v Speaker 4>and then an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities left and right that you </v>

874
00:42:49.121 --> 00:42:51.410
<v Speaker 4>could have gone different paths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can take it.</v>

875
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.040
<v Speaker 4>That's how big the universe is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how big infinity is,</v>

876
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.700
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that anything's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever gotten smarter than this.</v>

877
00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:01.520
<v Speaker 4>This is the only thing that we know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's gotten this smart.</v>

878
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:07.090
<v Speaker 4>It might be this is the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's got the smart because something </v>

879
00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:07.220
<v Speaker 4>had to be the first thing that got this </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart.</v>

880
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:09.560
<v Speaker 4>It didn't happen unless it happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously.</v>

881
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:12.170
<v Speaker 4>Like we're saying that it happened with </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of things,</v>

882
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:14.780
<v Speaker 4>but let's call that thing the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>in different places.</v>

883
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not like there's a gray alien with </v>
<v Speaker 4>big black eyes and a giant head,</v>

884
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 4>a little skinny neck that reads your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind and flies through magnetic fields.</v>

885
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about that.</v>

886
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.040
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about you and I this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

887
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.210
<v Speaker 4>this thing might exist an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of times all throughout space and</v>

888
00:43:29.211 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's call it this one thing.</v>

889
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:36.490
<v Speaker 4>This one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This might be the first time anything </v>

890
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:36.490
<v Speaker 4>has gotten as advanced as this one,</v>

891
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.910
<v Speaker 5>so it's like the term,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the simulation as they're using is base </v>

892
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:42.860
<v Speaker 5>reality like this is base reality and </v>
<v Speaker 5>not there.</v>

893
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:47.870
<v Speaker 5>The statistical probability of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>being based reality is somehow a.</v>

894
00:43:49.021 --> 00:43:51.750
<v Speaker 5>it's more probable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't based on reality,</v>

895
00:43:51.751 --> 00:43:56.751
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a probability that this is base </v>

896
00:43:56.751 --> 00:43:57.980
<v Speaker 5>reality and there's also a probability </v>
<v Speaker 5>that this isn't based on reality like we</v>

897
00:43:57.981 --> 00:43:58.380
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

898
00:43:58.381 --> 00:44:01.320
<v Speaker 5>you get to roll the dice on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

899
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.140
<v Speaker 5>I who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's impossible to,</v>

900
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:09.460
<v Speaker 5>to really like at this point we can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>prove that this isn't the default base </v>

901
00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.820
<v Speaker 5>reality that the entire universe is </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiencing,</v>

902
00:44:11.821 --> 00:44:15.120
<v Speaker 5>but my guess would be that no way man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like a.</v>

903
00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:17.700
<v Speaker 5>I think it's more realistic that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a fucking,</v>

904
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:23.710
<v Speaker 5>like a novelty farm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some kind of technological novelty </v>

905
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.840
<v Speaker 5>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like A.</v>

906
00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean to use human terms were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

907
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you could simulate a universe </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then create intelligent anything </v>

908
00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 5>Cynthia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligent beings that are particularly</v>

909
00:44:34.891 --> 00:44:37.200
<v Speaker 5>cynthiana intelligent beings that </v>
<v Speaker 5>matched you,</v>

910
00:44:37.201 --> 00:44:42.201
<v Speaker 5>your species,</v>
<v Speaker 5>duplicate yourself even and then run </v>

911
00:44:42.201 --> 00:44:45.171
<v Speaker 5>that duplication an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>times in this server mechanism or </v>

912
00:44:45.171 --> 00:44:46.840
<v Speaker 5>whatever you have in your super </v>
<v Speaker 5>computer.</v>

913
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 5>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

914
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:52.911
<v Speaker 5>you just set time to loop a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is faster rate as your computer would</v>

915
00:44:55.531 --> 00:45:00.531
<v Speaker 5>let you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So at night you just like let it run in </v>

916
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 5>the morning you wake up and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck,</v>

917
00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:02.130
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hemingway.</v>

918
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.120
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

919
00:45:03.121 --> 00:45:08.121
<v Speaker 5>They entire works of Hemingway just got </v>
<v Speaker 5>generated in my universe simulator by </v>

920
00:45:08.121 --> 00:45:12.591
<v Speaker 5>one of the simulated creatures that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>had in there and it's a very prosperous </v>

921
00:45:12.591 --> 00:45:16.761
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like a novelty farmer or </v>

922
00:45:16.761 --> 00:45:19.791
<v Speaker 5>something in the same way they've got </v>
<v Speaker 5>those fucking big coin things that are </v>

923
00:45:19.791 --> 00:45:21.450
<v Speaker 5>like constantly grinding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like make bitcoins,</v>

924
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:25.260
<v Speaker 5>you're fucking making universes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside the universities the universities</v>

925
00:45:25.261 --> 00:45:30.261
<v Speaker 5>are making planets and the planets are </v>
<v Speaker 5>making technology and the technology is </v>

926
00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:34.161
<v Speaker 5>being a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>every single whatever your morning </v>

927
00:45:34.161 --> 00:45:34.170
<v Speaker 5>happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whenever you wake up you're like,</v>

928
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.190
<v Speaker 5>oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got,</v>

929
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:37.890
<v Speaker 5>oh that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a new form of teleportation.</v>

930
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:42.890
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen that before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a way to like harvest information </v>

931
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 5>from a kind of living ai or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

932
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like it'd be a very,</v>

933
00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:52.611
<v Speaker 5>a really smart way to kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>gathered data or to create not novelty </v>

934
00:45:53.431 --> 00:45:58.431
<v Speaker 5>events.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean just for the pure entertainment </v>

935
00:45:58.431 --> 00:46:00.471
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you had a way to like access </v>

936
00:46:00.471 --> 00:46:00.720
<v Speaker 5>like five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like for you it's like,</v>

937
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now we download a movie,</v>

938
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 5>it takes like two minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five minutes.</v>

939
00:46:04.351 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Depending on your connection in the same</v>

940
00:46:06.511 --> 00:46:11.511
<v Speaker 5>way like you wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five minutes in a universe is born and </v>

941
00:46:11.511 --> 00:46:14.391
<v Speaker 5>dies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and throughout that it can pick out an </v>

942
00:46:14.391 --> 00:46:14.391
<v Speaker 5>interesting moments like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at this.</v>

943
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's that moment where in that planet,</v>

944
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:22.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world war three started because </v>

945
00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:25.250
<v Speaker 5>fucking Russia wanted to like secure </v>
<v Speaker 5>Syria and we didn't want it to happen.</v>

946
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the disaster.</v>

947
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.760
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We already have examples of this in a </v>

948
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.711
<v Speaker 5>rudimentary form and all these new </v>
<v Speaker 5>universes that are being created in </v>

949
00:46:33.711 --> 00:46:34.200
<v Speaker 5>these online games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Piggy back Lee.</v>

950
00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:35.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are those games,</v>

951
00:46:35.701 --> 00:46:36.360
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the,</v>

952
00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:41.361
<v Speaker 5>what are those games called?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know the name of those games </v>

953
00:46:41.361 --> 00:46:41.361
<v Speaker 5>where they create different worlds?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

954
00:46:41.361 --> 00:46:45.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's called procedural generation and </v>

955
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.910
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about the no man's sky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The game that everyone got angry about </v>

956
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:48.960
<v Speaker 5>what they get angry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

957
00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:53.961
<v Speaker 5>they got angry about it because the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the summation of the anger is just </v>

958
00:46:54.271 --> 00:46:56.940
<v Speaker 5>because something is gigantic doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean it's entertaining.</v>

959
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:59.190
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you ended up getting in this kind</v>

960
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:04.191
<v Speaker 5>of feedback loop because if you're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to procedurally generate and infinite a </v>

961
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:08.430
<v Speaker 5>year or a semi infinite universe with </v>
<v Speaker 5>all these different planets and stuff,</v>

962
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:13.940
<v Speaker 5>then that means you need an ai that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can procedurally generate that's also </v>

963
00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:14.140
<v Speaker 5>going to procedurally generate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

964
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.800
<v Speaker 5>what we consider to be a game like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

965
00:47:16.801 --> 00:47:19.560
<v Speaker 5>interesting storylines and things to do.</v>

966
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.120
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just creating things.</v>

967
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:21.750
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

968
00:47:21.751 --> 00:47:24.120
<v Speaker 5>Well that's one part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other part that people get mad about</v>

969
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:27.660
<v Speaker 5>is the apparently not even apparently </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can see like,</v>

970
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 5>people get so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God May,</v>

971
00:47:29.981 --> 00:47:34.981
<v Speaker 5>you never piss off the gaming community </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just like don't fuck with them </v>

972
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:40.621
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they swarm in and it's vicious </v>

973
00:47:40.621 --> 00:47:43.291
<v Speaker 5>and brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was playing the game and really </v>

974
00:47:43.291 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 5>enjoying it for at least a week and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>half,</v>

975
00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 5>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I go on like Reddit,</v>

976
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 5>no man's sky and read the comments and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

977
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.250
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys are fucking dicks.</v>

978
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 5>This game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Super Fun.</v>

979
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:57.481
<v Speaker 5>I'm on the best fucking time of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm never going to play this again to </v>

980
00:47:57.481 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 5>you out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

981
00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:00.250
<v Speaker 5>I know in the game it just suddenly it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

982
00:48:00.251 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it got boring,</v>

983
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 5>it got boring and it got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

984
00:48:03.341 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 5>for me it got boring for other people.</v>

985
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 5>I know some people were saying you guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>are dicks.</v>

986
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.160
<v Speaker 5>When I was enjoying it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reading their critique,</v>

987
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:15.180
<v Speaker 5>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but really it was like reading the </v>

988
00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.071
<v Speaker 5>critique of gourmet chefs far more </v>
<v Speaker 5>familiar with where gaming is at.</v>

989
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:22.170
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are people who play games all the </v>

990
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:22.170
<v Speaker 5>time and know it and like have very high</v>
<v Speaker 5>expectations.</v>

991
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:23.890
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the point is yes,</v>

992
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:29.040
<v Speaker 5>it procedurally generates this </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible universe but it ends up </v>

993
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.760
<v Speaker 5>getting kind of boring or something like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

994
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:35.761
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>procedurally generate like we are in a </v>

995
00:48:35.761 --> 00:48:37.801
<v Speaker 5>procedurally generated universe that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>producing novelty events which may be in</v>

996
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:44.461
<v Speaker 5>the universe that we are being </v>
<v Speaker 5>procedurally generated out of as a form </v>

997
00:48:44.461 --> 00:48:48.721
<v Speaker 5>of currency or a form of entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 5>or a form of something we don't even </v>

998
00:48:48.721 --> 00:48:52.300
<v Speaker 5>understand yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what could all I know is if I.</v>

999
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:57.301
<v Speaker 5>If there was a game called universe </v>
<v Speaker 5>creator run your computer and your </v>

1000
00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:02.340
<v Speaker 5>universe will at some point generate </v>
<v Speaker 5>sentience wife that at some point we'll </v>

1001
00:49:02.621 --> 00:49:07.621
<v Speaker 5>start generating technology that at some</v>
<v Speaker 5>point you'll be able to like watch and </v>

1002
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 5>possibly using your own dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I will be running that.</v>

1003
00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:16.141
<v Speaker 5>If I was a company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would definitely be running that </v>

1004
00:49:16.141 --> 00:49:19.231
<v Speaker 5>software for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would want that to exist just for pure</v>

1005
00:49:19.301 --> 00:49:24.301
<v Speaker 5>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's better than like having a never </v>

1006
00:49:24.301 --> 00:49:26.881
<v Speaker 5>ending stream of inventions coming from </v>
<v Speaker 5>your universe simulator that you could </v>

1007
00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:27.460
<v Speaker 5>then market in this dimension.</v>

1008
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something weird that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>do to where we look at things that we </v>

1009
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.041
<v Speaker 4>can generate with a computer versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that sort of exist in the real </v>

1010
00:49:36.111 --> 00:49:39.140
<v Speaker 4>world and we look at them as coming from</v>
<v Speaker 4>different sources.</v>

1011
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Something that man makes versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that just happens and because </v>

1012
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:48.110
<v Speaker 4>of we look at it from different sources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we recognize that.</v>

1013
00:49:48.111 --> 00:49:53.111
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a long process from a star </v>

1014
00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:59.140
<v Speaker 4>exploding to a human being being born,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're all connected.</v>

1015
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.530
<v Speaker 4>But star exploding is necessary for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>development of.</v>

1016
00:50:04.531 --> 00:50:07.910
<v Speaker 4>Of the carbon based life form on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>

1017
00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.010
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this,</v>

1018
00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:14.480
<v Speaker 4>the elements that make us the star had a</v>
<v Speaker 4>blow up,</v>

1019
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:18.920
<v Speaker 4>like there's this long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't think of that as like being</v>

1020
00:50:18.921 --> 00:50:23.921
<v Speaker 4>made because it takes too long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We decided we're going to call it </v>

1021
00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:25.100
<v Speaker 4>evolution or natural selection.</v>

1022
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:30.110
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by defining of these things in that </v>

1023
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.341
<v Speaker 4>way we've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've failed to look at the thing for </v>

1024
00:50:33.341 --> 00:50:37.121
<v Speaker 4>what the thing is with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is forget about whether </v>

1025
00:50:37.121 --> 00:50:38.000
<v Speaker 4>evolutions real or creation of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nonsense.</v>

1026
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.730
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean anything like whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>is doing it,</v>

1027
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:45.820
<v Speaker 4>it's doing it and it's doing it from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>star blowing up to a person talking </v>

1028
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:50.240
<v Speaker 4>about a star billowing up to his friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1029
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:51.220
<v Speaker 4>like right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1030
00:50:51.221 --> 00:50:52.130
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1031
00:50:52.131 --> 00:50:56.630
<v Speaker 4>this is all made like whatever you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>made as been made by this process.</v>

1032
00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 4>Any great painter and the architect who </v>
<v Speaker 4>built the most incredible buildings,</v>

1033
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:06.910
<v Speaker 4>you were made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This whole thing is made right and </v>

1034
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:11.201
<v Speaker 4>you're making things too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those things aren't any more </v>

1035
00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 4>significant than trees that all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is nuts.</v>

1036
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:17.270
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting more and more complex,</v>

1037
00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.510
<v Speaker 4>more and more involved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more aware,</v>

1038
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:24.520
<v Speaker 4>faster information sharing between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that matter,</v>

1039
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:27.380
<v Speaker 4>things making more and crazier and </v>
<v Speaker 4>better things.</v>

1040
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 4>But all of these things made by a star </v>
<v Speaker 4>explosion,</v>

1041
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:38.250
<v Speaker 5>Are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess like if you want to get </v>

1043
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:38.250
<v Speaker 5>technical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

1044
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Speaker 5>So when you say made it starts it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>employee.</v>

1045
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.080
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1046
00:51:42.081 --> 00:51:42.810
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1047
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:44.790
<v Speaker 5>it's a process,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1048
00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:45.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1049
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:46.960
<v Speaker 5>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're probably like,</v>

1050
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.720
<v Speaker 5>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1051
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.610
<v Speaker 5>I really do think that whatever this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>

1052
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.440
<v Speaker 5>is literally made in the sense of like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>maker.</v>

1053
00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.270
<v Speaker 5>Like it was really think there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>maker.</v>

1054
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.360
<v Speaker 5>I think it was individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an individual.</v>

1055
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:01.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1056
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:06.750
<v Speaker 5>and I don't think it's force.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the uh,</v>

1057
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.870
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1058
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.910
<v Speaker 5>create something that's very creative </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that it's.</v>

1059
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:15.380
<v Speaker 5>Or it's a source of creativity and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think that it's,</v>

1060
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:18.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm a fuck it.</v>

1061
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:21.680
<v Speaker 5>I'll say I'm a theist man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I pray,</v>

1062
00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:26.700
<v Speaker 5>I area sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you punching?</v>

1063
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:30.780
<v Speaker 5>I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to them.</v>

1064
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:31.930
<v Speaker 5>I've fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1065
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:36.980
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just love to pray and like when my </v>

1066
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.010
<v Speaker 5>life gets better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I pray and I just love it.</v>

1067
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:38.670
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1068
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:39.930
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I fucking,</v>

1069
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.760
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know me,</v>

1070
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:44.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to know you too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I enjoy.</v>

1071
00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:45.230
<v Speaker 5>So when I sit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you say,</v>

1072
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:46.700
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it an individual?</v>

1073
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:52.840
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 5>different ways of saying it in every </v>

1074
00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 5>single way of saying it falls short of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what it is.</v>

1075
00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:55.940
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's A.</v>

1076
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.310
<v Speaker 5>I keep telling you about this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man and I.</v>

1077
00:52:58.311 --> 00:53:01.970
<v Speaker 5>One day I hope you pick them up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a Buddhist teacher named Chogyam</v>

1078
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:05.970
<v Speaker 5>Trungpa who says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'll like getting in an argument with</v>

1079
00:53:05.971 --> 00:53:08.450
<v Speaker 5>Chogyam Trungpa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if he heard me spew that bullshit,</v>

1080
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:12.620
<v Speaker 5>what he would say his weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when I ask you,</v>

1081
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:15.170
<v Speaker 5>is it an individual?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it a thing?</v>

1082
00:53:15.171 --> 00:53:16.010
<v Speaker 5>Is it a person?</v>

1083
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:17.330
<v Speaker 5>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>

1084
00:53:17.331 --> 00:53:22.331
<v Speaker 5>There's no words for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then at that moment what you've done is </v>

1085
00:53:22.331 --> 00:53:26.891
<v Speaker 5>you've taken your confusion and you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>put it on an altar and you started </v>

1086
00:53:26.891 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 5>worshiping it as though it were your </v>
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

1087
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 5>Your ability to not articulate the thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>is not an indication of the existence of</v>

1088
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:38.601
<v Speaker 5>a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's more the indication of your </v>

1089
00:53:38.601 --> 00:53:41.150
<v Speaker 5>laziness because you want to like deify </v>
<v Speaker 5>your a confused,</v>

1090
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.720
<v Speaker 5>passionate emptiness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that.</v>

1091
00:53:45.721 --> 00:53:47.640
<v Speaker 5>There's a great for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of his books that is,</v>

1092
00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.320
<v Speaker 5>that's a great quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>echoed through my fucking ever since I </v>

1093
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 5>changed passionate emptiness exactly </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>

1094
00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:00.150
<v Speaker 5>Courtney love song,</v>
<v Speaker 5>confused,</v>

1095
00:54:00.151 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 5>passionate emptiness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1096
00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that being said,</v>

1097
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:04.160
<v Speaker 5>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1098
00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1099
00:54:05.311 --> 00:54:10.311
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you should do experiments in </v>

1100
00:54:10.311 --> 00:54:13.791
<v Speaker 5>reaching out to the transcendent as </v>
<v Speaker 5>though it were possibly an embodied </v>

1101
00:54:14.431 --> 00:54:19.431
<v Speaker 5>thing that was a lot smarter than you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if the result of the experiment is </v>

1102
00:54:19.621 --> 00:54:24.621
<v Speaker 5>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you just feel embarrassed or dumb or </v>

1103
00:54:24.621 --> 00:54:24.621
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why the fuck am I praying?</v>

1104
00:54:24.621 --> 00:54:25.980
<v Speaker 5>Why there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then who cares?</v>

1105
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 5>You lose nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if the results of the experiment is </v>

1106
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:33.171
<v Speaker 5>even as a placebo effect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you begin to experience a shift in your </v>

1107
00:54:33.171 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 5>subjective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I think it's worth continuing those</v>

1108
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 5>experiments and seeing like how it </v>
<v Speaker 5>unfolds.</v>

1109
00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's take away that definition,</v>

1110
00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:47.440
<v Speaker 4>the placebo effect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you have in some way decided </v>

1111
00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:50.490
<v Speaker 4>to meditate towards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1112
00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:56.500
<v Speaker 4>towards the objective of communicating </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the great love that runs the </v>

1113
00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.950
<v Speaker 4>universe and somehow know that benefits </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1114
00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:59.830
<v Speaker 4>that's not a placebo factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1115
00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:04.860
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a shift in your consciousness </v>

1116
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.230
<v Speaker 4>whether or not it's validated by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>existence of the thing.</v>

1117
00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

1118
00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:12.580
<v Speaker 4>It's still a shift in your consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 4>through what appears to be a decision </v>

1119
00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.770
<v Speaker 4>appears to be a decision that you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>made to gravitate towards God.</v>

1120
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gravitate towards love.</v>

1121
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1122
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:23.950
<v Speaker 4>I've always had the problem whenever </v>
<v Speaker 4>people talk about intelligent design or </v>

1123
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:26.180
<v Speaker 4>a thing or a deity and this is my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

1124
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:30.980
<v Speaker 4>I automatically think of instead of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe,</v>

1125
00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:34.460
<v Speaker 4>like says that there's a universe and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's this thing over here,</v>

1126
00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.550
<v Speaker 4>like right next to the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1127
00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:41.580
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna sit here and make the </v>

1128
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:41.580
<v Speaker 4>universe.</v>

1129
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:41.840
<v Speaker 4>It's a stupid way that I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's completely my own.</v>

1130
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:47.320
<v Speaker 4>Like you can grow up or you can just </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of form these ideas in your head </v>

1131
00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:54.850
<v Speaker 4>about what a deity is and then those </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas can be little prisons when you try</v>

1132
00:55:55.671 --> 00:56:00.671
<v Speaker 4>to define the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my defining the universe as the </v>

1133
00:56:00.671 --> 00:56:03.761
<v Speaker 4>universe being this thing that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is created and it's sitting over </v>

1134
00:56:03.761 --> 00:56:05.390
<v Speaker 4>here in this other thing like is it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the universe?</v>

1135
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.700
<v Speaker 4>It does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it build it from the universe?</v>

1136
00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:09.480
<v Speaker 4>Like where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it next door?</v>

1137
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.560
<v Speaker 4>Have a condo next to the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what does it have?</v>

1138
00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Like how is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a part of the universe?</v>

1139
00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:20.260
<v Speaker 4>Is it or is it that the idea of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual is the wrong way to look at </v>

1140
00:56:23.471 --> 00:56:28.471
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That if you look at all the life on </v>

1141
00:56:28.471 --> 00:56:28.471
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1142
00:56:28.471 --> 00:56:32.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems that it was a lot of things in </v>

1143
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:32.430
<v Speaker 4>nature that are fractal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1144
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Insurance exists pretty much everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>you look and when they start looking at </v>

1145
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:41.010
<v Speaker 4>subatomic particles and you realize how </v>
<v Speaker 4>deep they can go and how small they can </v>

1146
00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:43.630
<v Speaker 4>measure things and then you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>size of the universe itself.</v>

1147
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:48.631
<v Speaker 4>You look at the size of galaxies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>black holes and just the vastness of </v>

1148
00:56:48.631 --> 00:56:52.771
<v Speaker 4>space and the ability to measure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they measure 13 point something </v>

1149
00:56:52.771 --> 00:56:54.670
<v Speaker 4>billion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>light years since the big bang.</v>

1150
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:58.350
<v Speaker 4>All that madness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that craziness that they're there.</v>

1151
00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:03.220
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think by looking all that and all that</v>

1152
00:57:03.221 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by looking at the vastness of all this,</v>

1153
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:12.420
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We define it in this way where there's a</v>

1154
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 4>dunkin over here and there's an aunt </v>
<v Speaker 4>over there and there's a,</v>

1155
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:22.250
<v Speaker 4>you know another animal over here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but inside of all of us are a bunch of </v>

1156
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.720
<v Speaker 4>different animals that are all little </v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny ecosystems.</v>

1157
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.380
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Inside every person.</v>

1158
00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:30.970
<v Speaker 4>There's not a single individual life </v>
<v Speaker 4>form that's a person.</v>

1159
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:35.110
<v Speaker 4>Every person requires all this life </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside of it.</v>

1160
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:38.320
<v Speaker 4>He lie living in your body and all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of gut flora,</v>

1161
00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:43.530
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of things that are not you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are you because you are a </v>

1162
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:47.560
<v Speaker 4>system or a system just like your </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood's a system.</v>

1163
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Just like the rain forest is the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure all the people in the rain </v>

1164
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:56.841
<v Speaker 4>forest that are hunting with bows and </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrows and really looking out for </v>

1165
00:57:56.841 --> 00:58:01.501
<v Speaker 4>Jaguars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they don't think of themselves </v>

1166
00:58:01.501 --> 00:58:01.501
<v Speaker 4>as a system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are life system.</v>

1167
00:58:01.501 --> 00:58:06.031
<v Speaker 4>That's how life balances itself out both</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your gut and in the jungle and in the</v>

1168
00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:11.620
<v Speaker 4>mountains of Montana and in the savannas</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Africa.</v>

1169
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:16.890
<v Speaker 4>These are all system life systems and </v>
<v Speaker 4>our vision of life systems is that this </v>

1170
00:58:17.561 --> 00:58:19.930
<v Speaker 4>life system is contained to this planet.</v>

1171
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:21.940
<v Speaker 4>This is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this planet,</v>

1172
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:27.300
<v Speaker 4>everything on this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right with the life system that's </v>

1173
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.510
<v Speaker 4>contained on this planet is all bathed </v>
<v Speaker 4>in oxygen,</v>

1174
00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all these gases and the elimination</v>

1175
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:36.241
<v Speaker 4>of those gases does not mean that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not connected to all the other things </v>

1176
00:58:36.241 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 4>that don't have those gases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take those gases away,</v>

1177
00:58:38.051 --> 00:58:41.410
<v Speaker 4>you go into space itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're still fucking connected to that.</v>

1178
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:46.650
<v Speaker 4>You're still a soup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a part of an infinite soup of </v>

1179
00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:50.011
<v Speaker 4>space and you just like a subatomic </v>
<v Speaker 4>particle that blinks in and out of </v>

1180
00:58:50.011 --> 00:58:52.630
<v Speaker 4>existence that they can measure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's moving and it's not moving.</v>

1181
00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:57.631
<v Speaker 4>It's there and it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just how small the life form of a planet</v>

1182
00:58:58.001 --> 00:59:02.710
<v Speaker 4>is in comparison to the mass of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe itself,</v>

1183
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:06.430
<v Speaker 4>which might very well be just like every</v>
<v Speaker 4>other fractal.</v>

1184
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.910
<v Speaker 4>The bigger you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more it represents the same patterns</v>

1185
00:59:09.911 --> 00:59:12.190
<v Speaker 4>over and over again in larger scales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1186
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:17.880
<v Speaker 4>The entire planet could be a subatomic </v>
<v Speaker 4>particle particle in the cell of an </v>

1187
00:59:19.151 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 4>organism that lives on another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your entire</v>

1188
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.280
<v Speaker 1>universe itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you want even go deeper into it.</v>

1189
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Could the entire universe could be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a synaptic pulse in the </v>

1190
00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 1>brain of an entity just having a dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>like so,</v>

1191
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:39.110
<v Speaker 1>which is the synaptic pulse of another </v>
<v Speaker 1>entity,</v>

1192
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's also having a dream and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger </v>

1193
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:44.200
<v Speaker 1>and there's no end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>

1194
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:44.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1195
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.750
<v Speaker 1>this is the one of the first and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerald tablet.</v>

1196
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:49.670
<v Speaker 1>This chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen that.</v>

1197
00:59:49.671 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 1>We've probably talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1198
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:53.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the emerald tablet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The emerald tablet.</v>

1199
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:55.460
<v Speaker 1>The book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

1200
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:59.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like this out chemical text that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this super condensed.</v>

1201
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 1>A really old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1202
01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:08.231
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucking old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to try to say that </v>

1203
01:00:08.231 --> 01:00:10.991
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a great name that I always say </v>

1204
01:00:10.991 --> 01:00:11.120
<v Speaker 1>it wrong and I always get corrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll say it wrong again.</v>

1205
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>The Emerald Tablet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1206
01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is of Hermes trimester or </v>

1207
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you open it up,</v>

1208
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:24.160
<v Speaker 1>open up the emerald tablet and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we can see what it says on it </v>

1209
01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>because it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

1210
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the first one?</v>

1211
01:00:26.601 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1212
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>To certain with error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly most true.</v>

1213
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:35.620
<v Speaker 1>So you just said number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which is below is like that which </v>

1214
01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>is above and that which is above is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which is below,</v>

1215
01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:41.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the miracles of only one thing.</v>

1216
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And as all things have been in arose </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one by the mediation of one.</v>

1217
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.710
<v Speaker 1>So all things have their birth from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing by adaptation.</v>

1218
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1219
01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>so it's all the shit that we were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1220
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had already figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1221
01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1222
01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

1223
01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>it's evidence that other people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been as high as we are enough to put it </v>

1224
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.660
<v Speaker 1>in a tablet.</v>

1225
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have podcasts.</v>

1226
01:01:04.641 --> 01:01:09.641
<v Speaker 1>They used to have to carve shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tablets a lot of work and write that </v>

1227
01:01:09.641 --> 01:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to find some emerald man.</v>

1228
01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>If you had to write all that on bark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1229
01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1230
01:01:14.631 --> 01:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>but this is kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1231
01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.820
<v Speaker 1>all these chemical ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like,</v>

1232
01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>it only makes sense that if we see these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fractals all throughout nature,</v>

1233
01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>we can observe them here that are ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can only observe subatomic </v>

1234
01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.980
<v Speaker 1>particles that that's the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

1235
01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Like it's probably infinitely smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that by the way.</v>

1236
01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:38.891
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's cool about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that as a translation by Isaac </v>

1237
01:01:38.891 --> 01:01:38.891
<v Speaker 1>Newton?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1238
01:01:38.891 --> 01:01:40.580
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was really into this shit man.</v>

1239
01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Like Newton was fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was doing was asexual too,</v>

1240
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:46.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was like these.</v>

1241
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say because he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's A.</v>

1242
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's a sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he was.</v>

1243
01:01:50.901 --> 01:01:55.901
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were fucking around with mercury a </v>

1244
01:01:55.901 --> 01:01:57.310
<v Speaker 1>lot and like it was like messing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their heads like,</v>

1245
01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

1246
01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1247
01:01:58.881 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1248
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgive me,</v>

1249
01:02:00.321 --> 01:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>everyone out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1250
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>but go to Newton and the occult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Back and look at the occult section.</v>

1251
01:02:04.611 --> 01:02:09.611
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a lot of people are aware </v>

1252
01:02:09.611 --> 01:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that Newton was deeply into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the occult.</v>

1253
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1254
01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those scientists in the deep </v>

1255
01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.841
<v Speaker 1>thinkers back then were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were checking on all sorts of </v>

1256
01:02:19.841 --> 01:02:19.841
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1257
01:02:19.841 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking</v>

1258
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 5>on it is one way to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>another way to put it is like,</v>

1259
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:28.400
<v Speaker 5>it may be that some of these people </v>
<v Speaker 5>figured out ways to directly communicate</v>

1260
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:30.740
<v Speaker 5>with this intelligence that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1261
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.610
<v Speaker 5>that I certainly believe in and there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>through mercury poisoning me.</v>

1262
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:35.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe mercury is the way to,</v>

1263
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fecal bacteria,</v>

1264
01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:41.440
<v Speaker 2>personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you were showing his personal </v>

1265
01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.181
<v Speaker 2>life stuff there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure I'm right because I </v>

1266
01:02:43.181 --> 01:02:45.551
<v Speaker 2>said that he was asexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read some weirdness about the way he </v>

1267
01:02:45.551 --> 01:02:47.060
<v Speaker 2>viewed sex and wasn't a Christian as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1268
01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:52.900
<v Speaker 5>A pretty hardcore Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what kind of Christian he </v>

1269
01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:52.930
<v Speaker 5>was like that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a whole lot.</v>

1270
01:02:52.931 --> 01:02:54.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean Christians and big words</v>

1271
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.720
<v Speaker 2>never married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although he was once.</v>

1272
01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.030
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once claimed that he is.</v>

1273
01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it was once it was claimed that</v>

1274
01:03:02.061 --> 01:03:04.040
<v Speaker 2>he was engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Newton never married.</v>

1275
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:09.390
<v Speaker 5>The widespread belief that he had died </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a virgin has been commented on by </v>

1276
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:13.210
<v Speaker 5>writers such as mathematician,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Charles Hudson,</v>

1277
01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:17.350
<v Speaker 5>probably a hater economist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Maynard Keynes,</v>

1278
01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.350
<v Speaker 5>keens hater and physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Carl Sagan.</v>

1279
01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:21.190
<v Speaker 5>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Carl?</v>

1280
01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.980
<v Speaker 5>Well just said that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just said fuck me.</v>

1281
01:03:23.981 --> 01:03:26.730
<v Speaker 5>You did say why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are you talking shit about nudity?</v>

1282
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Not even talking shit about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fascinated by individuals that </v>

1283
01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:34.870
<v Speaker 2>are brilliant beyond beyond the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Tesla who was also like,</v>

1284
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a weird guy sexually fell in love with a</v>

1285
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:42.351
<v Speaker 5>pigeon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the whole deal and that was </v>

1286
01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:43.290
<v Speaker 5>completely out of his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yet insanely brilliant.</v>

1287
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:47.220
<v Speaker 5>Beyond insanely brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what happens is like what</v>

1288
01:03:47.221 --> 01:03:49.740
<v Speaker 5>we in by the way we call them out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their minds,</v>

1289
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where meanwhile like,</v>

1290
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:53.550
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing that makes any fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>sense?</v>

1291
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:54.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1292
01:03:54.541 --> 01:03:56.760
<v Speaker 5>they're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got it all figured out.</v>

1293
01:03:56.761 --> 01:04:01.761
<v Speaker 5>Look what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting in a fucking podcast studio </v>

1294
01:04:01.761 --> 01:04:05.241
<v Speaker 5>talking about the infinite universe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like we're all like the idea that </v>

1295
01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:09.470
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a kind of a pattern that's </v>

1296
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.470
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1297
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.540
<v Speaker 5>that's the same pattern right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1298
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:14.520
<v Speaker 5>I think these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they uh,</v>

1299
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:16.850
<v Speaker 5>they do make contact and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1300
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.420
<v Speaker 5>we talk about like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1301
01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of my favorite,</v>

1302
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.640
<v Speaker 5>I think you told me this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

1303
01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:28.641
<v Speaker 5>one of my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Ufo conspiracy theories is that </v>

1304
01:04:28.641 --> 01:04:32.811
<v Speaker 5>Roswell was a real alien crash and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we can chart the evolution of technology</v>

1305
01:04:34.321 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 5>from the Roswell alien crash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That technology is actually some kind of</v>

1306
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:42.591
<v Speaker 5>alien virus that came in through what </v>
<v Speaker 5>Roswell and is now spreading through art</v>

1307
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.820
<v Speaker 5>through history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

1308
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:50.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the most popular conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory when it comes to the creation of </v>

1309
01:04:51.651 --> 01:04:54.290
<v Speaker 2>like the transistor at Bell </v>
<v Speaker 2>Laboratories,</v>

1310
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:59.291
<v Speaker 2>which is in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an air force base outside of </v>

1311
01:04:59.291 --> 01:05:02.741
<v Speaker 2>bell laboratories and bell laboratories </v>
<v Speaker 2>is supposed to be where they examined </v>

1312
01:05:02.741 --> 01:05:06.731
<v Speaker 2>all the parts that they took from grant </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Ufo and they flew it to Wright </v>

1313
01:05:06.731 --> 01:05:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Patterson air force base and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>took all the stuff out of it.</v>

1314
01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:10.460
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fantastic,</v>

1315
01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.600
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the many things I love about you </v>

1316
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.921
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you are like the library of Congress </v>

1317
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:20.111
<v Speaker 5>for this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas in my mind it's just like a </v>

1318
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:22.381
<v Speaker 5>murky swamp when I try to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like if I pull you can you can in </v>

1319
01:05:22.381 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 5>detail expound on these things you like </v>
<v Speaker 5>photographically memorize them.</v>

1320
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:31.801
<v Speaker 5>I think it's really cool and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>therefore I know that you were the one </v>

1321
01:05:31.801 --> 01:05:32.020
<v Speaker 5>who told me this and I think about it a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>

1322
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:37.021
<v Speaker 5>It's a really cool idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's funny because for us </v>

1323
01:05:37.021 --> 01:05:37.021
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1324
01:05:37.021 --> 01:05:41.670
<v Speaker 5>the way we would get technologies by a </v>
<v Speaker 5>metal craft shooting into the earth and </v>

1325
01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:43.540
<v Speaker 5>then we're going to take that and make </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology.</v>

1326
01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:48.541
<v Speaker 5>Whereas I think the real alien </v>
<v Speaker 5>encounters that happen throughout </v>

1327
01:05:48.541 --> 01:05:50.740
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Ufo encounters a Ufo for,</v>

1328
01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:52.930
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for lack of a better word,</v>

1329
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:57.990
<v Speaker 5>a Ufo flies through the consciousness of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isaac Newton and Isaac Newton.</v>

1330
01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:04.110
<v Speaker 5>Tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of the great inventors have this </v>

1331
01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 5>spontaneous idea what they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1332
01:06:04.451 --> 01:06:04.990
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

1333
01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:10.380
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so the alien technology is actually </v>

1334
01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Speaker 5>not something that is necessarily has to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be matter,</v>

1335
01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:16.740
<v Speaker 5>but starts as a thought form that then </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets sort of produced through the </v>

1336
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:22.060
<v Speaker 5>spinner rack of the particular inventor </v>
<v Speaker 5>that like allows it to come through </v>

1337
01:06:22.181 --> 01:06:22.840
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know</v>

1338
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.870
<v Speaker 4>this very thing in an interview today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the exact thing.</v>

1339
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:31.890
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we were talking about ideas </v>

1340
01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:35.250
<v Speaker 4>possibly being a life form or ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a form of like creativity and </v>

1341
01:06:36.461 --> 01:06:41.461
<v Speaker 4>ideas being a form of life that forces </v>
<v Speaker 4>the change on an environment.</v>

1342
01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:45.360
<v Speaker 4>Forces the change in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1343
01:06:45.361 --> 01:06:48.730
<v Speaker 4>in a civilization come from ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ideas.</v>

1344
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.070
<v Speaker 4>Creativity is responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

1345
01:06:51.071 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 4>including this microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet connection,</v>

1346
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:55.630
<v Speaker 4>the building we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything we're wearing,</v>

1347
01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:00.900
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The car you drove to get or all of it </v>

1348
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.630
<v Speaker 4>comes from the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from ideas from creativity,</v>

1349
01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:06.400
<v Speaker 4>and the initial burst of imagination </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes from where we don't know.</v>

1350
01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:11.401
<v Speaker 4>It might be a life form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be as much of a life form as a </v>

1351
01:07:11.401 --> 01:07:11.401
<v Speaker 4>physical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1352
01:07:11.401 --> 01:07:11.890
<v Speaker 4>like a person</v>

1353
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:13.700
<v Speaker 5>or it might be the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1354
01:07:13.701 --> 01:07:17.410
<v Speaker 5>So like a eric,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1355
01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:19.460
<v Speaker 5>you see in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's never actually happened to me,</v>

1356
01:07:19.461 --> 01:07:24.461
<v Speaker 5>but like a plane flies too low and like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fucking trees or like when a </v>

1357
01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:25.070
<v Speaker 5>helicopter is landing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trees blow.</v>

1358
01:07:25.071 --> 01:07:27.560
<v Speaker 5>People have to hold their hands over </v>
<v Speaker 5>their ears.</v>

1359
01:07:27.561 --> 01:07:32.561
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So maybe when these like transcendent </v>

1360
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:32.810
<v Speaker 5>objects enter into our time space </v>
<v Speaker 5>continuum,</v>

1361
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:38.290
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tons of people start having the very </v>

1362
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.451
<v Speaker 5>same idea or different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like brilliant ideas that are actually </v>

1363
01:07:40.451 --> 01:07:40.451
<v Speaker 5>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1364
01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:45.550
<v Speaker 5>the sort of impact that this craft as it</v>
<v Speaker 5>passes through our planet or passes near</v>

1365
01:07:46.841 --> 01:07:50.180
<v Speaker 5>us or whatever that means from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimension that they're in.</v>

1366
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:55.450
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's the impact that it has on </v>
<v Speaker 5>our consciousness is the sudden </v>

1367
01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:58.811
<v Speaker 5>origination of these incredible ideas </v>
<v Speaker 5>that end up creating massive shifts in </v>

1368
01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:04.541
<v Speaker 5>our society that that that's because if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at like Tesla where he got his </v>

1369
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:08.690
<v Speaker 5>ideas and I don't know about Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of great inventors there.</v>

1370
01:08:08.691 --> 01:08:13.691
<v Speaker 5>It's not like their ideas came as they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were sitting at the whiteboard </v>

1371
01:08:13.691 --> 01:08:15.020
<v Speaker 5>calculating and then they had a Eureka </v>
<v Speaker 5>moment,</v>

1372
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.760
<v Speaker 5>like they had dreams</v>

1373
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:21.850
<v Speaker 1>with Tusla literally was claiming that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was getting some information from </v>

1374
01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:21.850
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1375
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:24.220
<v Speaker 1>He thought he was getting information </v>
<v Speaker 1>from space.</v>

1376
01:08:24.221 --> 01:08:25.440
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1377
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're onto something John Lilly</v>

1378
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:34.240
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was so fucked up all the time </v>

1379
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>though because he knows space lily was </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting intramuscular ketamine and then</v>

1380
01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 1>climbing into an isolation tank all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1381
01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>LSD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation,</v>

1382
01:08:42.141 --> 01:08:44.960
<v Speaker 1>attending the academy and injections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was towards the end like,</v>

1383
01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1384
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I think in the beginning it was LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was LSD and there was like a.</v>

1385
01:08:49.701 --> 01:08:54.701
<v Speaker 1>and it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got to the point where he </v>

1386
01:08:54.701 --> 01:08:58.301
<v Speaker 1>recognized that maybe his physical body </v>
<v Speaker 1>was actually getting in the way of of </v>

1387
01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:03.220
<v Speaker 1>what he actually was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we just sort of wanted to mountain </v>

1388
01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:03.220
<v Speaker 1>the nothingness and it was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>troubled by this thing.</v>

1389
01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I've got to keep coming back to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking day.</v>

1390
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:11.330
<v Speaker 1>He's ready to get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as a suicidal way,</v>

1391
01:09:11.331 --> 01:09:15.690
<v Speaker 1>but just like the way that a a something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has molded has to discard.</v>

1392
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
<v Speaker 1>He so far removed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say gone because I don't</v>

1393
01:09:21.021 --> 01:09:26.021
<v Speaker 1>think he's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was so far removed from the </v>

1394
01:09:26.021 --> 01:09:30.911
<v Speaker 1>average human being in terms of like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre his paths of thinking had gone </v>

1395
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:37.930
<v Speaker 1>and what he was trying to accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to mean he's a pioneer </v>

1396
01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:38.510
<v Speaker 1>interspecies communication with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins,</v>

1397
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.720
<v Speaker 1>dolphins high on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would get high on acid.</v>

1398
01:09:41.721 --> 01:09:43.930
<v Speaker 1>He could eat me wandering asset to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins.</v>

1399
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that his research on </v>

1400
01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:50.960
<v Speaker 1>dolphins was all canceled because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl who was a scientist was jerking the</v>

1401
01:09:50.961 --> 01:09:54.320
<v Speaker 1>dolphin off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That got his research cancel.</v>

1402
01:09:54.321 --> 01:09:59.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the things that got the </v>

1403
01:09:59.321 --> 01:09:59.321
<v Speaker 1>the project where she was living with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphin.</v>

1404
01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I like this story you're telling me is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the story of the fucking luckiest </v>

1405
01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>dolphin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1406
01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.080
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like not only.</v>

1407
01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying if you get caught as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphin,</v>

1408
01:10:09.201 --> 01:10:14.201
<v Speaker 1>it's not great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are going to get caught by </v>

1409
01:10:14.201 --> 01:10:15.971
<v Speaker 1>the monkeys and you don't end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up in a place where they kept </v>

1410
01:10:15.971 --> 01:10:18.970
<v Speaker 1>giving you acid and jerking you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>US.</v>

1411
01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.900
<v Speaker 1>The sounds off makes when you drug them </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1412
01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if that Dolphin got into</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with a seaworld dolphin and</v>

1413
01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:29.810
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1414
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:32.120
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1415
01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.410
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You jerked off dude,</v>

1416
01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I'll do flips for fat kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this man.</v>

1417
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She jerked you off.</v>

1418
01:10:42.951 --> 01:10:43.820
<v Speaker 1>How often?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyday.</v>

1419
01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1420
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:47.480
<v Speaker 1>and she kind of likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have look good.</v>

1421
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how that got his </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments cancel because it's pleasure</v>

1422
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:56.950
<v Speaker 1>because we're so puritanical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like through a scientist.</v>

1423
01:10:56.951 --> 01:10:58.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's makes sense.</v>

1424
01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.610
<v Speaker 1>This dolphin was severely distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was horny all the time.</v>

1425
01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:06.880
<v Speaker 1>She would jerk the dolphin off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dolphin could relax and then they </v>

1426
01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.850
<v Speaker 1>will do it to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the dolphin was always horny because</v>

1427
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.960
<v Speaker 1>dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a kid,</v>

1428
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:10.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins,</v>

1429
01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:11.630
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an 18 year old kid,</v>

1430
01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:14.610
<v Speaker 1>18 year old kid with a boner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so distracted.</v>

1431
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:19.110
<v Speaker 4>Good luck trying to get them to do work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she just thought rationally.</v>

1432
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a scientist.</v>

1433
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:25.731
<v Speaker 4>She didn't think there was anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong with sex and she definitely </v>

1434
01:11:25.731 --> 01:11:29.181
<v Speaker 4>realized that there was a problem in her</v>
<v Speaker 4>research where this dolphin is dealing </v>

1435
01:11:29.181 --> 01:11:32.961
<v Speaker 4>with too much desire to get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she's whacked him off,</v>

1436
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.430
<v Speaker 4>whacked him off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and got back to work.</v>

1437
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:39.440
<v Speaker 4>That's a very smart and pragmatic way of</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at it.</v>

1438
01:11:39.441 --> 01:11:41.040
<v Speaker 4>The problem is she told people about it,</v>

1439
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.170
<v Speaker 1>like over cocktails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1440
01:11:44.171 --> 01:11:45.980
<v Speaker 1>is there a fucking boyfriend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ruined it.</v>

1441
01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.220
<v Speaker 1>He was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1442
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I jerked off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the Dolphin's name?</v>

1443
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:51.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

1444
01:11:51.821 --> 01:11:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Like when he came to visit her at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he started getting five,</v>

1445
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:59.080
<v Speaker 1>she was choking off the dolphin like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was looking at him.</v>

1446
01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

1447
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>

1448
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Imagine what a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is the dolphins,</v>

1449
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:11.550
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to get dolphins to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>human words.</v>

1450
01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:12.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they can't.</v>

1451
01:12:12.721 --> 01:12:15.750
<v Speaker 4>They don't have any lips so they can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>make those sounds.</v>

1452
01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:18.840
<v Speaker 4>So they would do their best to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>something close to it,</v>

1453
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.930
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have those high piercing,</v>

1454
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:24.420
<v Speaker 4>shrieking sort of sounds that they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>make.</v>

1455
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Do you know man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the.</v>

1456
01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:25.980
<v Speaker 4>She's</v>

1457
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:29.240
<v Speaker 1>even the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what would have happened.</v>

1458
01:12:29.241 --> 01:12:31.070
<v Speaker 1>If they could have gotten the dolphin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

1459
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:36.430
<v Speaker 1>they would have canceled it because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing you would say is off again </v>

1460
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:37.070
<v Speaker 1>off again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1461
01:12:37.071 --> 01:12:40.910
<v Speaker 1>what did it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the video?</v>

1462
01:12:40.911 --> 01:12:45.911
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to change the study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the video of the cro </v>

1463
01:12:45.911 --> 01:12:45.911
<v Speaker 1>telling someone,</v>

01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:08.900
<v Speaker 4>The cat tries to get away from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1487
01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:14.100
<v Speaker 4>the cat likes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Turns around real quick and the raven </v>

1488
01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:16.501
<v Speaker 4>jumps away and then the raven flies over</v>
<v Speaker 4>to another cat is on another rooftop </v>

1489
01:14:16.501 --> 01:14:16.501
<v Speaker 4>sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How he does this.</v>

1490
01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:21.660
<v Speaker 4>He literally starts a fight between </v>
<v Speaker 4>these two just hanging out like,</v>

1491
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn fucking bored.</v>

1492
01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.800
<v Speaker 4>So he flies over there and fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's not a raven,</v>

1493
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.970
<v Speaker 4>is that a raven?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Crow Crow.</v>

1494
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.830
<v Speaker 4>But why is it looked wide?</v>

1495
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:34.710
<v Speaker 4>Is that the reflection of the sun on him</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now could be at.</v>

1496
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:36.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

1497
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.160
<v Speaker 4>so he flies over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets near the cat and he irritates </v>

1498
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:41.620
<v Speaker 4>the cat and then he flies over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

1499
01:14:41.621 --> 01:14:42.530
<v Speaker 4>gets near the other cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1500
01:14:42.531 --> 01:14:44.410
<v Speaker 4>he's getting behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He irritates him.</v>

1501
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.040
<v Speaker 4>He fucks with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking with both from literally </v>

1502
01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:50.040
<v Speaker 4>like he's fucking with him on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1503
01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.070
<v Speaker 4>he's getting really close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>

1504
01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 4>It backs up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's getting really close.</v>

1505
01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:54.730
<v Speaker 4>He fucks with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1506
01:14:54.731 --> 01:14:57.430
<v Speaker 4>he's literally fucking with that cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

1507
01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.350
<v Speaker 4>He keeps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He keeps poking at him.</v>

1508
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.930
<v Speaker 4>He's getting right behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cat turns around a swing at him,</v>

1509
01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:07.050
<v Speaker 4>so he's agitating the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cat jumps on the other and he flies </v>

1510
01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:09.610
<v Speaker 4>over there and he's often away from them</v>
<v Speaker 4>while they're duking it out.</v>

1511
01:15:09.611 --> 01:15:12.970
<v Speaker 4>They fall off the fucking roof,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beating the fuck out of each other.</v>

1512
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.120
<v Speaker 4>He flies to the ground and he's watching</v>
<v Speaker 4>them like he literally instigated and </v>

1513
01:15:19.211 --> 01:15:22.180
<v Speaker 4>started this fight that he's prodding </v>
<v Speaker 4>them while they're fighting.</v>

1514
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:28.570
<v Speaker 4>They fall into a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're beating the shit out of each </v>

1515
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:28.570
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1516
01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:30.610
<v Speaker 4>That birds like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1517
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.640
<v Speaker 4>what's the bird in their ear with them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crazy.</v>

1518
01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:36.430
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1519
01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.990
<v Speaker 5>And that's the bird is the devil to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Raven.</v>

1520
01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so raven.</v>

1521
01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:42.800
<v Speaker 5>Ravens are always taught in BC Tannic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1522
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.850
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1523
01:15:43.851 --> 01:15:47.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean I guess are there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like a harbinger of doom.</v>

1524
01:15:47.931 --> 01:15:49.490
<v Speaker 5>They're called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a great word for it.</v>

1525
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:53.600
<v Speaker 5>Psycho pumps is the word for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like animals that appear,</v>

1526
01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:58.190
<v Speaker 5>I think before someone's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like crows.</v>

1527
01:15:58.191 --> 01:16:00.350
<v Speaker 5>There's a whole bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's Edgar Allen Poe.</v>

1528
01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.010
<v Speaker 5>The Raven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Raven.</v>

1529
01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:03.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Raven that.</v>

1530
01:16:03.501 --> 01:16:04.070
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1531
01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:06.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read an analysis of what that was.</v>

1532
01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:08.210
<v Speaker 5>It's like very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very fucking sad,</v>

1533
01:16:08.211 --> 01:16:09.410
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Check the dump.</v>

1534
01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.060
<v Speaker 5>They're never going to be happy again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1535
01:16:11.061 --> 01:16:12.260
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea is like,</v>

1536
01:16:12.261 --> 01:16:17.261
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're never going to be fucking happy </v>

1537
01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:17.261
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like ever.</v>

1538
01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:18.110
<v Speaker 5>Like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like happiness is a dream.</v>

1539
01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:21.010
<v Speaker 5>Give it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reality is that life is,</v>

1540
01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the usual kind of fucking drivel </v>

1541
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 5>that comes out of Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't mean to say trivial,</v>

1542
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:29.690
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes the old happy juice isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming out of the synaptic vesicles.</v>

1543
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.510
<v Speaker 5>Vesicles way it should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you translate that.</v>

1544
01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.720
<v Speaker 5>It's like instead of recognizing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>your engine is running low on coolant,</v>

1545
01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:43.460
<v Speaker 5>you think that all cars in the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>must just run in some shitty way.</v>

1546
01:16:43.461 --> 01:16:44.450
<v Speaker 5>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1547
01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:47.300
<v Speaker 5>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the most beautiful things to</v>

1548
01:16:47.301 --> 01:16:51.680
<v Speaker 5>realize while simultaneously being one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the most depressing things to realize</v>

1549
01:16:51.681 --> 01:16:55.790
<v Speaker 5>which is that so much of what human </v>
<v Speaker 5>happiness is,</v>

1550
01:16:56.090 --> 01:17:01.090
<v Speaker 5>is coming from these synaptic vesicles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these little bubbles of Serotonin that </v>

1551
01:17:03.471 --> 01:17:06.550
<v Speaker 5>are getting dripped into our brains </v>
<v Speaker 5>according to our,</v>

1552
01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.930
<v Speaker 5>what activities we are partaking in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1553
01:17:08.931 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 5>and so</v>

1554
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.140
<v Speaker 1>some people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The drip isn't happening.</v>

1555
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:16.340
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that it's probably safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that for Edgar Allen Poe,</v>

1556
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:21.970
<v Speaker 1>if his brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could say the synaptic vesicles </v>

1557
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.930
<v Speaker 1>or the vagina of the human brain than </v>
<v Speaker 1>his word dry,</v>

1558
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:29.020
<v Speaker 1>arid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just fucking chafed synaptic </v>

1559
01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:35.021
<v Speaker 1>vesicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was depressed and nothing's coming </v>

1560
01:17:35.021 --> 01:17:35.021
<v Speaker 1>out man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1561
01:17:35.021 --> 01:17:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I know what that's like because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1562
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.900
<v Speaker 1>anyone who's taken Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've taken Mtma and it felt the </v>

1563
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.681
<v Speaker 1>Mtma related depression and extrapolate </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that three straight years of that </v>

1564
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.480
<v Speaker 1>unrelenting numbness that comes when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have enough of the happy juice up </v>

1565
01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:58.451
<v Speaker 1>there and then you're going to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing shit like never more.</v>

1566
01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't help that,</v>

1567
01:18:00.221 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fucking wife.</v>

1568
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I think at one point she had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the name of that terrible </v>

1569
01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:08.800
<v Speaker 1>disease?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuberculosis.</v>

1570
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it was tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has some horrible lung disease and I</v>

1571
01:18:13.281 --> 01:18:18.281
<v Speaker 1>think she was playing piano at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a party that he threw and she just like </v>

1572
01:18:19.551 --> 01:18:24.551
<v Speaker 1>exploded blood all over the piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she just caught the big spray of </v>

1573
01:18:24.551 --> 01:18:26.880
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had a rough life at Graland Po.</v>

1574
01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1575
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:33.140
<v Speaker 1>he had a crazy go that to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes depression.</v>

1576
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't help,</v>

1577
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:37.700
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing hinders your happiness.</v>

1578
01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Like crashing your system every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ugh.</v>

1579
01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially slowly poisoning </v>

1580
01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:46.940
<v Speaker 1>yourself if you're really a in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking all the time.</v>

1581
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>

1582
01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not fucking good.</v>

1583
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:54.710
<v Speaker 1>There's so many better options out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it and on that Pod,</v>

1584
01:18:54.711 --> 01:18:58.500
<v Speaker 1>that's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>

1585
01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that people would benefit </v>

1586
01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:07.730
<v Speaker 1>more from a two for marijuana instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>making you more confident,</v>

1587
01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.980
<v Speaker 1>makes less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you more alert,</v>

1588
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:13.040
<v Speaker 1>more aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more objective.</v>

1589
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:16.280
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you a nicer drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nicer,</v>

1590
01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:20.030
<v Speaker 1>like in terms of its effects in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavior of people that are on it.</v>

1591
01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Just a way nicer drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1592
01:19:21.621 --> 01:19:26.621
<v Speaker 1>I tell you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all this fucking shit coming out </v>

1593
01:19:26.621 --> 01:19:31.421
<v Speaker 1>about Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that really bummed me out the </v>

1594
01:19:31.421 --> 01:19:34.991
<v Speaker 1>most man was that fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like anti marijuana like that </v>

1595
01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:35.780
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1596
01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:39.380
<v Speaker 1>that really gets to me man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like God damn it because like I was</v>

1597
01:19:39.381 --> 01:19:42.980
<v Speaker 1>going to do for her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the pragmatic Clinton vote,</v>

1598
01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:43.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1599
01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:47.960
<v Speaker 1>well trump seems like a fun guy to hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with at a party.</v>

1600
01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Don't want him around my nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

1601
01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Like Hillary Clinton seems like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1602
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:53.360
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1603

<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1604
01:19:55.330 --> 01:20:00.330
<v Speaker 1>God just like the ultimate politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the super evolved ultimate flower </v>

1605
01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:03.980
<v Speaker 1>on the Goddamn Po.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barbara Bush of politics.</v>

1606
01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Like she's but God saw fuck out outright</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fucking check</v>

1607
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like God damn it.</v>

1608
01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:12.030

<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gary Johnson.</v>

1610
01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Gary Johnson makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1611
01:20:16.201 --> 01:20:21.201
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't know shit about Aleppo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't know shit about a lot of </v>

1612
01:20:21.201 --> 01:20:25.881
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's going to have to learn </v>

1613
01:20:25.881 --> 01:20:25.881
<v Speaker 4>if he becomes president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you really think that?</v>

1614
01:20:25.881 --> 01:20:27.330
<v Speaker 4>Is that really your intention?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's who you're endorsing,</v>

1615
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:30.330
<v Speaker 4>endorsing him more than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's who you're going to vote for.</v>

1616
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.790
<v Speaker 4>I'd vote outright in you about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

1617
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:37.610
<v Speaker 4>Don't write in me right in back at your </v>
<v Speaker 4>ranch is right in back at your answer.</v>

1618
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:39.930
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm writing in reading </v>
<v Speaker 4>impact trenches.</v>

1619
01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:43.290
<v Speaker 4>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I do think that,</v>

1620
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:48.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can we talk about this nonsense so long,</v>

1621
01:20:48.451 --> 01:20:53.451
<v Speaker 4>but her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her insistence on working towards </v>

1622
01:20:53.451 --> 01:20:57.230
<v Speaker 4>marijuana and making sure that marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 4>stays a schedule one drug.</v>

1623
01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1624
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.590
<v Speaker 4>It's not just disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's traitorous or a set of word.</v>

1625
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of big.</v>

1626
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's big.</v>

1627
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Traitorous make it better word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not traders.</v>

1628
01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:14.100
<v Speaker 4>Shitty trader is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could say traitorous sounds wrong.</v>

1629
01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:19.150
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a dinosaur treatise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton trade a syllabus,</v>

1630
01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:25.970
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just not doing your job to </v>

1631
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:29.430
<v Speaker 4>serve and protect us and to lead us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not only is it not doing your job,</v>

1632
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:34.880
<v Speaker 4>it's doing the opposite of your job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're doing something for profit and </v>

1633
01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:38.961
<v Speaker 4>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've made a connection and through </v>

1634
01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:41.540
<v Speaker 4>influence you've decided to do something</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know for sure doesn't help </v>

1635
01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:42.600
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It keeps people in jail.</v>

1636
01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:45.480
<v Speaker 4>That's all you need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The key people in jail part,</v>

1637
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:50.870
<v Speaker 4>it's all you need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More people were arrested from marijuana</v>

1638
01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:57.380
<v Speaker 4>than for all violent crimes combined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so fucked up.</v>

1639
01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:03.020
<v Speaker 4>It's insane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the problem is that it's a </v>

1640
01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.721
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a giant business and arresting </v>

1641
01:22:05.721 --> 01:22:08.160
<v Speaker 4>people and putting people in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping people in jail,</v>

1642
01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 4>enforcing laws.</v>

1643
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:12.000
<v Speaker 4>There's a business in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a huge business.</v>

1644
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.220
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to think of it as a huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>business,</v>

1645
01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:19.610
<v Speaker 4>but anytime a huge business drops off </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's going to drop off whoever </v>

1646
01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:20.190
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're in that business,</v>

1647
01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.590
<v Speaker 4>get out now because you're like </v>
<v Speaker 4>blockbuster video.</v>

1648
01:22:22.591 --> 01:22:24.870
<v Speaker 4>You motherfuckers right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to make it.</v>

1649
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.460
<v Speaker 4>You mean the prison business?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1650
01:22:26.461 --> 01:22:29.640
<v Speaker 4>the prison business and the drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>business,</v>

1651
01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:34.940
<v Speaker 4>that dea business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the arresting people for marijuana </v>

1652
01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:38.001
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody who's in the arresting people </v>

1653
01:22:38.001 --> 01:22:39.020
<v Speaker 4>for marijuana business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might as well be selling Betamax.</v>

1654
01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:41.190
<v Speaker 4>I hope you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1655
01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.450
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

1656
01:22:42.451 --> 01:22:47.451
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't keep arresting people for </v>

1657
01:22:47.451 --> 01:22:47.790
<v Speaker 4>something that everybody does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I had to give it up without.</v>

1658
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:51.500
<v Speaker 5>If she's saying if flight the next </v>
<v Speaker 5>president,</v>

1659
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:56.510
<v Speaker 5>she's definitely gonna be the next </v>
<v Speaker 5>president is saying that she's going to </v>

1660
01:22:56.510 --> 01:23:00.731
<v Speaker 5>continue this prohibition to the bankers</v>
<v Speaker 5>that were paying her to give a </v>

1661
01:23:00.731 --> 01:23:05.060
<v Speaker 5>presentation then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is the person Obama's endorsing</v>

1662
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 5>and Bernie Sanders is endorsing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like that.</v>

1663
01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1664
01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:10.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1665
01:23:10.421 --> 01:23:12.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The more I look into all this shit,</v>

1666
01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:15.600
<v Speaker 5>the more confused I become.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I start.</v>

1667
01:23:15.601 --> 01:23:17.590
<v Speaker 5>I tried to like go a little deeper into </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1668
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:22.830
<v Speaker 5>like looking up the Clinton Foundation </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then like checking out the charity </v>

1669
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:27.091
<v Speaker 5>websites that like talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Clinton found that or give it a rating </v>

1670
01:23:27.091 --> 01:23:27.091
<v Speaker 5>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

1671
01:23:27.091 --> 01:23:31.830
<v Speaker 5>well it definitely doesn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of misinformation </v>

1672
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:33.700
<v Speaker 5>coming from both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the most,</v>

1673
01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:39.210
<v Speaker 5>the one I trust only because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a left leaning super liberal </v>

1674
01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 5>website.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The huffington post called,</v>

1675
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:45.270
<v Speaker 5>there's an article in there saying that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton Foundation's gross is </v>

1676
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:49.021
<v Speaker 5>the name of the article and basically it</v>
<v Speaker 5>says the foundation itself,</v>

1677
01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:54.370
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the tax returns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>since it's an operating foundation,</v>

1678
01:23:54.371 --> 01:23:59.371
<v Speaker 5>all the bullshit of they're only giving </v>
<v Speaker 5>like six percent or 10 percent of the </v>

1679
01:23:59.371 --> 01:24:01.840
<v Speaker 5>money to charities is wrong because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>are doing shit.</v>

1680
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:05.020
<v Speaker 5>They are doing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That foundation goes into the world that</v>

1681
01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:10.080
<v Speaker 5>has worked with AIDS.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can't villainize the entire </v>

1682
01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.910
<v Speaker 5>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what's fucked up is the Clinton's,</v>

1683
01:24:12.911 --> 01:24:16.870
<v Speaker 5>when they go to give talks to people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>then donate to the foundation,</v>

1684
01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:20.470
<v Speaker 5>they get paid and that money separate </v>
<v Speaker 5>from what goes to the foundation.</v>

1685
01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:25.740
<v Speaker 5>So when Hillary Clinton goes and gives a</v>
<v Speaker 5>speech and then they donate to the </v>

1686
01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:30.151
<v Speaker 5>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the amount they pay her for the speech </v>

1687
01:24:30.151 --> 01:24:33.150
<v Speaker 5>doesn't go to the foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that goes to the Clintons when Bill </v>

1688
01:24:33.150 --> 01:24:35.410
<v Speaker 5>Clinton and it's hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 5>of dollars for an hour speech.</v>

1689
01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1690
01:24:36.311 --> 01:24:41.311
<v Speaker 5>So that's where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where the corruption is and </v>

1691
01:24:41.311 --> 01:24:44.821
<v Speaker 5>apparently there used to be some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>law that if there was even the </v>

1692
01:24:44.821 --> 01:24:48.781
<v Speaker 5>appearance of corruption and politics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you had to change your operating </v>

1693
01:24:48.781 --> 01:24:52.831
<v Speaker 5>procedures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that apparently got changed in the </v>

1694
01:24:52.831 --> 01:24:52.831
<v Speaker 5>Supreme Court or something.</v>

1695
01:24:52.831 --> 01:24:53.380
<v Speaker 5>So now you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could.</v>

1696
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking crazy.</v>

1697
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:57.940
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like last night at the debates man,</v>

1698
01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:01.750
<v Speaker 5>when uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they asked her about the Wiki leaks</v>

1699
01:25:01.751 --> 01:25:03.100
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is real,</v>

1700
01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:05.650
<v Speaker 5>like it's however the information got </v>
<v Speaker 5>obtained,</v>

1701
01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:08.650
<v Speaker 5>it really doesn't fucking matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>

1702
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:12.890
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the issue is the information itself,</v>

1703
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.350
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you watch that faint where she's</v>

1704
01:25:17.351 --> 01:25:19.650
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got it from Putin,</v>

1705
01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:22.120
<v Speaker 5>it was amazing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like,</v>

1706
01:25:22.121 --> 01:25:23.350
<v Speaker 5>God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like trump,</v>

1707
01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:27.580
<v Speaker 5>there's a really great chance right </v>
<v Speaker 5>there for you to be like,</v>

1708
01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:31.870
<v Speaker 5>did Putin send those emails?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was He writing your emails?</v>

1709
01:25:31.871 --> 01:25:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Because let's talk about the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>emails and then we'll talk about Russia.</v>

1710
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:37.450
<v Speaker 5>But he liked spun off on this weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1711
01:25:37.451 --> 01:25:39.160
<v Speaker 5>It was a really like associate baited </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1712
01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.810
<v Speaker 5>She fucking baited him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's a master thought.</v>

1713
01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 5>She's so good at playing him.</v>

<v Speaker 5>She's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing to watch though.</v>

1715
01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.390
<v Speaker 5>He's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she's doing it masterful.</v>

1718
01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:57.520
<v Speaker 5>comfort that we have is that this person</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's going to become president is very,</v>

1719
01:25:57.521 --> 01:26:01.000
<v Speaker 5>very sophisticated when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>manipulating people.</v>

1720
01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:04.760
<v Speaker 5>Sophisticated in a way that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Kind of is the heaven's gate dude that </v>

<v Speaker 5>he liked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's Kinda the same outfits.</v>

1731
01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to get a picture of it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.400
<v Speaker 5>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she keeps looking at the camera and </v>

<v Speaker 5>like it felt like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She knows I'm trying to like do this </v>

1736
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:49.280

<v Speaker 5>I've never seen anybody throw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I daggers.</v>

1738
01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:55.490
<v Speaker 5>Like Hillary Clinton camp man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

1739
01:26:55.970 --> 01:27:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that she's employing a </v>

1740
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:03.941
<v Speaker 2>different strategy now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because their first strategy with him </v>

1741
01:27:03.941 --> 01:27:06.290
<v Speaker 2>was to kind of laugh when he would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous shit and almost like take the</v>

1742
01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:11.291
<v Speaker 2>high road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now she's gone on the attack more </v>

1743
01:27:11.291 --> 01:27:14.240
<v Speaker 2>and now Clinton and Melania Donald shake</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands before.</v>

1744
01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's all this,</v>

1745
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:18.080
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1746
01:27:18.081 --> 01:27:23.081
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different sort of vibe now </v>

1747
01:27:23.081 --> 01:27:25.811
<v Speaker 2>between the two of them as it ramps up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was like super effective </v>

1748
01:27:25.811 --> 01:27:28.070
<v Speaker 2>though and just taking the moral high </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground her.</v>

1749
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean in terms of debate tactic </v>

1750
01:27:33.130 --> 01:27:33.190
<v Speaker 2>where here's trump my imagined.</v>

1751
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:38.310
<v Speaker 5>I imagine like what it trumps strategy </v>
<v Speaker 5>meeting looks like is like people </v>

1752
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:39.310
<v Speaker 5>sitting around eating cheeseburgers </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing blow.</v>

1753
01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:41.110
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1754
01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:46.380
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump's already making deals for his </v>

1755
01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:46.380
<v Speaker 5>next TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1756
01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:46.380
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

1757
01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:46.510
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:48.070
<v Speaker 5>The president thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't care.</v>

1759
01:27:48.071 --> 01:27:48.910
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1760
01:27:48.911 --> 01:27:51.880
<v Speaker 5>he probably is getting fucking calls </v>
<v Speaker 5>from poot and they're laughing.</v>

1761
01:27:51.881 --> 01:27:52.340
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>alright,</v>

1762
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:53.180
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go,</v>

1763
01:27:53.181 --> 01:27:55.160
<v Speaker 5>we gotta do this stupid fucking debate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1764
01:27:55.420 --> 01:28:00.420
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think if you look at a Hillary </v>

1765
01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:03.250
<v Speaker 5>Clinton strategy meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's like sitting in some kind of like </v>

1766
01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:06.640
<v Speaker 5>God dome surrounded by CIA agents who </v>
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>

1767
01:28:06.641 --> 01:28:11.110
<v Speaker 5>we've done a thermal analysis of Donald </v>
<v Speaker 5>and here are the moments that you should</v>

1768
01:28:11.111 --> 01:28:16.111
<v Speaker 5>hold still and at this moment we </v>
<v Speaker 5>recommend that you say this and then </v>

1769
01:28:16.111 --> 01:28:20.911
<v Speaker 5>this and then this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she goes through the hole that </v>

1770
01:28:20.911 --> 01:28:20.911
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1771
01:28:20.911 --> 01:28:23.880
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely gonna bring up the Wiki </v>
<v Speaker 5>leaks here according to our </v>

1772
01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.971
<v Speaker 5>psychological analysis and also some of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the DNA data we got from one of the </v>

1773
01:28:26.971 --> 01:28:28.900
<v Speaker 5>cheeseburger crumbs that fell out of his</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking mouth.</v>

1774
01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:33.010
<v Speaker 5>And one of these rallies is like he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to react to this and like she just</v>

1775
01:28:33.011 --> 01:28:37.000
<v Speaker 5>memorizes it and it kind of alien way </v>
<v Speaker 5>sits there and just does it.</v>

1776
01:28:37.001 --> 01:28:39.610
<v Speaker 5>Like the fighters I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember when you were like,</v>

1777
01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:44.640
<v Speaker 5>when I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't know at the time I </v>

1778
01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.711
<v Speaker 5>didn't know anything about fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you were explaining how like </v>

1779
01:28:46.711 --> 01:28:50.610
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have these insanely deep combos if </v>

1780
01:28:50.610 --> 01:28:54.151
<v Speaker 5>this person does this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have all these moves like 19 moves </v>

1781
01:28:54.151 --> 01:28:56.530
<v Speaker 5>deep that like there's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think she's like that.</v>

1782
01:28:56.790 --> 01:29:01.790
<v Speaker 5>Like she has like if he does this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do this and if he does that then </v>

1783
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.790
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1784
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.790
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then that.</v>

1785
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 5>And then that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then that.</v>

1786
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:07.370
<v Speaker 5>And they've done it all with like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>government team of psychologists who </v>

1787
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:09.480
<v Speaker 5>fully analyzed him and know how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking set him off.</v>

1788
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.720
<v Speaker 5>And she did it last night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She did it in every single fucking </v>

1789
01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:15.630
<v Speaker 5>debate and it's not like she's the one </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's coming up with that.</v>

1790

<v Speaker 5>She's got a team of the smartest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most manipulative people on planet earth</v>

1791
01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:25.620

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.340
<v Speaker 5>You guys failing and I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I have a feeling.</v>

1827
01:30:41.341 --> 01:30:42.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know for sure,</v>

1828
01:30:42.781 --> 01:30:46.470
<v Speaker 5>but my guess would be that if you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 5>to find people who said,</v>

1829
01:30:46.471 --> 01:30:47.910
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump grabbed my pussy,</v>

1830
01:30:47.911 --> 01:30:49.440
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't be that fucking hard.</v>

1831
01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:54.800
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you're looking for bigfoot</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty easy to run them down I guess,</v>

1832
01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.540
<v Speaker 5>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it wasn't like a hard thing to do.</v>

1833
01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:06.630
<v Speaker 5>It's a breadcrumb trail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very simple,</v>

1834
01:31:06.631 --> 01:31:11.631
<v Speaker 5>very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's like when you realize like </v>

1835
01:31:11.631 --> 01:31:14.421
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you start feeling this weird </v>

1836
01:31:14.421 --> 01:31:14.421
<v Speaker 5>compassion for him and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God.</v>

1837
01:31:14.421 --> 01:31:18.171
<v Speaker 5>Even with all his like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maliciousness and like weird </v>

1838
01:31:18.171 --> 01:31:18.300
<v Speaker 5>pervasiveness and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately he,</v>

1839
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:20.310
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like a fucking bowl.</v>

1840
01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:25.580
<v Speaker 5>They got put into a Goddamn ring with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>matador has been doing this kind of bowl</v>

1841
01:31:25.781 --> 01:31:28.880
<v Speaker 5>fighting for like 30 fucking years for </v>
<v Speaker 5>better,</v>

1842
01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:30.870
<v Speaker 5>for worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's,</v>

1843
01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:34.260
<v Speaker 5>we're watching what we saw last night I </v>
<v Speaker 5>guess.</v>

1844
01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:39.380
<v Speaker 4>And what's interesting about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big part of what's interesting about </v>

1845
01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:40.980
<v Speaker 4>it is he came really close to women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1846
01:31:40.981 --> 01:31:45.981
<v Speaker 4>he still in the neighborhood of winning </v>
<v Speaker 4>plus or minus 11 points or what that </v>

1847
01:31:46.321 --> 01:31:51.321
<v Speaker 4>means is between now and how many days </v>
<v Speaker 4>do we have until the election is 21 </v>

1848
01:31:51.321 --> 01:31:52.080
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen man,</v>

1849
01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 4>lot of crazy shit can happen in 21 days </v>
<v Speaker 4>to shift people's opinion.</v>

1850
01:31:56.890 --> 01:31:58.510
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but apparently again,</v>

1851
01:31:58.511 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 5>from all the now look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1852
01:32:00.101 --> 01:32:00.910
<v Speaker 5>I try to get it right.</v>

1853
01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.170
<v Speaker 4>Don't say any of that stuff because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even know if it's true.</v>

1854
01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:08.380
<v Speaker 4>They're all just talking on TV and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>brainwash and all of us to let us think </v>

1855
01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:09.680
<v Speaker 4>that they know who the fuck's voting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not talking to you.</v>

1856
01:32:09.681 --> 01:32:11.420
<v Speaker 4>They're not talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not talking to Jamie.</v>

1857
01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.900
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they know nearly.</v>

1858
01:32:14.150 --> 01:32:17.510
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a massive cover up at</v>

1859
01:32:17.511 --> 01:32:22.511
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of what happens in the </v>

1860
01:32:22.511 --> 01:32:24.560
<v Speaker 4>polls does reflect how the United States</v>
<v Speaker 4>feels,</v>

1861
01:32:24.561 --> 01:32:28.580
<v Speaker 4>but there's no way it could be 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent accurate because it's not.</v>

1862
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:31.550
<v Speaker 4>It's not pulling 100 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1863
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:36.910
<v Speaker 4>And I think part of the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 4>those poles is once you read the results</v>

1864
01:32:37.101 --> 01:32:40.130
<v Speaker 4>of the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton is a head by 16 percent.</v>

1865
01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:41.690
<v Speaker 4>Everybody just starts saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1866
01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.360
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton's got it in the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen the recent polls.</v>

1867
01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:48.680
<v Speaker 4>And you even start thinking in voting </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards that goal.</v>

1868
01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.080
<v Speaker 4>Like people who might have voted for </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump go,</v>

1869
01:32:51.081 --> 01:32:53.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to waste my vote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be on the winning team.</v>

1870
01:32:53.121 --> 01:32:54.320
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of that</v>

1871
01:32:54.710 --> 01:32:55.940
<v Speaker 5>I think really though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1872
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:59.900
<v Speaker 5>like if people like what that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>affected that actually has his people,</v>

1873
01:32:59.901 --> 01:33:02.360
<v Speaker 5>he might have been terrified of trump </v>
<v Speaker 5>being president.</v>

1874
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:04.430
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's already had by 12 percent,</v>

1875
01:33:04.431 --> 01:33:06.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to fucking drive out to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the polls to vote.</v>

1876
01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:11.620
<v Speaker 5>They don't come out to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it would serve her more if there </v>

1877
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:11.840
<v Speaker 5>was some collusion between her and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>media,</v>

1878
01:33:11.841 --> 01:33:15.110
<v Speaker 5>which according to the Podesta emails,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there certainly has been there.</v>

1879
01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:18.260
<v Speaker 5>Like you've got the of the editor of </v>
<v Speaker 5>politico,</v>

1880
01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:20.030
<v Speaker 5>you saw that one where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it,</v>

1881
01:33:20.031 --> 01:33:21.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm a hack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1882
01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy,</v>

1883
01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:23.600
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

1884
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:25.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if was the editor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember which guy was it.</v>

1885
01:33:25.761 --> 01:33:30.761
<v Speaker 5>The point is I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a pretty safe bet that </v>

1886
01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:36.520
<v Speaker 5>she's going to be the next president and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that that data that we're </v>

1887
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:41.090
<v Speaker 5>getting is necessarily some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>collusion between</v>

1888
01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:43.860
<v Speaker 4>not saying it's collusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying it affects the event itself.</v>

1889
01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that even if you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimately objectively pull a group of</v>

1890
01:33:47.941 --> 01:33:49.650
<v Speaker 4>people and you get a result from that </v>
<v Speaker 4>pole,</v>

1891
01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.200
<v Speaker 4>it's not really representative of 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent of the people.</v>

1892
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:57.350
<v Speaker 4>But once you start thinking that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and once people start deciding that it </v>

1893
01:33:57.350 --> 01:34:01.221
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has a massive impact on how people </v>

1894
01:34:01.221 --> 01:34:01.221
<v Speaker 4>vote.</v>

1895
01:34:01.221 --> 01:34:01.221
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta tell you man,</v>

1896
01:34:01.221 --> 01:34:05.330
<v Speaker 5>before the fucking buses go riding </v>
<v Speaker 5>through varying neighborhoods and </v>

1897
01:34:07.171 --> 01:34:12.171
<v Speaker 5>scooping up illegal immigrants in before</v>
<v Speaker 5>that fucking abortion cops start </v>

1898
01:34:13.091 --> 01:34:18.091
<v Speaker 5>arresting fucking women for getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>abortions and before all the insanity </v>

1899
01:34:18.211 --> 01:34:21.330
<v Speaker 5>that like apparently he's going to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts happening,</v>

1900
01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.500
<v Speaker 5>that he trump that if he gets elected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he gets to the metal arresting people</v>

1901
01:34:25.501 --> 01:34:26.820
<v Speaker 5>for abortions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1902
01:34:26.821 --> 01:34:29.050
<v Speaker 5>He said that women should be punished </v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

1903
01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.710
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the main,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of his many fuck ups as he was like,</v>

1904
01:34:31.711 --> 01:34:32.580
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women should be.</v>

1905
01:34:32.581 --> 01:34:36.060
<v Speaker 5>There should be some punitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The legal shit.</v>

1906
01:34:36.061 --> 01:34:38.550
<v Speaker 5>If women get a legal abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's real.</v>

1907
01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:39.600
<v Speaker 5>Look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could find.</v>

1908
01:34:39.601 --> 01:34:40.680
<v Speaker 5>It's like famous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1909
01:34:40.681 --> 01:34:41.850
<v Speaker 5>look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

1910
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:44.120
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really said that.</v>

1911
01:34:44.290 --> 01:34:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said you look it up.</v>

1912
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:46.590
<v Speaker 5>There's a whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>

1913
01:34:46.591 --> 01:34:51.591
<v Speaker 5>James James is going to look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that he had said those </v>

1914
01:34:55.171 --> 01:34:57.070
<v Speaker 5>words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a crazy thing to say there.</v>

1915
01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:57.400
<v Speaker 5>Ask</v>

1916
01:34:58.150 --> 01:35:00.720
<v Speaker 4>someone for having an abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not for having an abortion.</v>

1917
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:05.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like for a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see it's like enough that like </v>

1918
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:06.950
<v Speaker 4>she mentioned in the last debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1919
01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:13.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to say too because a lot of </v>

1920
01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:13.910
<v Speaker 4>his positions on things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1921
01:35:13.911 --> 01:35:15.530
<v Speaker 4>or off the cuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1922
01:35:15.531 --> 01:35:20.531
<v Speaker 4>like maybe he hadn't even considered it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody brings something up and he </v>

1923
01:35:20.531 --> 01:35:23.411
<v Speaker 4>talks about it and it doesn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking kind of trump he said he was </v>

1924
01:35:23.411 --> 01:35:23.600
<v Speaker 4>miss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll let you read it.</v>

1925
01:35:23.601 --> 01:35:24.320
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me read it.</v>

1926
01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:25.820
<v Speaker 4>Go back up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go back up please.</v>

1927
01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm trump abruptly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reverses course says women should not be</v>

1928
01:35:29.961 --> 01:35:32.330
<v Speaker 4>punished for abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what did he say?</v>

1929
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:34.610
<v Speaker 4>What we're going to look it up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the station?</v>

1930
01:35:34.611 --> 01:35:37.910
<v Speaker 4>There's been some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There has to be some sort of punishment.</v>

1931
01:35:37.911 --> 01:35:41.050
<v Speaker 4>He said women who receive unlawful </v>
<v Speaker 4>abortions,</v>

1932
01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:43.640
<v Speaker 4>I have not changed my position.</v>

1933
01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:47.230
<v Speaker 4>Trump said in the statement he said he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was referring to Dr.</v>

1934
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:50.250
<v Speaker 4>super former illegal abortions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not women who received it.</v>

1935
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:52.430
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand.</v>

1936
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:58.030
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he still believes that doctors who </v>

1937
01:35:58.030 --> 01:36:00.131
<v Speaker 4>perform illegal abortions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there should be some sort of punishment </v>

1938
01:36:00.131 --> 01:36:00.131
<v Speaker 4>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1939
01:36:00.131 --> 01:36:01.630
<v Speaker 4>well that's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wants to reverse roe versus Wade Rosie.</v>

1940
01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:03.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rosie said that last night.</v>

1941
01:36:03.971 --> 01:36:08.971
<v Speaker 4>I said he would put it into three or he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said he would try to put in three </v>

1942
01:36:08.971 --> 01:36:10.880
<v Speaker 4>Supreme Court justices that would be on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that side of the.</v>

1943
01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:16.300
<v Speaker 4>The decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it would automatically get reversed </v>

1944
01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 4>was I think his exact words almost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1945
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:22.270
<v Speaker 4>that's so tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's deciding what people can and </v>

1946
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:23.320
<v Speaker 4>can't do with their body and it'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

1947
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:26.090
<v Speaker 4>Not that it's a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not always a baby.</v>

1948
01:36:26.091 --> 01:36:28.890
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's a bunch of cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it's 10 cells,</v>

1949
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:30.770
<v Speaker 4>it's still a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1950
01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.930
<v Speaker 4>like you could get an abortion 10 cells </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1951
01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 4>Is that an abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1952
01:36:34.570 --> 01:36:39.570
<v Speaker 4>I do not know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm legitimately asking what time do you</v>

1953
01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:43.190
<v Speaker 4>get to tell someone that they can remain</v>
<v Speaker 4>pregnant?</v>

1954
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:45.920
<v Speaker 4>But think of the irony that fucking pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>abortion.</v>

1955
01:36:45.921 --> 01:36:48.950
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton is anti marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she's like,</v>

1956
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:50.420
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you.</v>

1957
01:36:50.421 --> 01:36:53.900
<v Speaker 4>I know it's not our place to say what a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman could do with their body,</v>

1958
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:56.480
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to fucking tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can put into your body.</v>

1959
01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:01.660
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it is the government's place to </v>

1960
01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:01.660
<v Speaker 4>say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1961
01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:01.660
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1962
01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:05.570
<v Speaker 4>She's doing it for profit 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the only reason why the banks </v>

1963
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:05.570
<v Speaker 4>wanted to do it in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wild.</v>

1964
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:07.310
<v Speaker 4>Would the banks be concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana?</v>

1965
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Are they in the marijuana business?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is going on?</v>

1966
01:37:10.821 --> 01:37:15.821
<v Speaker 4>Why would banks want her to be for </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana laws?</v>

1967
01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:17.930
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1968
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:19.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1969
01:37:19.161 --> 01:37:22.070
<v Speaker 4>It's all a giant backed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of bankers love weed,</v>

1970
01:37:22.071 --> 01:37:24.110
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guarantee.</v>

1971
01:37:24.111 --> 01:37:29.111
<v Speaker 4>I know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to do with banks having interest </v>

1972
01:37:29.111 --> 01:37:29.111
<v Speaker 4>in pharmaceutical companies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1973
01:37:29.111 --> 01:37:31.310
<v Speaker 4>the company that makes fentanyl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about this ad nauseum.</v>

1974
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:36.550
<v Speaker 4>They're spending hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 4>of dollars in Arizona to try to stop </v>

1975
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.550
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1976
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:40.340
<v Speaker 4>the medical or not even medical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to do recreational,</v>

1977
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:45.370
<v Speaker 4>recreational marijuana from being passed</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Arizona because they know that it's </v>

1978
01:37:45.370 --> 01:37:49.841
<v Speaker 4>way cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way easier and way more effective pain </v>

1979
01:37:49.841 --> 01:37:52.571
<v Speaker 4>relief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to fucking cripple their </v>

1980
01:37:52.571 --> 01:37:52.571
<v Speaker 4>creepy ass business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And guess what?</v>

1981
01:37:52.571 --> 01:37:55.080
<v Speaker 4>No physical addiction properties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people get addicted to it,</v>

1982
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 4>but to the same people that</v>

1983
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:01.010
<v Speaker 3>get addicted to a lot of stuff folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't mean there's like </v>

1984
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.010
<v Speaker 3>physical addictive properties to </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

1985
01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.720
<v Speaker 3>There's not really a mechanism for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get physically addicted to marijuana.</v>

1986
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:06.820
<v Speaker 3>The way you can get physically addicted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to painkillers,</v>

1987
01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:11.960
<v Speaker 3>even if there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the government's place to say </v>

1988
01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:14.751
<v Speaker 3>you can't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially while they still have pain </v>

1989
01:38:14.751 --> 01:38:14.751
<v Speaker 3>pills and then taking money from these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pains.</v>

1990
01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so gross.</v>

1991
01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:17.820
<v Speaker 3>What a fucking mess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1992
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:21.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to like this dream is like,</v>

1993
01:38:21.781 --> 01:38:26.781
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine if the fucking </v>

1994
01:38:26.781 --> 01:38:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Republicans had come up with just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal dude?</v>

1995
01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Like if they just somehow come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>one normal guy,</v>

1996
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:38.900
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a non religious nut and somebody </v>

1997
01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:43.311
<v Speaker 3>who like doesn't have like a checkered </v>
<v Speaker 3>past just to kind of balanced guys like,</v>

1998
01:38:43.561 --> 01:38:48.561
<v Speaker 3>well you need to work on the economy </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Mitt Romney without the Mormon </v>

1999
01:38:48.561 --> 01:38:48.561
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2000
01:38:48.561 --> 01:38:52.620
<v Speaker 3>If they had just come up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have won by a long shot,</v>

2001
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:57.950
<v Speaker 3>a long shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this was the perfect chance </v>

2002
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:59.670
<v Speaker 3>for them to get somebody in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't happen.</v>

2003
01:38:59.671 --> 01:39:02.940
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't do it like the whole sit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their whole system was so screwy.</v>

2004
01:39:02.941 --> 01:39:05.940
<v Speaker 3>It's sad to you when you hear some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the [inaudible] by the way,</v>

2005
01:39:05.941 --> 01:39:07.680
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a news flash.</v>

2006
01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.920
<v Speaker 3>Not all Republicans are pad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people think that a lot of them </v>

2007
01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:13.500
<v Speaker 3>have like some great fucking ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smaller government.</v>

2008
01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Not a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you like,</v>

2009
01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:19.530
<v Speaker 3>here are some of the frustration from </v>
<v Speaker 3>like my fucking dad,</v>

2010
01:39:19.531 --> 01:39:22.230
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a lifelong Republican.</v>

2011
01:39:22.231 --> 01:39:25.140
<v Speaker 3>He's a vet and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2012
01:39:25.141 --> 01:39:28.320
<v Speaker 3>he's like dismayed by all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's,</v>

2013
01:39:28.410 --> 01:39:33.410
<v Speaker 3>he looks at it from the perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's like seeing so many </v>

2014
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:37.131
<v Speaker 3>different election cycles and to look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's boiling down to debates that </v>

2015
01:39:38.311 --> 01:39:43.311
<v Speaker 3>have turned into the fucking jerry </v>
<v Speaker 3>springer show literally like this is a </v>

2016
01:39:43.311 --> 01:39:46.971
<v Speaker 3>fucking guy who spent two fucking years </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Vietnam by choice because he thought </v>

2017
01:39:48.601 --> 01:39:50.430
<v Speaker 3>he was going to fight for his country.</v>

2018
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:55.430
<v Speaker 3>So these things mean a lot to him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like to see fucking this fucking </v>

2019
01:39:56.070 --> 01:40:01.070
<v Speaker 3>barely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at least in the debates that I've </v>

2020
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.070
<v Speaker 3>seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2021
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.830
<v Speaker 3>you see barely anyone talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking veterans.</v>

2022
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Like no one's fucking talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that the Va's fucked or that like </v>

2023
01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:09.390
<v Speaker 3>some of these people aren't getting any </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the medical care that they need.</v>

2024
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:14.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're up there fucking talking about </v>

2025
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:16.680
<v Speaker 3>trump grabbing pussies are like Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton's fucking stupid foundation.</v>

2026
01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.090
<v Speaker 3>What about the fact that like people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing their goddamn brains out?</v>

2027
01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Oliver neighborhoods across our country </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they made the decision to like </v>

2028
01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.731
<v Speaker 3>go fight in fucking Iraq and more people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have killed themselves than have died </v>

2029
01:40:28.731 --> 01:40:29.100
<v Speaker 3>serving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2030
01:40:29.101 --> 01:40:30.310
<v Speaker 3>What about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are they,</v>

2031
01:40:30.311 --> 01:40:34.320
<v Speaker 3>your veterans have killed themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>than have been killed in war.</v>

2032
01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2033
01:40:35.670 --> 01:40:38.890
<v Speaker 3>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have never let me.</v>

2034
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:42.030
<v Speaker 3>What is the numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know how much more it is</v>

2035
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:48.110
<v Speaker 3>that more veterans have committed </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide than have died in combat in </v>

2036
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.870
<v Speaker 3>these wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2037
01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:53.290
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's unbelievably shocking to the fact</v>

2038
01:40:53.291 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 3>that they don't talk about</v>

2039
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:54.670
<v Speaker 4>that at all.</v>

2040
01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:58.070
<v Speaker 3>Hardly at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like to just imagine like.</v>

2041
01:40:58.210 --> 01:40:59.390
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another thing,</v>

2042
01:40:59.391 --> 01:41:01.220
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing you don't hear about,</v>

2043
01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:03.810
<v Speaker 3>like we hear about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2044
01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:05.500
<v Speaker 3>you hear about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2045
01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear,</v>

2046
01:41:07.730 --> 01:41:09.890
<v Speaker 3>we do hear about ptsd a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like you,</v>

2047
01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people realize the impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ptsd as a family,</v>

2048
01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.880
<v Speaker 3>like the impact of your dad or your mom </v>
<v Speaker 3>being completely closed off because like</v>

2049
01:41:20.601 --> 01:41:25.601
<v Speaker 3>when you get ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you develop these crazy survival </v>

2050
01:41:25.601 --> 01:41:26.780
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you try not to feel as much anymore.</v>

2051
01:41:26.781 --> 01:41:28.970
<v Speaker 3>So you get numbed down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you become an alcoholic,</v>

2052
01:41:29.210 --> 01:41:30.730
<v Speaker 3>you become a drug addict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2053
01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:35.000
<v Speaker 3>you have difficulty expressing emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking mess man.</v>

2054
01:41:35.001 --> 01:41:37.850
<v Speaker 3>And like by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all due respect,</v>

2055
01:41:37.851 --> 01:41:38.690
<v Speaker 3>but you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2056
01:41:38.691 --> 01:41:42.020
<v Speaker 3>ptsd is a very difficult disorder to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

2057
01:41:42.021 --> 01:41:44.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just impacting the vet,</v>

2058
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:49.330
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking the entire spreading out </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the communities and the </v>

2059
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:50.210
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that like,</v>

2060
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:53.570
<v Speaker 3>I just imagine being in a family that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>

2061
01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:57.830
<v Speaker 3>God that's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suicide surpassed war,</v>

2062
01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.270
<v Speaker 4>other larger place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim,</v>

2063
01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.650
<v Speaker 4>just 17 to 22 every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make that a little large police.</v>

2064
01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:04.690
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that man.</v>

2065
01:42:06.130 --> 01:42:07.840
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2066
01:42:07.890 --> 01:42:11.200
<v Speaker 4>this is really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty six percent of the look at this.</v>

2067
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:16.470
<v Speaker 4>The fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan </v>
<v Speaker 4>accounted for anywhere from one and a </v>

2068
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:17.890
<v Speaker 4>three deaths in the military from 2005 </v>
<v Speaker 4>to 2000,</v>

2069
01:42:17.891 --> 01:42:22.891
<v Speaker 4>10 to more than 46 percent of the deaths</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 2007 according to the height of the </v>

2070
01:42:24.281 --> 01:42:29.281
<v Speaker 4>Iraqi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So during the height of the Iraqi </v>

2071
01:42:29.281 --> 01:42:29.281
<v Speaker 4>search,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than 6,800</v>

2072
01:42:29.281 --> 01:42:32.851
<v Speaker 4>troops have died in Iraq and Afghanistan</v>
<v Speaker 4>since nine slash 11 and more than 3000 </v>

2073
01:42:32.851 --> 01:42:37.261
<v Speaker 4>additional service members have taken </v>
<v Speaker 4>their lives in the same time according </v>

2074
01:42:37.261 --> 01:42:40.681
<v Speaker 4>to Pentagon data now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So keep going down so we can find out </v>

2075
01:42:40.681 --> 01:42:41.260
<v Speaker 4>where that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>

2076
01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.060
<v Speaker 4>hold on a second then go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom of that please.</v>

2077
01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:49.360
<v Speaker 4>It says more than 6,800</v>
<v Speaker 4>troops have died in Iraq and Afghanistan</v>

2078
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:52.210
<v Speaker 4>and more than 3000 additional service </v>
<v Speaker 4>members have taken their lives.</v>

2079
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:56.170
<v Speaker 4>So how is that the same amount?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gook go back up to the title.</v>

2080
01:42:56.171 --> 01:42:58.690
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this a bad article?</v>

2081
01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.870
<v Speaker 4>Suicide surpassed war as the military </v>
<v Speaker 4>leading cause of death.</v>

2082
01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:06.220
<v Speaker 4>What that means is currently that </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean like all total.</v>

2083
01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:07.600
<v Speaker 4>I think this is an old article.</v>

2084
01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:09.230
<v Speaker 3>It's currently that which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2085
01:43:09.231 --> 01:43:10.580
<v Speaker 3>but still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2086
01:43:10.581 --> 01:43:11.600
<v Speaker 3>That's so dire.</v>

2087
01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:12.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a couple years old.</v>

2088
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Go and find a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can please find a more recent,</v>

2089
01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:20.100
<v Speaker 4>because I think what they were saying is</v>
<v Speaker 4>suicide.</v>

2090
01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.400
<v Speaker 4>Suicide has caused more American </v>
<v Speaker 4>casualties than wars in Iraq and </v>

2091
01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:25.400
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There it goes.</v>

2092
01:43:25.530 --> 01:43:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2094
01:43:29.881 --> 01:43:32.970
<v Speaker 4>What are the numbers there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

2095
01:43:32.971 --> 01:43:37.971
<v Speaker 4>veterans to explore experts estimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>that 17 of the 22 daily suicides </v>

2096
01:43:39.931 --> 01:43:44.460
<v Speaker 4>involving vets not enrolled in the Va's </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare system.</v>

2097
01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Cheese</v>

2098
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:49.290
<v Speaker 3>27,258</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those we honored for their service on</v>

2099
01:43:49.291 --> 01:43:51.500
<v Speaker 3>this veterans day have died by their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

2100
01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Twenty seven fucking thousand people.</v>

2101
01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.120
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

2102
01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:02.110
<v Speaker 4>That's from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many wars?</v>

2103
01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:03.200
<v Speaker 6>How many,</v>

2104
01:44:04.050 --> 01:44:06.620
<v Speaker 4>how many years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still people.</v>

2105
01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.270
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2106
01:44:09.271 --> 01:44:11.010
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing saw unbelievable.</v>

2107
01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:12.210
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very believable.</v>

2108
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>An empty,</v>

2109
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:20.030
<v Speaker 4>empty existence to be having sent over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there when you're 17 years old and </v>

2110
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:22.440
<v Speaker 4>you're fighting for a war that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't believe in.</v>

2111
01:44:22.441 --> 01:44:24.150
<v Speaker 4>You wind up killing people you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even know.</v>

2112
01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:29.990
<v Speaker 4>You come back off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up and ptsd it out and then you </v>

2113
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:29.990
<v Speaker 4>don't get any help.</v>

2114
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get any,</v>

2115
01:44:30.990 --> 01:44:35.990
<v Speaker 3>any help because part of I think maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of PTSD is you don't want to reach </v>

2116
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:39.831
<v Speaker 3>out for help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like part of the disorder is </v>

2117
01:44:39.831 --> 01:44:39.831
<v Speaker 3>you're all numbed down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

2118
01:44:39.831 --> 01:44:44.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to mention you have many of these </v>

2119
01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:45.150
<v Speaker 3>people have brain trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they've got like there's a lot of.</v>

2120
01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that if you're sitting in a </v>

2121
01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:50.540
<v Speaker 3>fit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're in a family,</v>

2122
01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:54.690
<v Speaker 3>it's been impacted by that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching the debates because you know,</v>

2123
01:44:54.691 --> 01:44:56.340
<v Speaker 3>for me like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

2124
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:58.620
<v Speaker 3>I watched the debates is a form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment,</v>

2125
01:44:58.710 --> 01:45:03.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's kind of like there's </v>

2126
01:45:03.710 --> 01:45:05.721
<v Speaker 3>something in it that's like grim yet </v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious and it's like interesting to </v>

2127
01:45:05.721 --> 01:45:09.150
<v Speaker 3>see this kind of unraveling of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>political system in this way.</v>

2128
01:45:09.810 --> 01:45:14.810
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when you just spend a little </v>

2129
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:18.561
<v Speaker 3>bit of time thinking about how the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine is like impacting families in </v>

2130
01:45:18.691 --> 01:45:20.670
<v Speaker 3>the most fucked up way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

2131
01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:23.970
<v Speaker 3>a lot of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know their dad has ptsd,</v>

2132
01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:29.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they don't even know why their dad </v>

2133
01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:32.150
<v Speaker 3>is drinking so much or is acting angry </v>
<v Speaker 3>or unpredictable or seems fucked up.</v>

2134
01:45:33.450 --> 01:45:36.060
<v Speaker 3>They don't even know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just think that's how dad is.</v>

2135
01:45:36.210 --> 01:45:40.140
<v Speaker 3>And then they like develop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They began to imitate that behavior,</v>

2136
01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:45.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the next thing you know you've </v>

2137
01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:46.881
<v Speaker 3>got like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like echo of this terrible thing that </v>

2138
01:45:46.881 --> 01:45:50.080
<v Speaker 3>war is echoing out into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into our communities and in India,</v>

2139
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:55.090
<v Speaker 3>in our fucking in there everything man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so I imagine when you're </v>

2140
01:45:55.090 --> 01:45:58.430
<v Speaker 3>watching the debates and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing that these two people are </v>

2141
01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:02.481
<v Speaker 3>spending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what percentage of time </v>

2142
01:46:02.481 --> 01:46:04.641
<v Speaker 3>talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the percentage is </v>

2143
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:06.810
<v Speaker 3>exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've talked about veterans at all,</v>

2144
01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:09.690
<v Speaker 3>but you probably start getting really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2145
01:46:09.691 --> 01:46:11.400
<v Speaker 3>really depressed when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2146
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I guess that was just a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit that we did out there for real </v>

2147
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.820
<v Speaker 3>because these guys are barely talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2148
01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:23.160
<v Speaker 4>It's just a weird popularity contests </v>
<v Speaker 4>for them to get into this position of </v>

2149
01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:26.581
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is and they're saying </v>

2150
01:46:26.581 --> 01:46:26.950
<v Speaker 4>whatever is popular in the moment and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's popular in the moment is grabbing</v>

2151
01:46:26.951 --> 01:46:31.951
<v Speaker 4>pussies and email scandals and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what everybody seems to be </v>

2152
01:46:31.951 --> 01:46:35.251
<v Speaker 4>focusing on because the war has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on for so long that people almost </v>

2153
01:46:35.251 --> 01:46:36.280
<v Speaker 4>numb to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you drudge that up,</v>

2154
01:46:36.281 --> 01:46:38.530
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to get the same emotional</v>
<v Speaker 4>sparks.</v>

2155
01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:42.020
<v Speaker 4>The current event sparked that we love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We love a current event.</v>

2156
01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:47.040
<v Speaker 4>Spark right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The current events bark is grabbing </v>

2157
01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.711
<v Speaker 4>pussies and emails candles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went back and forth the other day </v>

2158
01:46:49.711 --> 01:46:49.711
<v Speaker 4>during the debates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2159
01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:53.790
<v Speaker 4>post debate from CNN to Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 4>CNN to Fox News,</v>

2160
01:46:53.791 --> 01:46:58.791
<v Speaker 4>CNN to Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just listening to the different sides </v>

2161
01:46:58.801 --> 01:47:01.950
<v Speaker 4>and how they talk about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so bizarre.</v>

2162
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:03.130
<v Speaker 4>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2163
01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:08.280
<v Speaker 4>you never are more aware of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are being your pr propaganda as</v>

2164
01:47:10.351 --> 01:47:12.210
<v Speaker 4>being projected in your way.</v>

2165
01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:17.360
<v Speaker 4>Just blatantly unapologetic propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The CNN people aren't even remotely </v>

2166
01:47:20.341 --> 01:47:23.670
<v Speaker 4>considering the impact of her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>

2167
01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:29.110
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the controversy with the Clinton </v>

2168
01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:29.110
<v Speaker 4>Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>

2169
01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:33.000
<v Speaker 4>this wikileaks stuff that's come out </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the bankers and her trying to keep</v>

2170
01:47:33.001 --> 01:47:36.990
<v Speaker 4>marijuana and the illegal drug and keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans in prisoned.</v>

2171
01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of it,</v>

2172
01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:39.930
<v Speaker 4>none of that gets brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

2173
01:47:39.931 --> 01:47:43.500
<v Speaker 4>Not a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's brought up the idea that 30,000</v>

2174
01:47:43.501 --> 01:47:48.270
<v Speaker 4>emails were about Yoga classes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much does this bitch take yoga?</v>

2175
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.280
<v Speaker 4>How is that even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've been doing Jujitsu for 20 something</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

2177
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:59.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I have a thousand jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 4>emails or I could delete.</v>

2178
01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:02.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think I have one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might have 100.</v>

2179
01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:06.540
<v Speaker 4>I might have 100 or 200 Jujitsu emails </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I could lead.</v>

2180
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:10.230
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck is Hillary Clinton?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nonphysical.</v>

2181
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:15.320
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton with her bite suit on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that crazy space outfit on.</v>

<v Speaker 3>manipulate and now they're contrary to </v>

<v Speaker 3>distributing information.</v>

2201
01:49:07.161 --> 01:49:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2202
01:49:07.521 --> 01:49:10.550

<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>

2203
01:49:10.551 --> 01:49:12.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world's not really like that.</v>

2204
01:49:12.650 --> 01:49:13.730
<v Speaker 3>They don't know that over there.</v>

2205
01:49:13.730 --> 01:49:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the same way a assigned has </v>

2206
01:49:18.730 --> 01:49:18.730
<v Speaker 3>started like leaking this information </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just like,</v>

2207
01:49:18.730 --> 01:49:19.760
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check it out man,</v>

2208
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.310
<v Speaker 3>your politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how they fucking work,</v>

2209
01:49:22.311 --> 01:49:24.770
<v Speaker 3>this is how they work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And instead of us being like,</v>

2210
01:49:24.771 --> 01:49:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's reform the system,</v>

2211
01:49:27.351 --> 01:49:29.480
<v Speaker 3>we had to reform this fucking system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2212
01:49:29.481 --> 01:49:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even if it is above the board,</v>

2213
01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:37.340
<v Speaker 3>like even if what you're doing is above </v>
<v Speaker 3>the board in some kind of weird gray,</v>

2214
01:49:37.341 --> 01:49:40.310
<v Speaker 3>liminal legal area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't be,</v>

2215
01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:42.080
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's fix it.</v>

2216
01:49:42.110 --> 01:49:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Instead we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2217
01:49:43.670 --> 01:49:48.490
<v Speaker 3>this is that Vladimir Putin trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking manipulate our elections,</v>

2218
01:49:48.491 --> 01:49:53.491
<v Speaker 3>which by the way are not rigged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did he say that?</v>

2219
01:49:54.130 --> 01:49:57.610
<v Speaker 3>When our politicians are so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>

2220
01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:02.820
<v Speaker 3>why would anybody say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The very thing that makes these honest </v>

2221
01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:06.070
<v Speaker 3>people rise to power would be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt.</v>

2222
01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:07.930
<v Speaker 3>Too strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so strange,</v>

2223
01:50:07.931 --> 01:50:09.370
<v Speaker 3>so strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so strange.</v>

2224
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:10.850
<v Speaker 3>And it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2225
01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:14.320
<v Speaker 3>the reaction we should all be having </v>
<v Speaker 3>should not be like,</v>

2226
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:17.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anger at Russia.</v>

2227
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Their reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should be having his anger at our </v>

2228
01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:22.750
<v Speaker 3>political class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2229
01:50:22.751 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 3>it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the sanches idea,</v>

2230
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:27.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his idea is like if we expose.</v>

2231
01:50:27.970 --> 01:50:29.980
<v Speaker 3>He wrote this essay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read an article about it.</v>

2232
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:35.580
<v Speaker 3>If we expose the inner workings of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>political class and we show that the </v>

2233
01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:40.740
<v Speaker 3>level of deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fullness that is involved in this game </v>

2234
01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:40.740
<v Speaker 3>of chess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which now people are just saying,</v>

2235
01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:41.980
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just the way it works.</v>

2236
01:50:41.981 --> 01:50:46.981
<v Speaker 3>That's how it works in the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be cutthroat and you've </v>

2237
01:50:46.981 --> 01:50:48.310
<v Speaker 3>got to lie and you've got to trick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to do all this shit.</v>

2238
01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:53.580
<v Speaker 3>If we expose them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what that hopefully is supposed to </v>

2239
01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:57.690
<v Speaker 3>do is make them reform on their own or </v>
<v Speaker 3>create what he called a.</v>

2240
01:50:58.010 --> 01:51:00.400
<v Speaker 3>The idea is you want it to be very </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive to lie.</v>

2241
01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:05.401
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to and you and also he's </v>

2242
01:51:05.401 --> 01:51:07.381
<v Speaker 3>created a situation where all of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>are living in a terrible world of </v>

2243
01:51:07.381 --> 01:51:11.911
<v Speaker 3>paranoia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is kind of hilarious </v>

2244
01:51:11.911 --> 01:51:12.610
<v Speaker 3>because like a song has done to Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton,</v>

2245
01:51:12.611 --> 01:51:14.920
<v Speaker 3>what the NSA has done to all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2246
01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:16.310
<v Speaker 3>like they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2247
01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:21.310
<v Speaker 3>he has all this fucking data and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know which data he has.</v>

2248
01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:26.340
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't know what he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of politicians have no idea what </v>

2249
01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:28.560
<v Speaker 3>wiki leaks has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the strategy behind.</v>

2250
01:51:28.570 --> 01:51:32.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the strategy behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trickling release of this information is</v>

2251
01:51:32.951 --> 01:51:37.951
<v Speaker 3>because it's like the Japanese water </v>
<v Speaker 3>torture little drops so that every day </v>

2252
01:51:37.951 --> 01:51:39.580
<v Speaker 3>they have to sit and think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>

2253
01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:45.380
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get those fucking pictures in the </v>

2254
01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Bohemian.</v>

2255
01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:45.650
<v Speaker 4>You know what the rumors are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2256
01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:47.390
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the rumors about to release </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

2257
01:51:47.391 --> 01:51:50.060
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be a bomb dropped on </v>
<v Speaker 4>November first.</v>

2258
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:55.390
<v Speaker 4>That's the super awesome conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 4>rumor deluxe of the day that on November</v>

2259
01:51:55.491 --> 01:52:00.410
<v Speaker 4>first anonymous wiki leaks guy fawkes </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself,</v>

2260
01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:05.440
<v Speaker 4>someone is going to drop some huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking information bomb that's going to</v>

2261
01:52:06.321 --> 01:52:10.540
<v Speaker 4>make Hillary Clinton is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're the rumor.</v>

2262
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:15.550
<v Speaker 4>Of course I'm must conspiracy theorists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gonna disqualify for the you the </v>

2263
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:18.730
<v Speaker 4>election.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if that's possible at </v>

2264
01:52:18.730 --> 01:52:18.930
<v Speaker 4>this point because she got away with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that email scandal.</v>

2265
01:52:18.931 --> 01:52:23.931
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that email stuff would have put </v>

2266
01:52:23.931 --> 01:52:23.931
<v Speaker 4>anybody else in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2267
01:52:23.931 --> 01:52:27.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean I posted something on twitter the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other day about a soldier who took </v>

2268
01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:31.961
<v Speaker 4>photographs with his camera on his phone</v>
<v Speaker 4>of some inner workings of a submarine </v>

2269
01:52:32.391 --> 01:52:35.350
<v Speaker 4>and he's going to jail because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just took photographs.</v>

2270
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:39.020
<v Speaker 4>So what she did was infinitely worse.</v>

2271
01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:44.020
<v Speaker 4>They're both government officials.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That soldier and Hillary Clinton are </v>

2272
01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:45.230
<v Speaker 4>both government employees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2273
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.510
<v Speaker 4>The only difference being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course she's elected.</v>

2274
01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

2275
01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other than that,</v>

2276
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:51.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean he works for the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>

2277
01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:56.560
<v Speaker 4>But his responsibility to adhere to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules has way more consequence than </v>

2278

<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2307
01:54:07.721 --> 01:54:12.721
<v Speaker 3>you see him come out to that little </v>
<v Speaker 3>balcony and kind of look at ms dot sad </v>

2308

<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

2309
01:54:12.721 --> 01:54:15.280
<v Speaker 3>fucking sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's what you do.</v>

2310
01:54:15.790 --> 01:54:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Schedule one of those flash mobs were </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000,</v>

2311
01:54:21.131 --> 01:54:23.040
<v Speaker 3>20,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,000.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Don't kill me for saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will only want everyone to love </v>

2314
01:54:30.781 --> 01:54:30.781
<v Speaker 3>windover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get like 10,000</v>

2315
01:54:30.781 --> 01:54:32.350
<v Speaker 3>people to gather around that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>embassy.</v>

2316
01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:35.410
<v Speaker 3>Wearing that guy fawkes mask the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anonymous mass.</v>

2317
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:38.500
<v Speaker 3>They're all wearing the anonymous mask </v>
<v Speaker 3>and certain outfit.</v>

2318
01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a side business in anonymous</v>

2319
01:54:41.001 --> 01:54:41.540
<v Speaker 4>masks?</v>

2320
01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:44.290
<v Speaker 3>What guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox business.</v>

2321
01:54:45.010 --> 01:54:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Duncan trussell dog guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fawkes mask.</v>

2322
01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:50.340
<v Speaker 3>It goes to my foundation of show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

2323
01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:55.520
<v Speaker 3>the idea is you get them to gather </v>
<v Speaker 3>around it and some kind of mask and </v>

2324
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.220
<v Speaker 3>dress like Julian assange and then just </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw a mask.</v>

2325
01:54:57.460 --> 01:55:02.460
<v Speaker 3>So he liked jumps out into this mob of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people all dress like him wearing this </v>

2326
01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:04.450
<v Speaker 3>fucking guy fawkes mask and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>vanishes into the crowd.</v>

2327
01:55:04.810 --> 01:55:06.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a movie that's mission </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible.</v>

2328
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:08.290
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would work with.</v>

2329
01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:10.390
<v Speaker 3>I think because he's got access to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>balcony,</v>

2330
01:55:10.391 --> 01:55:15.391
<v Speaker 3>it means you could get down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just got to pop a laddered up real </v>

2331
01:55:15.391 --> 01:55:15.391
<v Speaker 3>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's dressed like fucking.</v>

2332
01:55:15.391 --> 01:55:17.650
<v Speaker 3>And not everyone looks like a sand with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the anonymous mask on.</v>

2333
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

2334
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Pop right off of that fucking balcony.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So close.</v>

2336
01:55:23.191 --> 01:55:28.191
<v Speaker 3>Just dive into a sea of people dressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the anonymous masks and get just </v>

2337
01:55:28.191 --> 01:55:29.440
<v Speaker 3>fucking vanish in a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shave your fucking head.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just you have to,</v>

2359
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:32.870
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone dance like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to always think God is a god.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2363
01:56:40.591 --> 01:56:44.130
<v Speaker 1>but you got to be aware of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something to be aware of.</v>

01:57:58.131 --> 01:58:00.330
<v Speaker 1>of miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to tell if you're brainwashed,</v>

2393
01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:02.790
<v Speaker 1>do you believe the earth is spinning a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand miles an hour,</v>

2394
01:58:02.791 --> 01:58:07.791
<v Speaker 1>but you can't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe the oceans are curving </v>

2395
01:58:07.791 --> 01:58:09.270
<v Speaker 1>because gravity in air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't measure it.</v>

2396
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave ships disappearing over the </v>

2397
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.940
<v Speaker 1>horizon or proof of the globe and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>due to perspective.</v>

2398
01:58:15.230 --> 01:58:20.230
<v Speaker 1>You believe that pilots would not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to account for the earth curvature or </v>

2399
01:58:20.230 --> 01:58:20.710
<v Speaker 1>spin while flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2400
01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

2401
01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Tell them at one time was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2402
01:58:24.991 --> 01:58:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I was getting a massage and the massage </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist with a flatter Arthur.</v>

2403
01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the past.</v>

2404
01:58:30.541 --> 01:58:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like what's better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm talking massages sometimes</v>

2405
01:58:33.841 --> 01:58:35.400
<v Speaker 1>suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like she say,</v>

2406
01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:41.080
<v Speaker 1>what's funny about it is as she's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining flat earth theory to me,</v>

2407
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to argue with her and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized my understanding of cosmology </v>

2408
01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:52.500
<v Speaker 1>is so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't come up with a persuasive </v>

2409
01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.420
<v Speaker 1>argument against it because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2410
01:58:55.421 --> 01:59:00.421
<v Speaker 1>the conspiracy argument is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you would think that everybody </v>

2411
01:59:00.421 --> 01:59:02.260
<v Speaker 1>would have to be in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who's ever been apart of space</v>

2412
01:59:02.261 --> 01:59:04.720
<v Speaker 1>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the Russians or the Chinese</v>

2413
01:59:04.721 --> 01:59:09.721
<v Speaker 1>or the Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who has ever been an </v>

2414
01:59:09.721 --> 01:59:10.030
<v Speaker 1>astrophysicist success to on it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2464

<v Speaker 1>Are you a mason?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Free Mason?</v>

2465
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any other kind of and fucking </v>

2466
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>pyramids and then you kissed the kissing</v>
<v Speaker 1>part was probably one of the greatest </v>

2467
02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:36.040
<v Speaker 1>moments in UFC history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was great man.</v>

2468
02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you something?</v>

2469
02:01:37.781 --> 02:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>I just found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2470
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually</v>

2471
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.780
<v Speaker 5>really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should research this.</v>

2472
02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:44.030
<v Speaker 5>Did I tell you about the cacophony </v>
<v Speaker 5>society?</v>

2473
02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:45.800
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's okay man.</v>

2474
02:01:45.801 --> 02:01:50.801
<v Speaker 5>So the guys who like at least partially </v>
<v Speaker 5>started burning man are called the </v>

2475
02:01:51.231 --> 02:01:56.231
<v Speaker 5>cacophony society and it was this group </v>
<v Speaker 5>of people that do the funniest fucking </v>

2476
02:01:57.201 --> 02:01:59.870
<v Speaker 5>things together and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating.</v>

2477
02:01:59.871 --> 02:02:01.640
<v Speaker 5>They call it culture jamming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

2478
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:03.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2479
02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:05.480
<v Speaker 5>they do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you ever heard of the salmon run.</v>

2480
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:10.750
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's that they dress up and matt giant </v>

2481
02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:11.330
<v Speaker 5>salmon outfits and run the wrong way and</v>
<v Speaker 5>racist.</v>

2482
02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:16.430
<v Speaker 5>That's Hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2483
02:02:17.010 --> 02:02:20.420
<v Speaker 5>Run towards the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They run the opposite direction.</v>

2484
02:02:20.421 --> 02:02:24.650
<v Speaker 5>So you'll see a marathon and salmon are </v>
<v Speaker 5>running like that is so funny.</v>

2485
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:28.390
<v Speaker 5>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the cacophony going upstream.</v>

2486
02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:31.190
<v Speaker 5>They're high fiving people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People let them go through that.</v>

2487
02:02:31.191 --> 02:02:32.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

2488
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:34.820
<v Speaker 5>That's the cacophony society man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They uh,</v>

2489
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:39.100
<v Speaker 5>but these are the guys who started </v>
<v Speaker 5>burning man and chuck Palahniuk.</v>

2490
02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:43.320
<v Speaker 5>That's where he got the inspiration for </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight club because he was running for no</v>

2491
02:02:43.810 --> 02:02:46.670
<v Speaker 5>coffee society because he was in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cacophony society.</v>

2492
02:02:46.671 --> 02:02:47.900
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's one of them,</v>

2493
02:02:48.290 --> 02:02:53.290
<v Speaker 5>but like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their motto is you may already be a </v>

2494
02:02:53.290 --> 02:02:56.030
<v Speaker 5>member and anybody can start their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>branch,</v>

2495
02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:58.370
<v Speaker 5>but it's like really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really funny.</v>

2496
02:02:58.371 --> 02:03:00.320
<v Speaker 5>Like if you look up all the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've done,</v>

2497
02:03:00.321 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really trippy.</v>

2498
02:03:01.401 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 5>Like they said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2499
02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:03.380
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2500
02:03:03.381 --> 02:03:08.381
<v Speaker 5>one of the things they did was they set </v>
<v Speaker 5>up clowns at every stop along the bus </v>

2501
02:03:09.801 --> 02:03:14.270
<v Speaker 5>route so that every time the bus pick </v>
<v Speaker 5>people up and picked up a new clown,</v>

2502
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 5>but the clowns wouldn't acknowledge each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

2503
02:03:16.671 --> 02:03:21.671
<v Speaker 5>Like they just happened to be getting on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same bus constraint.</v>

2504
02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.370
<v Speaker 5>It's cool though because what it did </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2505
02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm not going to try to get into </v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

2506
02:03:25.250 --> 02:03:30.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their theory about it because they </v>

2507
02:03:30.250 --> 02:03:30.250
<v Speaker 5>actually have a pretty deep </v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophical like,</v>

2508
02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:35.360
<v Speaker 5>or it seems to be a fairly deep </v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophy that a lot of it's really </v>

2509
02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.231
<v Speaker 5>hard to understand for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a data ism is part of it and this </v>

2510
02:03:38.231 --> 02:03:42.311
<v Speaker 5>concept at this thing called the zone </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually hocking based temporary </v>

2511
02:03:42.311 --> 02:03:46.631
<v Speaker 5>autonomous zone is kind of related to </v>
<v Speaker 5>this idea that you can create these </v>

2512
02:03:46.631 --> 02:03:51.461
<v Speaker 5>little bubbles that temporarily sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>a where the normal rules of society just</v>

2513
02:03:53.241 --> 02:03:54.620
<v Speaker 5>don't exist in that moment.</v>

2514
02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:58.490
<v Speaker 5>And so people who get to be in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>bubble with you get to experience a kind</v>

2515
02:03:58.491 --> 02:04:03.491
<v Speaker 5>of respite from the never ending flow of</v>
<v Speaker 5>society which can produce like huge </v>

2516
02:04:03.491 --> 02:04:08.471
<v Speaker 5>changes in a person's life to suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 5>no longer be afflicted with the humdrum </v>

2517
02:04:08.471 --> 02:04:13.390
<v Speaker 5>normal day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A materialistic consumeristic bullshit </v>

2518
02:04:13.401 --> 02:04:18.401
<v Speaker 5>that we call everyday life to create a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tiny little bubble where that doesn't </v>

2519
02:04:18.401 --> 02:04:19.160
<v Speaker 5>exist and where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are two rules.</v>

2520
02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:24.580
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you even call them </v>

2521
02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:25.721
<v Speaker 5>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the rules are you don't do a </v>

2522
02:04:25.721 --> 02:04:27.080
<v Speaker 5>cacophonous event for money and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't do it to promote your religion,</v>

2523
02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:32.380
<v Speaker 5>so you're doing this for no reason other</v>
<v Speaker 5>than like subversion for subversion </v>

2524
02:04:33.231 --> 02:04:34.880
<v Speaker 5>sake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's no.</v>

2525
02:04:34.890 --> 02:04:39.890
<v Speaker 5>The profit that you're getting from it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is just the incredible moment that you </v>

2526
02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:43.950
<v Speaker 5>find yourself in is salmon outfit </v>
<v Speaker 5>running the opposite way,</v>

2527
02:04:43.951 --> 02:04:48.951
<v Speaker 5>but what it does is it temporarily </v>
<v Speaker 5>disrupts the hypnotic trance that a lot </v>

2528
02:04:52.381 --> 02:04:55.200
<v Speaker 5>of people are in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when they're living,</v>

2529
02:04:55.230 --> 02:04:55.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just in.</v>

2530
02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:58.020
<v Speaker 5>This was on by design.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're trying to do,</v>

2531
02:04:58.021 --> 02:05:03.021
<v Speaker 5>or they're just having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like they're just having fun </v>

2532
02:05:03.021 --> 02:05:03.870
<v Speaker 5>running against the crowd of marathon </v>
<v Speaker 5>runners.</v>

2533
02:05:03.871 --> 02:05:05.480
<v Speaker 5>So salmon outfits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2534
02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:08.370
<v Speaker 5>that it is for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there's a theory behind it.</v>

2535
02:05:08.371 --> 02:05:13.371
<v Speaker 5>It's not actually like this is something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they've written out and </v>

2536
02:05:13.371 --> 02:05:15.840
<v Speaker 5>contemplated it and acted on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a great book called Tales of the</v>

2537
02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:17.820
<v Speaker 5>Cacophony Society that I'm reading.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so fucking funny.</v>

2538
02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:20.730
<v Speaker 5>How long have you been around for a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've been around since the.</v>

2539
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:25.880
<v Speaker 5>They were pre burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I guess they'd been around for like </v>

2540
02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:27.480
<v Speaker 5>mid eighties or something like that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>prior to that there was something called</v>

2541
02:05:27.481 --> 02:05:29.760
<v Speaker 5>the suicide club,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was,</v>

2542
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:34.020
<v Speaker 5>or they're an offshoot of this group in </v>
<v Speaker 5>San Francisco called the suicide club,</v>

2543
02:05:34.021 --> 02:05:39.021
<v Speaker 5>which was like an actual secrets society</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if you wanted to be a member you </v>

2544
02:05:39.511 --> 02:05:42.420
<v Speaker 5>had to get your affairs in order like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you were going to commit suicide.</v>

2545
02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:46.710
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really cool and like really cool.</v>

2546
02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:51.920
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then the cacophony society sort of </v>

2547
02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:55.341
<v Speaker 5>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their history is fucking hilarious </v>

2548
02:05:55.341 --> 02:05:55.730
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The history of them is so funny and like</v>

2549
02:05:55.890 --> 02:06:00.890
<v Speaker 5>if you look at like the early burning </v>
<v Speaker 5>man that the confidence we're involved </v>

2550
02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:04.461
<v Speaker 5>in whole Lee shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have like a drive by shooting </v>

2551
02:06:04.891 --> 02:06:08.460
<v Speaker 5>range.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like they would like drive in cars,</v>

2552
02:06:08.461 --> 02:06:10.110
<v Speaker 5>blasting it targets.</v>

2553
02:06:12.610 --> 02:06:17.610
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were launching flaming fucking </v>

2554
02:06:17.610 --> 02:06:21.360
<v Speaker 5>pianos out of catapults out in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of the desert like they were and </v>

2555
02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:22.860
<v Speaker 5>people were getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

2556
02:06:22.861 --> 02:06:27.861
<v Speaker 5>I wonder why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like they were like they were bad </v>

2557
02:06:27.861 --> 02:06:32.361
<v Speaker 5>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it sounds like if hunter s Thompson </v>

2558
02:06:32.361 --> 02:06:32.361
<v Speaker 5>started a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2559
02:06:32.361 --> 02:06:33.630
<v Speaker 5>That's a great way to put it in and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell you,</v>

2560
02:06:33.631 --> 02:06:38.631
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he probably knew of them and if he </v>

2561
02:06:38.631 --> 02:06:38.631
<v Speaker 5>didn't know of them he would have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2562
02:06:38.631 --> 02:06:38.631
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of them.</v>

2563
02:06:38.631 --> 02:06:39.090
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you be,</v>

2564
02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.800
<v Speaker 5>you can be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to even join up.</v>

2609
02:08:37.961 --> 02:08:42.961
<v Speaker 5>our final meeting to be caught up in how</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brendan Walsh ruined the Ukrainian </v>

2610
02:08:43.121 --> 02:08:44.890
<v Speaker 5>branch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the La Cacophony society.</v>

2611
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:49.890
<v Speaker 5>So let's just not think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he gives a speech and he reads </v>

2612

2614
02:08:57.491 --> 02:09:02.491
<v Speaker 5>cheating apology in front of a group of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in Pajamas who whenever Brendan </v>

2615
02:09:02.491 --> 02:09:04.660
<v Speaker 5>would say one of like tigers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird apologies.</v>

2616
02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:08.260
<v Speaker 5>Everyone would applaud and then shush </v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves at the same time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2633

<v Speaker 5>We're going to have a meeting of the new</v>
<v Speaker 5>board,</v>

2638
02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:01.990
<v Speaker 5>the new British new Ukrainian branch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the La Cacophony Society,</v>

2639
02:10:01.991 --> 02:10:03.280
<v Speaker 5>but we haven't figured out what that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>yet.</v>

2640
02:10:03.281 --> 02:10:04.930
<v Speaker 5>But why is it new?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ukrainian,</v>

2641
02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:07.540
<v Speaker 5>Ukrainian?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2642
02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:13.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole point of the thing that,</v>

2643
02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:19.690
<v Speaker 5>which is really beautiful because I got </v>
<v Speaker 5>on all this shit happened because like I</v>

2644
02:10:19.691 --> 02:10:20.650
<v Speaker 5>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2645
02:10:20.651 --> 02:10:25.651
<v Speaker 5>well burning man was the coolest thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've ever experienced and then I trace </v>

2646
02:10:25.651 --> 02:10:28.541
<v Speaker 5>that back to the cacophony society and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then I kept hearing this guy's named </v>

2647
02:10:28.541 --> 02:10:28.600
<v Speaker 5>John Locke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Locke.</v>

2648
02:10:28.630 --> 02:10:32.950
<v Speaker 5>John Law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like I found him and I emailed him.</v>

2649
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 5>Then he just wrote back like,</v>

2650
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just call me.</v>

2651
02:10:34.671 --> 02:10:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Here's my number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I called him and then he,</v>

2652
02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:39.770
<v Speaker 3>we started talking about how you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the events were like.</v>

2653
02:10:39.771 --> 02:10:43.520
<v Speaker 3>And he said the main thing about it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the inclusivity.</v>

2654
02:10:43.521 --> 02:10:46.430
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what makes it so cool is that we</v>

2655
02:10:46.431 --> 02:10:50.600
<v Speaker 3>like that if you really form a branch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is more of an experiment,</v>

2656
02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:55.840
<v Speaker 3>but if you really do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then everybody who decides to </v>

2657
02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:56.270
<v Speaker 3>participate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they uh,</v>

2658
02:10:56.450 --> 02:10:58.220
<v Speaker 3>they come up with their own events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2659
02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 3>So like everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2660
02:10:59.631 --> 02:11:01.810
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be doing this next </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday if you want to come,</v>

2661
02:11:01.811 --> 02:11:02.510
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't,</v>

2662
02:11:02.511 --> 02:11:04.760
<v Speaker 3>don't come the following Tuesday we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be doing this.</v>

2663
02:11:04.761 --> 02:11:09.761
<v Speaker 3>But there's no like pushing people out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if whoever wants to be </v>

2664
02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:10.280
<v Speaker 3>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them be involved.</v>

2665
02:11:10.281 --> 02:11:15.281
<v Speaker 3>And then everyone kind of gathers </v>
<v Speaker 3>together in this little weird bubble </v>

2666
02:11:15.281 --> 02:11:15.281
<v Speaker 3>that forms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>

2667
02:11:15.281 --> 02:11:19.631
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in pajamas at Gelson's </v>

2668
02:11:19.631 --> 02:11:19.631
<v Speaker 3>watching people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what we were talking about earlier.</v>

2669
02:11:19.631 --> 02:11:21.650
<v Speaker 3>What is the sane way to live?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2670
02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:25.070
<v Speaker 3>So when you're in Gelson's wearing </v>
<v Speaker 3>pajamas singing,</v>

2671
02:11:25.071 --> 02:11:30.071
<v Speaker 3>do you want to build a snowman?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look out and people are kind of </v>

2672
02:11:30.071 --> 02:11:32.821
<v Speaker 3>like walking with their shoulders down </v>
<v Speaker 3>to buy their evening groceries and </v>

2673
02:11:32.821 --> 02:11:33.080
<v Speaker 3>they're just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look over at you.</v>

2674
02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:35.420
<v Speaker 3>They get the biggest smile on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

2675
02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:36.920
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

2676
02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:40.220
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it feels so cool.</v>

2677
02:11:40.221 --> 02:11:45.221
<v Speaker 3>It's like a really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting moment of like really minor </v>

2678
02:11:45.221 --> 02:11:49.280
<v Speaker 3>rebellion that has no impact ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the flow of society.</v>

2679
02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:51.770
<v Speaker 3>But in that tiny moment it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2680
02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:53.900
<v Speaker 3>we're in zero gravity here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2681
02:11:57.140 --> 02:12:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a coordinated effort like that </v>

2682
02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:02.450
<v Speaker 3>with a bunch of people in pajamas </v>
<v Speaker 3>singing.</v>

2683
02:12:02.451 --> 02:12:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to build a snowman out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowhere would make everybody smile.</v>

2684
02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those like,</v>

2685
02:12:08.211 --> 02:12:10.610
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck are these guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Dude,</v>

2686
02:12:10.611 --> 02:12:12.770
<v Speaker 3>you'd look over because it was right </v>
<v Speaker 3>next to the Deli.</v>

2687
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:17.800
<v Speaker 3>So like people were like sitting at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>deli pretending to like be eating their </v>

2688
02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:21.251
<v Speaker 3>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they kept looking over it like </v>

2689
02:12:21.251 --> 02:12:21.251
<v Speaker 3>Brendan giving the Tiger Woods speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the other,</v>

2690
02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:26.600
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the other cool idea that they </v>

2691
02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:26.600
<v Speaker 3>came up with man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

2692
02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:30.011
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the way we do entertainment </v>

2693
02:12:30.011 --> 02:12:31.340
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird because it's like in and I</v>

2694
02:12:31.341 --> 02:12:33.470
<v Speaker 3>guess thank God for it because it's our </v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs,</v>

2695
02:12:33.471 --> 02:12:38.471
<v Speaker 3>but like people pay a cover and they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and there's the audience that sits in</v>

2696
02:12:39.261 --> 02:12:44.261
<v Speaker 3>the audience and the cut and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian that talks or the entertainer </v>

2697
02:12:44.261 --> 02:12:46.610
<v Speaker 3>that talks and there's this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance between the two and it's like,</v>

2698
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:49.820
<v Speaker 3>so that relationship between entertainer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and entertained,</v>

2699
02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:55.060
<v Speaker 3>their ideas like what's merged together </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that we're entertaining each other </v>

2700
02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:59.950
<v Speaker 3>for no reason other than like let's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking get together and like see what </v>

2701
02:12:59.950 --> 02:13:00.320
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2702
02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:05.500
<v Speaker 3>Now this was a nonrisky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of their thing is like </v>

2703
02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:05.930
<v Speaker 3>elevate the risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elevate the risk,</v>

2704
02:13:05.931 --> 02:13:08.930
<v Speaker 3>elevate the risk to the more you elevate</v>
<v Speaker 3>the risk,</v>

2705
02:13:09.170 --> 02:13:13.010
<v Speaker 3>the more it's like a crucible kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really brings people together,</v>

2706
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:18.310
<v Speaker 3>which is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of taking people out to the </v>

2707
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.310
<v Speaker 3>fucking desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Originally.</v>

2708
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:21.881
<v Speaker 3>It's like let's just take a group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people launched flaming pianos </v>

2709
02:13:21.881 --> 02:13:24.230
<v Speaker 3>with catapults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to bring up before I forget,</v>

2710
02:13:24.231 --> 02:13:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Brendan Walsh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite stunts that he did.</v>

2711
02:13:27.230 --> 02:13:32.230
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this gives you an indication and what </v>

2712
02:13:32.230 --> 02:13:32.230
<v Speaker 3>kind of sense of humor has he</v>

2713
02:13:32.230 --> 02:13:35.590
<v Speaker 4>put a fake wholefoods sign in Silver </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lake?</v>

2714
02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted people to think that a whole </v>

2715
02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:40.800
<v Speaker 4>foods was coming to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2716
02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:40.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there might be one now,</v>

2717
02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:43.890
<v Speaker 4>but he did this a long time ago and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot.</v>

2718
02:13:43.891 --> 02:13:48.891
<v Speaker 4>It was an empty lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he had a sign made with the whole </v>

2719
02:13:48.891 --> 02:13:49.920
<v Speaker 4>foods low put coming soon on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2720
02:13:49.921 --> 02:13:53.250
<v Speaker 4>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he set it up on the fence and people</v>

2721
02:13:53.251 --> 02:13:54.900
<v Speaker 4>were so psyched.</v>

2722
02:13:55.070 --> 02:13:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is Brendan Walsh,</v>

2723
02:13:57.111 --> 02:13:58.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what his sense of humor is.</v>

2724
02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:00.560
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dude,</v>

2725
02:14:00.561 --> 02:14:01.490
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2726
02:14:01.491 --> 02:14:04.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why when I read this book,</v>

2727
02:14:04.161 --> 02:14:05.990
<v Speaker 1>look at this right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll get the top of it.</v>

2728
02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Did the silver lake wholefoods hoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>prankster.</v>

2729
02:14:08.721 --> 02:14:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Reveal his plans on a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2730

<v Speaker 1>What the fuck with Mark Marin?</v>

2731

02:19:03.521 --> 02:19:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Like you've haven't been telling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

2847
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:05.980
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

2848
02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:11.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just like my friends do this </v>

2849
02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:11.580
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I come here,</v>

2850
02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:16.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just tell the truth while I'm up here </v>

2851
02:19:16.170 --> 02:19:16.170
<v Speaker 3>and like other people will lie to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2852
02:19:16.170 --> 02:19:20.101
<v Speaker 3>but I definitely don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they go deep and they commit and </v>

2853
02:19:20.101 --> 02:19:21.640
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not malicious.</v>

2854
02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:26.880
<v Speaker 3>It's really both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very funny thing and that's one </v>

2855
02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 3>tiny little part of it.</v>

2856
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:33.070
<v Speaker 3>Like imagine that spread out over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over and over again with just </v>

2857
02:19:33.711 --> 02:19:38.711
<v Speaker 3>different types of like bars or art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine like let's say and you know,</v>

2858
02:19:39.891 --> 02:19:43.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't take psychedelics and if I talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it on the podcast,</v>

2859
02:19:43.101 --> 02:19:45.170
<v Speaker 3>I do it as a joke because I want to seem</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool,</v>

2860
02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:50.440
<v Speaker 3>but imagine if you were in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking desert on psychedelics that </v>

2861
02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:53.450
<v Speaker 3>had just started kicking in on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>bicycle,</v>

2862
02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:58.451
<v Speaker 3>covered in led light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by other people in blinking </v>

2863
02:19:58.451 --> 02:20:01.370
<v Speaker 3>led lights on their bicycles and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in front of what appears to be a</v>

2864
02:20:01.371 --> 02:20:06.371
<v Speaker 3>massive bras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is either a locust of firefly,</v>

2865
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:11.490
<v Speaker 3>some kind of grasshopper cricket's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sculpture on top of another crib,</v>

2866
02:20:11.491 --> 02:20:16.491
<v Speaker 3>get sculpture that has combustible gas </v>
<v Speaker 3>exploding out of it so that it's.</v>

2867
02:20:16.701 --> 02:20:21.530
<v Speaker 3>And it's like 10 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 feet high with combustible gas,</v>

2868
02:20:21.531 --> 02:20:23.210
<v Speaker 3>exploding out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's making this.</v>

2869
02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:32.680
<v Speaker 3>Elon Musk has the dopest rod there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a yacht that like just goes </v>

2870
02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:34.760
<v Speaker 3>around through fucking burning man and </v>
<v Speaker 3>life goes on it,</v>

2871
02:20:34.761 --> 02:20:35.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2872
02:20:35.481 --> 02:20:37.520
<v Speaker 3>And anyone can get on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing about it,</v>

2873
02:20:37.521 --> 02:20:38.750
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's like this is,</v>

2874
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:42.170
<v Speaker 3>it's the idea of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is it's pure inclusivity.</v>

2875
02:20:42.171 --> 02:20:45.650
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea is it's like this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just everybody sharing.</v>

2876
02:20:45.651 --> 02:20:49.010
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So crazy ride through the desert.</v>

2877
02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:50.660
<v Speaker 3>You climb on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll give you,</v>

2878
02:20:51.350 --> 02:20:53.510
<v Speaker 3>they'll give you drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just like chill out.</v>

2879
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:57.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like the whole thing is like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gifting economy is what they call it.</v>

2880
02:20:57.621 --> 02:21:01.250
<v Speaker 3>So like everyone is just giving stuff to</v>
<v Speaker 3>answer was amazing.</v>

2881
02:21:01.310 --> 02:21:03.260
<v Speaker 3>It's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really truly is.</v>

2882
02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's,</v>

2883
02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:09.220
<v Speaker 3>here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can this go from here to a city?</v>

2884
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

2885
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:13.050
<v Speaker 3>can you develop a city like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2886
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:14.120
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do have,</v>

2887
02:21:14.121 --> 02:21:19.121
<v Speaker 3>so like I think the answer that is right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now probably not,</v>

2888
02:21:19.401 --> 02:21:22.150
<v Speaker 3>but why not because it's resource based </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

2889
02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:23.000
<v Speaker 3>it's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2890
02:21:23.001 --> 02:21:26.180
<v Speaker 3>imagine like a flower that once a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>blimps.</v>

2891
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:27.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what you could say.</v>

2892
02:21:27.861 --> 02:21:30.650
<v Speaker 3>That's maybe what burning man is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the year.</v>

2893
02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:35.980
<v Speaker 3>Lots of people are like getting together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and planning like what they're going to.</v>

2959
02:24:40.881 --> 02:24:41.970

<v Speaker 3>They sit around at silently.</v>

02:24:44.581 --> 02:24:49.581

<v Speaker 3>people sitting around that thing on fire</v>

2964
02:24:59.631 --> 02:25:01.230
<v Speaker 3>through the air and then when it finally</v>
<v Speaker 3>burns to the ground,</v>

2965
02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:05.980
<v Speaker 3>the entire group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they how like docs.</v>

2966
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2967
02:25:07.681 --> 02:25:09.720
<v Speaker 3>And that's the end of burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2968
02:25:11.370 --> 02:25:16.370
<v Speaker 3>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is growing at a staggering rate </v>

2969
02:25:16.370 --> 02:25:20.360
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's to stop these people from </v>

2970
02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:21.450
<v Speaker 3>claiming a city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if everybody just decided like,</v>

2971
02:25:21.451 --> 02:25:23.010
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's all move to Portland.</v>

2972
02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:24.160
<v Speaker 3>If all those</v>

2973
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:29.160
<v Speaker 4>people that are burning man type folks </v>
<v Speaker 4>just decided to try to have the same </v>

2974
02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:32.500
<v Speaker 4>sort of impact on a community that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside the realm of possibility.</v>

2975
02:25:32.501 --> 02:25:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2976
02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's already happening.</v>

2977
02:25:33.900 --> 02:25:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Is it happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happening?</v>

2978
02:25:35.361 --> 02:25:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Wherever there's people who have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>influenced by that festival,</v>

2979
02:25:38.721 --> 02:25:43.721
<v Speaker 3>he turned back into the world and try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>not be such selfish shit ads when </v>

2980
02:25:43.721 --> 02:25:47.051
<v Speaker 3>they're in the world or maybe try not to</v>
<v Speaker 3>waste so much stuff or like it's also </v>

2981
02:25:47.051 --> 02:25:48.320
<v Speaker 3>happening because you like realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

2982
02:25:48.350 --> 02:25:53.350
<v Speaker 3>This is not only a festival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is preparing for the fucking </v>

2983
02:25:53.350 --> 02:25:56.470
<v Speaker 3>possible economic collapse because if we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can all get together and survive in the </v>

2984
02:25:56.470 --> 02:25:59.120
<v Speaker 3>desert in this way and work together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there is a possibility.</v>

2985
02:25:59.270 --> 02:26:04.270
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually I went to see Alex and Allyson </v>

2986
02:26:04.270 --> 02:26:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Gray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are painting at the Dr Bronner's </v>

2987
02:26:06.970 --> 02:26:06.970
<v Speaker 3>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're painting a mural there.</v>

2988
02:26:06.970 --> 02:26:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Doctor Bronner's soap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hemp soap.</v>

2989
02:26:07.490 --> 02:26:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Dr Bronner has a camp there called Risa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2990
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:11.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr.</v>

2991
02:26:11.690 --> 02:26:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Bronner's soap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a camp there called </v>

2992
02:26:16.690 --> 02:26:16.690
<v Speaker 3>reformations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2993
02:26:16.690 --> 02:26:20.530
<v Speaker 3>And so they basically are just hosing </v>
<v Speaker 3>down all these filthy like burning man </v>

2994
02:26:20.530 --> 02:26:23.030
<v Speaker 3>people out in the desert to clean them </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2995
02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like after they hosed them down,</v>

2996
02:26:27.350 --> 02:26:30.920
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've constructed a tent where there's</v>

2997
02:26:30.921 --> 02:26:35.921
<v Speaker 3>a Dj playing music and it's dripping </v>
<v Speaker 3>water down and everyone's naked dancing </v>

2998
02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:42.460
<v Speaker 3>and Alex now allison gray or painting is</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful mural in that tent.</v>

2999
02:26:42.951 --> 02:26:43.760
<v Speaker 3>And so like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3000
02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:48.820
<v Speaker 3>corn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to visit them and we walked up </v>

3001
02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:48.820
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3002
02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:52.330
<v Speaker 3>those guys are so fucking cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then Alex starts with talking to me </v>

3003
02:26:52.330 --> 02:26:52.330
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

3004
02:26:52.330 --> 02:26:53.180
<v Speaker 3>This is right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3005
02:26:53.181 --> 02:26:58.181
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like Dr Bronner's family was in </v>

3006
02:26:58.181 --> 02:27:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Auschwitz where they had the showers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is the opposite of the showers </v>

3007
02:27:03.591 --> 02:27:08.591
<v Speaker 3>at Auschwitz because it's like naked </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in real showers dancing the music</v>

3008
02:27:09.831 --> 02:27:13.220
<v Speaker 3>in this like fucking super loving </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

3009
02:27:13.250 --> 02:27:16.700
<v Speaker 3>So their idea was to mirror the </v>
<v Speaker 3>holocaust or to create like,</v>

3010
02:27:16.970 --> 02:27:19.010
<v Speaker 3>not that you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to create like some,</v>

3011
02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:21.290
<v Speaker 3>like a response to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like,</v>

3012
02:27:21.291 --> 02:27:23.690
<v Speaker 3>here's what it could look like instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>of gassing people.</v>

3013
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:25.730
<v Speaker 3>There could be a DJ dripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3014
02:27:25.731 --> 02:27:27.200
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They spray it down.</v>

3015
02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:28.250
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3016
02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

3017
02:27:32.030 --> 02:27:37.030
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that Alex Gray was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying is this is the seed of a global </v>

3018
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:39.080
<v Speaker 3>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but seems to be.</v>

3019
02:27:39.470 --> 02:27:40.700
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be that would be.</v>

3020
02:27:40.830 --> 02:27:42.270
<v Speaker 4>There's something going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3021
02:27:42.330 --> 02:27:44.970
<v Speaker 4>There's a shift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a consciousness shift.</v>

3022
02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:47.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's this far reaches on both </v>
<v Speaker 4>sides.</v>

3023
02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:49.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's people that are resisting</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hardcore.</v>

3024
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:53.160
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of hardcore trump fans </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are resisting,</v>

3025
02:27:53.161 --> 02:27:58.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal immigrants and they want a </v>

3026
02:27:58.161 --> 02:28:01.640
<v Speaker 4>hardcore republican values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that are still </v>

3027
02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:05.451
<v Speaker 4>clinging to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then there's a lot of people that </v>

3028
02:28:05.451 --> 02:28:05.451
<v Speaker 4>were going to Bernie sanders re way too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3029
02:28:05.451 --> 02:28:07.290
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>realizing why you watch these,</v>

3030
02:28:07.291 --> 02:28:09.450
<v Speaker 4>to duke it out like King Kong versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>Godzilla.</v>

3031
02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:13.650
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting is the real loser is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the system itself,</v>

3032
02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:18.740
<v Speaker 4>our confidence in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our confidence in the system is at an </v>

3033
02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:20.940
<v Speaker 4>all time low and people that are your </v>
<v Speaker 4>age and older people like me,</v>

3034
02:28:21.050 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm 49.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you?</v>

3035
02:28:22.101 --> 02:28:26.290
<v Speaker 4>40 three now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty to 42 now to consider it.</v>

3036
02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:29.210
<v Speaker 4>We're like middle aged folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether we like it or not,</v>

3037
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:34.510
<v Speaker 4>but we grew up with no internet and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were exposed to the internet and now </v>

3038
02:28:35.451 --> 02:28:38.990
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing things like wikileaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The kids of today,</v>

3039
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:42.260
<v Speaker 4>they're going straight wiki links from </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking high school.</v>

3040
02:28:42.290 --> 02:28:45.050
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They knew about that in high school.</v>

3041
02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:47.420
<v Speaker 4>They they watch all the videos in high </v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

3042
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:50.360
<v Speaker 4>Those are the ones that I get the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>upset about.</v>

3043
02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:54.560
<v Speaker 4>When someone posts a video about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>flat earth or any kind of fucking stupid</v>

3044
02:28:54.561 --> 02:28:59.240
<v Speaker 4>shit where you're going to waste a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of time paying attention to nonsense,</v>

3045
02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:01.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not The world's Goddamn round.</v>

3046
02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:05.390
<v Speaker 4>They have a lot of video of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can go around it in a satellite.</v>

3047
02:29:05.391 --> 02:29:07.670
<v Speaker 4>You can go around in a jet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a fucking hoax.</v>

3048
02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:10.130
<v Speaker 4>Stop thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a waste of time.</v>

3049
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:12.500
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of other shit to </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on,</v>

3050
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:17.050
<v Speaker 4>but you'll get lost in that you'll get </v>
<v Speaker 4>lost and then that upsets me that,</v>

3051
02:29:17.051 --> 02:29:20.000
<v Speaker 4>that pisses me off and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible for it myself.</v>

3052
02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:25.160
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On this podcast or said a lot of shifts </v>

3053
02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:25.160
<v Speaker 4>that turned out not to be true.</v>

3054
02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:28.580
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's usually our obsessions are </v>

3055
02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:28.580
<v Speaker 5>temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think what I like what you said,</v>

3056
02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:30.510
<v Speaker 5>that the system is kind of short change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets out.</v>

3057
02:29:30.690 --> 02:29:35.690
<v Speaker 5>It reminds me of A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just watched on Netflix now it's </v>

3058
02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:39.710
<v Speaker 5>Luther's a crazy weekend I think as cod.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you saw the one with Al Sharpton.</v>

3059
02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:43.680
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's talking to Al Sharpton and he's</v>

3060
02:29:43.681 --> 02:29:48.681
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I let you down by not </v>

3061
02:29:48.681 --> 02:29:48.780
<v Speaker 5>getting arrested and Al Sharpton's </v>
<v Speaker 5>response as you let yourself down by not</v>

3062
02:29:48.781 --> 02:29:50.530
<v Speaker 5>getting her as did and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3063
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:53.230
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then at the end of.</v>

3064
02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:54.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do a spoiler</v>

3065
02:29:54.540 --> 02:29:55.350
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one man.</v>

3066
02:29:55.351 --> 02:30:00.351
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm thinking I didn't see that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a bunch of bots binge watched on </v>

3067
02:30:01.020 --> 02:30:01.500
<v Speaker 4>the first time.</v>

3068
02:30:01.530 --> 02:30:06.530
<v Speaker 5>The fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This episode is about black.</v>

3069
02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:09.120
<v Speaker 5>Are they black power people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blacks?</v>

3070
02:30:09.121 --> 02:30:10.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think lives matter.</v>

3071
02:30:10.650 --> 02:30:11.880
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like for that,</v>

3072
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:13.880
<v Speaker 5>this is like nation of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is Pete.</v>

3073
02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:18.240
<v Speaker 5>Like the one of the guys Louie was </v>
<v Speaker 5>hanging out with was like a hardcore,</v>

3074
02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:20.790
<v Speaker 5>like black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He hated white people.</v>

3075
02:30:20.791 --> 02:30:22.860
<v Speaker 5>White people are the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're the devil.</v>

3076
02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:24.020
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3077
02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:26.640
<v Speaker 5>but he was actually really sweet at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same time.</v>

3078
02:30:26.641 --> 02:30:28.830
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like really smart too.</v>

3079
02:30:29.010 --> 02:30:30.450
<v Speaker 5>This is a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember his name.</v>

3080
02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:32.480
<v Speaker 5>Dr Khalid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3081
02:30:32.530 --> 02:30:33.660
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he actually,</v>

3082
02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:38.460
<v Speaker 5>I looked him up because I always really </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanting to like follow him on twitter,</v>

3083
02:30:38.461 --> 02:30:43.461
<v Speaker 5>but he died of an aneurism but whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a crazy hardcore charismatic guy who</v>

3084
02:30:43.741 --> 02:30:48.741
<v Speaker 5>wants like the United States to give </v>
<v Speaker 5>back a swath of land to black people so </v>

3085
02:30:50.071 --> 02:30:52.290
<v Speaker 5>that they can go live there and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3086
02:30:52.291 --> 02:30:57.291
<v Speaker 5>Louis Theroux is such a likable guy that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could see that they were both kind </v>

3087
02:30:57.291 --> 02:30:58.530
<v Speaker 5>of liking each other when they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3088
02:30:58.531 --> 02:31:01.050
<v Speaker 5>And it was really sweet to watch and </v>
<v Speaker 5>really cool.</v>

3089
02:31:01.051 --> 02:31:06.051
<v Speaker 5>But you could also see that he was being</v>
<v Speaker 5>moved by recognizing how much a lot of </v>

3090
02:31:06.661 --> 02:31:09.270
<v Speaker 5>these people have gone through and how </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up it could be.</v>

3091
02:31:09.271 --> 02:31:14.271
<v Speaker 5>And this is before any of this shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened with the recent police </v>

3092
02:31:14.271 --> 02:31:17.331
<v Speaker 5>shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that another police shooting in 2001 </v>

3093
02:31:17.331 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 5>and they were going to go march about </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Sharpton was going to get arrested.</v>

3094
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:22.800
<v Speaker 3>But then so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>

3095
02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:27.830
<v Speaker 3>like Sharpton was like you let yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>down by not being part of this by not </v>

3096
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:29.370
<v Speaker 3>getting residents like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true,</v>

3097
02:31:29.371 --> 02:31:31.380
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While these people are up there fighting</v>

3098
02:31:31.381 --> 02:31:36.381
<v Speaker 3>like those fucking God damn cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Cro lord into a fight,</v>

3099
02:31:36.510 --> 02:31:41.510
<v Speaker 3>while they're up there debating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting and where our eyes are fixated </v>

3100
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:45.471
<v Speaker 3>on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can easily lose track of all this </v>

3101
02:31:45.471 --> 02:31:47.250
<v Speaker 3>stuff that we have definite control </v>
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

3102
02:31:47.251 --> 02:31:50.910
<v Speaker 3>which is we don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need to be so selfish.</v>

3103
02:31:51.390 --> 02:31:56.390
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to be so selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you start experimenting with </v>

3104
02:31:56.390 --> 02:31:57.420
<v Speaker 3>giving stuff away because you guaranteed</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3105
02:31:57.780 --> 02:32:00.780
<v Speaker 3>there is stuff that you have that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't need.</v>

3106
02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:06.140
<v Speaker 3>You literally don't need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in your garage that you covet kind </v>

3107
02:32:06.140 --> 02:32:07.320
<v Speaker 3>of like there's shit you covet that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't need,</v>

3108
02:32:07.321 --> 02:32:09.810
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to use or you have like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hoarder mentality where you're like,</v>

3109
02:32:09.811 --> 02:32:11.340
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might sell it one day,</v>

3110
02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:16.960
<v Speaker 3>who knows I'm going to definitely need </v>
<v Speaker 3>this vibrating bed one day or whatever </v>

3111
02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:16.960
<v Speaker 3>the fucking thing is that you have.</v>

3112
02:32:17.130 --> 02:32:22.130
<v Speaker 3>You don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could do an experiment where you </v>

3113
02:32:22.130 --> 02:32:22.450
<v Speaker 3>try to give it away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to,</v>

3114
02:32:22.451 --> 02:32:24.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to a charity or foundation,</v>

3115
02:32:24.481 --> 02:32:28.410
<v Speaker 3>but you figure out someone in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>community who maybe needs that thing for</v>

3116
02:32:28.411 --> 02:32:30.690
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone who could actually use it.</v>

3117
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:32.610
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be some lofty thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

3118
02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you got like an old fucking xbox </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your garage and your friend doesn't </v>

3119
02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:40.380
<v Speaker 3>have an xbox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give your friend the x box just for fun.</v>

3120
02:32:40.650 --> 02:32:43.230
<v Speaker 3>You could do these little experiments </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you do it,</v>

3121
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:45.660
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels good.</v>

3122
02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:48.840
<v Speaker 3>It like is a really great feeling to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start offloading shit.</v>

3123
02:32:48.841 --> 02:32:53.390
<v Speaker 3>You don't need into the community of </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and family and people around you</v>

3124
02:32:53.391 --> 02:32:56.520
<v Speaker 3>are a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people really need stuff man.</v>

3125
02:32:56.820 --> 02:32:58.530
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it won't hurt you at all.</v>

3126
02:32:58.860 --> 02:33:01.830
<v Speaker 3>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to me is like when you talk about,</v>

3127
02:33:01.831 --> 02:33:02.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we,</v>

3128
02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:05.010
<v Speaker 3>could burning man turn into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization?</v>

3129
02:33:05.550 --> 02:33:07.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not like,</v>

3130
02:33:07.441 --> 02:33:08.340
<v Speaker 3>you know who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3131
02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:14.090
<v Speaker 3>well I won't say who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of my friends was out there and </v>

3132
02:33:14.090 --> 02:33:16.860
<v Speaker 3>he works out there and I'm like not high</v>
<v Speaker 3>on psychedelics,</v>

3133
02:33:16.861 --> 02:33:20.280
<v Speaker 3>but I'm looking around and I know he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been going there for a long time and I'm</v>

3134
02:33:20.281 --> 02:33:23.670
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could this become society?</v>

3135
02:33:24.030 --> 02:33:24.750
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3136
02:33:25.170 --> 02:33:30.170
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if these people are out here for more </v>

3137
02:33:30.170 --> 02:33:30.170
<v Speaker 3>than four weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start killing children.</v>

3138
02:33:31.780 --> 02:33:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Whether that ready for that yet we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>ready for a couple of weeks at a time,</v>

3139
02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:37.780
<v Speaker 3>a couple weeks at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But 1:52</v>

3140
02:33:37.781 --> 02:33:39.120
<v Speaker 3>in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3141
02:33:39.270 --> 02:33:44.270
<v Speaker 3>And in the meantime you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>just kind of start experimenting with </v>

3142
02:33:44.911 --> 02:33:49.911
<v Speaker 3>not being selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about instead of looking at it as a </v>

3143
02:33:49.911 --> 02:33:51.030
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just experiment with being generous.</v>

3144
02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:52.320
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

3145
02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:56.430
<v Speaker 3>Think of generosity is the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>drop little love bombs.</v>

3146
02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3147
02:33:57.560 --> 02:33:59.010
<v Speaker 3>that's how I've always tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>

3148
02:33:59.030 --> 02:34:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it man,</v>

3149
02:34:00.481 --> 02:34:02.730
<v Speaker 3>those aren't little fucking love bombs </v>
<v Speaker 3>you leave.</v>

3150
02:34:02.731 --> 02:34:07.731
<v Speaker 3>I've seen not to like I've seen some </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking weeping waitresses when I turned</v>

3151
02:34:09.331 --> 02:34:11.100
<v Speaker 3>back to look as you're walking away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt,</v>

3152
02:34:11.101 --> 02:34:14.550
<v Speaker 3>and like that thing that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3153
02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:18.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing that you're doing,</v>

3154
02:34:18.191 --> 02:34:21.310
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that thing everyone can do that.</v>

3155
02:34:21.311 --> 02:34:24.830
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be the host of the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to you,</v>

3156
02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:25.710
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

3157
02:34:26.470 --> 02:34:29.300
<v Speaker 3>God forgive me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to</v>

3158
02:34:29.540 --> 02:34:32.420
<v Speaker 4>explain this to someone who was saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was a stupid thing to do.</v>

3159
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:33.680
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3160
02:34:33.681 --> 02:34:35.350
<v Speaker 4>you have to think of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3161
02:34:35.390 --> 02:34:37.400
<v Speaker 4>they were saying that like they're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to expect it.</v>

3162
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:43.510
<v Speaker 4>Every time a rich person goes there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna expect larger tips and </v>

3163
02:34:43.510 --> 02:34:45.450
<v Speaker 4>it's really not proportionate to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>service that they've given you about.</v>

3164
02:34:45.470 --> 02:34:48.830
<v Speaker 4>You can make someone happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes them unhappy and you don't feel</v>

3165
02:34:48.831 --> 02:34:52.100
<v Speaker 4>the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference between you leaving a one</v>

3166
02:34:52.101 --> 02:34:55.310
<v Speaker 4>number on a check for a tip and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3167
02:34:55.311 --> 02:34:58.070
<v Speaker 4>that was a good tip or another one </v>
<v Speaker 4>another go holy shit.</v>

3168
02:34:58.090 --> 02:35:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Like now they feel really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they just got a gift.</v>

3169
02:35:00.730 --> 02:35:03.170
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what the tip thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tip things.</v>

3170
02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:08.680
<v Speaker 4>That's it means that it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rare things that we have in our culture </v>

3171
02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:11.990
<v Speaker 4>where you could express gratitude in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>numerical amount.</v>

3172
02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:17.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that's the only way to </v>

3173
02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:19.121
<v Speaker 4>express gratitude because of course </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a way to express it with your </v>

3174
02:35:19.121 --> 02:35:19.121
<v Speaker 4>words and your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3175
02:35:19.121 --> 02:35:22.311
<v Speaker 4>your love and all that good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can express gratitude in a tip </v>

3176
02:35:22.311 --> 02:35:22.700
<v Speaker 4>form where you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3177
02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:24.630
<v Speaker 4>there's a number you can attach to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3178
02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:25.720
<v Speaker 4>like somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a.</v>

3179
02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:29.150
<v Speaker 4>If the bill is 50 bucks and you leave 50</v>
<v Speaker 4>bucks,</v>

3180
02:35:29.180 --> 02:35:34.180
<v Speaker 4>people go holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to a lot of people the difference </v>

3181
02:35:34.180 --> 02:35:36.740
<v Speaker 4>between $100 in your bank and $50 in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bank,</v>

3182
02:35:36.741 --> 02:35:38.750
<v Speaker 4>it's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're probably not going to feel that.</v>

3183
02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:41.210
<v Speaker 4>For some people you will be well,</v>

3184
02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:42.570
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>

3185
02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:47.380
<v Speaker 3>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to visit my dad in Florida and my</v>

3186
02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:52.440
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to this arcade that gives out </v>

3187
02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:56.221
<v Speaker 3>tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are those arcades that </v>

3188
02:35:56.221 --> 02:35:56.221
<v Speaker 3>dispenses tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

3189
02:35:56.221 --> 02:35:58.810
<v Speaker 3>Like you play fucking skeeball or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you'd like.</v>

3190
02:35:58.811 --> 02:36:01.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a casino for babies,</v>

3191
02:36:01.451 --> 02:36:03.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it prints these fucking tickets out.</v>

3192
02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:08.640
<v Speaker 3>You take the 10 tickets to the counter </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get like a piece of shit thing </v>

3193
02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:12.991
<v Speaker 3>that you'll never use like a nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like bear made of like Chinese and as </v>

3194
02:36:13.481 --> 02:36:14.830
<v Speaker 3>bestest or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3195
02:36:14.831 --> 02:36:16.780
<v Speaker 3>So like they exchange is dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

3196
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:21.910
<v Speaker 3>so these tickets we ended up accruing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this massive pile of fucking tickets.</v>

3197
02:36:21.911 --> 02:36:26.911
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're standing there looking at </v>

3198
02:36:26.911 --> 02:36:28.861
<v Speaker 3>this junk and then I looked down and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure other people out there have done </v>

3199
02:36:28.861 --> 02:36:32.071
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like a kid who's got a tiny </v>

3200
02:36:32.071 --> 02:36:34.141
<v Speaker 3>little bit of tickets and he's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at like the candy that a little </v>

<v Speaker 3>his brother</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3206
02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:52.230
<v Speaker 3>that look is way more valuable than any </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of piece of shit behind the </v>

3207
02:36:52.711 --> 02:36:53.570
<v Speaker 3>counter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3208
02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:56.010
<v Speaker 3>That is the essence of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3209
02:36:56.011 --> 02:36:57.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3210
02:36:57.031 --> 02:36:57.570
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3211
02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:02.010
<v Speaker 3>when you drop these love bombs off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not a one sided thing.</v>

3212
02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:06.900
<v Speaker 3>You're walking away feeling really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know what you just did.</v>

3213
02:37:07.170 --> 02:37:09.920
<v Speaker 3>You impacted a person's weak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

3214

<v Speaker 3>this person might not have money to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>their kids fucking groceries that week,</v>

3215
02:37:14.311 --> 02:37:15.800
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they do.</v>

3216
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.660
<v Speaker 3>They might not have been able to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>rent.</v>

3217
02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:20.480
<v Speaker 3>Now they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're walking away.</v>

3218
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Having created that shift in a person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe as temporary is,</v>

3219
02:37:24.390 --> 02:37:29.390
<v Speaker 3>it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still a shift in the direction of </v>

3220
02:37:29.390 --> 02:37:29.390
<v Speaker 3>the positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3221
02:37:29.390 --> 02:37:30.110
<v Speaker 3>So what you've done there as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned,</v>

3222
02:37:30.111 --> 02:37:35.111
<v Speaker 3>as a kind of magical act kind of miracle</v>

3224
02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:42.600
<v Speaker 3>they're like people who would go around </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like spray bottles and just spray </v>

3225
02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:47.261
<v Speaker 3>your sunglasses off for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which out in the desert is really </v>

3226
02:37:47.261 --> 02:37:50.171
<v Speaker 3>important because all the sand gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught in there and you can't fucking </v>

3227
02:37:50.171 --> 02:37:50.930
<v Speaker 3>see that's what they had to give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was just like helping you in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3229
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.760

<v Speaker 3>So just there giving a service to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't expect anything out of </v>

3231
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.190
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can do.</v>

3233
02:38:02.310 --> 02:38:07.040
<v Speaker 3>Anyone can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is definitely something you can do</v>

3234
02:38:07.310 --> 02:38:09.470
<v Speaker 3>that you're not doing and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

3235
02:38:09.530 --> 02:38:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Not because yourself is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing it just because you </v>

3236
02:38:14.530 --> 02:38:17.020
<v Speaker 3>haven't even realized you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like having a superpower that </v>

3237
02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:17.020
<v Speaker 3>you're not aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>

3238
02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:18.740
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Duncan?</v>

3244

<v Speaker 3>answer a question with a question that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>rude.</v>

3247
02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:42.020
<v Speaker 3>That's a poor taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

3248
02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you man.</v>

3249

<v Speaker 3>will run.</v>

3250
02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:49.250

<v Speaker 3>We've got to get out of here before it </v>

3252
02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:54.550
<v Speaker 3>blows up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Out of here anyway.</v>

3253
02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Who is going to blow up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is going to be fun to this thing,</v>

3254
02:38:58.850 --> 02:39:03.850
<v Speaker 3>this America you think it'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I don't know if this is going to </v>

3255
02:39:03.981 --> 02:39:04.580
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3256
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:07.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at this election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3257
02:39:07.041 --> 02:39:09.350
<v Speaker 3>this thing's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too volatile.</v>

3258
02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let it fucking collapsed by.</v>

3259
02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:17.060
<v Speaker 3>If it fucking collapses about children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are going to be.</v>

3260
02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:18.920
<v Speaker 3>What about the infrastructure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3261
02:39:18.921 --> 02:39:23.921
<v Speaker 3>I just had this conversation with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this conversation with Chris Ryan </v>

3262
02:39:23.921 --> 02:39:25.430
<v Speaker 3>and my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to do a shrimp rates united.</v>

3263
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:27.470
<v Speaker 3>And he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3264
02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:29.850
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about how post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3265
02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:34.730
<v Speaker 3>after disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody gives to each other and people</v>

3266
02:39:34.731 --> 02:39:35.390
<v Speaker 3>are very kind.</v>

3267
02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:38.690
<v Speaker 3>So if there was some kind of economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse,</v>

3268
02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:43.720
<v Speaker 3>some calamity or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I think what people would suddenly </v>

3269
02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:48.011
<v Speaker 3>realize is like what would happen is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that pendulum that swings in front of </v>

3270
02:39:48.011 --> 02:39:52.661
<v Speaker 3>the eyes of the sum total of all people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country and convinces us of the </v>

3271
02:39:52.661 --> 02:39:55.850
<v Speaker 3>importance of this small group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>secretive people.</v>

3272
02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Maybe for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing stopped swinging and we like </v>

3273
02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:01.520
<v Speaker 3>look away from it and look at each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

3274
02:40:01.521 --> 02:40:03.470
<v Speaker 3>And we realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

3275
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:07.640
<v Speaker 3>we've got each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be okay.</v>

3276
02:40:07.820 --> 02:40:11.690
<v Speaker 3>The fantasy of the fucking road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like grab your guns,</v>

3277
02:40:12.110 --> 02:40:15.030
<v Speaker 3>go rob the rich people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

3278
02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:20.060
<v Speaker 3>The idea that it's going to be some kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like the La riots times a million </v>

3279
02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:20.100
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3280
02:40:20.130 --> 02:40:23.160
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not what it's like at all.</v>

3281
02:40:23.161 --> 02:40:25.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like we can help each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

3284
02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:31.960
<v Speaker 3>thought we did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We maybe we didn't need them at all.</v>

3285
02:40:31.980 --> 02:40:36.980
<v Speaker 3>We've got the fucking roads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people who know how to fix </v>

3286

<v Speaker 3>roads.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know how to do such a super hip and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we need the fucking system.</v>

3288

3296
02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:01.980
<v Speaker 3>It could still happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could still happen.</v>

3297
02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:04.620
<v Speaker 3>It can really happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think such a hippie it.</v>

3298
02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:06.570
<v Speaker 3>There's no hospitals and that burning </v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3299
02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:11.660
<v Speaker 3>just cleaners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do have like a full hospital at </v>

3300
02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:11.730
<v Speaker 3>burning man.</v>

3301
02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:13.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go visit it,</v>

3302
02:41:13.021 --> 02:41:18.021
<v Speaker 3>but they say they have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a urgent care medical facility </v>

3303
02:41:18.021 --> 02:41:18.021
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really nice.</v>

3304
02:41:18.021 --> 02:41:22.371
<v Speaker 3>And they fucking need it to [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you think I'm a fucking super </v>

3305
02:41:22.371 --> 02:41:22.930
<v Speaker 3>hippie man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they have like a checkbox?</v>

3306
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:25.080
<v Speaker 3>Like do you have an injury or are you </v>
<v Speaker 3>freaking out?</v>

3307
02:41:25.081 --> 02:41:26.170
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the,</v>

3308
02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:29.610
<v Speaker 3>that's the Zendo project it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maps is doing.</v>

3309
02:41:29.611 --> 02:41:34.611
<v Speaker 3>So one of the cool things that Doblin is</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is they have a thing called Zendo,</v>

3310
02:41:35.490 --> 02:41:38.640
<v Speaker 3>which is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called psychedelic harm reduction.</v>

3311
02:41:38.970 --> 02:41:43.970
<v Speaker 3>And so they create,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the Porta Johns at burning man </v>

3312
02:41:43.970 --> 02:41:47.420
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these signs that they put up that say a </v>

3313
02:41:47.420 --> 02:41:47.420
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little night,</v>

3314
02:41:47.420 --> 02:41:50.520
<v Speaker 3>a little weirder than you expected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like come here.</v>

3315
02:41:50.730 --> 02:41:53.580
<v Speaker 3>And so like you go to this place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3316
02:41:53.850 --> 02:41:56.100
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa have this guy on your podcast.</v>

3317
02:41:56.101 --> 02:41:56.890
<v Speaker 3>His name's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3318
02:41:57.660 --> 02:41:59.850
<v Speaker 3>Dr Cole Marta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a psychiatrist.</v>

3319
02:41:59.850 --> 02:42:03.720
<v Speaker 3>He's like one of the people involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the MTMA for ptsd.</v>

3320
02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:05.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3321
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:10.670
<v Speaker 3>experiments that they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in the phase three clinical </v>

3322
02:42:10.670 --> 02:42:13.521
<v Speaker 3>trials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maps is but so he volunteers at the </v>

3323
02:42:13.521 --> 02:42:18.021
<v Speaker 3>Zendo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But basically what happens is it's the </v>

3324
02:42:18.021 --> 02:42:20.641
<v Speaker 3>safe space that Doblin is created where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go there if you're freaking out and </v>

3325
02:42:21.451 --> 02:42:23.220
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I going to get fucking arrested?</v>

3326
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:24.940
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no man,</v>

3327
02:42:25.330 --> 02:42:28.590
<v Speaker 3>just sit down and relax and like these </v>
<v Speaker 3>are trained,</v>

3328
02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:33.860
<v Speaker 3>this Guy Coal Marta man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's smart train clinicians and </v>

3329
02:42:33.860 --> 02:42:34.750
<v Speaker 3>if they're not clinicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've peaked.</v>

3330
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:39.790
<v Speaker 3>There are people who have been through </v>
<v Speaker 3>this program who just sit with you and </v>

3331
02:42:39.790 --> 02:42:43.011
<v Speaker 3>let you freak out without judging you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like just sit with you and let you </v>

3332
02:42:43.011 --> 02:42:45.030
<v Speaker 3>relax until you're having an okay time </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

3333
02:42:45.180 --> 02:42:50.180
<v Speaker 3>And then they let you go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of like losing your shit and </v>

3334
02:42:50.180 --> 02:42:54.201
<v Speaker 3>like getting arrested or losing your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and being around your friends who </v>

3335
02:42:54.201 --> 02:42:54.330
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the Fuck's wrong with you?</v>

3336
02:42:54.330 --> 02:42:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to be around like really smart </v>

3337
02:42:59.330 --> 02:43:02.271
<v Speaker 3>trained people who know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to like not just like help you </v>

3338
02:43:02.371 --> 02:43:07.371
<v Speaker 3>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but help you use this event to like </v>

3339
02:43:07.371 --> 02:43:11.030
<v Speaker 3>transform your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of times a bad trip is </v>

3340
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:13.540
<v Speaker 3>like a transformative moment for someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're around the right people.</v>

3341
02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:15.280
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3342
02:43:15.310 --> 02:43:17.200
<v Speaker 3>maps is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

3343
02:43:17.201 --> 02:43:22.201
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done so much cool shit and Rick </v>

3344
02:43:22.201 --> 02:43:22.201
<v Speaker 3>Doblin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just such an interesting guy.</v>

3345
02:43:22.201 --> 02:43:25.360
<v Speaker 3>I've had him on twice had a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to them on the podcast twice.</v>

3346
02:43:25.361 --> 02:43:28.600
<v Speaker 3>He's such a fascinating dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a warrior man.</v>

3347
02:43:28.601 --> 02:43:33.601
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the how might he spent </v>
<v Speaker 3>his entire life like we know we sit here</v>

3348
02:43:35.740 --> 02:43:39.970
<v Speaker 3>and we fucking rail against the system </v>
<v Speaker 3>and marijuana and like ahh,</v>

3349
02:43:40.300 --> 02:43:43.030
<v Speaker 3>but Doblin man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like on the front lines,</v>

3350
02:43:43.031 --> 02:43:48.031
<v Speaker 3>like this guy is like deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply involved in doing it the right </v>

3351
02:43:48.521 --> 02:43:48.760
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

3352
02:43:49.290 --> 02:43:51.270
<v Speaker 3>He's doing it through the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3353
02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:53.110
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is cool.</v>

3354
02:43:53.410 --> 02:43:58.410
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting like he was detailing </v>
<v Speaker 3>like getting it passed and what was </v>

3355
02:43:58.410 --> 02:44:02.491
<v Speaker 3>going to be entailed and getting this </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy through and then what would be </v>

3356
02:44:02.491 --> 02:44:04.600
<v Speaker 3>next and how this is a longterm thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing over long,</v>

3357
02:44:04.900 --> 02:44:06.010
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years.</v>

3358
02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave.</v>

3359
02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:10.840
<v Speaker 3>He gave a talk at burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just like when you like he just</v>

3360
02:44:10.841 --> 02:44:15.841
<v Speaker 3>detailing the like the war on drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like why it's happened and what it is </v>

3361
02:44:15.841 --> 02:44:20.731
<v Speaker 3>and then like his step by step plan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you realize like this guy is in a </v>

3362
02:44:21.310 --> 02:44:26.310
<v Speaker 3>phase three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>phase three of clinical trials which </v>

3363
02:44:26.310 --> 02:44:30.511
<v Speaker 3>never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with a schedule one substance that </v>

3364
02:44:30.511 --> 02:44:34.600
<v Speaker 3>theoretically could like the results </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're getting are very good,</v>

3365
02:44:34.601 --> 02:44:39.601
<v Speaker 3>but if people who have ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they go to the doctor,</v>

3366
02:44:39.940 --> 02:44:44.940
<v Speaker 3>the doctor will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'll prescribe xanax and maybe </v>

3367
02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:46.420
<v Speaker 3>they'll give you like cognitive behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy or something,</v>

3368
02:44:46.421 --> 02:44:51.421
<v Speaker 3>but like the idea that there might be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to give someone Mgma,</v>

3369
02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:57.480
<v Speaker 3>mgma mixed in with like a specific type </v>
<v Speaker 3>of therapy and that that could actually,</v>

3370
02:44:59.250 --> 02:45:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say cure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they set their mind to lift the </v>

3371
02:45:04.270 --> 02:45:05.650
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weight of,</v>

3372
02:45:05.710 --> 02:45:10.710
<v Speaker 3>of this horror off of them or at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>allow it to like dabble and explained </v>

3373
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:11.260
<v Speaker 3>why he thinks that works.</v>

3374
02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:16.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to try to repeat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that this could work for </v>

3375
02:45:16.260 --> 02:45:17.950
<v Speaker 3>real is just the most incredible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

3376
02:45:17.951 --> 02:45:20.470
<v Speaker 3>That guy would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should get a Nobel prize.</v>

3377
02:45:20.530 --> 02:45:22.900
<v Speaker 3>I think he did explain it on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

3378
02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:24.640
<v Speaker 3>Sydney to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember Jamie?</v>

3379
02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you did though.</v>

3380
02:45:27.161 --> 02:45:30.510
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he explained how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're when you.</v>

3381
02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>short term longterm memory,</v>

3382
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:37.570
<v Speaker 3>so when you have a traumatic event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets stuck in short term memory.</v>

3383
02:45:37.571 --> 02:45:40.360
<v Speaker 3>Somehow it's looping there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not getting filed away in the right</v>

3384
02:45:40.361 --> 02:45:41.740
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God forgives me.</v>

3385
02:45:41.741 --> 02:45:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Everyone listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doblin coal,</v>

3386
02:45:43.591 --> 02:45:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Marty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever.</v>

3387
02:45:44.141 --> 02:45:48.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm ruining this in front of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like it like it apparently something</v>

3388
02:45:48.851 --> 02:45:53.851
<v Speaker 3>about revisiting the experience under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the influence of Mtma causes it to </v>

3389
02:45:54.521 --> 02:45:58.330
<v Speaker 3>somehow be refiled in the right part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain again,</v>

3390
02:45:58.331 --> 02:46:02.680
<v Speaker 3>so it's not sticking out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>forefront of your experiences,</v>

3391
02:46:02.681 --> 02:46:07.681
<v Speaker 3>so it's not like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing isn't always there like a </v>

3392
02:46:07.681 --> 02:46:09.340
<v Speaker 3>flash bulb light or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another thing that's infuriating.</v>

3393
02:46:09.380 --> 02:46:10.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's almost</v>

3394
02:46:10.430 --> 02:46:15.430
<v Speaker 4>to me is infuriating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As teenagers getting hooked on flat </v>

3395
02:46:15.430 --> 02:46:19.451
<v Speaker 4>earth videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more infuriating even that this is </v>

3396
02:46:19.451 --> 02:46:19.850
<v Speaker 4>always been there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This has always been there.</v>

3397
02:46:20.060 --> 02:46:25.060
<v Speaker 4>This has always been there and they made</v>
<v Speaker 4>it illegal and all these people that </v>

3398
02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:28.541
<v Speaker 4>suffered could have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could have gotten relief through this </v>

3399
02:46:28.541 --> 02:46:29.720
<v Speaker 4>all long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A long time ago.</v>

3400
02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:30.470
<v Speaker 4>I now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3401
02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:33.540
<v Speaker 4>if they just recognized this early on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had been super objective about it.</v>

3402
02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:33.890
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3403
02:46:33.891 --> 02:46:38.891
<v Speaker 4>clue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We clearly have an issue with ptsd in </v>

3404
02:46:38.891 --> 02:46:39.530
<v Speaker 4>soldiers and police men and people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have gone through domestic abuse.</v>

3405
02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:41.460
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people with PTSD.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can.</v>

3406
02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:45.230
<v Speaker 4>This king literally changed the course </v>
<v Speaker 4>of our nation,</v>

3407
02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:50.680
<v Speaker 4>but do you keep up the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dea is corrupt system to keep up this </v>

3408
02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:55.511
<v Speaker 4>nasty business of arresting people for </v>

<v Speaker 2>John Ghomeshi,</v>

3455
02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:13.960
<v Speaker 2>they kicked him off the radio show </v>
<v Speaker 2>because all these women were claiming </v>

3456
02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:15.540
<v Speaker 2>that they had sex with them and even to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like beat them up and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>together for us.</v>

3471
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't get to become a super hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you noticed something's different </v>

3472
02:50:06.910 --> 02:50:07.260
<v Speaker 2>burning man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3473
02:50:07.261 --> 02:50:09.630
<v Speaker 2>They got got out of the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have there.</v>

3474
02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Was that from 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have a cool looking 300 </v>

3475
02:50:15.180 --> 02:50:15.810
<v Speaker 2>employees at a hospital that has 52 </v>
<v Speaker 2>beds.</v>

3476
02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It set an actual hospital,</v>

3477
02:50:17.941 --> 02:50:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Humboldt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>general hospital employees come and help</v>

3478
02:50:19.921 --> 02:50:24.921
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have tickets for burning man to </v>

3479
02:50:24.921 --> 02:50:24.921
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if the biome now.</v>

3480
02:50:24.921 --> 02:50:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that sound crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like it doesn't make any </v>

3481
02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:31.581
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is the only way to keep people </v>

3482
02:50:31.581 --> 02:50:33.270
<v Speaker 2>from overwhelming place because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna if you have tickets,</v>

3483
02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:35.280
<v Speaker 2>that means you can only sell a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of tickets.</v>

3484
02:50:35.450 --> 02:50:37.560
<v Speaker 2>It means Bernie man sells out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3485
02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3486
02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:39.220
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3487
02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:40.680
<v Speaker 2>the service here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3488
02:50:40.930 --> 02:50:43.980
<v Speaker 2>the hospital was paid for by the burning</v>
<v Speaker 2>man organization.</v>

3489
02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:47.190
<v Speaker 2>It costs $455,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that year.</v>

3490
02:50:47.250 --> 02:50:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

3491
02:50:49.071 --> 02:50:49.640
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3492
02:50:49.660 --> 02:50:51.110
<v Speaker 2>so that's where the tickets go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3493
02:50:51.550 --> 02:50:53.290
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To show their website where it all goes.</v>

3494
02:50:53.310 --> 02:50:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make sense though,</v>

3495
02:50:54.451 --> 02:50:57.030
<v Speaker 2>is limiting the number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that?</v>

3496
02:50:57.031 --> 02:50:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that seem illogical?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3497
02:50:58.831 --> 02:51:00.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if a 150,000</v>

3498
02:51:00.811 --> 02:51:03.990
<v Speaker 2>people in that hospital now is fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't,</v>

3499
02:51:04.630 --> 02:51:08.250
<v Speaker 2>but they just have to ramp it up based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on how many people buy tickets.</v>

3500
02:51:08.430 --> 02:51:13.430
<v Speaker 2>As long as you just keep having tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'll have more money to spend on </v>

3501
02:51:13.430 --> 02:51:15.630
<v Speaker 2>more hospitals and you would just sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of plan it accordingly,</v>

3502
02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:20.840
<v Speaker 2>but maybe they're trying to like slowly </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop it where they don't want it to </v>

3503
02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:21.900
<v Speaker 2>get completely chaotic and out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

3504
02:51:21.901 --> 02:51:25.950
<v Speaker 2>which is what it definitely would do if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had no restrictions whatsoever.</v>

3505
02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while you were urinating,</v>

3506
02:51:27.391 --> 02:51:32.391
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about the restrictions </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the population at burning man and </v>

3507
02:51:32.391 --> 02:51:32.391
<v Speaker 2>then I found that to be a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>odd.</v>

3508
02:51:32.520 --> 02:51:37.520
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense that they're selling </v>
<v Speaker 2>tickets to it because especially there </v>

3509
02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:40.340
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We found out how much it costs for the </v>

3510
02:51:40.340 --> 02:51:40.340
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four hundred and $25,000</v>

3511
02:51:40.340 --> 02:51:40.650
<v Speaker 2>for a year or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>

3512
02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:42.630
<v Speaker 2>Fifty five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four 55.</v>

3513
02:51:42.750 --> 02:51:47.750
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why wouldn't they just allow more </v>

3514
02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:50.100
<v Speaker 2>people to buy tickets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't they just keep selling to a</v>

3515
02:51:50.101 --> 02:51:54.450
<v Speaker 2>number I might guess would be that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like they have to work out deals</v>

3516
02:51:54.451 --> 02:51:58.370
<v Speaker 2>with growth and like the surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas and what's lock.</v>

3517
02:51:58.400 --> 02:52:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Go relax the town right before you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fucking burning man.</v>

3518
02:52:01.411 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 2>That once a year just gets like this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this huge</v>

3519
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:08.170
<v Speaker 1>influx of Dell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like they are.</v>

3520
02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

3521
02:52:08.951 --> 02:52:13.951
<v Speaker 1>The bureau of land management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bureau of land management is the same </v>

3522
02:52:13.951 --> 02:52:18.541
<v Speaker 1>thing that manages a public land for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like hiking and fishing and rafting and </v>

3523
02:52:20.890 --> 02:52:21.880
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3524
02:52:21.881 --> 02:52:24.190
<v Speaker 1>And so like basically if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3525
02:52:24.460 --> 02:52:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you could see that because they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>given in this and basically it's a shake</v>

3526
02:52:28.141 --> 02:52:28.750
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3527
02:52:28.751 --> 02:52:32.800
<v Speaker 1>So like if you want to do this festival </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe paying us well,</v>

3528
02:52:32.801 --> 02:52:37.801
<v Speaker 1>would you say that it's a shakedown or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to control the population </v>

3529
02:52:37.801 --> 02:52:38.260
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't want to getting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of control?</v>

3530
02:52:38.280 --> 02:52:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know of land management has a </v>

3531
02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:45.661
<v Speaker 1>reasonable being dev a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern that it could get completely </v>

3532
02:52:46.001 --> 02:52:48.210
<v Speaker 1>overrun with hippies and it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive.</v>

3533
02:52:48.240 --> 02:52:53.240
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a reasonable concern </v>

3534
02:52:53.240 --> 02:52:53.350
<v Speaker 1>and there's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3535
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:55.660
<v Speaker 1>there's also some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm not,</v>

3536
02:52:55.661 --> 02:52:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3537
02:52:56.260 --> 02:52:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps there could be maybe some </v>
<v Speaker 1>profiteering happening,</v>

3538
02:52:59.170 --> 02:53:04.170
<v Speaker 1>but here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they make more money by </v>

3539
02:53:04.170 --> 02:53:06.420
<v Speaker 1>allowing more people in if they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to tear the move is to just say,</v>

3540
02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think burning man material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3541
02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Sound Bureau of land management.</v>

3542
02:53:11.711 --> 02:53:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3543
02:53:12.521 --> 02:53:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Why would they just open it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighty $1,000,000.</v>

3544
02:53:16.150 --> 02:53:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that burning man's expenses.</v>

3545
02:53:20.260 --> 02:53:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30.</v>

3546
02:53:21.460 --> 02:53:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty million.</v>

3547
02:53:23.141 --> 02:53:28.141
<v Speaker 1>One hundred $85,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burning man was once a scrappy little </v>

3548
02:53:28.541 --> 02:53:31.750
<v Speaker 1>desert gatherings become a multifaceted </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional operation.</v>

3549
02:53:31.751 --> 02:53:36.751
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The burning man project produces the </v>

3550
02:53:36.751 --> 02:53:38.911
<v Speaker 1>nation's largest permanent event on </v>
<v Speaker 1>public land and supports and extensive </v>

3551
02:53:39.191 --> 02:53:43.150
<v Speaker 1>global network of events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists and civic initiatives.</v>

3552
02:53:44.290 --> 02:53:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

3553
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that's so much money.</v>

3554
02:53:47.050 --> 02:53:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to hear something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even dod million.</v>

3555
02:53:49.211 --> 02:53:50.290
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>

3556
02:53:50.440 --> 02:53:53.710
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy about it is when you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

3557
02:53:54.190 --> 02:53:55.540
<v Speaker 1>there's no trash on the ground.</v>

3558
02:53:56.140 --> 02:53:59.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really not too bad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call it the matter out of place.</v>

3559
02:54:00.270 --> 02:54:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Boop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boop.</v>

3560
02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:06.000
<v Speaker 1>So like what they do after the festival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will like go from camp to camp,</v>

3561
02:54:06.760 --> 02:54:10.780
<v Speaker 1>looking for where the trash is and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they find any trash they like,</v>

3562
02:54:10.810 --> 02:54:15.810
<v Speaker 1>like if someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say broken in a bottle or </v>

3563
02:54:15.810 --> 02:54:15.810
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3564
02:54:15.810 --> 02:54:19.320
<v Speaker 1>They will bring like a team of 11 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in to sift through the sand to get every</v>

3565
02:54:20.651 --> 02:54:25.651
<v Speaker 1>single bit of glass out of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sand so that it goes back to being just </v>

3566
02:54:25.651 --> 02:54:30.511
<v Speaker 1>what it was before alkaline desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

3567
02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:35.870
<v Speaker 1>that comes from the cacophonous because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the good confidence sayings is </v>

3568
02:54:35.870 --> 02:54:35.960
<v Speaker 1>leave no trace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

3569
02:54:35.970 --> 02:54:40.970
<v Speaker 1>the idea is like they go to a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they're insane thing and then leave </v>

3570
02:54:40.970 --> 02:54:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's like they were never there </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

3571
02:54:41.500 --> 02:54:43.810
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty trippy to take us so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

3572
02:54:44.050 --> 02:54:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3573
02:54:46.220 --> 02:54:47.690
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3574
02:54:47.780 --> 02:54:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I wonder like this didn't exist 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years ago.</v>

3575
02:54:50.910 --> 02:54:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Like what's it going to be like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years from now?</v>

3576
02:54:53.110 --> 02:54:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say when people give up the</v>

3577
02:54:58.031 --> 02:55:03.031
<v Speaker 1>ideas that have sort of imprisoned each </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation about keeping up with the </v>

3578
02:55:03.591 --> 02:55:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Joneses</v>

3579
02:55:04.580 --> 02:55:09.580
<v Speaker 2>and about belonging to the right country</v>
<v Speaker 2>club and about all the things that </v>

3580
02:55:09.580 --> 02:55:12.110
<v Speaker 2>people strive for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moving up the corporate ladder,</v>

3581
02:55:12.590 --> 02:55:15.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff and clinking glasses like</v>

3582
02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:20.800
<v Speaker 2>you're in a fucking Leonardo dicaprio </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie before it takes a turn for the </v>

3583
02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:22.040
<v Speaker 2>worst traits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3584
02:55:22.780 --> 02:55:27.780
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's literally what it is before it </v>

3585
02:55:27.780 --> 02:55:28.310
<v Speaker 2>all starts getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're clinking glasses.</v>

3586
02:55:28.490 --> 02:55:29.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody's hoping for.</v>

3587
02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3588
02:55:33.420 --> 02:55:34.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3589
02:55:34.741 --> 02:55:35.430
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3590
02:55:35.431 --> 02:55:40.431
<v Speaker 3>we're evolving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's evolving and we're learning </v>

3591
02:55:40.431 --> 02:55:41.760
<v Speaker 3>a lot of stuff right now and like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3592
02:55:41.790 --> 02:55:46.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're learning a lot of stuff and part </v>

3593
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:48.921
<v Speaker 3>of I think hopefully what we're learning</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that certain things cannot be </v>

3594
02:55:49.050 --> 02:55:54.050
<v Speaker 3>commodified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's no way to really put a </v>

3595
02:55:54.050 --> 02:55:54.410
<v Speaker 3>price on certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3596
02:55:55.230 --> 02:56:00.230
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like they're against money or </v>

3597
02:56:00.230 --> 02:56:00.870
<v Speaker 3>against people making money or anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

3598
02:56:00.871 --> 02:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>The idea is like make money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spend the whole year making money,</v>

3599
02:56:05.430 --> 02:56:10.430
<v Speaker 3>but then let's fucking ignite it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of your amazing sculpture that you </v>

3600
02:56:10.741 --> 02:56:13.470
<v Speaker 3>brought out into the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other cool thing is too,</v>

3601
02:56:13.500 --> 02:56:17.700
<v Speaker 3>when you're looking at these sculptures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't see like a plaque that's like,</v>

3602
02:56:17.701 --> 02:56:21.540
<v Speaker 3>this was made by Tim French.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Follow me at Tim.</v>

3603
02:56:23.700 --> 02:56:25.150
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's,</v>

3604
02:56:25.650 --> 02:56:30.650
<v Speaker 3>no one's signing their fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like you're out there and it's like </v>

3605
02:56:30.650 --> 02:56:33.860
<v Speaker 3>you're standing underneath some out </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical like sphere,</v>

3606
02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:35.040
<v Speaker 3>nickel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laser,</v>

3607
02:56:35.041 --> 02:56:40.041
<v Speaker 3>globe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That spinning in a way that the lights </v>

3608
02:56:40.041 --> 02:56:42.561
<v Speaker 3>make it look like the ground you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing on is like rotating and </v>

3609
02:56:42.561 --> 02:56:43.260
<v Speaker 3>shifting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who made that?</v>

3610
02:56:43.470 --> 02:56:46.170
<v Speaker 3>Why did they make that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did they get it out in the desert?</v>

3611
02:56:46.290 --> 02:56:49.170
<v Speaker 3>How are they fueling this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is this?</v>

3612
02:56:49.380 --> 02:56:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Or like the Mat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's tesla coils everywhere out </v>

3613
02:56:54.380 --> 02:56:57.141
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just tesla coils sparking in the </v>

3614
02:56:57.141 --> 02:56:59.780
<v Speaker 3>fucking middle of the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone got a tesla coil out to burn it.</v>

3615
02:56:59.790 --> 02:57:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Like just when you consider getting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tesla coil into the middle of the </v>

3616
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:06.480
<v Speaker 3>fucking desert and then setting it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it works.</v>

3617
02:57:06.690 --> 02:57:07.860
<v Speaker 3>I think they have videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

3618
02:57:07.861 --> 02:57:10.060
<v Speaker 3>If you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty cool looking man.</v>

3619
02:57:10.310 --> 02:57:13.350
<v Speaker 3>That just sitting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

3620

3621
02:57:16.770 --> 02:57:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or like Dick Slides.</v>

3622
02:57:19.170 --> 02:57:21.870
<v Speaker 3>What does that giant thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy next to the tesla coil.</v>

3623
02:57:21.910 --> 02:57:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that.</v>

3624
02:57:23.220 --> 02:57:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Floating eyes and what's in his hands.</v>

3625
02:57:25.950 --> 02:57:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't see it.</v>

3626
02:57:27.060 --> 02:57:32.060
<v Speaker 3>They have Dick Slides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have like these slides shape like </v>

3627
02:57:32.060 --> 02:57:34.821

<v Speaker 3>your sperm getting shot into a pussy </v>

3628

<v Speaker 3>fucking trippy festival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the coolest thing ever,</v>

3629
02:57:38.761 --> 02:57:43.761

<v Speaker 3>They have an entire spectrum of just </v>

3630
02:57:43.761 --> 02:57:43.761
<v Speaker 3>insanity out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's pretty amazing.</v>

3633

<v Speaker 3>Or that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look up the catacombs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They made these fucking pyramids out </v>

02:58:08.571 --> 02:58:08.571
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3646
02:58:13.980 --> 02:58:18.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they do this during the time that </v>

3647
02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:18.980
<v Speaker 5>they're there and then they burn it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

3648
02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:21.630
<v Speaker 5>they come in early so they come in like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a cow like three weeks earlier.</v>

3649
02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:26.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure the exact amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 5>they construct this thing and then they </v>

3650
02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:28.110
<v Speaker 5>just fucking burn it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They burn those things in the morning at</v>

3651
02:58:28.111 --> 02:58:30.330
<v Speaker 5>like 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>AM dude.</v>

3652
02:58:30.630 --> 02:58:31.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see.</v>

3653
02:58:31.801 --> 02:58:34.080
<v Speaker 5>Look at the dust devils that kicked up </v>
<v Speaker 5>next to it.</v>

3654
02:58:34.110 --> 02:58:38.610
<v Speaker 5>Like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A dust devils are incredible.</v>

3655
02:58:39.330 --> 02:58:40.890
<v Speaker 5>That's wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A little dust.</v>

3656
02:58:40.891 --> 02:58:42.600
<v Speaker 5>Tornadoes and just roam through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>camps.</v>

3657
02:58:42.601 --> 02:58:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Dude.</v>

3658
02:58:44.041 --> 02:58:47.130
<v Speaker 5>When these storms kick up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the most beautiful,</v>

3659
02:58:47.131 --> 02:58:52.131
<v Speaker 5>insane thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just all of a sudden out of the </v>

3660
02:58:52.131 --> 02:58:53.931
<v Speaker 5>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything goes from being completely </v>

3661
02:58:53.931 --> 02:58:55.410
<v Speaker 5>clear to just being completely obscured </v>
<v Speaker 5>with this very fine dust,</v>

3662
02:58:55.411 --> 02:59:00.411
<v Speaker 5>which is why everyone's got led lights </v>
<v Speaker 5>on because the lights glow through the </v>

3663
02:59:00.411 --> 02:59:01.170
<v Speaker 5>dust so that you don't run into </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody.</v>

3664
02:59:01.380 --> 02:59:03.650
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh</v>

3665
02:59:03.950 --> 02:59:06.200
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a weird choice though.</v>

3666
02:59:06.201 --> 02:59:09.200
<v Speaker 5>Why wouldn't they choose to do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere where it's like nice.</v>

3667
02:59:09.890 --> 02:59:11.660
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that statement they're making is</v>

3668
02:59:11.661 --> 02:59:13.850
<v Speaker 5>we can do this in the middle of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>

3669
02:59:13.851 --> 02:59:15.680
<v Speaker 5>Think what we could see you everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>

3670
02:59:16.360 --> 02:59:18.110
<v Speaker 5>You think they did that on purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3671
02:59:18.111 --> 02:59:22.490
<v Speaker 5>I think it evolved like the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that originally the idea was the</v>

3672
02:59:22.491 --> 02:59:25.100
<v Speaker 5>cacophonous had this idea of what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>called the zone trip,</v>

3673
02:59:25.490 --> 02:59:30.490
<v Speaker 5>which is that if you take a group of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and bring them out of their </v>

3674
02:59:30.490 --> 02:59:33.641
<v Speaker 5>natural habitat and you then something </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of magical happens and so there's a</v>

3675
02:59:34.101 --> 02:59:37.430
<v Speaker 5>story of how will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first time they went out there,</v>

3676
02:59:37.431 --> 02:59:42.431
<v Speaker 5>they drew a line in the sand and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>are like everything after this line as </v>

3677
02:59:43.341 --> 02:59:46.550
<v Speaker 5>the zone and like that's when that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>the first burning man is.</v>

3678
02:59:46.551 --> 02:59:51.551
<v Speaker 5>It just was like they just picked a </v>
<v Speaker 5>desolate place so they wouldn't get </v>

3679
02:59:51.551 --> 02:59:53.030
<v Speaker 5>bothered by people because what was </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening is.</v>

3680
02:59:54.050 --> 02:59:55.790
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's Larry.</v>

3681
02:59:55.820 --> 02:59:57.680
<v Speaker 5>Will you look up Larry burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Larry.</v>

3682
02:59:57.681 --> 02:59:59.030
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember his last name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3683
02:59:59.360 --> 03:00:00.860
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Larry Harvey.</v>

3684
03:00:01.070 --> 03:00:04.550
<v Speaker 5>So what was happening is Larry Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going to the beach.</v>

3685
03:00:04.551 --> 03:00:08.960
<v Speaker 5>He went to the beach and they just burnt</v>
<v Speaker 5>this like an effigy of a man.</v>

3686
03:00:08.990 --> 03:00:13.990
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just ignited this effigy at the </v>

3687
03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:14.900
<v Speaker 5>beach and Larry Harvey won't say why </v>
<v Speaker 5>they did it.</v>

3688
03:00:14.930 --> 03:00:15.860
<v Speaker 5>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They won't.</v>

3689
03:00:15.861 --> 03:00:18.710
<v Speaker 5>Everybody wants to know like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well what was their reason behind it?</v>

3690
03:00:18.860 --> 03:00:23.860
<v Speaker 5>So like they just went and burned this </v>
<v Speaker 5>avid g out there and then they were </v>

3691
03:00:23.860 --> 03:00:26.501
<v Speaker 5>doing it like I think a few years in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>row and it kept getting bigger and </v>

3692
03:00:26.501 --> 03:00:31.421
<v Speaker 5>bigger and bigger and then the somehow </v>
<v Speaker 5>the cacophony society got involved </v>

3693
03:00:31.460 --> 03:00:36.460
<v Speaker 5>because it got so big one year the cops </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't let him burn it and so then </v>

3694
03:00:36.460 --> 03:00:40.361
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they ended up scheduling a cacophonous </v>

3695
03:00:40.361 --> 03:00:41.740
<v Speaker 5>event,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what I've got the flyer,</v>

3696
03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:42.260
<v Speaker 5>my phone.</v>

3697
03:00:42.260 --> 03:00:45.200
<v Speaker 5>It's like the burning of the man and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>black rock desert.</v>

3698
03:00:45.201 --> 03:00:50.201
<v Speaker 5>And so they like redid that event and </v>
<v Speaker 5>took the burning man out there.</v>

3699
03:00:51.081 --> 03:00:56.081
<v Speaker 5>That was the first burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they started doing it every </v>

3700
03:00:56.081 --> 03:00:56.810
<v Speaker 5>year just like they were doing it at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>beach in San Francisco.</v>

3701
03:00:56.811 --> 03:00:59.950
<v Speaker 5>But it kept getting bigger and bigger </v>
<v Speaker 5>and bigger.</v>

3702
03:00:59.951 --> 03:01:01.690
<v Speaker 5>And then it became like a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

3703
03:01:01.740 --> 03:01:04.270
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a confidence to vent basically</v>

3704
03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:07.690
<v Speaker 5>that spun out of control and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>turned into this.</v>

3705
03:01:08.170 --> 03:01:13.170
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is one of the largest festivals on </v>

3706
03:01:13.170 --> 03:01:13.170
<v Speaker 5>earth?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

3707
03:01:13.170 --> 03:01:13.170
<v Speaker 5>when is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When does it take place?</v>

3708
03:01:13.170 --> 03:01:15.370
<v Speaker 5>Labor Day weekend with the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>

3709
03:01:15.850 --> 03:01:18.880
<v Speaker 5>Like the first week in September last </v>
<v Speaker 5>week in August summer,</v>

3710
03:01:18.881 --> 03:01:21.880
<v Speaker 5>so it just ended the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it just ended a few weeks ago.</v>

3711
03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:23.560
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you can look it up.</v>

3712
03:01:23.561 --> 03:01:25.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure that data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That can be totally off on that.</v>

3713
03:01:25.660 --> 03:01:27.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either way.</v>

3714
03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:29.920
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sounds crazy.</v>

3715
03:01:30.230 --> 03:01:31.510
<v Speaker 5>It sounds amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3716
03:01:31.540 --> 03:01:32.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty incredible,</v>

3717
03:01:32.801 --> 03:01:34.090
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty cool.</v>

3718
03:01:34.091 --> 03:01:34.930
<v Speaker 5>You got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3719
03:01:34.931 --> 03:01:37.060

<v Speaker 5>I feel like maybe I do have to go,</v>

3720
03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:38.560
<v Speaker 5>but when you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to do it,</v>

3721
03:01:38.561 --> 03:01:43.561
<v Speaker 5>right man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the problem is like a lot of </v>

3722
03:01:43.561 --> 03:01:43.561
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

3723
03:01:43.561 --> 03:01:43.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could do it whatever way you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want,</v>

3724
03:01:43.691 --> 03:01:45.220
<v Speaker 5>but there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you telling people how to do it?</v>

3725
03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:48.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to tell you how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you how to not do it.</v>

3726
03:01:48.130 --> 03:01:49.450
<v Speaker 5>How do you not do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3727
03:01:49.451 --> 03:01:52.270
<v Speaker 5>you heard what happened to the camp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wide ocean camp out there,</v>

3728
03:01:52.271 --> 03:01:54.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the wide ocean camp?</v>

3729
03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:57.310
<v Speaker 5>So there these camps called like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what the White Ocean camp is?</v>

3730
03:01:57.620 --> 03:02:00.060
<v Speaker 5>I think that's that story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want wanna blow story Buchloh it</v>

3731
03:02:00.230 --> 03:02:05.230
<v Speaker 5>when you want to see people's power </v>
<v Speaker 5>lines and shit because it's like the </v>

3732
03:02:05.230 --> 03:02:09.751
<v Speaker 5>problem is like there's like you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>be a little too inclusive there and so </v>

3733
03:02:09.751 --> 03:02:14.040
<v Speaker 5>you end up like part of what's cool </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that thing is like a.</v>

3734
03:02:14.270 --> 03:02:16.090
<v Speaker 5>The thing I saw in an interview with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Larry Harvey,</v>

3735
03:02:16.091 --> 03:02:18.130
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a survival situation,</v>

3736
03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:19.960
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's tough.</v>

3737
03:02:20.260 --> 03:02:22.750
<v Speaker 5>It's not easy all the way through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>

3738
03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:25.420
<v Speaker 5>you got to get out there in a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>rv.</v>

3739
03:02:25.421 --> 03:02:27.070
<v Speaker 5>We drove an rv out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3740
03:02:27.071 --> 03:02:31.030
<v Speaker 5>Now that's hard or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like when you're driving an Rv,</v>

3741
03:02:31.410 --> 03:02:36.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm out of burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not easy because it's a eight hour </v>

3742
03:02:36.410 --> 03:02:41.281
<v Speaker 5>line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get out of burning man in the morning </v>

3743
03:02:41.281 --> 03:02:41.350
<v Speaker 5>and your rv.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're sitting in a fucking rv for eight</v>

3744
03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:46.380
<v Speaker 5>hours and this massive line of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who are being pulsed out of burning man </v>

3745
03:02:46.661 --> 03:02:51.661
<v Speaker 5>because there's only one road out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is every time you want to leave </v>

3746
03:02:51.661 --> 03:02:53.850
<v Speaker 5>through any day of burning man to leave </v>
<v Speaker 5>early.</v>

3747
03:02:53.890 --> 03:02:56.470
<v Speaker 5>You won't have to wait that long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you go through the whole festival</v>

3748
03:02:56.471 --> 03:02:57.880
<v Speaker 5>it takes that long to get out.</v>

3749
03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:00.630
<v Speaker 5>And so the point is it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

3750
03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:02.950
<v Speaker 5>It's not necessarily supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>easy.</v>

3751
03:03:02.951 --> 03:03:07.951
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like part of it's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking hard and like really tries you </v>

3752
03:03:07.951 --> 03:03:10.320
<v Speaker 5>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like you're going to get it.</v>

3753
03:03:10.321 --> 03:03:12.160
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not easy.</v>

3754
03:03:12.220 --> 03:03:17.220
<v Speaker 5>So some people think that like there are</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are kind of subverting the </v>

3755
03:03:17.501 --> 03:03:22.501
<v Speaker 5>experience a little bit by like flying </v>
<v Speaker 5>in on a private jet and then being </v>

3756
03:03:22.501 --> 03:03:26.170
<v Speaker 5>brought to a place that's already been </v>
<v Speaker 5>built for them where they get to kind of</v>

3757
03:03:26.350 --> 03:03:31.350
<v Speaker 5>hang out and then that place is like </v>
<v Speaker 5>theoretically it's not so easy for </v>

3758
03:03:31.350 --> 03:03:33.160
<v Speaker 5>people to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though wide ocean,</v>

3759
03:03:33.161 --> 03:03:34.990
<v Speaker 5>like one of them at one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 5>they said was like,</v>

3760
03:03:34.991 --> 03:03:36.550
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're giving food to people,</v>

3761
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:41.790
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an embarrassing embarrassing </v>

3762
03:03:41.790 --> 03:03:45.751
<v Speaker 5>post.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the guys from wide ocean put up </v>

3763
03:03:45.751 --> 03:03:46.540
<v Speaker 5>like what you did do us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was like a guy who clearly didn't</v>

3764
03:03:46.541 --> 03:03:48.370
<v Speaker 5>get the whole point of the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like,</v>

3765
03:03:48.970 --> 03:03:52.090
<v Speaker 5>seriously though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would they do that?</v>

3766
03:03:52.180 --> 03:03:57.180
<v Speaker 5>Instead of just complaining or just </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to them like why would they cut </v>

3767
03:03:57.180 --> 03:03:57.980
<v Speaker 5>their power?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would they make</v>

3768
03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:00.740
<v Speaker 1>their food spoil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem like a logical choice,</v>

3769
03:04:00.741 --> 03:04:01.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3770
03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:05.960
<v Speaker 1>there's some good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a logical choice for me?</v>

3771
03:04:06.320 --> 03:04:07.370
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell No.</v>

3772
03:04:07.371 --> 03:04:12.371
<v Speaker 1>Of course not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they think it makes sense to them </v>

3773
03:04:12.371 --> 03:04:12.620
<v Speaker 1>that they cut the power and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sabotage these people's food.</v>

3774
03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3775
03:04:15.350 --> 03:04:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3776
03:04:15.951 --> 03:04:20.951
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up their camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They apparently glued there doors shut </v>

3777
03:04:20.951 --> 03:04:24.701
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seems contrary to the idea </v>

3778
03:04:24.701 --> 03:04:24.701
<v Speaker 1>behind the event itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3779
03:04:24.701 --> 03:04:27.140
<v Speaker 1>that's the crowdsource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one idea at that event.</v>

3780
03:04:27.141 --> 03:04:31.430
<v Speaker 1>You're hearing my perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My perspective is one thing,</v>

3781
03:04:31.550 --> 03:04:33.500
<v Speaker 1>but that ain't the only fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

3782
03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a bunch of people out there</v>

3783
03:04:35.870 --> 03:04:38.750
<v Speaker 1>who aren't there for a laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like people who are like,</v>

3784
03:04:39.080 --> 03:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the gladiator ring they </v>

3785
03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:45.620
<v Speaker 1>have there or they slam people to who </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight or the fucking fisting tent or the</v>

3786
03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:49.520
<v Speaker 1>fisting tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fisting in the genital fisting.</v>

3787
03:04:49.570 --> 03:04:50.240
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3788
03:04:50.570 --> 03:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>they have a tent for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have an orgy tent.</v>

3789
03:04:52.850 --> 03:04:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Fistula tent for fisting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3790
03:04:54.861 --> 03:04:57.380
<v Speaker 1>there a fisting tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to it,</v>

3791
03:04:57.381 --> 03:05:02.381
<v Speaker 1>but I heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you not go to it if it was </v>

3792
03:05:02.381 --> 03:05:02.381
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

3793
03:05:02.381 --> 03:05:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you build it,</v>

3794
03:05:04.341 --> 03:05:07.130
<v Speaker 1>they will come visit one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the only way in is someone's got a</v>

3795
03:05:07.131 --> 03:05:10.550
<v Speaker 1>fistula because that would stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

3796
03:05:10.580 --> 03:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Or You could fit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you be in a fist in somebody you </v>

3797
03:05:15.580 --> 03:05:15.590
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just to see what's like,</v>

3798
03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I think I can imagine what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3799
03:05:18.140 --> 03:05:20.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That particular thing isn't like,</v>

3800
03:05:21.080 --> 03:05:22.370
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't appeal to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3801
03:05:22.590 --> 03:05:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I do like the openness of it and I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that like eventually after</v>

3802
03:05:27.471 --> 03:05:29.900
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people walking around naked </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a week,</v>

3803
03:05:29.901 --> 03:05:33.050
<v Speaker 1>you stopped seeing naked people and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people in my camp,</v>

3804
03:05:33.051 --> 03:05:38.051
<v Speaker 1>it could be a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say they have something called </v>

3805
03:05:38.051 --> 03:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>acceptable boner Tuesday where Pete guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>will take fucking cialis and just walk </v>

3806
03:05:41.781 --> 03:05:45.470
<v Speaker 1>around with fucking bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>

3807
03:05:45.471 --> 03:05:46.970
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my own ideas of it.</v>

3808
03:05:46.971 --> 03:05:48.650
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't one idea about it,</v>

3809
03:05:48.651 --> 03:05:50.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a tame.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it definitely doesn't feel good.</v>

3861
03:07:51.930 --> 03:07:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is nuts man.</v>

3862
03:07:53.970 --> 03:07:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really strange.</v>

3863
03:07:56.530 --> 03:07:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Hear his people screaming and yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3864
03:08:00.240 --> 03:08:05.070
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they police in this at all.</v>

3865
03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:08.040
<v Speaker 1>There's cops everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cops everywhere in burning man.</v>

3866
03:08:08.310 --> 03:08:10.050
<v Speaker 1>There's cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3867
03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Who would the cops what?</v>

3868
03:08:11.610 --> 03:08:13.950
<v Speaker 1>There's cops walking around with cop </v>
<v Speaker 1>outfits on.</v>

3869
03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:19.040
<v Speaker 1>There's costs with the cop outfits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undercover cops with the cop outfits.</v>

3870
03:08:19.290 --> 03:08:24.290
<v Speaker 1>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just wait for someone to shoot </v>

3871
03:08:24.290 --> 03:08:24.470
<v Speaker 1>somebody beat somebody up or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

3872
03:08:24.660 --> 03:08:26.840
<v Speaker 1>So I got to tell you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

3873
03:08:26.841 --> 03:08:31.841
<v Speaker 1>I most of the cops I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be having really funny </v>

3874
03:08:31.841 --> 03:08:32.290
<v Speaker 1>conversations with people at burning </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3875
03:08:32.291 --> 03:08:34.470
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking to them like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them are,</v>

3876
03:08:34.500 --> 03:08:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are arrests,</v>

3877
03:08:35.401 --> 03:08:39.780
<v Speaker 1>but like from what I saw there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the after.</v>

3878
03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I think for a cop after being at burning</v>
<v Speaker 1>man for three days,</v>

3879
03:08:43.530 --> 03:08:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I think their perspective starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing maybe a little bit because </v>

3880
03:08:48.530 --> 03:08:48.600
<v Speaker 1>they're in this weirdness just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>

3881
03:08:48.601 --> 03:08:53.601
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's naive to say there's </v>

3882
03:08:53.601 --> 03:08:55.860
<v Speaker 1>undercover cops there and people from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp said one of the things that people </v>

3883
03:08:55.860 --> 03:09:00.021
<v Speaker 1>do is they'll go to where there's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>party or a rave and yeah,</v>

3884
03:09:01.081 --> 03:09:01.460
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

3885
03:09:01.490 --> 03:09:02.860
<v Speaker 1>OPS on Atvs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3886
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>there you go with the Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3887
03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:09.390
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just like doing that.</v>

3888
03:09:09.420 --> 03:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>But like one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they do is they go,</v>

3889
03:09:12.990 --> 03:09:17.990
<v Speaker 1>they'll go to like with monopoly money </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like fake money and fake plastic </v>

3890
03:09:18.151 --> 03:09:23.151
<v Speaker 1>bags and do fake drug deals so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly the undercover cops will come </v>

3891
03:09:23.221 --> 03:09:28.221
<v Speaker 1>out and then they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they will follow the undercover </v>

3892
03:09:28.221 --> 03:09:28.221
<v Speaker 1>cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3893
03:09:28.221 --> 03:09:29.830
<v Speaker 1>because it draws them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3894
03:09:30.200 --> 03:09:32.930
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do fake drug deals.</v>

3895
03:09:33.360 --> 03:09:36.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard with fake money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true.</v>

3896
03:09:36.151 --> 03:09:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's true or not and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's end on that.</v>

3897
03:09:39.100 --> 03:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

3898
03:09:39.841 --> 03:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>You've changed my perspective of burning</v>
<v Speaker 1>man here,</v>

3899
03:09:43.450 --> 03:09:48.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3900
03:09:48.450 --> 03:09:50.841
<v Speaker 1>because I'm glad we stopped the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation on the phone because you </v>

3901
03:09:50.841 --> 03:09:50.841
<v Speaker 1>were so adamant about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3902
03:09:50.841 --> 03:09:52.050
<v Speaker 1>we got to talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we did,</v>

3903
03:09:52.051 --> 03:09:53.070
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
