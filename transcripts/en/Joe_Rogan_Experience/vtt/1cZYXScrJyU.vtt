<v Speaker 1>Indian people.</v>

42
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.073

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I will fully own a bomb if I'm bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm bombing.</v>

85
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you that bombed before a </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion times.</v>

86
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty,</v>

87
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of the set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 minutes in.</v>

88
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:55.390

<v Speaker 1>effectively.</v>

89
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think being gay is a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

90
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

91
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.723
<v Speaker 1>but this is how you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's gay black people and no </v>

92
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>one's going to choose to be gay if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're already black.</v>

93
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's doubling down on hardship.</v>

94
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.561
<v Speaker 1>That's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

96
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

97
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.033
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one like no black dude ever wakes up </v>

98
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:14.771
<v Speaker 1>and thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

99
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>This black shit to wheezy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put on a Madonna Halter top</v>

100
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>and some Jordans and tell an Indian dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to live his life.</v>

101
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>That's not a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's new born that way.</v>

102
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>And that it bombs like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silence.</v>

103
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.063
<v Speaker 1>Really complete silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I say you're exactly who I </v>

104
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>expected to be as a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I say,</v>

105
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only person that chooses.</v>

106
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>This is also what wasn't printed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the offensive part to me.</v>

107
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:41.194
<v Speaker 1>What I think is offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next part where I say the only </v>

108
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>person that chooses whether or not to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay in a daily basis is mike pence.</v>

109
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can all agree that like,</v>

110
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.264
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's getting that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no man hates homosexuals that much </v>

111
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:52.474
<v Speaker 1>if he himself is not a homosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he chooses not to be gay everyday and </v>

112
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>that gets some laughs and applause.</v>

113
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.461
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

114
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

<v Speaker 1>three minutes.</v>

00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>about how my dad landed in Newark when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he immigrated to America.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some girls from Newark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she interrupts as todd talking for like </v>

121
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.873
<v Speaker 1>I've gone fishing with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to see if I can get back </v>

122
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She interrupting,</v>

<v Speaker 1>landed in Newark back when he landed,</v>

125
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 1>it was called brick city because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>

126
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at someone wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd hit you with a brick.</v>

127
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find kind of throwaway line.</v>

128
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>This girl goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

129
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

130
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.220

<v Speaker 1>what she's trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to talk to her and I'm </v>

<v Speaker 1>going to talk about like trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>back into material.</v>

135
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.393
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like probably a minute 20 or </v>

136
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:53.810
<v Speaker 1>something and then added my corner of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>left eye.</v>

140
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:04.994
<v Speaker 1>concluding my talking to her because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that's not going to go </v>

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.743
<v Speaker 1>I mean I understand why she lied because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's trying to save face and not try </v>

174
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.590
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess not to embarrass me or whatever,</v>

175
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:34.424
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to believe that shit that </v>

176
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 1>all three you came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

177
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>the tech has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I go,</v>

178
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.913
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it because the tech has to leave or </v>

179
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.214
<v Speaker 1>because I'm saying some things that made</v>
<v Speaker 1>people uncomfortable and one of the </v>

180
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:47.980
<v Speaker 1>other girls goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

181
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.823
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think there's a distinction between </v>

182
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 1>being uncomfortable and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful.</v>

183
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't use your big words.</v>

184
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.760
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my brain I'm like,</v>

185
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.623
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

186
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.270
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

187
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've been disrespectful at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

188
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Then there are some people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

189
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Majority of people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

190
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.463
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like there's a pocket of the crowd </v>

191
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:16.230
<v Speaker 1>were the three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Asian American alliance leaders and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the crew was like waiting.</v>

193
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:20.894
<v Speaker 1>And I think some of them cheer when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll make the distinction between </v>

194
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful being uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

195
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>what do you hadn't been disrespectful in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slightest?</v>

196
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one girl goes,</v>

197
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>we think you're not entitled to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>making some of the jokes you're making.</v>

198
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like my,</v>

199
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>my trigger words entitled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking at this point,</v>

201
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too almost in shock,</v>

202
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 1>deer in headlights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like even processed anger.</v>

203
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm just trying to assess what </v>

204
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>they're specifically saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like which joke specifically.</v>

205
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.000
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think that gay and black joke,</v>

206
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm a is particularly offensive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

207
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then at this point I'm like,</v>

208
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 1>instead of explaining that the joke is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite progressive,</v>

209
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.533
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally got that job from an </v>

210
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 1>audience member at stand up New York in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 2011.</v>

211
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:09.324
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctly because it was such like one </v>

212
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>of these sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

213
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:14.530
<v Speaker 1>that's a good bit moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

214
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>And I tell them that and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to a guy in the crowd.</v>

215
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 1>So I was onstage and I used to live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell's kitchen.</v>

216
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm in New York and I'm in like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a gay black constituency </v>

217
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 1>that would always make fun of me when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was leaving my apartment,</v>

218
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:31.060
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ribbing me,</v>

220
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like I'm,</v>

221
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to talk about that on stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>at stand up New York during like a check</v>

222
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.353
<v Speaker 1>spot or whatever and I'm talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd and then there's was a gay black </v>

223
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:41.694
<v Speaker 1>guy that like heckled me and I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to him and then at some point </v>

224
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how,</v>

225
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being gay can be a choice.</v>

226
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He's,</v>

227
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.750
<v Speaker 1>he starts dying and we have like a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapport.</v>

228
00:09:49.751 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh perfect,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just got it.</v>

230
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 1>And so I tell them that and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

232
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 1>there's been a change for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to go.</v>

233
00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively,</v>

234
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong for doing what you're doing</v>

235
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:03.984
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

236
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

237
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:05.723
<v Speaker 1>I'm a generation older than you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know comedy better than anybody in </v>

238
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 1>this room for.</v>

239
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.490
<v Speaker 1>That's for God damn sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know disrespect and I,</v>

240
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.403
<v Speaker 1>I've been through a lot of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know that what I'm saying right </v>

241
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:16.554
<v Speaker 1>now hasn't been offensive in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightest and I say you can't isolate </v>

242
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 1>yourself from the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you going to do when,</v>

243
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>when some real bad shit happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

244
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 1>like if someone actually does something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's offensive,</v>

245
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you can't handle things this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you silence someone that's not,</v>

246
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 1>that's not progress or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they asked me if I have closing</v>

247
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:41.751
<v Speaker 1>remarks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have closing remarks as prepared.</v>

248
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:42.684
<v Speaker 1>So those are hard to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>closing remarks out of nowhere on the </v>

249
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to save it.</v>

250
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.710
<v Speaker 1>I tried to save it with a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.490
<v Speaker 1>and it fucking bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like hi.</v>

252
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 1>And just unlike still talking and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they cut my mic and I'm like,</v>

253
00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:58.660

254
00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

255
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.520

<v Speaker 1>You cut my uh,</v>

256
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.510

<v Speaker 1>they won't even let me talk to them </v>

00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:35.140

300
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 1>conversation just gets awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

301
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:48.190
<v Speaker 1>She revealed that her father is not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

302
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.113
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

307
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what my dad does.</v>

308
00:12:58.450 --> 00:12:59.283
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

309

316
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:09.220

<v Speaker 1>to the point where I asked her,</v>

317
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you uncomfortable?</v>

318
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:10.931
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

<v Speaker 1>do not say shit until you get paid.</v>

349
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:26.530

392
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.163

<v Speaker 1>confirmed my belief that it's all </v>

393
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:21.080
<v Speaker 1>fucking nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she effectively says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm good with what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good a lot of things,</v>

400
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:43.064
<v Speaker 1>but I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can eviscerate somebody's in the </v>

401
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.280
<v Speaker 1>instagram DM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>messaging me like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

406

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

407
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.713
<v Speaker 1>I'm not totally fucked with all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and I go to this show at ucb east </v>

408
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.603
<v Speaker 1>and like I'm taping the hours an hour so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even process of what just </v>

409
00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:06.344
<v Speaker 1>happened because my instinct is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about this immediately but I can't </v>

410
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 1>because I have to tape this hour.</v>

411
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:16.010
<v Speaker 1>And so I get off stage and the hour goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

412
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.083
<v Speaker 1>And as I'm leaving ucb east three kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were at the show at Columbia had </v>

413
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:23.264
<v Speaker 1>come down from Columbia and followed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ucb east and they came up to me and </v>

414
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:28.070
<v Speaker 1>apologize in person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

415
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:29.120
<v Speaker 1>we're so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened.</v>

416
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:29.954
<v Speaker 1>Like we loved your set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we don't know what the fuck is </v>

417
00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:32.990
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that took me,</v>

418
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.720
<v Speaker 1>that gave me like a beat to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

419
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe,</v>

420
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe everyone isn't this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just the people that have the</v>

421
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:42.284
<v Speaker 1>fucking bull horn that get to just say </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they want and silence </v>

422
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:47.480
<v Speaker 1>people that are like the minority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're like the,</v>

423
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.053
<v Speaker 1>the vocal minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like all these people that are </v>

424
00:17:50.431 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 1>like actually on my squad are not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocal as they can be.</v>

425
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 1>They're more like quiet and apologize </v>
<v Speaker 1>and person.</v>

426
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 1>And so the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

427
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything about it,</v>

428
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:05.280
<v Speaker 1>but like the Columbia newspaper hits me </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

429
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Like I got off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leave Columbia at 9:30,</v>

430
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 1>the Colombian newspaper hits me up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

431
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5:00</v>

432
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.431
<v Speaker 1>PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

433
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any comment?</v>

434
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comment,</v>

435
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's that for a comment?</v>

436
00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:16.854
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

437
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.713
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to talk to you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me fucking process what's going on </v>

438
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 1>the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still thinking about it,</v>

439
00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going down to open for Aziz in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic city.</v>

440
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.873
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open for him and I'm telling this story </v>

441
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.223
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he immediately hits on the fact that </v>

442
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy that these kids came up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and apologize and I'm like,</v>

443
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about how insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is because I'm still mad,</v>

444
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.760
<v Speaker 1>but I'm thinking I'm talking to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

445
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:45.594
<v Speaker 1>like I'm talking to disease and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is kind of crazy because it's </v>

446
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:52.170
<v Speaker 1>so easy to buy into the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's a fucking soft motherfucker.</v>

447
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.813
<v Speaker 1>And then I think about it some more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think about like all the gigs </v>

448
00:18:56.791 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I've done college wise before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the past year I've been lucky to</v>

449
00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 1>know I did like Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a school in Alaska,</v>

450
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:08.250
<v Speaker 1>a school in Ohio to school in Maryland </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said much more offensive shit like</v>

451
00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:12.960
<v Speaker 1>anti trump shit in the fucking red list </v>
<v Speaker 1>of states and it's all been fine,</v>

452
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've never been kicked off stage </v>

453
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:17.590
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to me,</v>

454
00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:18.424
<v Speaker 1>like this Columbia incident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the students there seemed like the </v>

455
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:24.070
<v Speaker 1>exception rather than the rule you'll</v>

456
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.650
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everyone's a soft person,</v>

457
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.300
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

458
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.313
<v Speaker 2>It does make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I think is is young kids in </v>

459
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:35.530
<v Speaker 2>particular that are in a position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

460
00:19:35.531 --> 00:19:36.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're running something.</v>

461
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:41.020
<v Speaker 2>They have this idea of how people should</v>
<v Speaker 2>behave that they want in their head,</v>

462
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:46.110
<v Speaker 2>and when you don't fit that mold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they just decided to be outraged.</v>

463
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened here.</v>

464
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.470
<v Speaker 2>You look at the context of what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

465
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.450
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a comedian,</v>

466
00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're obviously a guy would jokes about</v>

467
00:19:54.791 --> 00:19:55.331
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

468
00:19:55.331 --> 00:19:56.164
<v Speaker 2>So that's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not saying anything negative </v>

469
00:19:57.761 --> 00:20:02.590
<v Speaker 2>about black people or gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're essentially admitting that it's a</v>

470
00:20:02.591 --> 00:20:04.240
<v Speaker 2>hardship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

471
00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:05.643
<v Speaker 2>we all agreed that black people </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience racism and gay people </v>

472
00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:10.710
<v Speaker 2>experience homophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody agrees that.</v>

473
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that makes perfect sense and it's </v>

474
00:20:13.391 --> 00:20:14.510
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you man.</v>

475
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:14.850
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

476
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.920
<v Speaker 2>it's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is stupid.</v>

477
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:19.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's normal,</v>

478
00:20:19.241 --> 00:20:20.021
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

479
00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:20.854
<v Speaker 2>that's been going on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped doing colleges a long time </v>

480
00:20:23.381 --> 00:20:25.270
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the early two thousands.</v>

481
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I did a college in Florida and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking these,</v>

482
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.570
<v Speaker 2>they don't know enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is not fun.</v>

483
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.580
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why I would do this for </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

484
00:20:33.581 --> 00:20:36.850
<v Speaker 2>because college is paid a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know enough there.</v>

485
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean they should if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're 18 year old kids and then get</v>

486
00:20:40.311 --> 00:20:44.230
<v Speaker 2>into a club that has an 18 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a limit where you can get in at 18,</v>

487
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>they should do that and then there'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>with other 30 olds and</v>

488
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.130
<v Speaker 3>people with life experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>

489
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:56.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to perform at the whim of </v>
<v Speaker 3>children and that's what these are.</v>

490
00:20:56.561 --> 00:21:00.580
<v Speaker 3>These are children who are engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreational outrage.</v>

491
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.870
<v Speaker 3>They're deciding to be outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

492
00:21:02.871 --> 00:21:03.730
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

493
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.490
<v Speaker 3>it felt like with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with them particularly,</v>

494
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 3>it felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I grew up fine.</v>

495
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I grew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't grow up rich,</v>

496
00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:11.914
<v Speaker 3>but my parents had some money for a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>before things went north or average </v>

497
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:15.484
<v Speaker 3>middle class people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like to me it's like I've been </v>

498
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:23.230
<v Speaker 3>through some life and so I know when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who haven't been through life get</v>

499
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:24.064
<v Speaker 3>upset about shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always like the thing with Texas </v>

500
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:27.574
<v Speaker 3>and Ohio and Alaska is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are like the kids of blue collar </v>

501
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:32.044
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who have been through some </v>

502
00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:34.660
<v Speaker 3>shit and maybe not even just blue </v>
<v Speaker 3>collar,</v>

503
00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:37.570
<v Speaker 3>but people who have been through some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of life where life experience,</v>

504
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 3>where they know that things aren't just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like words can hurt,</v>

505
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part they're fine.</v>

506
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like when like your fucking dad </v>
<v Speaker 3>loses his job.</v>

507
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>

508
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.870
<v Speaker 3>it's the intent of what you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

509
00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you trying to do?</v>

510
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:51.844
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to get laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're telling jokes and trying to get </v>

511
00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 3>laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're hired to do.</v>

512
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.193
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take the context of people forget </v>

513
00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:02.080
<v Speaker 3>that comedian is a job that like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

514
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.230
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not who I am as a human being </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>

515
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will over funny first.</v>

516
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.910

<v Speaker 3>Funny over everything.</v>

517

<v Speaker 3>You have to write.</v>

519
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.790
<v Speaker 3>It's just the only way it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

520
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Speaker 3>it's so crazy what people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

521
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if kids have changed or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

522
00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

523
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.203
<v Speaker 3>they haven't changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just think that this is the thing </v>

524
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:24.334
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

525
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.353
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in,</v>

526
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.360
<v Speaker 3>when I was doing college is way back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the day.</v>

527
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I was in my twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a college in Connecticut and right</v>

528
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:35.770
<v Speaker 3>after I did their college I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to the kids.</v>

529
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do my set and then uh,</v>

530
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.490
<v Speaker 3>I would like open up for q and a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

531
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.520
<v Speaker 3>fuck's going on my throat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was um,</v>

532
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.240
<v Speaker 3>I was probably 24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25,</v>

533
00:22:51.341 --> 00:22:53.500
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 25 at the oldest.</v>

534
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.330
<v Speaker 3>So I was just a couple of years older </v>
<v Speaker 3>than them.</v>

535
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.603
<v Speaker 3>And so it was fun for me to talk to them</v>
<v Speaker 3>about what life is like when you </v>

536
00:23:00.761 --> 00:23:02.560
<v Speaker 3>actually have to pay your own bills and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're out,</v>

<v Speaker 3>to have an actual camera.</v>

552
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.380
<v Speaker 3>They had a fucking castle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a long time,</v>

553
00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:40.660
<v Speaker 3>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 51,</v>

554
00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 3>so this is a 90,</v>

<v Speaker 3>somewhere around that.</v>

556
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.173
<v Speaker 3>So this one guy comes up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes the joke he said about Jewish </v>

557
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:53.420
<v Speaker 3>people's very offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was joking,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you serious?</v>

559
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.843
<v Speaker 3>And he was very offensive and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous and shit and like has a hard </v>

<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

562
00:24:02.821 --> 00:24:04.070
<v Speaker 3>think about what the joke says.</v>

563
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.203
<v Speaker 3>It's about Jewish people being really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at business will walk into a bar </v>

564
00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:09.800
<v Speaker 3>that decided to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a,</v>

565
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:10.634
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing offensive about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know what's crazy is like it's </v>

566
00:24:13.831 --> 00:24:14.664
<v Speaker 3>like people now and maybe forever have </v>
<v Speaker 3>always heard shit and they immediately </v>

567
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 3>think this means if I'm thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>something bad about this,</v>

568
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 3>that means that someone is saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking bad about it.</v>

569
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.263
<v Speaker 3>They decided this is a taboo subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're not even say anything </v>

570
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:29.804
<v Speaker 3>negative about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you do a joke about </v>

571
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:34.740
<v Speaker 3>interracial relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best kind integration where I should</v>

572
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 3>just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just do a joke about that,</v>

573
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.933
<v Speaker 3>there are people that are going to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>red flags up instantly and look to </v>

574
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:45.500
<v Speaker 3>misinterpret anything that you say on </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose because they don't want.</v>

575
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.140
<v Speaker 3>They don't want that thought in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

576
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.690
<v Speaker 3>They don't want the thought of know </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

577
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.880
<v Speaker 3>this guy's looking for antisemitism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that joke to just walk into a bar.</v>

578
00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.050
<v Speaker 3>They buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's none there.</v>

579
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.003
<v Speaker 3>You could look all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a joke about Jewish folks by and </v>

580
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:01.750
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just does nothing.</v>

581
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Positive stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a big Dick,</v>

582
00:25:05.751 --> 00:25:06.584
<v Speaker 3>black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

583
00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.810
<v Speaker 3>It's not negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing negative about it.</v>

584
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:09.644
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gets upset that you think they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a big Dick unless they have a </v>

585
00:25:11.791 --> 00:25:13.580
<v Speaker 3>little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of lead time.</v>

586
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:18.020
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's young people that also flexing,</v>

587
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.003
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're free from the control of their </v>

588
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:20.714
<v Speaker 3>parents and I find them you dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that more in like rich or upper middle </v>

589
00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:27.854
<v Speaker 3>class families because I think they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>more hands on with their kids and more </v>

590
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:36.161
<v Speaker 3>controlling and those kids get free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to exert their own freedom and</v>

591
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:37.154
<v Speaker 3>when they get free of their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to establish that they're </v>

592
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 3>different and that they have their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

593
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:42.524
<v Speaker 3>their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we're part of the new </v>

594
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:43.850
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

595
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.220
<v Speaker 3>The new generation is not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerate racism.</v>

596
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.233
<v Speaker 3>CIS Hetero activity and they just decide</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're going to fucking put their </v>

597
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:51.734
<v Speaker 3>foot down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a pattern that repeats itself </v>

598
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.283
<v Speaker 3>over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just today they have social media </v>

599
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 3>and this is the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference is they feel like they're</v>

600
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:00.764
<v Speaker 3>empowered because they get online and </v>
<v Speaker 3>other morons that are the same age as </v>

601
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:05.780
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Confirm with them.</v>

602
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 3>You can just confirm any belief that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

603
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Like that's another lesson I've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>from this is just like confirmation bias</v>

604
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.460
<v Speaker 3>is like the wildest shit ever you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>find.</v>

605
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 3>You can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one lady who wrote some shit.</v>

606
00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm anti gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti black and other areas.</v>

607
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm like in the comments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

608
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.770
<v Speaker 3>this is clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is clearly what he was saying.</v>

609
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that you took that from my set.</v>

610
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a solution here.</v>

611
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.593
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at this heart for a long </v>

612
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:35.570
<v Speaker 3>time now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need safe spaces for comedians.</v>

613
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.820
<v Speaker 3>There's no solution because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with immature people in terms of</v>

614
00:26:40.821 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 3>like the literally the development of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their frontal lobe.</v>

615
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.660
<v Speaker 3>They're not fully formed yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do you think of it is like,</v>

616
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.713
<v Speaker 3>I put it in my op Ed that I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like I was thinking about like </v>

617
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:52.703
<v Speaker 3>how much of it now is a function of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that like we immediately get </v>

618
00:26:57.571 --> 00:26:59.850
<v Speaker 3>whatever we want in our hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

619
00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:00.684
<v Speaker 3>Like the instant gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like instant kind of thought </v>

620
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:05.730
<v Speaker 3>process where there's no real thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>that occurs.</v>

621
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 3>It's more just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this comes into my brain.</v>

622
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.240
<v Speaker 3>I hear gay black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has to be,</v>

623
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.940
<v Speaker 3>this is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's coming out for sure.</v>

624
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you say gay black on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>today in a really liberal,</v>

625
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.790
<v Speaker 3>very progressive environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get this thing you.</v>

626
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.673
<v Speaker 3>But you have to say something like pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>super pro gay and super pro black and </v>

627
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:25.704
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even have to be a joke like </v>

628
00:27:27.221 --> 00:27:28.054
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're better off just going for that </v>

629
00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:30.271
<v Speaker 3>applause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Break,</v>

<v Speaker 3>People want their comedians to be their </v>

632
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:38.740
<v Speaker 3>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

633
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:43.830
<v Speaker 3>that's what it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is wild laugh know people.</v>

634
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.530
<v Speaker 3>When I say people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like this next group of,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that were shot because the comedians </v>

637

<v Speaker 3>that are going to be their leaders </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't even gonna be funny.</v>

638
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.770

<v Speaker 3>to death.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You get once you get out in the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

<v Speaker 3>chairs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

649
00:28:15.811 --> 00:28:18.350
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing I think like people </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

650
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:19.680
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a hero man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

654
00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:25.440
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is uh,</v>

655
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.453
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really believed that this is just a </v>

656
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 3>symptom of growing up and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving these people the power to express</v>

657
00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 3>themselves where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no mature,</v>

658
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:36.120
<v Speaker 3>wiser person that's around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>

659
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:36.954
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's look at the context of what he's </v>

660
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>examined what he's doing,</v>

661
00:28:40.351 --> 00:28:41.184
<v Speaker 3>and then you're going to apologize to </v>
<v Speaker 3>him because this is clearly a fucking </v>

662
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:43.500
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>

663
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 3>You hired a guy to tell jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tells jokes and you say,</v>

664
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:47.244
<v Speaker 3>not that show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This specific thing is strange because </v>

665
00:28:50.431 --> 00:28:51.720
<v Speaker 3>they're were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like,</v>

666
00:28:51.721 --> 00:28:56.721
<v Speaker 3>he did not respect what the event was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unlike like what?</v>

667
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not this.</v>

668
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not your mascot here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

669
00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.223
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not a pep rally dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to tell jokes when you weren't </v>

670
00:29:05.071 --> 00:29:10.050
<v Speaker 3>hired to do a speech about this event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to direct my fucking act.</v>

671
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they understand how long </v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes to write an act.</v>

672
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another conversation though.</v>

673

<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.593
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

692
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.510
<v Speaker 3>You just fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do that.</v>

693
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:08.970
<v Speaker 3>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't have said that on this.</v>

694
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luck in the next six months.</v>

695
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.510
<v Speaker 3>I really don't think this is a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think this is is.</v>

696
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why all these different</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians had been saying.</v>

697
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.220
<v Speaker 3>John Malaney said this recently and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really love John Malaney,</v>

698
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.410
<v Speaker 3>but I completely disagree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

699
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:28.300
<v Speaker 3>the reason why Comedians don't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>colleges,</v>

700
00:30:28.301 --> 00:30:31.180
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing to do with political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness has to do with the money.</v>

701
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.620
<v Speaker 3>That is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

702
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.520
<v Speaker 3>he says that because his act is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good and really clean.</v>

703
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Essentially do his act anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an excellent act,</v>

704
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:40.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

705
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.060
<v Speaker 3>but there's other guys like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Brian Regan,</v>

706
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.400
<v Speaker 3>he's got an excellent act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could do colleges anywhere and yeah,</v>

707
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.253
<v Speaker 3>like any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere they see the reason why they </v>

708
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.660
<v Speaker 3>don't do colleges because the kids are </v>
<v Speaker 3>too fucking sensitive.</v>

709
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.523
<v Speaker 3>That's 100 percent the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that they don't make money </v>

710
00:30:56.171 --> 00:30:57.004
<v Speaker 3>at colleges?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand how much colleges </v>

711
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.410
<v Speaker 3>pay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pay a lot of money.</v>

712
00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 3>It's not to a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think to a lot of comics,</v>

713
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.730
<v Speaker 3>it's just not worth the hassle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not worth,</v>

714
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if,</v>

715
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:09.240
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't need the cash and I was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jerry,</v>

716
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was whatever,</v>

717
00:31:11.501 --> 00:31:12.334
<v Speaker 3>like the two and a half weeks that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>spent like reading the news and getting </v>

718
00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:17.074
<v Speaker 3>back and live answering emails and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting back into the shit of just like </v>

719
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:21.730
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if I didn't?</v>

720
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 3>I would easily give that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the flip side.</v>

721
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.420
<v Speaker 3>This is probably one of the best things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ever happened to you as a stand up.</v>

722
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was saying.</v>

723
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.870
<v Speaker 3>Gigantic national attention as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

724
00:31:31.871 --> 00:31:34.440
<v Speaker 3>the two things every comic has said it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was one of the,</v>

725
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.370
<v Speaker 3>do you get paid and do is good press </v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

726
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.140
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking pricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's true.</v>

727
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.130
<v Speaker 3>It's good to feel the same way after </v>
<v Speaker 3>time is sort of the wounds over.</v>

728
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:48.993
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now it's still raw and fresh and </v>

729
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:52.840
<v Speaker 3>you're still angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still getting shit from comics.</v>

730
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.340
<v Speaker 3>Like that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been my whole.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you see a comment from a,</v>

769
00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.050
<v Speaker 3>even if they're like in England or South</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa and you see it,</v>

770
00:33:19.051 --> 00:33:20.690
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you immediately have that kinship.</v>

771
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

772
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.153
<v Speaker 3>you're a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you ever watch a community in </v>

773
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.750
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Chris and uh,</v>

774
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry do,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I liked,</v>

778

<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

779
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:31.034
<v Speaker 3>but Chris and Jerry have a moment where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about going to a party </v>

780
00:33:35.151 --> 00:33:39.440

<v Speaker 3>other and it's like,</v>

782
00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:45.230
<v Speaker 3>that's the kinship that I think you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

783
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 3>as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I forget what we talked about.</v>

<v Speaker 3>How do we get on this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a long time and it's your life </v>

808
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.500
<v Speaker 3>your whole life as a human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said you were on stage at college in</v>

809
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:40.190
<v Speaker 3>1990.</v>

810
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.023
<v Speaker 3>I was for crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 92 now that I'm thinking </v>

811
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.120
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 99.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere around nine to.</v>

812
00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.183
<v Speaker 3>But either way it's a long ass time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the crazy thing is do you still keep </v>

813
00:34:51.951 --> 00:34:52.784
<v Speaker 3>learning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

814
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.673
<v Speaker 3>like you still keep learning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll still have a weird set and I </v>

815
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.130
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

816
00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:58.780
<v Speaker 3>why did I do it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

817
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:59.623
<v Speaker 3>I have this idea in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me flip this around and it'll fuck </v>

818
00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:03.410
<v Speaker 3>the whole joke up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

819
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:08.200
<v Speaker 3>why did I say rescue first?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should have said that later.</v>

820
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.353
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That goes back to how much work this </v>

821
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:15.920
<v Speaker 3>shit is that you forget how much time </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to invest.</v>

822
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.030
<v Speaker 3>I got two new babies right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not not real babies and real kids,</v>

823
00:35:20.031 --> 00:35:23.780
<v Speaker 3>but I have two new comedy babies even </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and I'm watering them.</v>

824
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Like right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

825
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.870
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to give them some light.</v>

826
00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:28.670
<v Speaker 3>I got to make sure they get the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>fertilizer.</v>

827
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Like right now I have two bits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One bit.</v>

828
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:32.114
<v Speaker 3>That's one day out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it yesterday for the first time </v>

829
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 3>I'd been working on it for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>

830
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I knew there was some life to it and I</v>

831
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 2>sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote it out and I said,</v>

832
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:40.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one want a free ball.</v>

833
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:42.360
<v Speaker 2>This shit last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's her process?</v>

834
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I have over the last three or four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

835
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:52.460
<v Speaker 2>four years since I'm actually five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since I did my comedy central special in</v>

836
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:53.754
<v Speaker 2>2014.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided to change my process right </v>

837
00:35:57.091 --> 00:35:57.924
<v Speaker 2>before that because I decided that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to do more specials because I </v>

838
00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:01.524
<v Speaker 2>went from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did one in 2009 that I really liked </v>

839
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.890
<v Speaker 2>that I did one in 2012 that I have asked</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I said,</v>

840
00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:09.870
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wasn't doing.</v>

841
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't at the store anymore and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't doing weekly sets,</v>

842
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 2>so then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

843
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very distinct process in terms</v>

844
00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:19.710
<v Speaker 2>of the work that you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

845
00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 2>you have to go up a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have to go up at least three or</v>

846
00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 2>four times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

847
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:25.583
<v Speaker 2>three or four days a week and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to go multiple times a night and I </v>

848
00:36:28.571 --> 00:36:29.404
<v Speaker 2>like to go to different environments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just the store or they like to do </v>

849
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:32.544
<v Speaker 2>the Improv.</v>

850
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I like to do the Ice House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to do different environments.</v>

851
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Then I have to write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write,</v>

852
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.143
<v Speaker 2>like sit in front of a computer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>write and I like to do it high and I </v>

853
00:36:42.551 --> 00:36:44.820
<v Speaker 2>like to do it sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could to do it both ways.</v>

854
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.713
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And George Carlin had an interesting </v>

855
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:48.114
<v Speaker 2>method that I think I'm starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adopt because I've been doing it a lot </v>

856
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:51.474
<v Speaker 2>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's subconscious where I </v>

857
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 2>write out concepts sober and then I fire</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

858
00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:01.140
<v Speaker 2>then our spark up a joint and then I go </v>
<v Speaker 2>over it again when I'm high,</v>

859
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.040
<v Speaker 2>like the structure's already there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll start putting the funny.</v>

860
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.083
<v Speaker 2>Then after the writing part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of going over it and </v>

861
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:11.724
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to give it a little life before </v>

862
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:16.860
<v Speaker 2>bringing it to the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when I bring to the stage,</v>

863
00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I write it out on paper.</v>

864
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.073
<v Speaker 2>I have to write it out on paper because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how remember where my bullet </v>

865
00:37:20.911 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 2>points are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then recording always and then review of</v>

866
00:37:25.861 --> 00:37:29.010
<v Speaker 2>the recording.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then rewriting after the review,</v>

867
00:37:29.011 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 2>the recording,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this process is like this is my process.</v>

868
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.240
<v Speaker 2>When I do it that way I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel excited.</v>

869
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Like last night I came home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote till 2:30</v>

870
00:37:38.491 --> 00:37:40.160
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came home at 1230.</v>

871
00:37:40.161 --> 00:37:40.994
<v Speaker 2>I wrote for two hours and by the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like falling asleep in front of my </v>

872
00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:44.810
<v Speaker 2>laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shut the laptop,</v>

873
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel good.</v>

874
00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting it in.</v>

875
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I know it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is all live shit working out.</v>

876
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:52.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go to bed.</v>

877
00:37:52.471 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to bed.</v>

878
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

879
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a live.</v>

880
00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:59.130
<v Speaker 2>This bitch is alive when they wake up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the first thing you think about</v>

881
00:37:59.131 --> 00:37:59.641
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

882
00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:00.474
<v Speaker 2>I got this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this new beer that night and did </v>

883
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.180
<v Speaker 2>it for the first time last night and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>did well at the comedy store,</v>

884
00:38:06.181 --> 00:38:08.430
<v Speaker 2>but then it crushed at the Improv and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

885
00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:10.290
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was the bit.</v>

886
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:13.800
<v Speaker 2>The bit is about old people getting stds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nursing homes.</v>

887
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a phenomena.</v>

888
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This new thing that's happening.</v>

889
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blow your Dick around if you're 85 years</v>

890
00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:24.844
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

891
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.150
<v Speaker 1>No one needs condom doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

892
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.043
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

893
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

894
00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.333
<v Speaker 2>but then there's this other bit of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on as well that's a little </v>

895
00:38:33.681 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 2>bit older about dude from</v>

896
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 3>the missionary that got shot up by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrows.</v>

897
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:40.204
<v Speaker 3>But the uncontacted tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course my people did that came from </v>

898
00:38:44.371 --> 00:38:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Africa and stepping in India and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ireland,</v>

899
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 3>but they immigrated from Africa 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago under contact at trump.</v>

900
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.520
<v Speaker 3>But the point being that the process for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

901
00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 3>it's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all this stuff with.</v>

902
00:38:58.691 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 3>It's really about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about focus and attention,</v>

903
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 3>focus and attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about that,</v>

904
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.770
<v Speaker 3>but the work in terms of breaking it </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

905
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:06.963
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of things that I think </v>

906
00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:09.394
<v Speaker 3>comedians don't do that they really </v>
<v Speaker 3>should do and the number one thing is </v>

907
00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:14.494
<v Speaker 3>writing actual writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing like sitting in front of a </v>

908
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:17.734
<v Speaker 3>computer or a notebook and writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most comedians like to just have a bit </v>

909
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 3>and they work it out on stage and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know how it worked and then they improve</v>

910
00:39:24.521 --> 00:39:25.354
<v Speaker 3>it the next set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially if you're doing like the </v>

911
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:28.083
<v Speaker 3>New York City trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you doing like the seller and then </v>

912
00:39:29.851 --> 00:39:30.684
<v Speaker 3>you do stand that you do an all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different sets all around town and </v>

913
00:39:33.521 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 3>you're doing little short 10 minute sets</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and they're like,</v>

914
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.770
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to just kind of keep working </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

915
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:39.603
<v Speaker 3>Just keep working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that it's critical to </v>

916
00:39:42.191 --> 00:39:46.300
<v Speaker 3>actually sit alone with the material and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just look at it,</v>

917
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.373
<v Speaker 3>look at it and try to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can I make this quicker or what's a </v>

918
00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:53.110
<v Speaker 3>sneak your way to do this or what else </v>
<v Speaker 3>is in this that I'm missing?</v>

919
00:39:53.111 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 3>And I think the for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

920
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.963
<v Speaker 3>I right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I just started doing up until </v>

921
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:01.810
<v Speaker 3>probably like a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe eight months ago,</v>

922
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I was of the brain where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll write a note or write a bullet,</v>

923
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:05.880
<v Speaker 3>bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet,</v>

924
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.713
<v Speaker 3>bullet point or whatever and I'll try </v>
<v Speaker 3>and work it out and then I'll write </v>

925
00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 3>something that I think is interesting as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a joke,</v>

926
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.423
<v Speaker 3>but like I saw no opening for disease or</v>
<v Speaker 3>working with a song like working with </v>

927
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:16.924
<v Speaker 3>people that are like crushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their process is like fuck they're </v>

928
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.620
<v Speaker 3>maniacs when the like you were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

929
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.660
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a codified process.</v>

930
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.130
<v Speaker 3>This is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it.</v>

931
00:40:27.131 --> 00:40:29.740
<v Speaker 3>This is what's worked for like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 years,</v>

932
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.880
<v Speaker 3>however long I've been doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once I saw like that process,</v>

933
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh these motherfuckers,</v>

934
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.913
<v Speaker 3>I think I work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these guys work fucking crazy hard </v>

935
00:40:38.141 --> 00:40:38.974
<v Speaker 3>and it's like sort of emulate that </v>
<v Speaker 3>process of like I got to set aside at </v>

936
00:40:41.231 --> 00:40:42.064
<v Speaker 3>least 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 minutes a day where I'm like </v>

937
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.561
<v Speaker 3>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

938
00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's the same thing over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

939
00:40:46.241 --> 00:40:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

940
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:49.540
<v Speaker 3>how can I fix this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this word doesn't need to be there.</v>

941
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:50.374
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll say it in my apartment to </v>

942
00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:53.014
<v Speaker 3>myself and I'll try to do like how I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would do it on stage because it's like </v>

943
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm my comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to be conversational,</v>

944
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.690
<v Speaker 3>at least make it seem conversational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

945
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.090
<v Speaker 3>how can I seem relaxed while doing this?</v>

946
00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:07.660
<v Speaker 3>But still emphasize the right word for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the punchline or whatever it is.</v>

947
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now that process like,</v>

948
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:10.953
<v Speaker 3>and it's all repetition now when you got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to repeat the process to make it a </v>

949
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:14.224
<v Speaker 3>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise this is the thing you did </v>

950
00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:16.240
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now that's,</v>

951
00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.113
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm starting to do now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just physically fucking getting up and </v>

952
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.841
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

953
00:41:19.841 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 3>this I gotta write this bid out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though it was a bit.</v>

954
00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:25.180
<v Speaker 3>I've done a billion times but something </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there that I got to figure out.</v>

955
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

956
00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:30.580
<v Speaker 3>another thing to do that really works </v>
<v Speaker 3>well to sort of get it in your head is a</v>

957
00:41:30.581 --> 00:41:35.581
<v Speaker 3>cork board to have a big old bullets and</v>
<v Speaker 3>board and put index cards on none of the</v>

958
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:36.464
<v Speaker 3>titles of your bits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I would put like index cards </v>

959
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:41.690
<v Speaker 3>underneath it that are like the bullet </v>
<v Speaker 3>points of that bit.</v>

960
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:42.643
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like a storyboard or maybe kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of step back and look at them and then </v>

961
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 3>try to see if they make sense in order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe I should flip it around.</v>

962
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:50.024
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I should do the bit about the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting bit by the dog before I do the </v>

963
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:53.624
<v Speaker 3>bit about the monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between being bit by a </v>

964
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:58.603
<v Speaker 3>monkey and like maybe it's better to </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce this distrust of animals </v>

965
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 3>because in this way or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

966
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:08.000
<v Speaker 3>It's about attention though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

967
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.510
<v Speaker 3>It's attention and focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these guys.</v>

968
00:42:09.511 --> 00:42:10.344
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that work really hard?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a coincidence that those guys </v>

969
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 3>are killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

970
00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:15.613
<v Speaker 3>there's something to it and there's also</v>
<v Speaker 3>the recognition when you do start </v>

971
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.023
<v Speaker 3>killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

972
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:21.170
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is rare.</v>

973
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm in a rare spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm filling up these gigantic places.</v>

974
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:25.790
<v Speaker 3>People coming out to see me.</v>

975
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing netflix specials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to work harder now.</v>

976
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta keep it up and you gotta keep </v>

977
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.900
<v Speaker 3>it up and you got to realize that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>

978
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Bill Burr said something once that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think was really,</v>

979
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.100
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like dead on the money.</v>

980
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:41.000
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what it's like to be disappointed</v>

981
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.700
<v Speaker 3>by someone that you go to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you go to see a band.</v>

982
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:45.343
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember going when I see a band when </v>

983
00:42:45.951 --> 00:42:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid and they half asset and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

984
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:49.250
<v Speaker 3>like you feel fucked over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

985
00:42:49.251 --> 00:42:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever want to do that to my fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

986
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.460
<v Speaker 3>ah Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

987
00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:53.294
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like realize that you used to be a fan </v>

988
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.070
<v Speaker 3>and I'll think of your fans as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

989
00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.750
<v Speaker 3>How you would experience you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want someone phoning it in,</v>

990
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their night,</v>

991
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:04.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

992
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.500
<v Speaker 3>That is their night it came out to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone they love and it's like,</v>

993
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.590
<v Speaker 3>you got to fucking earn that love </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>

994
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

995
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.113
<v Speaker 3>And tickets are expensive and they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to work to get those tickets and a lot </v>

996
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:15.210
<v Speaker 3>of people doing jobs they fucking hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

997
00:43:15.211 --> 00:43:16.044
<v Speaker 3>and cutting back on other things to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough money to go out and have a few </v>

998
00:43:18.351 --> 00:43:19.580
<v Speaker 3>drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

999
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1000
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:21.463
<v Speaker 3>there's a responsibility to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also a lot of people that </v>

1001
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:24.614
<v Speaker 3>try to skirt that responsibility because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the pressure of that responsibility </v>

1002
00:43:27.111 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 3>is kind of overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think about it,</v>

1003
00:43:28.821 --> 00:43:29.654
<v Speaker 3>it makes you nervous and you just start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fuck off and you have ass and I'll </v>

1004
00:43:32.661 --> 00:43:34.200
<v Speaker 3>be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.110
<v Speaker 3>But that's like college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1006
00:43:36.111 --> 00:43:36.944
<v Speaker 3>It's like cramming for tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a lot of people that </v>

1007
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:39.554
<v Speaker 3>study all year long and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that half acid up until the last </v>

1008
00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 3>minute and then they just try to shove </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all in all at once.</v>

1009
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:45.733
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird kind of confidence that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need or or delusional delusional </v>

1010
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.790
<v Speaker 3>delusional competence where like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be fine fucking.</v>

1011
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.530
<v Speaker 3>And I admit I've done that a few times </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I've just been like,</v>

1012
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:55.450
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1013
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll work this out.</v>

1014
00:43:56.361 --> 00:43:57.194
<v Speaker 3>It'll be straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like the Times where I've like </v>

1015
00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.053
<v Speaker 3>fucking sat and been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the bit I gotta do I gotTa make </v>

1016
00:44:01.641 --> 00:44:02.474
<v Speaker 3>sure I hit it to the point where I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>just bring the notebook on stage and </v>

1017
00:44:04.581 --> 00:44:05.240
<v Speaker 3>just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1018
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.740
<v Speaker 3>I gotta make sure this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this goes away.</v>

1019
00:44:06.741 --> 00:44:08.840
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the old expression,</v>

1020
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:09.674
<v Speaker 3>how you do anything is how you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything or how you do everything is </v>

1021
00:44:12.261 --> 00:44:14.120
<v Speaker 3>how you do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1022
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:15.043
<v Speaker 3>there's something to that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something to like not allowing </v>

1023
00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:21.990
<v Speaker 3>yourself to think of yourself as someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a fuckup yeah.</v>

1024
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Because as soon as you think of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a fuck up.</v>

1025
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 3>If you get that in your head man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that like the default setting almost</v>

1026
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 3>where it's like that's easy to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>human are like,</v>

1027
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:32.903
<v Speaker 3>I think people are hardwired to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also very easy to just not do </v>

1028
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:40.650
<v Speaker 3>that and I believe that it'll be fine or</v>
<v Speaker 3>or five,</v>

1029
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.543
<v Speaker 3>fuck this up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the pressure alleviator as you put </v>

1030
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:46.950
<v Speaker 3>these expectations on yourself of </v>
<v Speaker 3>success in the end,</v>

1031
00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:47.784
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of pressure involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting those expectations and one of </v>

1032
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 3>the best pressure relievers is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking up.</v>

1033
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 3>So you lower your own personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>expectations.</v>

1034
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.460
<v Speaker 3>People drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing all that kind of shit.</v>

1035
00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.333
<v Speaker 3>Just like sabotaging your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that will </v>

1036
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:03.930
<v Speaker 3>sabotage their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start getting some success and then</v>

1037
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:08.680
<v Speaker 3>the panic overwhelms them and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>just start taking pills or go,</v>

1038
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.080
<v Speaker 3>go fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna,</v>

1039
00:45:10.081 --> 00:45:11.580
<v Speaker 3>lose this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fuck it up.</v>

1040
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:12.121
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1041
00:45:12.121 --> 00:45:13.770
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mentality is really normal.</v>

1042
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The psychological mind fuck that goes on</v>

1043
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:18.264
<v Speaker 3>when you're attempting to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's standup comedy or I guess </v>

1044
00:45:21.841 --> 00:45:24.170
<v Speaker 3>it would probably be the same with </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost any art form.</v>

1045
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.433
<v Speaker 3>You're especially open-ended art forum </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you don't have a boss who's </v>

1046
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.830
<v Speaker 3>telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1047
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mess,</v>

1048
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:31.620
<v Speaker 3>you got to get this fucking project in </v>
<v Speaker 3>at 3:00</v>

1049
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.263
<v Speaker 3>if that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the crazy thing is like you </v>

1050
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:36.143
<v Speaker 3>forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or like what people don't know is that </v>

1051
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 3>comedy is the most entrepreneurial </v>
<v Speaker 3>endeavor.</v>

1052
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:40.554
<v Speaker 3>There is you fucking there and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>why everyone thinks they could do it </v>

1053
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.340
<v Speaker 3>because there's no capital investment of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

1054
00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:51.240
<v Speaker 3>It's all just mental investment in hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and everybody thinks they can do it</v>

1055
00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:53.040
<v Speaker 3>because they do most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1056
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:54.610
<v Speaker 3>most of it is just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.490
<v Speaker 3>So like I could talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could talk.</v>

1058
00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.413
<v Speaker 3>How come I can't talk like I've made </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have to do it and funny at the </v>

1059
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:01.141
<v Speaker 3>office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1060
00:46:01.141 --> 00:46:03.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm funny all the time I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup.</v>

1061
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:04.403
<v Speaker 3>Like how many people have you heard say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm thinking about doing stand </v>

1062

<v Speaker 3>good luck man.</v>

1064
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:12.480
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because some people I'm like,</v>

1065
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 3>I know they have the work ethic to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck that.</v>

1066
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:15.654
<v Speaker 3>If like if my friends were super </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful in most other endeavors like </v>

1067
00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:19.434
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do like finance or doctors or </v>

1068
00:46:20.401 --> 00:46:23.370
<v Speaker 3>whatever applied the same work ethic to </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

1069
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.920
<v Speaker 3>They might be successful if they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>

1070
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.113
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people think they're funny </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just forget that fucking the </v>

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.840
<v Speaker 2>You're just saying a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

1127
00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.010
<v Speaker 2>You've got to stop this.</v>

1128
00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It's very fucking good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1129
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his act is uniquely him.</v>

1130
00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Kick it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never teach anybody how to do that.</v>

1131
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that act.</v>

1132
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.500
<v Speaker 1>He had a figure that act out on his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's developed a so well.</v>

1133
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the thing.</v>

1134
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like with comedy,</v>

1135
00:49:13.781 --> 00:49:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy shit is,</v>

1136
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.960
<v Speaker 1>is that everyone thinks they could do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense that like,</v>

1137
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.370
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell a joke and I could show.</v>

1138
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.233
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people can tell a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom could tell a joke my that </v>

1139
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 1>everyone can tell a joke because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>written in Shit,</v>

1140
00:49:28.481 --> 00:49:29.314
<v Speaker 1>but it's so hard to cultivate who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are because that's you're also doing </v>

1141
00:49:33.341 --> 00:49:35.170
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like trying to figure out,</v>

1142
00:49:35.171 --> 00:49:36.004
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a bunch of fucking insane shit </v>

1143
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:41.050
<v Speaker 1>and my brain and this is how I think it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to figure out how I'm going to say</v>

1144
00:49:41.051 --> 00:49:43.120
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily how everyone else</v>

1145
00:49:43.121 --> 00:49:43.954
<v Speaker 1>would say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just how I feel about it and </v>

1146
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:46.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say it that way.</v>

1147
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Take into account the economy of words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to sneak it up on people.</v>

1148
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:54.620
<v Speaker 2>You want to get the idea into their head</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they figured it out on their own,</v>

1149
00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.720
<v Speaker 2>so like boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it pops.</v>

1150
00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you want.</v>

1151
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like a little race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the.</v>

1152
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.193
<v Speaker 2>You have to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduce it in a way that's unique and </v>

1153
00:50:06.591 --> 00:50:07.424
<v Speaker 2>captivating and entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also quick enough to get into their </v>

1154
00:50:10.791 --> 00:50:12.410
<v Speaker 2>brain before they figured out where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going.</v>

1155
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Because the worst thing is when you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy on stage and you're like,</v>

1156
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:16.460
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where this is going,</v>

1157
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.950
<v Speaker 2>and then he gets there and then a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>people go,</v>

1158
00:50:18.951 --> 00:50:20.060
<v Speaker 2>ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ha ha.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was there yesterday dog I saw coming </v>

1160
00:50:25.391 --> 00:50:28.250

<v Speaker 1>Unless they can say</v>

1161
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.870
<v Speaker 3>it and you see it coming and it still </v>
<v Speaker 3>hits you because it's so good.</v>

1162
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:31.723
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just really good writing and the </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1164
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:37.874
<v Speaker 3>but it's also on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're talking about how hard it </v>

1165
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:41.804
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also the most fun shit of all time </v>

1166
00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:44.950
<v Speaker 3>when it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1167
00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:50.340
<v Speaker 3>pops off when you had to have a new bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have that pause right before you</v>

1168
00:50:50.361 --> 00:50:54.020
<v Speaker 3>deliver and you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I told him that's not real.</v>

1169

<v Speaker 3>And then ever goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1172
00:51:01.911 --> 00:51:02.744
<v Speaker 3>the whole audience laughs and roars and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're having a good time and it's one </v>

1173
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:09.260
<v Speaker 3>of the greatest feelings in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because,</v>

<v Speaker 3>your mouth and then you're like,</v>

1224
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:39.540
<v Speaker 1>When you see girls getting upset at guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing my face because you could like,</v>

1225
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:40.613

1228
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:52.560
<v Speaker 1>laughing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a fiance now,</v>

1229
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:53.394
<v Speaker 1>but we got engaged like three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago and I do this bit about or </v>

1230
00:53:55.411 --> 00:53:56.244
<v Speaker 1>where I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a one night she got mad at me </v>

1231
00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 1>because I closed the door too loud </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she was sleeping and I was drunk</v>

1232
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:03.714
<v Speaker 1>and I came home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just accidentally closed the door and </v>

1233
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you like the bit is I say,</v>

1234
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways to close the door.</v>

1235
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:10.763
<v Speaker 1>As Amanda's a regulator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just close it like you've been taught </v>

1236
00:54:12.211 --> 00:54:13.380
<v Speaker 1>your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another way.</v>

1237
00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.420
<v Speaker 1>If you live with your girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come home like she's sleeping,</v>

1238
00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:16.254
<v Speaker 1>you gotta turn the Doorknob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push it into the frame and then release </v>

1239
00:54:18.631 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 1>it so it doesn't make a noise or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

1240
00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:25.491
<v Speaker 1>My end and you see guys and girls going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who told you that's how you got to do.</v>

1241
00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me is like the best where it's </v>

1242
00:54:31.531 --> 00:54:32.364
<v Speaker 1>like I know everything that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers are going through in this </v>

1243
00:54:34.711 --> 00:54:38.340
<v Speaker 1>fucking moment and the and like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna go home and talk about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>loud.</v>

1246
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:47.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite part of doing any bit</v>

1247
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:50.280
<v Speaker 1>where it's like you could see a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of just react to some shit.</v>

1248
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:51.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel sorry for people that don't have </v>

1249
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.290
<v Speaker 1>a job where they can be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1250
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I think whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1251
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're a person who enjoys creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1252
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:02.603
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most rewarding feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>of building something that wasn't there </v>

1253
00:55:05.071 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 1>before and then all of a sudden it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you made it.</v>

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard like completing a,</v>

1255

<v Speaker 1>Like a special.</v>

1257

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1259
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I did a spot on seth meyers in like July</v>
<v Speaker 1>of last year,</v>

1260
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:24.930

1261
00:55:24.931 --> 00:55:26.000
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On TV.</v>

1262
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:27.180
<v Speaker 1>How was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a weird.</v>

1263
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:28.913
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like a nice guy as a </v>

1264
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:30.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1265
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I love seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

1266
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I met him before because at updates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he came upstairs and like hang out.</v>

1267
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Would it come hang out with us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1268
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:38.160
<v Speaker 1>the show itself was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1269
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:39.740
<v Speaker 1>the process with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>

1270
00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:40.653
<v Speaker 1>the booker there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very simple because they're like </v>

1271
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.990
<v Speaker 1>big fans of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like seth is obviously a fan of comedy,</v>

1272
00:55:44.991 --> 00:55:47.790
<v Speaker 1>but the lady that books a show is also a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big fan of comedy.</v>

1273
00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:52.230
<v Speaker 1>So I was a bit nervous just because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like my first time going on in front</v>

1274
00:55:52.231 --> 00:55:53.790
<v Speaker 1>of millions of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1275
00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 1>People watched that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was just like,</v>

1276
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:56.783
<v Speaker 1>I got to make sure that my writing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my jokes come off as fucking strong as </v>

1277
00:56:00.121 --> 00:56:02.760
<v Speaker 1>possible and it went great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1278
00:56:02.761 --> 00:56:06.130
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously some people trolls </v>
<v Speaker 1>like talking shit on Youtube,</v>

1279
00:56:06.131 --> 00:56:09.260
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1280
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.350
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so tough not to.</v>

1281
00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:14.880
<v Speaker 1>It's so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>

1282
00:56:14.881 --> 00:56:15.714
<v Speaker 1>With the thing that you're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the instagram where you deleted every </v>

<v Speaker 3>and hoping that there's something new in</v>

<v Speaker 3>there and they never asked.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's like that same feeling.</v>

1312
00:57:36.491 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 3>I botched his joke.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that is really what it is.</v>

1315
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:43.303
<v Speaker 3>It's this weird compulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this instantaneous gratification thing </v>

1316
00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 3>that you're getting off of some weird </v>

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 3>by touching that device and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>information to pop up.</v>

1318
00:57:55.091 --> 00:57:57.040

<v Speaker 3>Even in the hunting world,</v>

1344
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:11.343
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people like instagramming while</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hunting and they're doing </v>

1345
00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.300
<v Speaker 3>instastories while they're out there in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the forest.</v>

1346
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.793
<v Speaker 3>It's good when there's no connection </v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's no service and no </v>

1347
00:59:20.201 --> 00:59:21.560
<v Speaker 3>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>

<v Speaker 3>dropped that shit like 10 times and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped it and it just started making </v>

<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1372
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:25.520
<v Speaker 3>You're not missing anything from Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Missing anything,</v>

1373
01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:28.340
<v Speaker 3>but you feel like you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Check twitter,</v>

1374
01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 3>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram is,</v>

1375
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:33.800
<v Speaker 3>we're addicted to it to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1376
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.620
<v Speaker 3>it feels like cigarettes in the fifties </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's like no one.</v>

1377
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Here it is mark dorm and social media is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1378
01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:40.640
<v Speaker 3>look in the fridge over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1379
01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:41.474
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you check it so many times that </v>

1380
01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:45.230
<v Speaker 3>eventually you start consuming things </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even like.</v>

1381
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even better.</v>

1382
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:48.100
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start bleeding.</v>

1383
01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Tweet leftover 2,630</v>
<v Speaker 3>likes son is going to go up a lot now.</v>

1384
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>

1385
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.720
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1386
01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:01.550
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in my real fear is that this is one</v>

1387
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:02.384
<v Speaker 3>stage of a complete connection to </v>
<v Speaker 3>electronics and to each other that's </v>

1388
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:08.803
<v Speaker 3>unhealthy and unproductive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unavoidable because I don't think we're </v>

1389
01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:13.004
<v Speaker 3>gonna end with social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like twitter and instagram where it's </v>

1390
01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:18.530
<v Speaker 3>like you can just press a button,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>

1391
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:21.530
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be completely connected to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain.</v>

1392
01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have that fairly soon.</v>

1393
01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:25.334
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like within the next 10 years </v>

1394
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.373
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be a normal thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just pull up information </v>

1395
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.230
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously.</v>

1396
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:31.063
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the watch thing feels almost like </v>

1397
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.220
<v Speaker 3>wearing a digital watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1398
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:36.063
<v Speaker 3>this is a regular watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't my dad's Rato from like 1980 </v>

1399
01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:42.200
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make such cool digital watches now.</v>

1400
01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:45.410
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look cool now.</v>

1401
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>

1402
01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I think the next step is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1403
01:01:47.961 --> 01:01:49.230
<v Speaker 3>I can just do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even got to.</v>

1404
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.670
<v Speaker 3>What's the prompt you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't reach in your pocket</v>

1405
01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 3>to check your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just got an iphone,</v>

1406
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:56.660
<v Speaker 3>watch whatever the fuck they call that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1407
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I watch and I wore it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1408
01:01:59.451 --> 01:02:01.160
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing with this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even like.</v>

1409
01:02:01.161 --> 01:02:02.330
<v Speaker 3>It buzzes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1410
01:02:02.331 --> 01:02:02.841
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

1411
01:02:02.841 --> 01:02:03.674
<v Speaker 3>This person texted me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still got to fucking go on this </v>

1412
01:02:04.881 --> 01:02:06.170
<v Speaker 3>thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1413
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not this enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phone is enough.</v>

1414
01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:10.813
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that's good for is your </v>

1415
01:02:11.571 --> 01:02:12.340
<v Speaker 3>heart rate.</v>

1416
01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.180
<v Speaker 3>It monitors your heart rate when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>run.</v>

1417
01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:15.890
<v Speaker 3>It's good for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the race thing.</v>

1418
01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.773
<v Speaker 3>Watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also logs the amount of time and </v>

1419
01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:23.520
<v Speaker 3>miles that you put in and your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your heart rate variability and all that</v>

1420
01:02:23.521 --> 01:02:25.650
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is some good aspects to it in terms</v>

1421
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:28.080
<v Speaker 3>of a fitness tracker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but other than that it's like,</v>

1422
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 3>to what end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1423
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:32.760
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't run.</v>

1424
01:02:32.761 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Elan was on the podcast,</v>

1425
01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:36.384
<v Speaker 3>he was talking to me about his neuro </v>
<v Speaker 3>link thing that he's going to be coming </v>

1426
01:02:38.761 --> 01:02:40.530
<v Speaker 3>out with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said back then,</v>

1427
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.690
<v Speaker 3>and this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that three months ago?</v>

1428
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:45.833
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere around three months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that they were going to be </v>

1429
01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 3>coming out with it within four to six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1430
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:53.070
<v Speaker 3>So that's any day now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what the fuck this is,</v>

1431
01:02:53.071 --> 01:02:57.540
<v Speaker 3>but he said essentially it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna open up the bandwidth between</v>

1432
01:02:57.541 --> 01:02:58.374
<v Speaker 3>you and information that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>radically change the way human beings </v>

1433
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:01.500
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1434
01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:04.950
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way human beings access information.</v>

1435
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like a internet thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't tell me why.</v>

1436
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:11.940
<v Speaker 3>That's all he would tell blink neurolink</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1437
01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:12.870
<v Speaker 3>because it's on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1438
01:03:12.871 --> 01:03:13.704
<v Speaker 3>we were on air when he was saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I oddly trust him to be a </v>

1439
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.600
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a net positive for the universe.</v>

1440
01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

1441
01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:23.604
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like Zuckerberg and like other </v>

1442
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:30.050
<v Speaker 3>times net doesn't net negative for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are the reasons.</v>

1443
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:30.953
<v Speaker 3>They are a lot of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 3>society has gone the way it has because </v>

1444
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.710
<v Speaker 3>you can confirm whatever the fuck.</v>

1445
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:35.730
<v Speaker 3>But Elan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1446
01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:37.163
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not fucking build a car that you </v>

1447
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:43.030
<v Speaker 3>don't need any gasoline for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not fucking send shit to this space?</v>

1448
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a net positive for us.</v>

1449
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:48.660
<v Speaker 3>I am 100 percent convinced he's a net </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive.</v>

1450
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:52.580
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a legitimate genius and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think there's a lot of them.</v>

1451
01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Mark Zuckerberg is a smart guy.</v>

1452
01:03:54.771 --> 01:03:56.970
<v Speaker 3>He was very ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a big difference.</v>

1453
01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:57.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Zuckerberg quote that I read </v>

1454
01:03:59.311 --> 01:04:03.900
<v Speaker 3>recently that what's good for the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not necessarily good for facebook.</v>

1455
01:04:03.901 --> 01:04:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1456
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that he burned it to the ground.</v>

1457
01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:10.800
<v Speaker 3>That's all out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull out,</v>

1458
01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.320
<v Speaker 3>pull out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's let the fuck.</v>

1459
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Did you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1460
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.050
<v Speaker 3>how much money do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

1461
01:04:16.051 --> 01:04:18.750
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you have like $18,000,000,000?</v>

1462
01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 3>How much more do you need?</v>

1463
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:20.873
<v Speaker 3>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sitting over here talking about </v>

1464
01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:26.250
<v Speaker 3>what's good for facebook is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily good for the good.</v>

1465
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.000
<v Speaker 3>You got all the good for 18 fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred lifetimes.</v>

1466
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that,</v>

1467
01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My favorite Zuckerberg joke,</v>

1468
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:37.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1469
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.033
<v Speaker 3>we were at update and this was when </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zuckerberg is a being grilled by </v>

1470
01:04:43.261 --> 01:04:48.261
<v Speaker 3>Congress and when he's sipping wine to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this and Chris rock comes by and he</v>

1471
01:04:48.991 --> 01:04:49.824
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1472
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:51.750
<v Speaker 3>you know what I didn't like about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>trial.</v>

1473
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:52.943
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing worse than watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone being grilled by Congress when </v>

1474
01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:56.934
<v Speaker 3>there's no stakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing happens to mark Zuckerberg if </v>

1475
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.840
<v Speaker 3>even if the shit goes worse for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing happens to that guy.</v>

1476
01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my face.</v>

1477
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:05.863
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never think about it that way where </v>

1478
01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:09.840
<v Speaker 3>nothing happens to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

1479
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 3>if even if facebook blows up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1480
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:17.070
<v Speaker 3>here's what could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If facebook intentionally concluded,</v>

1481
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 3>if there was some</v>

1482
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.083
<v Speaker 2>sort of proof that they received some </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial compensation to lean one way </v>

1483
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.150
<v Speaker 2>or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

1484
01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.590
<v Speaker 2>is that was percolating right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1485
01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:30.424
<v Speaker 2>but it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what they were searching for </v>

1486
01:05:32.511 --> 01:05:34.630
<v Speaker 2>when they're searching for is what we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find out.</v>

1487
01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:35.523
<v Speaker 2>How is it that these Russian bots are </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to disseminate propaganda so </v>

1488
01:05:41.411 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 2>readily and so easily and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiently?</v>

1489
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop that.</v>

1490
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:49.750
<v Speaker 2>How has all this stuff propagated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where's this coming from?</v>

1491
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:50.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people that were asking were </v>

1492
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>techno ignorant and that was part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with Congress,</v>

1493
01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.520
<v Speaker 2>so it was like a Google makes the iphone</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1494
01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.823
<v Speaker 2>Going to ask him to Google and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come my niece has got bad words on </v>

1495
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:08.620
<v Speaker 2>her iphone and someone has to tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google doesn't make the iphone the whole</v>

1496
01:06:08.621 --> 01:06:12.970
<v Speaker 2>place roars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you go to Congress to laugh,</v>

1497
01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:15.310
<v Speaker 2>like everybody's laughing at what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking idiot you are.</v>

1498
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.240
<v Speaker 2>These are the people that are asking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

1499
01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.970
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1500
01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:22.360
<v Speaker 2>You need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need people from like ars Technica.</v>

1501
01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:24.190
<v Speaker 2>You need people from like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1502
01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:29.230
<v Speaker 2>a scene that you need people from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need fucking techno guys.</v>

1503
01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:30.363
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women who really understand </v>

1504
01:06:32.351 --> 01:06:34.780
<v Speaker 2>technology should be throwing those </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions around Asians.</v>

1505
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people with autism.</v>

1506
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:38.703
<v Speaker 2>You need people that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly understand what the complications </v>

1507
01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:44.060
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1508
01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:48.820
<v Speaker 2>what the ramifications are and what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have done to prevent these things.</v>

1509
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:49.893
<v Speaker 2>I think that what happened with facebook</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's happening with twitter and a </v>

1510
01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:55.810
<v Speaker 2>lot of these other things is no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>anticipated the impact culturally.</v>

1511
01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:56.663
<v Speaker 2>They were going to have the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about this the other day </v>

1512
01:06:58.661 --> 01:06:59.494
<v Speaker 2>about a with Sam j like maybe a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago about like how it's the </v>

1513
01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:08.650
<v Speaker 2>democratization of information and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy it is to pretend like you know what</v>

1514
01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:09.370
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about.</v>

1515
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:12.130
<v Speaker 2>That's like the majority of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like facebook,</v>

1516
01:07:12.131 --> 01:07:15.370
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this shit because it used to be all.</v>

1517
01:07:15.371 --> 01:07:18.190
<v Speaker 2>You need an infrastructure to spread </v>
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>

1518
01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:22.060
<v Speaker 2>You needed a fucking truck factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you don't even need pants.</v>

1519
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:22.923
<v Speaker 2>You could just fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just got to put like a weird fucking </v>

1520
01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:27.970
<v Speaker 2>eagle on your website and it's like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the fucking news.</v>

1521
01:07:27.971 --> 01:07:28.804
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't even have to have a website that </v>

1522
01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.840
<v Speaker 2>have a popular twitter account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

1523
01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:32.723
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have popular twitter accounts and when </v>

1524
01:07:34.811 --> 01:07:37.250
<v Speaker 2>you go to the twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I.</v>

1525
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:39.580
<v Speaker 2>There's quite a few people that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>followed that I don't follow.</v>

1526
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.593
<v Speaker 2>What that means is I bookmark their page</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that they don't even know that I </v>

1527
01:07:43.241 --> 01:07:45.550
<v Speaker 2>follow them because they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

1528
01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.713
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them sending me DDMS and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go and read their stuff and they </v>

1529
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.380
<v Speaker 2>are on there all day.</v>

1530
01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1531
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:54.663
<v Speaker 2>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing battle against the good </v>

1532
01:07:56.051 --> 01:07:58.120
<v Speaker 2>and the bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dark forces in the light,</v>

1533
01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:03.450
<v Speaker 2>they're just fucking going after it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they develop these sort of a news portal</v>

1534
01:08:04.301 --> 01:08:07.390
<v Speaker 2>pages and you don't even know who the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck these people are.</v>

1535
01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:08.224
<v Speaker 2>You don't know anything about them but </v>
<v Speaker 2>their page or it's all battling and I </v>

1536
01:08:11.381 --> 01:08:14.760
<v Speaker 2>know I follow people that are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore right wing people that had just</v>

1537
01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.790
<v Speaker 2>battling the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're hilarious.</v>

1538
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.713
<v Speaker 2>It's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I follow people that are hard </v>

1539
01:08:20.121 --> 01:08:21.980
<v Speaker 2>core lefties that are battling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1540

<v Speaker 2>Everyone's a Nazi and everyone's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>right like you're outright for it </v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking single liberal principle.</v>

1542
01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:32.570

<v Speaker 1>This whole Columbia shit is that I was </v>

1544
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:43.031
<v Speaker 1>featured on Breitbart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They finally like a brown dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I cannot be like,</v>

1546
01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I got emails from people at Fox News </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dinesh D'souza Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1549
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking.</v>

1550
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:53.983
<v Speaker 1>I hate that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about to say something bad guys </v>

1551
01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:59.270
<v Speaker 1>can't stand that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1552
01:08:59.271 --> 01:09:00.104
<v Speaker 1>he's the only brown guy that made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through him and him and fucking Bobby </v>

1553
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.213
<v Speaker 1>Jindal like they're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to turn me into this </v>

1554
01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:06.051
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1555
01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not coming on your fucking TV shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can use me as your.</v>

1556
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:14.350
<v Speaker 1>So everything's gone a muck and PC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've wished free speech was under attack</v>

1557
01:09:14.391 --> 01:09:16.130
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people need to shut the fuck up.</v>

1558
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.040
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this.</v>

1559
01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:22.460
<v Speaker 1>There's too much shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has a podcast show me,</v>

1560
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't deserve to speak a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1561
01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell everybody get to,</v>

1562
01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.920
<v Speaker 1>to get a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I stopped because,</v>

1563
01:09:30.921 --> 01:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1564
01:09:31.851 --> 01:09:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can anymore.</v>

1565
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:34.993
<v Speaker 1>I think over the last few years it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting so saturated that it's almost </v>

1566
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:41.240
<v Speaker 1>impossible to break through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that.</v>

1567
01:09:41.241 --> 01:09:43.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>

1568
01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:44.384
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need a everyone's opinion </v>

1569
01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:47.143
<v Speaker 1>about it like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have to fucking work to </v>

1570
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:50.684
<v Speaker 1>develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have the right to have an opinion </v>

1571
01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.990
<v Speaker 1>about some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you should.</v>

1572
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 1>You definitely should have a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

1573
01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.760
<v Speaker 1>It should be something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well thought out nuance.</v>

1574
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:04.760
<v Speaker 1>There's no nuance anymore either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because because everything's got to</v>

1575
01:10:04.761 --> 01:10:06.380
<v Speaker 1>be black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with a lot.</v>

1576
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:09.920
<v Speaker 1>This younger generation was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something's not black and white,</v>

1577
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.920
<v Speaker 1>it goes fucking arrive for them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want it to be black and white,</v>

1578
01:10:12.921 --> 01:10:15.230
<v Speaker 1>so they'll create a false narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it is black or white.</v>

1579
01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1580
01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.373
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing that you see a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>today where people pretend that someone </v>

1581
01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:20.460
<v Speaker 2>is something and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1582
01:10:20.461 --> 01:10:24.300
<v Speaker 2>they do this reductionist thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they boil it down to one thing,</v>

1583
01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went on stage and said anti gay anti </v>

1584
01:10:28.921 --> 01:10:32.880
<v Speaker 2>black jokes at Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy's a piece of shit.</v>

1585
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:34.860
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like an Indian portal to the outright.</v>

1587

<v Speaker 1>That's who you think I am as a magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>carpet to the outright.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I find me a comic.</v>

1593

<v Speaker 1>they fucking suck.</v>

1594

01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:07.670
<v Speaker 1>somebody in and their own agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This reduction is shit.</v>

1598
01:11:07.671 --> 01:11:08.504
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how I feel about it and look at </v>

1599
01:11:10.671 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>the points that make me seem smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incorrect about this.</v>

1600
01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1601
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:14.993
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to do that online in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of everybody instead of like this </v>

1602
01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:21.270
<v Speaker 2>internal examination of their actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings and how they really think about</v>

1603
01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:24.180
<v Speaker 2>things and whether or not they make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense or whether or not it's objective.</v>

1604
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:25.463
<v Speaker 2>Instead of that they're broadcasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and this sort of weird way that's </v>

1605
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.760
<v Speaker 2>at least partially intentionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>deceptive.</v>

1606
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Like the acknowledgement that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

1607
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:39.180
<v Speaker 2>That there is nuance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no,</v>

1608
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:43.110
<v Speaker 2>life is fucking complicated and ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>are complicated.</v>

1609
01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Especially ideas in terms of when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

1610
01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 2>When you're talking about this cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of battle that's going on right now</v>

1611
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:53.003
<v Speaker 2>between the you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're attacking people who are like </v>

1612
01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:56.063
<v Speaker 2>clearly very left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for not being left wing enough and </v>

1613
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.490
<v Speaker 2>they're running out of target.</v>

1614
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>I will bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone hit me up saying,</v>

1615
01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:08.763

<v Speaker 1>supremacists and people that are </v>

1627
01:12:44.321 --> 01:12:45.820
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I'm not,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call up someone at the KKK,</v>

<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

1632
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:05.800
<v Speaker 2>That is hilarious that you have not </v>
<v Speaker 2>denounced white supremacists.</v>

1633
01:13:05.801 --> 01:13:09.440
<v Speaker 2>So by your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Dave decided that you haven't acted</v>

1634
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:12.380
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes there'll be a story online and</v>

1635
01:13:12.381 --> 01:13:13.214
<v Speaker 2>I will get a tweet with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Your silence about this story is </v>

1636
01:13:15.861 --> 01:13:17.240
<v Speaker 2>deafening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1639
01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:22.803
<v Speaker 1>but I cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone had to tell me that that </v>

1640
01:13:25.211 --> 01:13:27.020
<v Speaker 1>was happening before I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll respond some way.</v>

1643
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:31.643
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to think about things before I </v>

1644
01:13:32.471 --> 01:13:33.450
<v Speaker 2>respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Louis ck thing went down,</v>

1646
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:36.833
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of angry tweets into one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them from a fucking journalists that </v>

1647
01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:41.574
<v Speaker 2>I've done stories with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done interviews with this guy </v>

1648
01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:44.034
<v Speaker 2>before and he was talking shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians that have not denounced Louis </v>

1649
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.251
<v Speaker 2>C k.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

1650
01:13:49.251 --> 01:13:51.390
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>

1651
01:13:51.391 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the whole story.</v>

1652
01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.360
<v Speaker 2>I know what he said and I know what she </v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

1653
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.530
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1654
01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.860
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing seems to me like a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>old cluster fuck even.</v>

1655
01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1656
01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.660
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1657
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:04.943
<v Speaker 2>like you can denounce his actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he said he did all this shit that he </v>

1658
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:10.850
<v Speaker 2>mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ew,</v>

1659
01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 2>that's gross.</v>

1660
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what he did was incorrect and </v>

1661
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:16.450
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that like,</v>

1662
01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you should denounce that you should not </v>
<v Speaker 1>be working again.</v>

1663
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.823
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you forget I'm also a comic and be </v>

1664
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.733
<v Speaker 1>murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make parole dog like the fucking you </v>

1665
01:14:25.611 --> 01:14:28.270
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does it end?</v>

1666
01:14:28.271 --> 01:14:29.104
<v Speaker 1>Almost there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things that you should be </v>

1667
01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:31.144
<v Speaker 1>way more upset about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about a hastert the guy who's the </v>

1668
01:14:33.431 --> 01:14:38.431
<v Speaker 1>speaker of the house who went to jail </v>
<v Speaker 1>for fucking kids and he molested a bunch</v>

1669
01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>of kids and he only got 15 months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1670
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1671
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1672
01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:45.043
<v Speaker 1>Exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So meanwhile everybody is ranting and </v>

1673
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:47.730
<v Speaker 1>railing about Louis C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k.</v>

1674
01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.680
<v Speaker 1>not that this diminishes what Lucy Kay </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

1675
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:51.763
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying there's some real horrors</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and to choose to </v>

1676
01:14:55.630 --> 01:14:57.760
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the comedian who asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

1677
01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.170
<v Speaker 1>can I jerk off in front of you?</v>

1678
01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:00.970
<v Speaker 1>They said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did it.</v>

1679
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:06.330
<v Speaker 1>He didn't hold anybody in a room against</v>
<v Speaker 1>their will or force them to watch him or</v>

1680
01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 1>what he did was just gross and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped doing it like more than 10 years</v>

1681
01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:13.630
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good,</v>

1682
01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:14.763
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that someone would think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I need to make a statement about </v>

1683
01:15:17.201 --> 01:15:17.651
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bitch,</v>

1684
01:15:17.651 --> 01:15:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to make a statement about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1685
01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to talk about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk to him about like,</v>

1686
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.720
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so quick.</v>

1687
01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:28.240
<v Speaker 1>We automatically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say we,</v>

1688
01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean people at large sort of assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst about a person immediately.</v>

1689
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also this social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1690
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1691
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.113
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they really assume that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they just have this opportunity </v>

1692
01:15:40.211 --> 01:15:41.044
<v Speaker 1>to express themselves in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get a reaction out of </v>

1693
01:15:42.461 --> 01:15:43.900
<v Speaker 1>you and this is the way to do it.</v>

1694
01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.011
<v Speaker 1>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1695
01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:45.844
<v Speaker 1>what's crazy is that like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been harping on this younger </v>

1696
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:50.314
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've said some shit at like seller </v>

1697
01:15:52.301 --> 01:15:53.134
<v Speaker 1>and Vu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like very anti trump shit and people </v>

1698
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:58.240
<v Speaker 1>have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I view the sellers,</v>

1699
01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the other clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1700
01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:01.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what I said about trump.</v>

1701
01:16:01.931 --> 01:16:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I basically fat shaming because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a fat piece of shit,</v>

1702
01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:05.794
<v Speaker 1>but like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more articulate in joke form and some </v>

1703
01:16:10.241 --> 01:16:11.770
<v Speaker 1>guy got up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

1704
01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:14.260
<v Speaker 1>and it just bounced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1705
01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.393
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're mad about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You not mad about the fact that he is </v>

1706
01:16:18.581 --> 01:16:19.414
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your president is a billionaire </v>

1707
01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:24.220
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't use his money to just hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>a personal trainer once in a while.</v>

1708
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:25.083
<v Speaker 1>Like adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's diet is not the way you want </v>

1709
01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:30.490
<v Speaker 1>your fucking president to be living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his life more or less.</v>

1710
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:33.520
<v Speaker 1>And this person just got up and bounce </v>

<v Speaker 2>stuff that you shouldn't be at a comedy </v>

1740
01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:55.670
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where people go to say offensive</v>

1741
01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:58.730
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's like you don't want dirt in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hands and you're in a garden.</v>

<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1745
01:18:04.111 --> 01:18:05.270
<v Speaker 2>but people politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1746
01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:06.104
<v Speaker 2>when you get into their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know their team and you're shitting </v>

1747
01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:10.190
<v Speaker 2>on their team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably Republican.</v>

1748
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Of course he has brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's living in Florida.</v>

1749
01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Water's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's.</v>

1750
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:21.030
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like politically like people are,</v>

1751
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:24.910
<v Speaker 1>are so like that's part of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

1752
01:18:24.911 --> 01:18:29.911
<v Speaker 1>Almost were like having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have done a lot of political comedy,</v>

1753
01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to me it's like when you do that,</v>

1754
01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.260
<v Speaker 1>you're almost talking to them as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if their politics are their person,</v>

1755
01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:38.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1756
01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.560
<v Speaker 1>and that's the kind of crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>

1757
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.130
<v Speaker 1>my politics are not necessarily who I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a human being.</v>

1758
01:18:45.131 --> 01:18:45.964
<v Speaker 1>Like I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty liberal when it comes to </v>

1759
01:18:48.431 --> 01:18:49.264
<v Speaker 1>social issues but might be fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative when it comes to financial </v>

1760
01:18:52.631 --> 01:18:54.220
<v Speaker 1>issues and fiscal issues and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1761
01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.553
<v Speaker 1>don't take what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I voted for it to be who I am as a </v>

1762
01:18:59.261 --> 01:19:00.094
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one has that nuance anymore </v>

1763
01:19:02.051 --> 01:19:02.884
<v Speaker 1>about anything.</v>

1764
01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an identity issue.</v>

1765
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:09.870
<v Speaker 2>People find whatever team it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's progressive or conservative</v>

1766
01:19:10.001 --> 01:19:14.110
<v Speaker 2>and they just decide this is my identity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they cloak themselves in it and then</v>

1767
01:19:14.111 --> 01:19:14.944
<v Speaker 2>they defend it and some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that someone like yourself was </v>

1768

<v Speaker 1>with anything other than a real </v>

1849
01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:38.163
<v Speaker 1>It's also very apparent in every article</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was printed or whatever that most </v>

1850
01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:47.040
<v Speaker 1>people are on my side so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a hundred percent confident.</v>

1851
01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I did nothing wrong from a human as a </v>

01:22:55.651 --> 01:22:56.760
<v Speaker 1>been a thing I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know these people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1856
01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:00.993
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking took calculus with you people </v>

1857
01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.113
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the kind of Shit that me and my </v>

1858
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.353
<v Speaker 1>Asian friends and my Indian friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk when we were in fucking </v>

1859
01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.100
<v Speaker 1>school like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking light work.</v>

1860
01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1861
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe that.</v>

1862
01:23:15.011 --> 01:23:16.060
<v Speaker 1>But even then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1863
01:23:16.061 --> 01:23:16.894
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to fucking think about </v>

1864
01:23:19.001 --> 01:23:21.130
<v Speaker 1>that going awry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1865
01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:22.540
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1866
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.820
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:26.303
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an educational experience and net </v>

1868
01:23:28.231 --> 01:23:29.064
<v Speaker 2>positive overall without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also gives us an opportunity to </v>

1869
01:23:31.801 --> 01:23:34.320
<v Speaker 2>make fun of these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think they need.</v>

1870
01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:37.860
<v Speaker 2>They need to realize that the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks they're fools in the eye.</v>

1871
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:41.700
<v Speaker 2>And I really believed that all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read several articles on your case,</v>

1872
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:46.790
<v Speaker 2>your situation rather your case caught a</v>
<v Speaker 2>case like a comedy me to,</v>

1873
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:50.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the articles that I've read were all</v>

1874
01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:54.640
<v Speaker 2>essentially positive and they were all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1875
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.230
<v Speaker 2>mocking these fucking little children.</v>

1876
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:58.263
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say for the record that eyes </v>

1877
01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>on the record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still think that it was,</v>

1878
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I still think that it's the minority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that group,</v>

1879
01:24:06.261 --> 01:24:08.660
<v Speaker 1>especially at Columbia for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1880
01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's just that they happen to like.</v>

1881
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:11.763
<v Speaker 1>Because the majority of the kids were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like amped and like had a good time and </v>

1882
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:15.100
<v Speaker 1>even if</v>

1883
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 2>that can happen though word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some majority,</v>

1884
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:17.913
<v Speaker 2>a majority can like you in a minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>can stand up and then the majority </v>

1885
01:24:20.771 --> 01:24:21.870
<v Speaker 2>doesn't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1886
01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:23.680
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit hurt my feelings.</v>

1887
01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:24.751
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1888
01:24:24.751 --> 01:24:25.584
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kids,</v>

1889
01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.490
<v Speaker 1>those kids saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them stay,</v>

1890
01:24:27.491 --> 01:24:29.510
<v Speaker 1>let them stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't like a chorus which is,</v>

1891
01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:31.820
<v Speaker 1>I would have hoped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

1892
01:24:32.730 --> 01:24:34.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a little fucking babies and they</v>

1893
01:24:34.841 --> 01:24:35.674
<v Speaker 2>need to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to hit it a little babies </v>

1894
01:24:36.761 --> 01:24:38.650
<v Speaker 2>because that's how you grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1895
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:39.484
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do something ridiculous and that </v>

1896
01:24:40.511 --> 01:24:42.100
<v Speaker 2>people criticize you and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>

1897
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:43.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of ridiculous.</v>

1898
01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:45.063
<v Speaker 2>Let me just check myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Than it hurts your feelings and you </v>

1899
01:24:46.751 --> 01:24:49.330
<v Speaker 2>fight it off for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You try to pretend you battle it,</v>

1900
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:50.343
<v Speaker 2>but overall over the course of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to absorb that information </v>

1901
01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:58.030
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully those kids are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow and mature.</v>

1902
01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:02.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have friends that were like </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely progressive,</v>

1903
01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:03.093
<v Speaker 2>Weirdo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy off the charts like activists 10 </v>

1904
01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:12.450
<v Speaker 2>years ago and now they're like way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way mellow and they've just like,</v>

1905
01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:13.323
<v Speaker 2>what was wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was virtue signaling I was trying too </v>

1906
01:25:15.731 --> 01:25:16.564
<v Speaker 2>hard and they realized like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what they were doing was just </v>

1907
01:25:18.791 --> 01:25:19.624
<v Speaker 2>wasting energy and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a lot of angst and a lot of just </v>

1908
01:25:22.511 --> 01:25:26.140
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to affect change in order to make</v>

1909
01:25:26.141 --> 01:25:28.600
<v Speaker 2>themselves feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1910
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:32.740
<v Speaker 2>Trying to push buttons in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>validate their existence.</v>

1911
01:25:32.970 --> 01:25:34.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that specific.</v>

1912
01:25:34.890 --> 01:25:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was like it was either </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a note.</v>

1913
01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:41.550
<v Speaker 1>We have an opportunity to assert our </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of rightness,</v>

1914
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.013
<v Speaker 1>however wrong it is here and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take a stand and this is </v>

1915
01:25:46.891 --> 01:25:48.680
<v Speaker 1>who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1916
01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.340
<v Speaker 1>just just chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1917
01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.190
<v Speaker 2>chill the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1918
01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1919
01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:54.863
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of foolishness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is the world we live in and I </v>

1920
01:25:56.881 --> 01:25:57.714
<v Speaker 2>think there's a big part of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>accentuated by the fact that we have a </v>

1921
01:26:00.571 --> 01:26:02.310
<v Speaker 2>maniac for president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>

1922

<v Speaker 2>water is because</v>

1923
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.490
<v Speaker 3>they feel like that eval needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>combated at every turn because we didn't</v>

1924
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.593
<v Speaker 3>before and we let this guy get into </v>
<v Speaker 3>office and now here he is and the </v>

1925
01:26:11.571 --> 01:26:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Mueller probe and all this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>craziness.</v>

1926
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:17.720
<v Speaker 3>When Obama was president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she felt a lot cooler.</v>

1927
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Now it's like trump is president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was like,</v>

1928

1932
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:30.643

<v Speaker 3>We used to think that you understood </v>

1933
01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.120
<v Speaker 3>national policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's just trying to make buddy.</v>

1938
01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:47.540
<v Speaker 3>And wouldn't you love to be a fly on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wall?</v>

1939
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:48.403
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause what we're getting all the crazy </v>

1940
01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:51.950
<v Speaker 3>is him when he knows cameras are on him.</v>

1941
01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:52.933
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to see what he's like </v>

1942
01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.633
<v Speaker 3>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what I would love to see him like </v>

1943
01:26:58.311 --> 01:26:59.144
<v Speaker 3>watch Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to like sit in our cheeseburger </v>

1944
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:03.980
<v Speaker 3>just fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a crazy person.</v>

1945
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:06.020
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1946
01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:06.873
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unnerving and that's what I think </v>

1947
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:13.830
<v Speaker 3>like what a lot of what we're seeing on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with this particular thing is</v>

1948
01:27:14.151 --> 01:27:14.984
<v Speaker 3>the thing where it's like you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>control in any other facet of your life </v>

1949
01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.273
<v Speaker 3>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to try to exert it in a </v>

1950
01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:22.124
<v Speaker 3>way that you think is positive when in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact you're doing the opposite of what </v>

1951
01:27:26.031 --> 01:27:26.830
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1952
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:29.450
<v Speaker 3>your liberal sensibilities are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1953
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:30.643
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also a trend and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that political correctness and it comes </v>

1954
01:27:36.201 --> 01:27:38.570
<v Speaker 3>in waves and it existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty,</v>

1955
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:40.890
<v Speaker 3>pretty strong in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1956
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:41.803
<v Speaker 3>political correctness was washing over </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the eighties and destroy rap </v>

1957
01:27:45.321 --> 01:27:48.260
<v Speaker 3>and shit coming back and it'll go away </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1958
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:51.590
<v Speaker 3>People get sick of it and it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous and people will rebel against</v>

1959
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:52.663
<v Speaker 3>political correctness in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think overall the culture is </v>

1960
01:27:56.781 --> 01:27:59.210
<v Speaker 3>trying to adjust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is trying to self adjust.</v>

1961
01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.253
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to the the actual culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the as a whole is trying to eliminate </v>

1962
01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:07.700
<v Speaker 3>racism and eliminate sexism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminate bias,</v>

1963
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:10.310
<v Speaker 3>which are good noble goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're good noble goals,</v>

1964
01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:11.503
<v Speaker 3>but along the ways you have these polar </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremes of people that are doing it </v>

1965
01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:16.070
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poor execution,</v>

1966
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:20.510
<v Speaker 3>terrible execution level understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also strange to me,</v>

1967
01:28:20.511 --> 01:28:25.511
<v Speaker 3>it's like what utopia are you trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create by silencing stuff?</v>

1968
01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Because just because you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because you say,</v>

1969
01:28:28.731 --> 01:28:29.564
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't say racist shit doesn't mean </v>

1970
01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:31.873
<v Speaker 3>it goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you can't say sexual shit doesn't </v>

1971
01:28:33.171 --> 01:28:34.004
<v Speaker 3>mean it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more like you're treating the </v>

1972
01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:38.830
<v Speaker 3>symptom and not the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1973
01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.750
<v Speaker 3>But in their defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jogging my very specific platform.</v>

1974
01:28:41.751 --> 01:28:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a stage.</v>

1975
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:45.530
<v Speaker 3>If you had actually said something </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually racist,</v>

1976
01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:46.813
<v Speaker 3>then it would make sense that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want anybody telling racists </v>

1977
01:28:49.410 --> 01:28:50.380
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1978
01:28:50.381 --> 01:28:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they.</v>

1979
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:54.020
<v Speaker 3>But they wanted it to be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:28:54.021 --> 01:28:54.854
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you just fucking take a </v>

1981
01:28:56.391 --> 01:28:57.224
<v Speaker 3>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a second to relax and once I get </v>

1982
01:29:00.321 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what utopia</v>

1983
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:05.100
<v Speaker 2>have you read about that's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>real?</v>

1984
01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Like every book we read in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>College,</v>

1985
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:09.420
<v Speaker 2>brave new world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord of the flies,</v>

1986
01:29:09.421 --> 01:29:13.860
<v Speaker 2>19 eight or animal farm like the giver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in fucking middle school.</v>

1987
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:17.900
<v Speaker 2>That's all a utopia but this fuck that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking killing babies and you know,</v>

1988
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:18.933
<v Speaker 2>goes south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all a fucking false utopia kind of </v>

1989
01:29:21.991 --> 01:29:23.250
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1990
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:25.560
<v Speaker 2>there is hate speech in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1991
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:27.630
<v Speaker 2>You know you don't want it on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform,</v>

1992
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:29.670
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to decide what is hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

1993
01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:32.220
<v Speaker 2>when is it really hate speech and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it just ignorance.</v>

1994
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.353
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes the best way to combat bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech is to let that speech play out </v>

1995
01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:42.180
<v Speaker 2>and let good speech overwhelm it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>logic and reason and a better argument.</v>

1996
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:46.020
<v Speaker 2>That's really what freedom of speech is </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be all about.</v>

1997
01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:47.310
<v Speaker 2>That we work all this out.</v>

1998
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:51.320
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you start censoring voices </v>
<v Speaker 2>and telling people that you're not going</v>

1999
01:29:51.321 --> 01:29:53.670
<v Speaker 2>to allow them to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy you,</v>

2000
01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.690
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start,</v>

2001
01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:55.613
<v Speaker 2>you create this atmosphere where you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>start to choose what you're going to </v>

2002
01:29:59.571 --> 01:30:00.404
<v Speaker 2>allow through and when you're not going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to allow through and then you're going </v>

2003
01:30:01.741 --> 01:30:04.530
<v Speaker 2>to start censoring things that are far </v>
<v Speaker 2>more subtle.</v>

2004
01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.820
<v Speaker 2>You're going to start censoring things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't seem reasonable,</v>

2005
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.910
<v Speaker 2>but you've decided that it's already </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay to sensor,</v>

2006
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:15.480
<v Speaker 2>so you've censored this person nagging </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sensor the next worst thing.</v>

2007
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:16.723
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go down the line until </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just people that disagree with you </v>

2008
01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:19.771
<v Speaker 2>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2009
01:30:19.771 --> 01:30:22.380
<v Speaker 2>well my world is perfect now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when in fact,</v>

2010
01:30:22.381 --> 01:30:25.150
<v Speaker 2>it's actually just a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are talking shit about you.</v>

2011
01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:25.993
<v Speaker 2>You just don't happen to know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with what's going on </v>

2012
01:30:29.161 --> 01:30:31.070
<v Speaker 2>with Patrion with A.</v>

2013
01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:32.053
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of podcast pay for him </v>

2014
01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:36.630
<v Speaker 2>or you can pay for shit with Patriana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2015
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:38.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pay for things,</v>

2016
01:30:38.311 --> 01:30:40.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's not necessarily just for </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

2017
01:30:40.021 --> 01:30:42.510
<v Speaker 2>but people do use it for podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they use it for many things.</v>

2018
01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:46.710
<v Speaker 2>But there's this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name is Carl Benjamin,</v>

2019
01:30:46.711 --> 01:30:49.860
<v Speaker 2>and he goes by the name of Sargon are </v>
<v Speaker 2>our cod,</v>

2020
01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:50.993
<v Speaker 2>and he considers himself a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you call a classic British </v>

2021
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:57.090
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more leans,</v>

2022
01:30:57.091 --> 01:31:00.000
<v Speaker 2>more conservative than our idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>a liberal is,</v>

2023
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.760
<v Speaker 2>but essentially it's more of a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian.</v>

2024
01:31:02.761 --> 01:31:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Toward what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you,</v>

2025
01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:07.020
<v Speaker 2>how would you describe a classic British</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal?</v>

2026
01:31:07.021 --> 01:31:07.854
<v Speaker 2>Like what would be the definitely google</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first of the name would be Carl </v>

2027
01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:12.031
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2028
01:31:12.031 --> 01:31:13.510
<v Speaker 2>that's a strong name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2029
01:31:13.530 --> 01:31:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Sargon of a cod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

2030
01:31:15.571 --> 01:31:16.230
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2031
01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:20.110
<v Speaker 2>his screen name and he has a youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel and uh,</v>

2032
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.400
<v Speaker 2>he said something on a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even his own.</v>

2033
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:30.920
<v Speaker 2>He was a guest on another channel and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said something about white supremacist.</v>

2034
01:31:32.041 --> 01:31:32.874
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about these white </v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacists that are acting up and </v>

2035
01:31:34.801 --> 01:31:37.500
<v Speaker 2>doing all these horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2036
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.920
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a poorly formed thought.</v>

2037
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:46.190
<v Speaker 2>But what he said essentially said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are being niggers almost.</v>

2038
01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:48.900
<v Speaker 2>You act like white niggers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is his word.</v>

2039
01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Jesus said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what he's saying.</v>

2040
01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:54.090
<v Speaker 2>You're acting like a bunch of niggers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know,</v>

2041
01:31:54.091 --> 01:31:54.924
<v Speaker 2>you act like white niggers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if you heard that word and so </v>

2042
01:31:56.791 --> 01:31:58.020
<v Speaker 2>finding you right now ladies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gentlemen,</v>

2043
01:31:58.021 --> 01:31:58.854
<v Speaker 2>I'm just reading a set exactly how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>described black people acting is the </v>

2044
01:32:01.931 --> 01:32:03.910
<v Speaker 2>impression I get dealing with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2045
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:05.253
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not in the mood to deal with </v>

2046
01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:10.640
<v Speaker 2>this kind of disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a very fun,</v>

2047
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:11.733
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very poorly thought out way of </v>

2048
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 2>expressing himself.</v>

2049
01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:17.733
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading this and I think also </v>

2050
01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:21.723
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people like using that word to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shock and they think they can get away </v>

2051
01:32:25.031 --> 01:32:27.580
<v Speaker 2>with it and you know when you're using </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2052
01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:29.230
<v Speaker 2>what's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

2053
01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:32.110
<v Speaker 2>What's the context of this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also said,</v>

2054
01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:32.944
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2055
01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 2>you carry on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't expect me to have a debate</v>

2056
01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:37.960
<v Speaker 2>with one of your faggots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would I bother?</v>

2057
01:32:37.961 --> 01:32:38.794
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that is more egregious because that </v>

2058
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:41.913
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're just dealing with </v>

2059
01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:46.630
<v Speaker 2>censoring words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not.</v>

2060
01:32:46.631 --> 01:32:51.631
<v Speaker 2>He's not using that saying you're acting</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way you call gay people.</v>

2061
01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:55.750
<v Speaker 2>He's not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like calling someone a gay slur.</v>

2062
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:57.820
<v Speaker 2>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again and again,</v>

2063
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.910
<v Speaker 2>so this was just what they had decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>to use.</v>

2064
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't agree with any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2065
01:33:02.831 --> 01:33:04.300
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm reading this.</v>

2066
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:05.133
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2067
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:10.950
<v Speaker 2>these are poorly thought out arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a poorly thought out sentence.</v>

2068
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:12.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2069
01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.100
<v Speaker 2>just stop scrolling there for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put that back up.</v>

2070
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:17.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not well thought out.</v>

2071
01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Good.</v>

2072
01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.193
<v Speaker 2>So they've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this has nothing to do with his </v>

2073
01:33:24.251 --> 01:33:26.590
<v Speaker 2>patrion page isn't even having to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his,</v>

2074
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:28.263
<v Speaker 2>his channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something he made this comment </v>

2075
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:35.350
<v Speaker 2>as a part of a longer wide ranging </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview with a youtuber name Michelle,</v>

2076
01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Katelyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Katelyn,</v>

2077
01:33:38.170 --> 01:33:39.003
<v Speaker 2>and you can watch the full interview on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this says chatting with Sargon of a cod </v>

2078
01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.510
<v Speaker 2>about the liberalist community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2079
01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.550
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2080
01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:53.230
<v Speaker 2>it was free flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many set a bunch of really stupid things</v>

2081
01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.093
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what he was trying to say is that </v>

2082
01:33:57.011 --> 01:33:57.844
<v Speaker 2>these people are behaving exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they do when they try to say racist </v>

2083
01:34:06.341 --> 01:34:07.900
<v Speaker 2>things about black people.</v>

2084
01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Essentially they're behaving exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way they're describing.</v>

2085
01:34:12.441 --> 01:34:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Race in a racist way,</v>

2086
01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:17.253
<v Speaker 2>it's just not well thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like this guy needs a class and </v>

2087
01:34:19.901 --> 01:34:22.210
<v Speaker 2>how to fucking be articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Jesus Christ,</v>

2088
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:24.000
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm getting from this.</v>

2089
01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:25.063
<v Speaker 2>Patrion decided to remove him because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and there's many people that feel </v>

2090
01:34:30.521 --> 01:34:33.910
<v Speaker 2>like that's not exactly why they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were looking for an excuse and</v>

2091
01:34:33.911 --> 01:34:37.840
<v Speaker 2>it's really because his anti liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>bias.</v>

2092
01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:39.033
<v Speaker 2>So they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are disgusted by the </v>

2093
01:34:43.871 --> 01:34:44.704
<v Speaker 2>idea that Patrion is now censoring </v>
<v Speaker 2>voices and the deciding who should or </v>

2094
01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:50.884
<v Speaker 2>should not be able to receive donations </v>
<v Speaker 2>from their fans based on their own </v>

2095
01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:57.250
<v Speaker 2>personal political.</v>

2096
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:59.143
<v Speaker 3>So this is the argument now and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting thing that's popped </v>

2097
01:35:02.361 --> 01:35:06.560
<v Speaker 3>up because people like Sam Harris who is</v>
<v Speaker 3>very left.</v>

2098
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:08.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets accused of being all right,</v>

2099
01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.350
<v Speaker 3>was kind of hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's very progressive and you know,</v>

2100
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:13.243
<v Speaker 3>he's a public intellectual and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided this is a moment where he is </v>

2101
01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:22.841
<v Speaker 3>going to pull his patriotic account down</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he doesn't like the way they are</v>

2102
01:35:23.301 --> 01:35:24.134
<v Speaker 3>choosing to censor people and d platform</v>
<v Speaker 3>people based entirely on something that </v>

2103
01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:31.814
<v Speaker 3>has nothing to do with anything he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>done on their platform and it's </v>

2104
01:35:34.311 --> 01:35:36.730
<v Speaker 3>something to do with something that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there on,</v>

2105
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.900
<v Speaker 3>on another channel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's one of those weird little battle</v>

2106
01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:43.030
<v Speaker 3>ground situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do think like,</v>

2107
01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the patrons a private enterprise,</v>

2108
01:35:46.041 --> 01:35:46.271
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:35:46.271 --> 01:35:49.730
<v Speaker 3>So they can do whatever the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want and essentially they can and did.</v>

2110
01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.053
<v Speaker 3>So then people can decide that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to deal with Patriot because </v>

2111
01:35:53.631 --> 01:35:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Patriot doesn't support free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>free speech.</v>

2112
01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:58.213
<v Speaker 3>The argument would go that free speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not just supporting speech that you </v>

2113
01:36:03.231 --> 01:36:04.064
<v Speaker 3>agree with for true free speech is </v>
<v Speaker 3>letting people express themselves right </v>

2114
01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.440
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he expressed himself,</v>

2115
01:36:09.441 --> 01:36:13.220
<v Speaker 3>they're not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clumsy,</v>

2116
01:36:13.670 --> 01:36:14.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heavier.</v>

2117
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:18.020
<v Speaker 3>That's an understatement though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your thoughts on it this year,</v>

2118
01:36:18.021 --> 01:36:19.970
<v Speaker 3>you've never seen this before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are your thoughts on it?</v>

2119
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.863
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2120
01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:25.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's such a bad choice of words </v>
<v Speaker 3>is such a way to just.</v>

2121
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:28.880
<v Speaker 3>If I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm person reading that,</v>

2122
01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.650
<v Speaker 3>unlike my immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my eye goes,</v>

2123
01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:32.240
<v Speaker 3>you said what you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2124
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:33.074
<v Speaker 3>it's such an offensive word where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't even go there immediately </v>

2125
01:36:35.901 --> 01:36:38.450
<v Speaker 3>distracts from the point that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make.</v>

2126
01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.060
<v Speaker 3>So it's a good way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2127
01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:40.933
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such like a just needed you need </v>

2128
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:45.200
<v Speaker 3>like I don't think that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's racist or not,</v>

2129
01:36:45.230 --> 01:36:48.470
<v Speaker 3>but like I don't think he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your immediate reaction is like this</v>

2130
01:36:48.471 --> 01:36:50.350
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

2131
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.943
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have fundamentally destroyed </v>

2132
01:36:54.681 --> 01:36:57.860
<v Speaker 3>whatever point you were trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of your choice.</v>

2133
01:36:57.890 --> 01:37:00.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be trying to save.</v>

2134
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of the analogy now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like it's,</v>

2135
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:06.580
<v Speaker 3>it's such a distracting choice of words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2136
01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:08.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a great way of putting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2137
01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if he could have said,</v>

2138
01:37:09.981 --> 01:37:12.290
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all conversations,</v>

2139
01:37:12.291 --> 01:37:13.640
<v Speaker 3>including this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2140
01:37:13.641 --> 01:37:15.620
<v Speaker 3>like I'm trying to formulate these </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions on the fly.</v>

2141
01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:16.480
<v Speaker 3>So are you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2142
01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:17.653
<v Speaker 3>that was what he was doing on the fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything he </v>

2143
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:23.920
<v Speaker 3>prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that damn dog,</v>

2144
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:24.833
<v Speaker 3>I mean that wasn't vetted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gone over that with a fucking </v>

2145
01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:31.130
<v Speaker 3>highlighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the key points.</v>

2146
01:37:31.131 --> 01:37:33.320
<v Speaker 3>And once I hit on had been a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>websites.</v>

2147
01:37:33.321 --> 01:37:34.154
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to look up the ones </v>

2148
01:37:34.881 --> 01:37:36.290
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know for instance,</v>

2149
01:37:36.291 --> 01:37:37.190
<v Speaker 3>on twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2150
01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:38.133
<v Speaker 3>in the last year they've changed things </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the terms of service that kind of </v>

2151
01:37:40.641 --> 01:37:42.800
<v Speaker 3>what you do broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2152
01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Affects what you do on anyone to catch </v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that.</v>

2153
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.333
<v Speaker 3>What you just saying right now is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who's the CEO of Patriot actually </v>

2154
01:37:49.101 --> 01:37:51.290
<v Speaker 3>went on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave Rubin's show,</v>

2155
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>the Rubin report and said that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>only concerned with things that</v>

2156
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.310
<v Speaker 2>happen on Patrion is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they focus on.</v>

2157
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Then they changed that after this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because here's the problem,</v>

2158
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:07.463
<v Speaker 2>like I see their point with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this particular thing that this guy </v>

2159
01:38:12.661 --> 01:38:13.494
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see how they find that offensive and </v>

2160
01:38:15.931 --> 01:38:16.764
<v Speaker 2>if that becomes a thing that he does </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than once and becomes a thing that </v>

2161
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:21.624
<v Speaker 2>he uses that all the time and uses that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of that kind of language in that </v>

2162
01:38:26.881 --> 01:38:29.280
<v Speaker 2>context a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2163
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:30.780
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not.</v>

2164
01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.660
<v Speaker 2>It's clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2165
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:38.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not a wise choice of words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sloppy and it's kind of a lazy.</v>

2166
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also it's kind of racist,</v>

2167
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.033
<v Speaker 2>but it's why is it racist was racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what he's doing is attacking </v>

2168
01:38:47.851 --> 01:38:52.440
<v Speaker 2>people who are racists by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he could have done it this way,</v>

2169
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could have said,</v>

2170
01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:54.923
<v Speaker 2>you people rally on about black people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and call them this and you say they're </v>

2171
01:38:58.801 --> 01:38:59.634
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

2172
01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:03.690
<v Speaker 2>This is what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are exactly what you're.</v>

2173
01:39:03.691 --> 01:39:07.710
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's missing is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the right pigment to,</v>

2174
01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:10.230
<v Speaker 2>to receive your own hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own self hate,</v>

2175
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:15.000
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing the very things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you accuse that you in a racist way.</v>

2176
01:39:15.001 --> 01:39:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Cues black people doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid though,</v>

2177
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:22.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's to the way to combat that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't you,</v>

2178
01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:24.533
<v Speaker 2>when you start censoring people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking away their ability to make a </v>

2179
01:39:27.931 --> 01:39:28.764
<v Speaker 2>living by expressing themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think that's the way to go </v>

2180
01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:34.740
<v Speaker 2>because you're just going to receive </v>
<v Speaker 2>backlash and that's,</v>

2181
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:36.600
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those that's,</v>

2182
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:37.783
<v Speaker 3>that's one of those instances where it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you've set a trigger word that is </v>

2183
01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:47.050
<v Speaker 3>clearly a trigger word and and what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just said is the way he should have said</v>

2184
01:39:47.391 --> 01:39:48.500
<v Speaker 3>what he wanted to say.</v>

2185
01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in hindsight,</v>

2186
01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:51.970
<v Speaker 2>if you gave them an opportunity like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've said,</v>

2187
01:39:51.971 --> 01:39:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Hey Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a time machine.</v>

2188
01:39:54.490 --> 01:39:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Go back right before you said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say it again.</v>

2189
01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.110
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

2190
01:39:57.110 --> 01:40:01.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll just say on Patriot on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm reading their stance on it as a</v>

2191
01:40:01.821 --> 01:40:03.500
<v Speaker 3>website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't host anything,</v>

2192
01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.820
<v Speaker 3>so like to say that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's happening.</v>

2193
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:09.920
<v Speaker 3>Do blogs like Jordan Peterson wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 3>blog on Patrion,</v>

2194
01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:11.860
<v Speaker 3>but that's what most of their content </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2195
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:12.763
<v Speaker 3>is links from other websites they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take into account what you're </v>

2196
01:40:16.491 --> 01:40:18.020
<v Speaker 3>creating as a creator</v>

2197
01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:23.030
<v Speaker 2>anywhere almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't even him as a creator though,</v>

2198
01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:25.580
<v Speaker 2>this was him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guest on someone else's show,</v>

2199
01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.550
<v Speaker 2>so this is not something that's his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>content that he</v>

2200
01:40:28.630 --> 01:40:29.463
<v Speaker 3>put out their stances that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>collaborates with other creators and </v>

2201
01:40:31.631 --> 01:40:32.464
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would be considered a </v>

2202
01:40:32.741 --> 01:40:33.574
<v Speaker 3>collaboration.</v>

2203
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a generator.</v>

2204
01:40:35.371 --> 01:40:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I guess I see that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not think that it's a wise thing to</v>

2205
01:40:39.511 --> 01:40:40.620
<v Speaker 2>censor him though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you</v>

2206
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:43.663
<v Speaker 3>get that motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a PR coach dog with Jesus Christ the </v>

2207
01:40:45.771 --> 01:40:47.690
<v Speaker 3>very least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this is the first dance,</v>

2208
01:40:47.691 --> 01:40:51.370
<v Speaker 3>which I think they're saying it is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely a warning or maybe thing.</v>

2209
01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the van.</v>

2210
01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Temporary bandmates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2211
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:58.000
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he does is he's a.</v>

2212
01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:01.420
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a commentator.</v>

2213
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:02.583
<v Speaker 2>He sees life and he talks about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to a lot of his stuff and </v>

2214
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:08.380
<v Speaker 2>it's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart man.</v>

2215
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:10.810
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not very good.</v>

2216
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:12.003
<v Speaker 2>So the right way when it comes to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things is let the people who contribute </v>

2217
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:21.400
<v Speaker 2>to his patron decide that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what he's doing,</v>

2218
01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:23.320
<v Speaker 2>so they're are no longer going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribe.</v>

2219
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:24.303
<v Speaker 2>That's the correct use of the platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The platform exists because people who </v>

2220
01:41:27.251 --> 01:41:31.060
<v Speaker 2>are fans are able to contribute that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say to mash,</v>

2221
01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:32.073
<v Speaker 2>I really liked what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to send you a $100 every </v>

2222
01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if someone wants to do that,</v>

2223
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:37.114
<v Speaker 2>they can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of people that do do </v>

2224
01:41:38.561 --> 01:41:39.394
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say something that makes them </v>

2225
01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:41.913
<v Speaker 2>offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes them realize you're sloppy </v>

2226
01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:46.330
<v Speaker 2>with your words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes him feel like you're a fool.</v>

2227
01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:47.231
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2228
01:41:47.231 --> 01:41:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sending that fucking guy money </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the marketplace talking sense,</v>

2229
01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:51.813
<v Speaker 2>and then they pull back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he lost 30 percent of his market </v>

2230
01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:55.503
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a bunch of blogs are written </v>

2231
01:41:57.341 --> 01:42:00.700
<v Speaker 2>about how stupid what he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the correct response.</v>

2232
01:42:00.730 --> 01:42:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I don't think,</v>

2233
01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.233
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with pulling out is then</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys like Sam Harris or pulling out and </v>

2234
01:42:07.091 --> 01:42:11.740
<v Speaker 2>they've lost somewhere around 20 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all their patriotic counts because of</v>

2235
01:42:11.741 --> 01:42:12.220
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2236
01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:14.860
<v Speaker 2>she does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been a backlash and by the way a</v>

2237
01:42:14.861 --> 01:42:15.694
<v Speaker 2>backlash that's primarily coming from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't agree with what that </v>

2238
01:42:19.181 --> 01:42:20.014
<v Speaker 2>guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do agree that it's a very slippery </v>

2239
01:42:23.021 --> 01:42:23.854
<v Speaker 2>slope to start censoring people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good moral stance to take like </v>

2240
01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:28.373
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like Kinda like I forget which </v>

2241
01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.020
<v Speaker 2>political figures set as I do not agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what you're saying,</v>

2242
01:42:35.050 --> 01:42:39.850
<v Speaker 2>but I will defend fight to the to day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to ability to say yes.</v>

2243
01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:40.713
<v Speaker 2>I think that's important because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only way that ideas get worked out is </v>

2244
01:42:43.451 --> 01:42:46.210
<v Speaker 2>through discussion and as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>silence voices,</v>

2245
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:50.290
<v Speaker 2>then you no longer have that discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now to youtube credit,</v>

2246
01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.540
<v Speaker 2>he still up on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2247
01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Because this was a talk that he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's available on Youtube.</v>

2248
01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:56.703
<v Speaker 2>You can listen to it on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still has his youtube account and </v>

2249
01:42:59.891 --> 01:43:01.450
<v Speaker 2>he's still able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2250
01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:02.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

2251
01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:03.133
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we're seeing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>D platforming is it's sort of a </v>

2252
01:43:05.171 --> 01:43:09.520
<v Speaker 2>cascading effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a dominoes twitter takes you down and</v>

2253
01:43:09.521 --> 01:43:13.270
<v Speaker 2>then facebook takes you down with a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a limbo,</v>

2254
01:43:13.271 --> 01:43:17.530
<v Speaker 2>but some other right wing or that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a said some shit.</v>

2255
01:43:17.531 --> 01:43:20.910
<v Speaker 2>And then Gavin McInnes proud boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got To tick them off of everything.</v>

2256
01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's off everything.</v>

2257
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:22.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:43:22.601 --> 01:43:23.920
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>

2259
01:43:23.921 --> 01:43:26.040
<v Speaker 2>And with him it's even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was he?</v>

2260
01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.700
<v Speaker 2>He's like a hate speech guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't he?</v>

2261
01:43:27.701 --> 01:43:30.040
<v Speaker 2>He's like fucking inciting violence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2262
01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.160
<v Speaker 2>He definitely did incite violence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he wanted these proud boys to fight</v>

2263
01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:39.273
<v Speaker 2>against Antifa and he felt like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Antifa people were thugs and that they </v>

2264
01:43:43.301 --> 01:43:44.134
<v Speaker 2>showed up a conservative events and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened violence and then he wanted </v>

2265
01:43:46.781 --> 01:43:47.614
<v Speaker 2>the proud boys to fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had him on my podcast long </v>

2266
01:43:50.501 --> 01:43:51.334
<v Speaker 2>before any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This shit went down when I didn't even </v>

2267
01:43:52.731 --> 01:43:55.370
<v Speaker 2>know what the fuck the proud boys was </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was asking him.</v>

2268
01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:56.413
<v Speaker 2>I knew him as the co founder of vice and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know knew him as what I would </v>

2269
01:44:01.071 --> 01:44:04.010
<v Speaker 2>basically say is he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was essentially,</v>

2270
01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.080
<v Speaker 2>who's a shit talker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a provocateur.</v>

2271
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:09.283
<v Speaker 2>He was a clever provoca tour and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a funny guy like he came the </v>

2272
01:44:13.061 --> 01:44:15.950
<v Speaker 2>last time he came on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was dressed like Michael Douglas from</v>

2273
01:44:15.951 --> 01:44:16.784
<v Speaker 2>falling down.</v>

2274
01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.390
<v Speaker 2>He had the fucking briefcase and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and the crazy tie and yeah,</v>

2275
01:44:20.391 --> 01:44:22.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did it on purpose.</v>

2276
01:44:22.281 --> 01:44:24.860
<v Speaker 2>He said he's dressing like Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas from falling down.</v>

2277
01:44:24.861 --> 01:44:25.694
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy who would trick people into </v>

2278
01:44:28.731 --> 01:44:32.510
<v Speaker 2>coming in and talking with him on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube channel and they thought that he</v>

2279
01:44:32.511 --> 01:44:35.300
<v Speaker 2>was liberal or progressive and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

2280
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:36.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would basically talked him into a </v>

2281
01:44:37.791 --> 01:44:40.130
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barry Cohen,</v>

2282
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:42.030
<v Speaker 2>shit or leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2283
01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:43.220
<v Speaker 2>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:44:43.221 --> 01:44:46.040
<v Speaker 2>He was doing a lot of that and there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it was very clever.</v>

2285
01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:46.963
<v Speaker 2>I was doing on his youtube channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he got into this whole proud boys </v>

2286
01:44:49.281 --> 01:44:50.114
<v Speaker 2>thing and we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a video you can watch the </v>

2287
01:44:52.161 --> 01:44:52.994
<v Speaker 2>bizarre origins of the proud boys from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast that I did with Anthony Kumina </v>

2288
01:44:57.321 --> 01:45:01.400
<v Speaker 2>from opiod Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he explains how the proud boys.</v>

2289
01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Initially we're just a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a joke.</v>

2290
01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:06.053
<v Speaker 2>It was literally a joke and they did it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make fun of a guy that was one of </v>

2291
01:45:09.701 --> 01:45:10.534
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was one of their interns think so it </v>

2292
01:45:12.101 --> 01:45:12.670
<v Speaker 2>sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2293
01:45:12.670 --> 01:45:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a crazy story,</v>

2294
01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:15.683
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit took a real life of its own </v>

2295
01:45:17.001 --> 01:45:19.920
<v Speaker 2>and now they're fucking junior kkk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2296
01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.000
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2297
01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.073
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all of a sudden it got away from </v>

2298
01:45:24.141 --> 01:45:27.800
<v Speaker 2>him and they became an organization </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you could just join,</v>

2299
01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:31.700
<v Speaker 2>so all these people joined and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>act as a proud boy and they were beating</v>

2300
01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:34.380
<v Speaker 2>people up and all this other crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he doubles down.</v>

2301
01:45:35.210 --> 01:45:37.400
<v Speaker 2>He got out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he quit.</v>

2302
01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:38.293
<v Speaker 2>He denounced his position that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized that his life was falling </v>

2303
01:45:40.611 --> 01:45:42.140
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was being labeled.</v>

2304
01:45:42.141 --> 01:45:43.790
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

2305
01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:46.400
<v Speaker 2>They falsely claimed the FBI labeled </v>
<v Speaker 2>them as a hate crime,</v>

2306
01:45:46.401 --> 01:45:46.890
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't.</v>

2307
01:45:46.890 --> 01:45:47.723
<v Speaker 2>But the southern poverty law center did </v>
<v Speaker 2>label them as a hate crime and several </v>

2308
01:45:50.931 --> 01:45:54.010
<v Speaker 2>other organizations as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the southern poverty law center,</v>

2309
01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.900
<v Speaker 2>they've had some pretty crazy shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've said as well.</v>

2310
01:45:57.490 --> 01:45:58.323
<v Speaker 2>There a serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liberal progressive organization that </v>

2311
01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:04.490
<v Speaker 2>occasionally oversteps the boundaries of</v>
<v Speaker 2>logic and reason they,</v>

2312
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:05.703
<v Speaker 2>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he did was start an organization </v>

2313
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:09.583
<v Speaker 2>and I had a joke about about vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My joke about vegans was the problem </v>

2314
01:46:14.181 --> 01:46:16.010
<v Speaker 2>with vegans is a problem with any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

2315
01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:17.413
<v Speaker 2>If you get a group of 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the odds that one of them is </v>

2316
01:46:20.211 --> 01:46:21.890
<v Speaker 2>going to be a fucking idiot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2317
01:46:21.891 --> 01:46:25.310
<v Speaker 2>that's 100 percent right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're being really charitable,</v>

2318
01:46:25.370 --> 01:46:30.260
<v Speaker 2>one out of 100 is a fucking moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get a group like vegans,</v>

2319
01:46:30.261 --> 01:46:31.094
<v Speaker 2>which is anyone can join and you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 300 million people in this </v>

2320
01:46:36.531 --> 01:46:37.364
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means there's 3 million fucking </v>

2321
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:41.533
<v Speaker 2>idiots.</v>

2322
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.883
<v Speaker 2>That's generous and a lot of them are </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan and the joke was that the problem </v>

2323
01:46:47.091 --> 01:46:47.924
<v Speaker 2>is not the actual people with good </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethics and morals don't want animals to </v>

2324
01:46:51.151 --> 01:46:54.300
<v Speaker 2>suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you let a bunch of people</v>

2325
01:46:54.301 --> 01:46:55.134
<v Speaker 2>with no identity join your gang and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become a part of this plant based </v>

2326
01:46:58.021 --> 01:47:00.060
<v Speaker 2>gang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is same thing with the proud boys.</v>

2327
01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.193
<v Speaker 2>I think some of them probably went into </v>
<v Speaker 2>it thinking it was a goof and they were </v>

2328
01:47:04.381 --> 01:47:07.260
<v Speaker 2>going to go there and they thought these</v>
<v Speaker 2>Antifa assholes,</v>

2329
01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.273
<v Speaker 2>these 90 pound dork swinging bike locks </v>
<v Speaker 2>at people and calling everybody a Nazi </v>

2330
01:47:11.821 --> 01:47:15.290
<v Speaker 2>and fascist and trying to shut down </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single conservative speech.</v>

2331
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:17.070
<v Speaker 2>That was at a neat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any sort of university.</v>

2332
01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:20.290
<v Speaker 2>These people were preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were calling Ben Shapiro and Nazi.</v>

2333
01:47:20.291 --> 01:47:22.980
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking Jewish man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wears a Yarmulke.</v>

2334
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:24.083
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy to call him a Nazi is </v>

2335
01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:26.910
<v Speaker 2>completely insane.</v>

2336
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:31.650
<v Speaker 2>The alt right and the left almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2337
01:47:31.651 --> 01:47:32.484
<v Speaker 2>And so their idea was to have something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be there to balance out the </v>

2338
01:47:37.351 --> 01:47:38.184
<v Speaker 2>alt left and it got out of control and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so he denounced it and he stepped away </v>

2339
01:47:42.481 --> 01:47:43.230
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pulled with,</v>

2340
01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:44.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2341
01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:47.370
<v Speaker 2>he's now what you sped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See you don't know him,</v>

2342
01:47:47.490 --> 01:47:50.820
<v Speaker 2>but you said he's the hate speech guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said he's that guy.</v>

2343
01:47:50.821 --> 01:47:51.390
<v Speaker 2>He's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2344
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:52.223
<v Speaker 2>that's how everybody's going to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you found out your sister was </v>

2345
01:47:55.111 --> 01:47:57.000
<v Speaker 2>dating and people like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating,</v>

2346
01:47:57.001 --> 01:47:59.280
<v Speaker 2>the hate speech guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's who he is.</v>

2347
01:47:59.610 --> 01:48:00.041
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2348
01:48:00.041 --> 01:48:00.151
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2349
01:48:00.151 --> 01:48:00.631
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2350
01:48:00.631 --> 01:48:03.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it got away from him.</v>

2351
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.610
<v Speaker 2>It just became this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't him anymore.</v>

2352
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:08.100
<v Speaker 2>With all these people that joined it </v>
<v Speaker 2>were actual racist.</v>

2353
01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter too late.</v>

2354
01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:12.270
<v Speaker 2>There's no room for that in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out the game.</v>

2355
01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2356
01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:16.780
<v Speaker 2>So any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these other groups have.</v>

2357
01:48:16.810 --> 01:48:17.643
<v Speaker 2>Once he started getting deep platformed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these other groups got pressure to deep </v>

2358
01:48:21.691 --> 01:48:23.610
<v Speaker 2>platform him because they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2359
01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:24.533
<v Speaker 2>you keep the hate speech guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me that hate speech guys </v>

2360
01:48:26.851 --> 01:48:28.380
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

2361
01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:29.191
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2362
01:48:29.191 --> 01:48:32.460
<v Speaker 2>We got to take them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that this domino effect does seem</v>

2363
01:48:32.461 --> 01:48:33.294
<v Speaker 2>to take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with this Sargon of a cod thing </v>

2364
01:48:35.251 --> 01:48:36.084
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to be taking place with </v>

2365
01:48:37.771 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 2>him because people are examining what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

2366
01:48:40.171 --> 01:48:40.681
<v Speaker 2>And they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2367
01:48:40.681 --> 01:48:45.570
<v Speaker 2>this is a sloppy use of these words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not wise what he did,</v>

2368
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:46.613
<v Speaker 2>but I do not think he's a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think he was promoting </v>

2369
01:48:49.441 --> 01:48:53.400
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he was doing was he was using words</v>

2370
01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.350
<v Speaker 2>poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awfully.</v>

2371
01:48:55.410 --> 01:48:56.850
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what he's guilty of.</v>

2372
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the but that's the,</v>

2373
01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good sign.</v>

2374
01:49:00.991 --> 01:49:04.440
<v Speaker 2>He's not being deep platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if like if people are taking a beat</v>

2375
01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:09.500
<v Speaker 2>to realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I don't hate gays and blacks.</v>

2376
01:49:09.850 --> 01:49:11.610
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the point that the whole,</v>

2377
01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:12.473
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing has been a lesson in </v>
<v Speaker 2>patience and that's good to hear that </v>

2378
01:49:14.341 --> 01:49:18.600
<v Speaker 2>like this guy is being afforded some </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients about,</v>

2379
01:49:18.601 --> 01:49:22.650
<v Speaker 2>but in their defense he's already been </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked off twitter.</v>

2380
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:26.040
<v Speaker 2>He'd been kicked off of twitter before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what for though.</v>

2381
01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what he got kicked off </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter for?</v>

2382
01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:32.850
<v Speaker 2>He got kicked off at twitter previously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he already had that scarlet mark,</v>

2383
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was already.</v>

2384
01:49:34.410 --> 01:49:37.620
<v Speaker 2>People are already looking at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's been inarticulate on twitter</v>

2385
01:49:37.621 --> 01:49:40.840
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No way get it on.</v>

2386
01:49:41.570 --> 01:49:42.403

<v Speaker 2>He had determined that he had harassed </v>

2387
01:49:45.601 --> 01:49:46.710
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

2388
01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:48.010

2389
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.650

<v Speaker 3>Is it a new account?</v>

2390
01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:53.860

<v Speaker 3>13,000.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He must have.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's too fast.</v>

2400
01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.171
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2401
01:50:16.171 --> 01:50:17.260
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dude.</v>

2402
01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:18.094
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was at the shows like a story </v>

2403
01:50:20.681 --> 01:50:24.940
<v Speaker 3>would be hot Monday morning and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday morning I was like,</v>

2404
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:27.070
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one gives a shit.</v>

2405
01:50:27.071 --> 01:50:27.904
<v Speaker 3>Dog gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the more interesting </v>

2406
01:50:29.921 --> 01:50:31.910
<v Speaker 3>things about this whole trump story with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2407
01:50:31.930 --> 01:50:32.763
<v Speaker 3>especially the Mueller probe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there's been so many of those </v>

2408
01:50:36.161 --> 01:50:36.994
<v Speaker 3>quick stories that have just piled up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you remember that family where the </v>

2409
01:50:41.141 --> 01:50:46.141
<v Speaker 3>son died in Iraq and he didn't mean to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut you off.</v>

2410
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:50.080
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd said something.</v>

2411
01:50:50.081 --> 01:50:55.081
<v Speaker 3>He had marked somehow another mock the </v>
<v Speaker 3>family and people like this guy and it'd</v>

2412
01:50:56.730 --> 01:50:59.380
<v Speaker 3>be in a lot of people thought that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be the end of him and it's just</v>

2413
01:50:59.381 --> 01:51:02.740
<v Speaker 3>like these things sort of pile of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pakistani American.</v>

2414
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2415
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's been so many of those </v>

2416
01:51:06.821 --> 01:51:09.600
<v Speaker 3>stories that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But accumulative,</v>

2417
01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:10.853
<v Speaker 3>they are starting to pile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just little much is little drops </v>

2418
01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:17.050
<v Speaker 3>that are coming in the lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can.</v>

2419
01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:18.203
<v Speaker 3>He's been able to sort of roll with </v>
<v Speaker 3>those punches and just sort of slide </v>

2420
01:51:21.581 --> 01:51:24.190
<v Speaker 3>them off kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this Mueller thing,</v>

2421
01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:25.053
<v Speaker 3>what I really like about the Mula thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's been a real slow build and </v>

2422
01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:34.180
<v Speaker 3>you get little hints of what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's been like the,</v>

2423
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:35.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're talking about this at the </v>

2424
01:51:35.441 --> 01:51:36.310
<v Speaker 3>show while I was there.</v>

2425
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:40.720
<v Speaker 3>It was just like FBI don't fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They build a case.</v>

2426
01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:41.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take their fucking time and they </v>

2427
01:51:43.361 --> 01:51:46.240
<v Speaker 3>got all the time and money in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>to build.</v>

2428
01:51:46.450 --> 01:51:48.910
<v Speaker 3>And when they come they don't come like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2429
01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.650
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come a heavy the,</v>

2430
01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:52.933
<v Speaker 3>the knocking on doors that come in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred deep and that's what it's going </v>

2431
01:51:55.801 --> 01:51:56.860
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero to six.</v>

2432
01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 3>A 100 like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2433
01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.193
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's going to be interesting to </v>

2434
01:52:00.161 --> 01:52:01.930
<v Speaker 3>see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially Mueller.</v>

2435
01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:06.280
<v Speaker 3>You look at that guy is I calculated </v>
<v Speaker 3>assassin that isn't.</v>

2436
01:52:06.281 --> 01:52:09.370
<v Speaker 3>He is taking his fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be killing trump.</v>

2437
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:12.310
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't take shit and that the beauty</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it Mueller,</v>

2438
01:52:12.311 --> 01:52:13.660
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2439
01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:16.260
<v Speaker 3>he's an independent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2440
01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:18.130
<v Speaker 3>He don't take shit from nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2441
01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:22.120
<v Speaker 3>the crazy thing was that trump was </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally considering firing him.</v>

2442
01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But everyone's like,</v>

2443
01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:25.470
<v Speaker 3>someone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2444
01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:27.160
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot do that.</v>

2445
01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:31.180
<v Speaker 3>That's why you can not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That he fired comey.</v>

2446
01:52:31.210 --> 01:52:32.770
<v Speaker 3>That's when I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2447
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:34.203
<v Speaker 3>like this guy could just do that and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>could just fire the head of the FBI </v>

2448
01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:39.460
<v Speaker 3>testing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just going to do this.</v>

2449
01:52:39.730 --> 01:52:40.563
<v Speaker 3>Can I get rid of the Attorney General?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I think was supposed to be on my </v>

2450
01:52:43.691 --> 01:52:46.100

<v Speaker 1>as a man of high ethical standards when </v>
