00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Speaker 1>So I might not recognize it,</v>

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's just,</v>

4
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know why speculated fucking wasted all your time.</v>

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan says,</v>

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>keep on questioning everything.</v>

7
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop on that show.</v>

8
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:20.214
<v Speaker 1>The question</v>

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.771
<v Speaker 1>with the one with,</v>

10
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

11
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.023
<v Speaker 1>with chem trails,</v>

12
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.471
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either way,</v>

13
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fucking up there.</v>

14
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>But there is a difference between the ones that that do dissipate.</v>

15
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:29.551
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

16
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>You know right away and the ones that stick around.</v>

17
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Well again,</v>

18
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I say absolutely not a scientist nor in anything that I will say on any,</v>

19
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>whether it's about fucking air travel or space exploration,</v>

20
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>anything that I'll say on anything,</v>

21
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>the caveat that it must be stated is I don't know what the fuck I'm talking</v>

22
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

23
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>I have no education,</v>

24
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>these subjects and I'm merely reiterating things that I've heard people say</v>

25
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>online that's like,</v>

26
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>if you were to say that everyone would think so though.</v>

27
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

28
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>You sound confident about the problem.</v>

29
00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Problem.</v>

30
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.383
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

31
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.223
<v Speaker 1>I sound like an idiot.</v>

32
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

34
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>especially if I'm wrong and I'm super confident that that's how called get</v>

35
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:06.204
<v Speaker 1>started again.</v>

36
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.941
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

37
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.411
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>people are confident people want to listen to them,</v>

40
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>but I'm super honest about what I know and I don't know.</v>

41
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking as honest as as humanly possible,</v>

42
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>even if it makes it look like an asshole.</v>

43
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>But in that situation,</v>

44
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I do know for a fact that when,</v>

45
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>when Khan trails or more likely there's a map on a NASA website,</v>

46
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>you can go to the NASA website and they'll show you where controls will linger</v>

47
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>in the sky and where they won't.</v>

48
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.931
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

49
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>in 1942,</v>

50
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>the government was doing a research project on what they called persistent</v>

51
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>condensation trails.</v>

52
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And what they discovered is during various atmosphere conditions,</v>

53
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>whether there's a lot of moisture in the atmosphere or less moisture,</v>

54
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>depending on what the conditions are,</v>

55
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>it will change the length of the contracts that appear behind jets.</v>

56
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And when you burn jet fuel,</v>

57
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>it creates moisture.</v>

58
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>And when you create moisture out of that burning jet fuel and it changes the</v>

59
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>temperature of the air as it passes through like that,</v>

60
00:01:58.501 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>you literally create a cloud.</v>

61
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>And so when people are looking at that and they're thinking,</v>

62
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.341
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

63
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>the government spraying us with fake clouds,</v>

64
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to think that it's very easy.</v>

65
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:12.201
<v Speaker 1>And this does not mean that they haven't done tests and really unethical things</v>

66
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>with spraying aerosols from planes.</v>

67
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.471
<v Speaker 1>We know they have,</v>

68
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>we know that pesticides are sprayed from planes.</v>

69
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

70
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>so we've,</v>

71
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.531
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

72
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>we're familiar.</v>

73
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>We have that archetype in our head of spraying poison.</v>

74
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>We've seen the footage from Vietnam when they sprayed agent orange to defoliate</v>

75
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>vast parts in jungles.</v>

76
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>We've seen all that shit.</v>

77
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>So we're wary of things that are sprayed from planes and you should be,</v>

78
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>but you should also know that there is a huge difference between that and what</v>

79
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing in the sky in a regular basis.</v>

80
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And when you start saying that,</v>

81
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>what you're seeing this guy on a regular basis is the government's spraying</v>

82
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.683
<v Speaker 1>chemicals.</v>

83
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>You really throw a monkey wrench into the whole idea of them actually spraying</v>

84
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>chemicals.</v>

85
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Because first of all,</v>

86
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:51.971
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

87
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

88
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>the argument is they're spraying of aluminum and Barium.</v>

89
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

90
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a scientist.</v>

91
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:56.874
<v Speaker 1>I'm half retarded.</v>

92
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.283
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

93
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>it took a lot shots to the head as a youngster.</v>

94
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is if they did spray aluminum and Barium and the sky wouldn't</v>

95
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>linger like a cloud,</v>

96
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a lingering like a cloud because it's a cloud.</v>

97
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>And I know a lot of people have invested a long amount of their life wanting to</v>

98
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>think that what they're seeing is chemicals.</v>

99
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>And so it fucks with you because it's hard to admit you're wrong.</v>

100
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to change gears.</v>

101
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>We all know that.</v>

102
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

103
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>But in this situation,</v>

104
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>we have to look at it.</v>

105
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>There might be times when someone's spraying something from the sky,</v>

106
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>but the majority of what you're seeing is just a byproduct of a jet engine going</v>

107
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>through condensation.</v>

108
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the reality.</v>

109
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.751
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

110
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:37.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:38.840
<v Speaker 1>are they geoengineering?</v>

112
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

113
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:40.264
<v Speaker 1>but yes.</v>

114
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So here's the reality.</v>

115
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>The reality is,</v>

116
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>even though it's just an accidental byproduct of jet travel,</v>

117
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 1>it does change the environment and it is geoengineering.</v>

118
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.010
<v Speaker 1>But it's not on purpose,</v>

119
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>not on purpose.</v>

120
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just a part of flying.</v>

121
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.023
<v Speaker 1>If we're going to have,</v>

122
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>there's 93,000 fucking flights a day worldwide a day.</v>

123
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>So they're burning jet fuel in the sky above your head.</v>

124
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:07.801
<v Speaker 1>They're taking toxic fuel in fucking hundred gallon wings full of this shit.</v>

125
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Your wings are filled up with fucking fuel and they're burning that shit up in</v>

126
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the sky and creating clouds.</v>

127
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.011
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

128
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>It changes the environment,</v>

129
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like pollution changes the environment.</v>

130
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 1>In La when you're driving on the highway,</v>

131
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not the government's spraying pollution.</v>

132
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

133
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking pollution.</v>

134
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just a byproduct of human civilization and a byproduct of air travel is a,</v>

135
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>they're burning jet fuel in the sky and be,</v>

136
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>it creates persistent condensation trails under certain atmospheric conditions.</v>

137
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>This is the best that I could discern after research and talking to real</v>

138
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>experts,</v>

139
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>but this does it and this is where he'll go.</v>

140
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking douche information urgent Joe brokers working for the</v>

141
00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:46.200
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

142
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>You've got to stop and look at this shit rationally if you're wrong about the</v>

143
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>majority of what you see in the sky,</v>

144
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>you discredit the possibility,</v>

145
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>the very real possibility that things have been done.</v>

146
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a study about Saint Louis,</v>

147
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.121
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Saint Louis.</v>

148
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:01.361
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

149
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

150
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.471
<v Speaker 1>let me pull this up.</v>

151
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.304
<v Speaker 1>St Louis,</v>

152
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>there was a something that was in the news really recently that they discovered</v>

153
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>radiation.</v>

154
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I think chem trails or just an excuse for pansies.</v>

155
00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm just that like to look at clouds and they went something like,</v>

156
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.131
<v Speaker 1>like a reason.</v>

157
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:14.964
<v Speaker 1>It was a beautiful,</v>

158
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious how,</v>

159
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:16.691
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

160
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:16.991
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

161
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>why some stick around and why some don't.</v>

162
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.601
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

163
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>so they're here.</v>

164
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Well this is because of atmospheric conditions.</v>

165
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between,</v>

166
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it rains and sometimes it doesn't.</v>

167
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's clouds,</v>

168
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:26.810
<v Speaker 1>sometimes there's nothing.</v>

169
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.410
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

170
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>the conditions apparently when it's right before a crowd,</v>

171
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>like it's Kinda hazy.</v>

172
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Those are the conditions that are best for creating these persistent</v>

173
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>condensation trails and people have to understand these are fucking southwest</v>

174
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>airlines flights you're looking at.</v>

175
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we put these either these are,</v>

176
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:41.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>unmarked government planes.</v>

178
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.481
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

179
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you really know that?</v>

180
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.951
<v Speaker 1>What kind of fucking,</v>

181
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Eric,</v>

182
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>what kind of telescoped you have?</v>

183
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>How much research have you actually done or are you like me?</v>

184
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you just reiterate you that you learn online will doing this show and doing</v>

185
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>the show on chem trails?</v>

186
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>More people got fucking mad at me because of Cantrell's trails.</v>

187
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.274
<v Speaker 1>Then anything,</v>

188
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>and I take part of the blame for that.</v>

189
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why is because I think they did a shitty job of editing it</v>

190
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 1>and this is no disrespect,</v>

191
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>but the way that people edit that show,</v>

192
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>they have eight hours of footage.</v>

193
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>They have to slam down to 44 minutes.</v>

194
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 1>To them it wasn't important to totally completely explain what what causes the</v>

195
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>chem trail.</v>

196
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have 100% say or a contrail rather.</v>

197
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have 100% say as to how the show got edited.</v>

198
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>I had say after the fact,</v>

199
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>I would voice my opinion.</v>

200
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>He would get overruled or they would listen to me.</v>

201
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:27.231
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

202
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

203
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>it varied and in this I lost and in this I think we created a bad product.</v>

204
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it represented fully the the correct full explanation of what</v>

205
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>contracts are.</v>

206
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I think because it's such a complex issue,</v>

207
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I think we owed a very complex and scientific explanation.</v>

208
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is people think that Shit's boring.</v>

209
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Like what I just said right now,</v>

210
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>the majority of people listening that would watch American idol,</v>

211
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.230
<v Speaker 1>but go pull,</v>

212
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you [inaudible] podcast is not for everybody.</v>

213
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 1>You know and this conversation is not for everybody,</v>

214
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to make a TV show,</v>

215
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>it kind of has to be for everybody for the networks accepted until it becomes</v>

216
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 1>really successful or find its niche.</v>

217
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 1>And then people,</v>

218
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.920
<v Speaker 1>you know like South Park,</v>

219
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>they can do whatever the fuck they want.</v>

220
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

221
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>cause it's a proven product.</v>

222
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>If you had another show,</v>

223
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 1>we tried to make a cartoon where a gay Guy Stuffing Paris Hilton up his ass and</v>

224
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 1>winning a sloughed off,</v>

225
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>they would go that's the fuck are you talking about?</v>

226
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 1>No you can't do that.</v>

227
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:22.480
<v Speaker 1>But South Park is so successful and is so proven in the market that they do the</v>

228
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 1>well when you show is not proven,</v>

229
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you really can't.</v>

230
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to like have your say as to how things get done.</v>

231
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a complex dance and I don't think we pulled it off,</v>

232
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.441
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

233
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the thing of creating something,</v>

234
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 1>like when you try to create a show,</v>

235
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I feel personally responsible for it though because a lot of people got angry</v>

236
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of that anger could have been avoided.</v>

237
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.470
<v Speaker 1>When I first started looking at chem trails,</v>

238
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.161
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

239
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:43.994
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

240
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 1>I too believe that it was a possibility.</v>

241
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Like is it possible to just point us off right in front of our face?</v>

242
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>They just spraying the sky.</v>

243
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.390
<v Speaker 1>But then the more you look into it,</v>

244
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.551
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

245
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:52.701
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

246
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>there's photos from 1980 that show these contrail like long ones that lingered</v>

247
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>in the sky.</v>

248
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

249
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.911
<v Speaker 1>when we were younger,</v>

250
00:07:58.911 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 1>they didn't linger.</v>

251
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Actually they did.</v>

252
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.671
<v Speaker 1>You just don't remember.</v>

253
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:02.211
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention.</v>

254
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 1>How much the fuck do you pay attention to clouds and created by jets when you're</v>

255
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.770
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

256
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:06.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

257
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.270
<v Speaker 1>can you really tell me exactly what the fuck do you saw?</v>

258
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I barely remember shit I did last week.</v>

259
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

260
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm being honest.</v>

261
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>I barely remember important shit.</v>

262
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I did like shows that I did that were great.</v>

263
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I got a standing ovation.</v>

264
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I barely remember them.</v>

265
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>You tell me you remember this,</v>

266
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:19.611
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

267
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:19.851
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

268
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

269
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 1>these contrails from when you were eight years old.</v>

270
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I remember the foot.</v>

271
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Highly doubt.</v>

272
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking remember that shit dude.</v>

273
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:25.874
<v Speaker 1>I learned stuff.</v>

274
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I learned some stuff from Duane bank.com today,</v>

275
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:29.324
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

276
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.261
<v Speaker 1>forget it either.</v>

277
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:31.094
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

278
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>These people that I'm talking to,</v>

279
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:35.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem with doing this show and this is why I don't know if I'm going</v>

280
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>to continue doing it.</v>

281
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

282
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.071
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

283
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Scifi hasn't asked me to do it again,</v>

284
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:39.231
<v Speaker 1>but even if they do,</v>

285
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I have to really think about how it's,</v>

286
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm doing what I want to do.</v>

287
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's coming out the way I want it to come out.</v>

288
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:45.951
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

289
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

290
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 1>there's part of it that is like,</v>

291
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:49.220
<v Speaker 1>there was an episode we did on transhumanism.</v>

292
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>It's all complicated,</v>

293
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.130
<v Speaker 1>the science of extending human life.</v>

294
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 1>And I love that because I got to talk to all these super intelligent people and</v>

295
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>pick their brain and ask really important to me questions.</v>

296
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.773
<v Speaker 1>I'd love that,</v>

297
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>but talking to people that are telling me they're seeing bulletproof wolves and</v>

298
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>go see shit that pops out of the grids are little wormhole and out came a</v>

299
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof wolf.</v>

300
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.141
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

301
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>that sure happened.</v>

302
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you didn't have a camera and you,</v>

303
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>

304
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.240
<v Speaker 1>while you're out there hunting for bulletproof walls,</v>

305
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:16.981
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

306
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I got tired of it.</v>

307
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I got tired of talking to people that are just crazy people or silly people or</v>

308
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>people that need a fucking hug.</v>

309
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that out.</v>

310
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.111
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

311
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent and there's also a lot of people that really believe what they</v>

312
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>are saying and it's not because they're assholes,</v>

313
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>it's because they lack critical thinking skills,</v>

314
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 1>whether no one's taught it to them,</v>

315
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>whether they've ignored them,</v>

316
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the way they were raised,</v>

317
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the environment they grew up in,</v>

318
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>whether it was the ideas they were exposed to as a young person.</v>

319
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what has caused the situation that we're talking about,</v>

320
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people out there that are thinking in a very piss poor way</v>

321
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 1>and I've been one of them in the past.</v>

322
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

323
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

324
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I've believed in a lot of stupid shit in the past,</v>

325
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.493
<v Speaker 1>you know that I,</v>

326
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I was convinced probably was real.</v>

327
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing I was talking about this a thing called rods.</v>

328
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:00.451
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

329
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:00.780
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

330
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>this fucking,</v>

331
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.280
<v Speaker 1>they look like jellyfish that fly through the air faster than you can see.</v>

332
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole video on them.</v>

333
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:05.551
<v Speaker 1>Roswell,</v>

334
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:06.384
<v Speaker 1>bronze.</v>

335
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Then I watched a show called monster quest when they showed what they really</v>

336
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>

337
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just a video auto fact.</v>

338
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Like when you have a camera and it's going on slow motion and something flies</v>

339
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 1>past in front of it,</v>

340
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 1>stretches the image out and make,</v>

341
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a blur.</v>

342
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.413
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking blur.</v>

343
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.780
<v Speaker 1>So I was convinced that these things were flying through the air all around us</v>

344
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:24.340
<v Speaker 1>cause I'd seen this video and I was like looking for him.</v>

345
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>The guy who made this video does not want to admit that they don't,</v>

346
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.773
<v Speaker 1>they don't exist.</v>

347
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.621
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

348
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 1>he actually showed up at the UFC expo when I was doing a Q and a and he asks,</v>

349
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 1>he got in line and said he needed to talk to me about Roswell rods and he's</v>

350
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 1>coming on my podcast because they are real and a though those people on monster</v>

351
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>quest fucked him and they add,</v>

352
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they could have fucked them because they basically showed the</v>

353
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 1>same scene.</v>

354
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.690
<v Speaker 1>There was a of a campfire or a light and a bunch of bugs were flying in front of</v>

355
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 1>light and they set two cameras in front of it.</v>

356
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 1>One of them was an HD super fast camera to they use for like super slow mo and</v>

357
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 1>the other one was like a regular video camera.</v>

358
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Well the regular video cameras showed these rods.</v>

359
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 1>They are flying a crop because it's an artifact.</v>

360
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at how it's flying across the video,</v>

361
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not flying that fast.</v>

362
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:10.524
<v Speaker 1>Like I can see it.</v>

363
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.480
<v Speaker 1>So how can I not see it with my eyes,</v>

364
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 1>but I could see it on camera.</v>

365
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one just showed it's just bugs judge.</v>

366
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 1>But did you see the underwater ones and the space?</v>

367
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Real theories without a doubt.</v>

368
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

369
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 1>information to government has been hiding.</v>

370
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

371
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.510
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing right now is called you.</v>

372
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You're making a plea to ridicule rods are just tiny.</v>

373
00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:33.804
<v Speaker 1>Can trails.</v>

374
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

375
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:35.731
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

376
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:35.891
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

377
00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:36.660
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

378
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.340
<v Speaker 1>they might as well do you know,</v>

379
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were real man.</v>

380
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>

381
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

382
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:40.821
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

383
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I saw a video once it showed that there were fucking buildings on the moon,</v>

384
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>like to split this lucky guy had he like had these images.</v>

385
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:48.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

386
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:49.141
<v Speaker 1>even worse than that.</v>

387
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>How about the face of Mars?</v>

388
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 1>How about that motherfucker?</v>

389
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.590
<v Speaker 1>You ever see the face on Mars?</v>

390
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

391
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Well there's images that people will swear to you.</v>

392
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 1>The government is patiently doctor does.</v>

393
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Second more high resolution images.</v>

394
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 1>There was some photos they took for like a long time ago of Mars and as they</v>

395
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:04.144
<v Speaker 1>flew over Mars,</v>

396
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 1>it shows what looks like a five sided pyramid I think,</v>

397
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.350
<v Speaker 1>and a face,</v>

398
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>a face on Mars.</v>

399
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Even my own friend who I loved dearly,</v>

400
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Graham Hancock wrote a dumb ass book about all this shit.</v>

401
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I love this friend dear they dumb ass dumb ass.</v>

402
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 1>But he admits it was a mistake.</v>

403
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:21.843
<v Speaker 1>He admits it,</v>

404
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 1>but shit,</v>

405
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 1>that shit's important,</v>

406
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

407
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 1>It's clearly,</v>

408
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a faith if you look at the shape,</v>

409
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>but it does not appear in nature.</v>

410
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.090
<v Speaker 1>This is either a two eyes pitch.</v>

411
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck you're looking at.</v>

412
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:33.634
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at a spot that you decide that that's like looking at the clouds</v>

414
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 1>and thinking that you see in dragons.</v>

415
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

416
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 1>you also could be seen a fucked up cloud because cloud's aren't perfect</v>

417
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical squares.</v>

418
00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:46.354
<v Speaker 1>You Shit head.</v>

419
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

420
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.570
<v Speaker 1>and you're looking at some things that you barely tell what the fuck you're</v>

421
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:50.200
<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>

422
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Clearly it's the faith on Mars and there's a dude who has these videos where he</v>

423
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:56.030
<v Speaker 1>measures like these arbitrary distances,</v>

424
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 1>like a few measure from the nose to the Left Front Center of that pyramid.</v>

425
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.080
<v Speaker 1>It is the exact same distance as the Spanx to the pyramid of Giza.</v>

426
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.041
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

427
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:08.030
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did you come to that conclusion?</v>

428
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.753
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

429
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.300
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it from the White House and a 44 inch television in the corner</v>

430
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 1>where Clinton used to get his blow jobs from that room,</v>

431
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:20.960
<v Speaker 1>clearly the pyramid has a face on it that looks like numbers on Mars and then,</v>

432
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and people fucking buy the DVD and call each other on the phone and do this some</v>

433
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:25.570
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

434
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.760
<v Speaker 1>You got to see there's a man who's dropping some truth,</v>

435
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 1>some mad truth about the pyramid and the next thing you know you're getting</v>

436
00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 1>fucking email blasts.</v>

437
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:33.101
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this?</v>

438
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:33.821
<v Speaker 1>About The pyramid?</v>

439
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Like you mother fuckers,</v>

440
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not a fucking face on the Mars.</v>

441
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.483
<v Speaker 1>There might be,</v>

442
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's not it.</v>

443
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

444
00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 1>there might be some other shit.</v>

445
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean there's not some Osha.</v>

446
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.231
<v Speaker 1>It matter of fact,</v>

447
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:47.760
<v Speaker 1>the pyramid shapes on Mars are way more interesting than the,</v>

448
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:48.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

449
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.730
<v Speaker 1>the face because the face when they show the high resolution image of the face,</v>

450
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 1>these are been doctored,</v>

451
00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 1>clearly doctored.</v>

452
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.230
<v Speaker 1>These are not high resolution photographs.</v>

453
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:57.041
<v Speaker 1>In fact they are.</v>

454
00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And what less than half of the gigabytes.</v>

455
00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:04.111
<v Speaker 1>And it would be if it was a true 85 gallon pickle fucking picture.</v>

456
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.060
<v Speaker 1>But there are some like symmetrical objects that exist that do look like five,</v>

457
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:12.990
<v Speaker 1>sorry pyramids like you pull up that because that was kind of interesting to see</v>

458
00:14:12.991 --> 00:14:13.240
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

459
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

460
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>But it's also possible that those things exist naturally.</v>

461
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:20.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird shapes that exist naturally.</v>

462
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.011
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a,</v>

463
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:21.611
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

464
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

465
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it's called.</v>

466
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.990
<v Speaker 1>A giant something giant's causeway,</v>

467
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I think in Ireland.</v>

468
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Let me think if that's it.</v>

469
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Let me see if that's it.</v>

470
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.830
<v Speaker 1>But it's this crazy rock formation that's totally natural.</v>

471
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Ireland I our wind,</v>

472
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is.</v>

473
00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I need to get the images here.</v>

474
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:38.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

475
00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:39.560
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

476
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.393
<v Speaker 1>Go there.</v>

477
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:40.961
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

478
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:45.961
<v Speaker 1>go to giants causeway in Ireland and tell me this shit doesn't look like some</v>

479
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 1>mother fuckers were building a building,</v>

480
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.143
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

481
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.051
<v Speaker 1>It's not at all.</v>

482
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:51.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just some weird,</v>

483
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 1>crazy natural formation.</v>

484
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.060
<v Speaker 1>If you saw this on an image of Mars,</v>

485
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>if someone sent you this,</v>

486
00:14:57.081 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 1>clearly these were cobblestones on a a Martian street.</v>

487
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 1>They have cars like Arvs.</v>

488
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 1>They're probably shaped like us.</v>

489
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.643
<v Speaker 1>Go to that.</v>

490
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.191
<v Speaker 1>If you found it,</v>

491
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:07.820
<v Speaker 1>look at these images.</v>

492
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.653
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shit.</v>

493
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

494
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Where is this?</v>

495
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

496
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.033
<v Speaker 1>this is an Ireland.</v>

497
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Tell me if you saw that on Mars,</v>

498
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't start shitting your pants.</v>

499
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

500
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Clearly if we're so sophisticated civilization,</v>

501
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 1>that's just natural shit.</v>

502
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps aliens came down and ruin them.</v>

503
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Took their women.</v>

504
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

505
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:26.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

506
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.890
<v Speaker 1>that Shit looks so wow.</v>

507
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 1>That looks so unnatural.</v>

508
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:29.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

509
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 1>100% it looks like someone made a cool ass cobblestone streets,</v>

510
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a natural formation when these,</v>

511
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck causes a stones to be shaped in these weird patterns,</v>

512
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.703
<v Speaker 1>but look at that.</v>

513
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at that,</v>

514
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 1>you would swear that has to be made by somebody,</v>

515
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:48.403
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

516
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It's totally natural,</v>

517
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:51.501
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

518
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 1>And there's varying stages of it.</v>

519
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:55.340
<v Speaker 1>They can actually see like how it's developed.</v>

520
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:55.881
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

521
00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:56.181
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

522
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:57.014
<v Speaker 1>obviously not,</v>

523
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.243
<v Speaker 1>what are they called?</v>

524
00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.200
<v Speaker 1>What's the geologist?</v>

525
00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Expert?</v>

526
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Someone who understands rocks.</v>

527
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking human being.</v>
