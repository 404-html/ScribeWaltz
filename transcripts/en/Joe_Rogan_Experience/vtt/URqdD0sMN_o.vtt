00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.440
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.910
<v Speaker 1>your initial questioning is how do people kind of lose their collective minds?</v>

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It every once in a while in history and a part of the answer is if you start a</v>

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>kind of vicious circle of denouncing people and then denouncing people who don't</v>

5
00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:18.641
<v Speaker 1>denounce,</v>

6
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>people were denouncing people who call the whistle on a and other people</v>

7
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.370
<v Speaker 1>denouncing people,</v>

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.390
<v Speaker 1>then you can get a kind of circle of terror where no one wants.</v>

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is so afraid of being denounced that they wanted to.</v>

10
00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:36.961
<v Speaker 1>Now first Stalinist Soviet Union is another example at Mao's China,</v>

11
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>and that's somehow some,</v>

12
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways in which dictators could often,</v>

13
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.530
<v Speaker 1>enforce their power by habits turning the citizens against each other.</v>

15
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.280
<v Speaker 1>So everyone's denouncing everyone else out of fear that they'll be an announced</v>

16
00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.114
<v Speaker 1>first</v>

17
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 2>going on right now in North Korea,</v>

18
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

19
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.471
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

20
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:52.431
<v Speaker 2>North Korea,</v>

23
00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 2>they have this thing where they each have to report on each other.</v>

24
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Like when people are together,</v>

25
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 2>they report on each other for different things that they did that were</v>

26
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:02.110
<v Speaker 2>violations of whatever code</v>

27
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>they follow up.</v>

28
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.621
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

29
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 1>And so governments know how to explain it,</v>

30
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't just governments,</v>

31
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 1>it can happen spontaneously too.</v>

32
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird human trait,</v>

33
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

34
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.671
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

35
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a combination of a kind of a human trait and a kind of dynamic when you</v>

36
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>have a kind of a network of people and they all are,</v>

37
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>are kind of trapped and no one can be the first person to escape from this</v>

38
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:26.090
<v Speaker 1>vicious circle because they don't want to be the one who is denounced it,</v>

39
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>imprisoned and tortured or whatever the consequence may be.</v>

40
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>What do you think,</v>

41
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.571
<v Speaker 1>where do you think,</v>

42
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 1>if you think at all about this,</v>

43
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:35.300
<v Speaker 1>where do you think this is all headed?</v>

44
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Like especially in terms of social media and certainly it's hard to tell,</v>

45
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:41.110
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

46
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

47
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned the possibility that there's been such a growing recognition of</v>

48
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:50.081
<v Speaker 1>the problem that we will mount a response that it'll just seem ridiculous of the</v>

49
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>outrage mob once it's recognized that there are outraged mobs and virtual</v>

50
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>signaling fanatics.</v>

51
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

52
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>once we have a label for them,</v>

53
00:01:58.341 --> 00:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>once we know that it's a thing,</v>

54
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.501
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

55
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>it'll seem so ridiculous that people will be less tempted to do it.</v>

56
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

57
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>that's the optimistic outcome.</v>

58
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I never really had followed his political or is his public speaking type life.</v>

59
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.833
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

60
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.711
<v Speaker 2>holy crap,</v>

61
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 2>this guy is pretty dialed in.</v>

62
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the plan it takes over when he might retire,</v>

63
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:19.051
<v Speaker 2>he might,</v>

64
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's 40 so he's just getting his feet under in that world.</v>

65
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 2>And trump dynasty just like they did with the buses.</v>

66
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

67
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Just know all of the Clintons claim.</v>

68
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Once you're in there,</v>

69
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

70
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 2>that's all they want.</v>

71
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:33.204
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that interesting?</v>

72
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.111
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

73
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:34.921
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

74
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I would feel.</v>

75
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean man.</v>

76
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a good guy.</v>

77
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>I wished that don junior was running for president.</v>

78
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

79
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 2>he's don junior is very reasonable.</v>

80
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

81
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:45.744
<v Speaker 2>Totally,</v>

82
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.011
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

83
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:46.571
<v Speaker 2>It's funny if he,</v>

84
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 2>if he says one thing wrong,</v>

85
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 2>one thing,</v>

86
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 2>one slip up of a word,</v>

87
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

88
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 2>everybody does every day.</v>

89
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.783
<v Speaker 2>I do it every day.</v>

90
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

91
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>

92
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

93
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.690
<v Speaker 2>one slip up of the word Corey Knowlton one fuck up like that.</v>

94
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v Speaker 2>And then this,</v>

95
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

96
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.990
<v Speaker 2>you see all this,</v>

97
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 2>this magnified,</v>

98
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.350
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous hate that comes his way and the,</v>

99
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

100
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 2>the attacks against him,</v>

101
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 2>people right now listening to this,</v>

102
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:13.880
<v Speaker 2>probably yelling at them because they're fucking Joseph Ford.</v>

103
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Here's the show.</v>

104
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Here's a dose yet.</v>

105
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

106
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

107
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

108
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.250
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

109
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

110
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.910
<v Speaker 3>it is really hard not to get pissed off.</v>

111
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.370
<v Speaker 3>What's really hard to be unbiased.</v>

112
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.010
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to have perspective.</v>

113
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody does a good job as president.</v>

114
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a single person to do it well.</v>

115
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.720
<v Speaker 3>But really my drug of choice was meth back in that day.</v>

116
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.090
<v Speaker 3>That was what I really liked.</v>

117
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.650
<v Speaker 3>That was actually what I was addicted to at one point and I ended up going to</v>

118
00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 3>jail and that was what got me out of addiction.</v>

119
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize I was addicted until I was in jail.</v>

120
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.510
<v Speaker 3>So what made you realize that when you were in jail?</v>

121
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

122
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.920
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

123
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.920
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't stop thinking about it and just won it and just,</v>

124
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean I didn't get,</v>

125
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.173
<v Speaker 3>have like,</v>

126
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.153
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

127
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.103
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

128
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.380
<v Speaker 3>like cold sweats or anything.</v>

129
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:06.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that happens with purse,</v>

130
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.913
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

131
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was just like,</v>

132
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.100
<v Speaker 3>the couldn't stop thinking about it,</v>

133
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:11.250
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

134
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.581
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

135
00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:11.960
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

136
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 3>like just a lot of that anger was coming out.</v>

137
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:15.361
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>

138
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:15.930
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

139
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.651
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

140
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:17.820
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to fight everybody.</v>

141
00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:18.061
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

142
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:19.200
<v Speaker 3>somebody gave me something,</v>

143
00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:19.621
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

144
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:20.454
<v Speaker 3>And Wow.</v>

145
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

146
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 3>It was just really terrible experience,</v>

147
00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:25.590
<v Speaker 3>but probably only lasted three or four days.</v>

148
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.993
<v Speaker 3>Not even,</v>

149
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.200
<v Speaker 3>maybe not even that.</v>

150
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.040
<v Speaker 3>And then you came out of it.</v>

151
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

152
00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:32.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was just like a able to accept my fate and,</v>

153
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.643
<v Speaker 3>and deal with it.</v>

154
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 3>What does it feel like to be on meth?</v>

155
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.680
<v Speaker 3>You have to take adderall.</v>

156
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.630
<v Speaker 3>I'd never taken an adderall.</v>

157
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.140
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

158
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.973
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

159
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 3>pretty similar to adderall.</v>

160
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

161
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like adderall.</v>

162
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the closest I would say</v>

163
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.170
<v Speaker 3>how many you're high,</v>

164
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have that euphoria more than anything.</v>

165
00:04:55.381 --> 00:04:56.214
<v Speaker 3>Just to,</v>

166
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.593
<v Speaker 3>excuse me.</v>

167
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 3>Just an extreme sense of euphoria.</v>

168
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Just everything is beautiful.</v>

169
00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:03.840
<v Speaker 3>But then men,</v>

170
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.600
<v Speaker 3>soon as you start to lose that a little bit,</v>

171
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 3>you just itch for it.</v>

172
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.590
<v Speaker 3>So bad man.</v>

173
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:11.424
<v Speaker 3>So bad.</v>

174
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.990
<v Speaker 3>Like you just want it again.</v>

175
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.360
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to sleep.</v>

176
00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 3>You like your teeth would be grinding and you're just like,</v>

177
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.503
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

178
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.670
<v Speaker 3>you're just tensing up all your muscles.</v>

179
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

180
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.210
<v Speaker 3>I got to get more of that.</v>

181
00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:24.044
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

182
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Now when you're working out at all back then.</v>

183
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

184
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.820
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

185
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.280
<v Speaker 3>Well I take,</v>

186
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 3>well not working out like I should be.</v>

187
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:31.710
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

188
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:31.821
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

189
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:33.150
<v Speaker 3>I was angry a lot of times,</v>

190
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:36.870
<v Speaker 3>like I'd be at a party that this was a common thing I'd be at like a party or</v>

191
00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:37.591
<v Speaker 3>just doing drugs,</v>

192
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:38.424
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

193
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 3>And I just started getting look at everybody like I don't like none of you.</v>

194
00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:45.240
<v Speaker 3>And I would just walk outside and I would go for a run.</v>

195
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.321
<v Speaker 3>I'd run five,</v>

196
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 3>six miles,</v>

197
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 3>come back and be like,</v>

198
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.240
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

199
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.530
<v Speaker 3>give me another line or whatever.</v>

200
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.543
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

201
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

202
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

203
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.950
<v Speaker 3>you won't run and then come back.</v>

204
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

205
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.020
<v Speaker 3>And then sometimes I would,</v>

206
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.250
<v Speaker 3>I would fight people,</v>

207
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

208
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 3>that was very,</v>

209
00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 3>very</v>

210
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 4>common if you call that working out.</v>

211
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.770
<v Speaker 4>And we did</v>

212
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 4>this particular time in my life.</v>

213
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.064
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

214
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Let me see what we got here.</v>

215
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Billionaire Air Wyatt.</v>

216
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 4>Coke makes shirts about money.</v>

217
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 4>I drank blood this morning.</v>

218
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.601
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>

219
00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 4>It's their shirts are about money.</v>

220
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:17.001
<v Speaker 4>Can you.</v>

221
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 4>Can I see those pictures again?</v>

222
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 4>That looks like pink handcuffs with keys.</v>

223
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 4>How has that about money?</v>

224
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 4>Because that's what I paid for.</v>

225
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 4>Paid.</v>

229
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 4>It's unavailable.</v>

230
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.593
<v Speaker 4>Somebody's got it.</v>

231
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.171

<v Speaker 4>Brand.</v>

303
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:42.310
<v Speaker 4>Accused me of stealing value and in fact,</v>

<v Speaker 4>in the lawsuit as well,</v>

305
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:44.870
<v Speaker 4>which is absolutely not true because this.</v>

306
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 4>Is this used everywhere or is it just the greenland?</v>

307
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:48.910
<v Speaker 4>Greenland.</v>

308

<v Speaker 4>Seaworld everywhere.</v>

315
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 4>when I was,</v>

316
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 4>when I left marine land,</v>

317
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 4>I had the agreement again.</v>

318
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 4>I left fairly amicably considering the situation,</v>

319
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

322
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.450
