00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick.</v>

5
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a big fat book of notes over </v>

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.471
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's something I use like </v>

8
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:24.411
<v Speaker 1>before I'm giving a talk or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that where I like to something </v>

9
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:29.391
<v Speaker 1>about writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handwriting things like helps me </v>

10
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:29.391
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

11
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've shown that I do that before </v>

12
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.721
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at my notebook and you </v>

13
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>think if you ever thought that I like </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually wrote in my notebook,</v>

14
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>you'd think I'm a crazy person because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading the same thing over and over</v>

15
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all work.</v>

16
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>No play makes jack a dull boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like before a set,</v>

17
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>what I do is I just write out the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I wanted to work on and I'll</v>

18
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>write them out over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I'll have 100 page notebook and </v>

19
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 1>it's like 100 pages of like half of it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same stuff over and over again.</v>

20
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm Kinda the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

21
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll write out things like that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>more detail and then like you said,</v>

22
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>all like righteous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a cue,</v>

23
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>like it's different when you're giving a</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

24
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>at least like in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a powerpoint talk you have to slide</v>

25
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>and this slide cues like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes of talk.</v>

26
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:17.141
<v Speaker 1>So you've got like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps you remember what you're going </v>

27
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>that would help for comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

29
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Probably a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have a slide show,</v>

30
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that would actually be a really </v>

31
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.811
<v Speaker 1>good idea for like particular points </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you could show that you weren't </v>

32
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like look this is a real thing.</v>

33
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have like a reference there because </v>

34
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about in my new set where I have</v>

35
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:41.751
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to reassure people that I'm not </v>

36
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:41.751
<v Speaker 1>making this up because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

37
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like one of them was this woman </v>

38
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>who proposed as a high school student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a 25 year old police officers,</v>

39
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>super attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she poses a high school student and </v>

40
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>convinced a young boy to sell her </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and then arrested him.</v>

41
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>So it was just an experiment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

42
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>it was a sting operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

43
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>And he was a regular kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an honor roll kid.</v>

44
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's a felon.</v>

45
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teen falls in love with undercover cop </v>

47
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>and marijuana sting gets arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 1>So this is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to be able to put that up </v>

49
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>and go see because you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could just make stuff up if </v>

50
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to know what comedians do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make stuff.</v>

51
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you made something up like,</v>

52
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:33.351
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a story in the news and just </v>

53
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:33.351
<v Speaker 1>made it up.</v>

54
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:33.351
<v Speaker 1>That sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it.</v>

55
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:33.351
<v Speaker 1>Who cares if it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:35.210
<v Speaker 1>people just come to laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

57
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like comedians usually make up </v>

58
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>personal stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they say it's true and I'm </v>

59
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so outrageous is really true.</v>

60
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because it's just so funny,</v>

61
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of the stories that,</v>

62
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>that some of these comedians tell when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

63
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>how can this be true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said it was true,</v>

64
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they my friend part of comedy?</v>

65
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely tell my friend Dom irrera</v>

66
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>has a really funny joke about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

67
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a true</v>

68
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

69
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:05.581
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about you just make something up </v>

70
00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:05.581
<v Speaker 2>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

71
00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:06.240
<v Speaker 2>like it doesn't have to be true buddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich.</v>

72
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I can't say it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's Kinda like messing with you </v>

73
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.341
<v Speaker 2>because the whole time they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're likely true because that's </v>

74
00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's true.</v>

75
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it depends.</v>

76
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Depends on the person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume everything in your notebook.</v>

77
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

78
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that helps me like said </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

79
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 2>this helps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:33.211
<v Speaker 2>writing it down helps me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also there's the running running </v>

81
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 2>like helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually this was very interesting </v>

82
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 2>because the study just came out not long</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago showing that if you.</v>

83
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.470
<v Speaker 2>So if you run the four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to learn something and you </v>

84
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 2>want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you want to like,</v>

85
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something short term recall,</v>

86
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 2>so you're gonna go up on stage and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

87
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a skid or whatever,</v>

88
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you run right before that,</v>

89
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 2>it improves the short term memory.</v>

90
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 2>So your short term recall if you run </v>
<v Speaker 2>right before,</v>

91
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:02.701
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're quickly read over something and </v>

92
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.491
<v Speaker 2>then you want to remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you are learning something and </v>

93
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:09.061
<v Speaker 2>then you run after you learn it and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the next day you want to remember </v>

94
00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's more of a longer term memory.</v>

95
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.180
<v Speaker 2>It improves that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like whether or not you're </v>

96
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 2>running before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you learn it affects the short </v>

97
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 2>term versus long term memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

98
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 2>How did they work that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bizarre.</v>

99
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

100
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like they were testing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

101
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 2>They just found it out through because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just,</v>

102
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing running before,</v>

103
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 2>after they're probably looking at just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see how it affects short and longterm</v>

104
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 2>memory recall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were surprised to find out this</v>

105
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:34.320
<v Speaker 2>was a study that was done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

106
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember where it was done.</v>

107
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I know I tweeted about it not long ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was like within this last </v>

108
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 2>month that it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

109
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you want to,</v>

110
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 2>if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like while I'm,</v>

111
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning new material throughout the </v>

112
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I go for a run in the evening and </v>

113
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 2>then the next day I'll be able to recall</v>
<v Speaker 2>it better.</v>

114
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Theoretically now I'm subject to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>placebo effects.</v>

115
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

116
00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>

117
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't run normally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did a five k on Monday,</v>

118
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>like I don't run at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a buddy of mine had a five k race in</v>

119
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:11.821
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I flew in for him and my friend </v>

120
00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Cameron Hanes and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran it and it was surprisingly hard.</v>

121
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Just like all the working out I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So only three miles.</v>

122
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like three point one or someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>like her heart is a fucking hard.</v>

123
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

124
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:26.581
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you do any like aerobic between </v>

125
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:30.211
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and I do elliptical machine and </v>

126
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of yoga but doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do yoga three times a </v>

127
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.981
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not always successful at getting </v>

128
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:37.981
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got there last week,</v>

129
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 2>three times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

130
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't run so I figured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all that stuff I do,</v>

131
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have,</v>

132
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

133
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't train at all,</v>

134
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of like on the fly just </v>
<v Speaker 2>did this five k and I saw,</v>

135
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I saw you post something about this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm isn't,</v>

136
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 2>doesn't cameron?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't he like some kind of like crazy </v>

137
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.071
<v Speaker 2>runner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's preparing right now for the </v>

138
00:05:59.071 --> 00:05:59.071
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] which</v>

139
00:05:59.071 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>is 235 or 234 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy like that.</v>

140
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And Jamie's a runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when Jamie shakes his head like that,</v>

141
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really gross.</v>

142
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

143
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a nut.</v>

144
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.970
<v Speaker 1>He did two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh five last year he did the big foot </v>

145
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.970
<v Speaker 1>200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 205 miles.</v>

146
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.381
<v Speaker 1>Plus it has something insane like 55,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet of elevation change over the course</v>

147
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:27.011
<v Speaker 1>of the entire race because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly going up and down and up and </v>

148
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:29.340
<v Speaker 1>down and at some points in the race it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so steep and the terrain,</v>

149
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 1>it's an outdoor race over Mount Saint </v>
<v Speaker 1>Helens.</v>

150
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.180
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes the terrain is so brutal </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the top speed is two miles an hour </v>

151
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.180
<v Speaker 1>or</v>

152
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.390
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be like one of those like </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing super agers like,</v>

153
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.510
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

154
00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Just very mentally sharp when he's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's older.</v>

155
00:06:45.151 --> 00:06:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Either that or he's not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been shot like it's been shown.</v>

156
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of being a super ager,</v>

157
00:06:50.551 --> 00:06:54.720
<v Speaker 3>like being a super ager means your old </v>
<v Speaker 3>but your,</v>

158
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.790
<v Speaker 3>you're physically fit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're mentally sharp and mentally </v>

159
00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.790
<v Speaker 3>sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is,</v>

160
00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.790
<v Speaker 3>is really the key thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

161
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.041
<v Speaker 3>cause we start losing brain mass at like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the age of 20 and by the time if you can</v>

162
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:09.291
<v Speaker 3>actually make it to 100 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose like 20 percent of your brain </v>

163
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:12.261
<v Speaker 3>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they found that one of the keys to </v>

164
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 3>maintaining your brain mass is pushing </v>
<v Speaker 3>past that comfortable zone physically.</v>

165
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.210
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

166
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 3>exercise wise and also mentally just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

167
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.280
<v Speaker 3>obviously like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like learning new things and challenging</v>

168
00:07:26.281 --> 00:07:31.281
<v Speaker 3>yourself so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you're working out you don't do </v>

169
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:31.281
<v Speaker 3>this kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

170
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:33.900
<v Speaker 3>half ass thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to push yourself,</v>

171
00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:38.901
<v Speaker 3>you have to really push yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to be key for becoming a </v>

172
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:39.270
<v Speaker 3>super ager.</v>

173
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.070
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy than it works with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

174
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Why exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean exercise has profound effects on </v>

175
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.661
<v Speaker 3>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean specifically if you're looking </v>

176
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:50.661
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

177
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 3>a robotic aerobic exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a row,</v>

178
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.760
<v Speaker 3>it's hard aerobic exercise as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a five k running three miles.</v>

179
00:07:56.761 --> 00:08:01.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do a lot of training and yet that </v>

180
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:01.800
<v Speaker 3>was still hard for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

181
00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:04.680
<v Speaker 3>because during that type of aerobic </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise is difficult.</v>

182
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies have shown that even just like </v>

183
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.100
<v Speaker 3>20 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise </v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

184
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.040
<v Speaker 3>in healthy young men increase serum </v>
<v Speaker 3>bdnf.</v>

185
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:16.080
<v Speaker 3>So which is brain drive neurotrophic </v>
<v Speaker 3>factor.</v>

186
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 3>This is a growth factor that is involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in growing new brain cells and in </v>

187
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.040
<v Speaker 3>allowing the existing brain cells to </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>

188
00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:24.160
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

189
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.660
<v Speaker 3>talking about combating brain atrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about commenting that the</v>

190
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:31.200
<v Speaker 3>fact that your brain is atrophying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting at the age of 20,</v>

191
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.490
<v Speaker 3>that's the way to do it.</v>

192
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Your brain starts to atrophy at 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At 20 you start to lose brain mass.</v>

193
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

194
00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:39.870
<v Speaker 3>It's really frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

195
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:44.190
<v Speaker 3>you start at the peak at 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so stupid at 20.</v>

196
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm so much smarter than I was when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was 20.</v>

197
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

198
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not necessarily like brain </v>

199
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.470
<v Speaker 3>mass and intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

200
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely a correlate but,</v>

201
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 3>but like when you start losing mass in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hippocampus,</v>

202
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's memory learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

203
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.880
<v Speaker 3>that part of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

204
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 3>but there's just so many studies showing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that exercise roebuck exercise and also,</v>

205
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to be Arabic.</v>

206
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.810
<v Speaker 3>You can do resistance training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sort of stuff also affects the </v>

207
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.810
<v Speaker 3>brain as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for me,</v>

208
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.461
<v Speaker 3>like I've been a runner since high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school and track I guess long a long </v>

209
00:09:19.461 --> 00:09:20.740
<v Speaker 3>time and for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

210
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.810
<v Speaker 3>I've done like a few races,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done a marathon and I don't feel </v>

211
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 3>like marathons are my thing.</v>

212
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt like that was just really </v>
<v Speaker 3>rough,</v>

213
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was.</v>

214
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'll run three miles and I will </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel challenged.</v>

215
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Like if I push myself I can do that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I feel like doing that a couple </v>

216
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times a week is plenty for me.</v>

217
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.990
<v Speaker 3>But when I run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

218
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 3>for me it's my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I entered this like state of,</v>

219
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 3>of like daydreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

220
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:50.090
<v Speaker 3>I get creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

221
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 3>when I'm going on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a three mile run,</v>

222
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start thinking about things,</v>

223
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have an important decision to make </v>

224
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 3>or something that's causing me some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of anxiety,</v>

225
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 3>I go for a run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like I can address that issue</v>

226
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.770
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting is that there </v>

227
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 3>have been studies that have shown that </v>
<v Speaker 3>going for a run,</v>

228
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and specifically aerobic exercise,</v>

229
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 3>it activates the part of your brain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bolt and executive function,</v>

230
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:20.460
<v Speaker 3>which helps you make decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

231
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda like that overarching part of</v>

232
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:24.210
<v Speaker 3>your brain that helps with all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planning,</v>

233
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 3>long term planning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

234
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:26.430
<v Speaker 3>And so I always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>

235
00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:28.610
<v Speaker 3>I feel like if I go for runs and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>bothering me,</v>

236
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Speaker 3>if I'm anxious and I always feel better </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent of the time,</v>

237
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.520
<v Speaker 3>like there's not a single time that I go</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a run and I'm like,</v>

238
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel worse.</v>

239
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.630
<v Speaker 3>Why did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

240
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 3>it's like I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like crap while I'm doing it.</v>

241
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

242
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:42.850
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

243
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

244
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 4>human mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is all just theoretical in </v>

245
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.271
<v Speaker 4>my own theories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the human mind is designed to </v>

246
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:54.271
<v Speaker 4>confront serious things like predators </v>
<v Speaker 4>and dangerous enemies.</v>

247
00:10:55.871 --> 00:11:00.871
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we don't really get much of that in </v>

248
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:02.080
<v Speaker 4>this life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when a person is dealing with stress,</v>

249
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.770
<v Speaker 4>I think the mind is preparing for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that don't exist.</v>

250
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.200
<v Speaker 4>So even if you can work things out </v>
<v Speaker 4>logically,</v>

251
00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:13.120
<v Speaker 4>there's still remains like this residual</v>
<v Speaker 4>effect of all these human reward systems</v>

252
00:11:13.121 --> 00:11:18.121
<v Speaker 4>that are kind of in place when the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>we really did have to have all those </v>

253
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:21.880
<v Speaker 4>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those reactions in place to deal with,</v>

254
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dangerous invaders or you know,</v>

255
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 4>horrible natural conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

256
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:31.180
<v Speaker 4>whatever they would be that we hardly </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever experienced any more.</v>

257
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 4>So like when I work out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I have anything that's bothering me </v>

258
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.651
<v Speaker 4>or troubling me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I get like a distorted </v>

259
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:43.540
<v Speaker 4>perception of the danger of it or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical real.</v>

260
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.800
<v Speaker 4>Like it could be something real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I have an issue at work that I have</v>

261
00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:52.801
<v Speaker 4>to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe I have to make a decision or </v>

262
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:55.321
<v Speaker 4>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm stressed about something and I feel </v>

263
00:11:55.321 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 4>this no matter how much I work it out </v>
<v Speaker 4>logically,</v>

264
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 4>I still feel this physical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like residual issue.</v>

265
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:05.070
<v Speaker 4>And that issue only seems to be resolved</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me because I don't run with hitting </v>

266
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 4>the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like for me it's a punching bag,</v>

267
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 4>which is really hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you,</v>

268
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.780
<v Speaker 4>when you do rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like kickboxing rounds on a bag,</v>

269
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 4>have a timer and I could set it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>three to five minutes.</v>

270
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.250
<v Speaker 4>It'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll allow you to set it all the way </v>

271
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.250
<v Speaker 4>down to one and then it has like </v>
<v Speaker 4>intervals.</v>

272
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 4>So it gives me like 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every 30 seconds of Buzzer go off and it</v>

273
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 4>has two lights.</v>

274
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 4>One light is yellow and one light is </v>
<v Speaker 4>blue.</v>

275
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:33.750
<v Speaker 4>And so the yellow light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of a go at like 60,</v>

276
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 4>70 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the blue light I sprint.</v>

277
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 4>So it's like sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to catch your breast print,</v>

278
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 4>tried to catch your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I do that for seven to eight rounds.</v>

279
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 4>And when I do that I don't give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>about anything after it's over.</v>

280
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>

281
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.610
<v Speaker 4>Like it's amazing what it does because </v>
<v Speaker 4>like my mind still has all the same </v>

282
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 4>data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still understand all,</v>

283
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:58.600
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like work related nonsense.</v>

284
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 4>I still understand all the issues about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and they're all,</v>

285
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:07.261
<v Speaker 4>there's no new information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now the information is coming into </v>

286
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:07.261
<v Speaker 4>my brain and it's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

287
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:11.731
<v Speaker 4>this isn't a foreign invader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These aren't vikings that are coming </v>

288
00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 4>over and have a fucking boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dragon's head at the front of it,</v>

289
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.600
<v Speaker 4>swinging swords.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

290
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:16.000
<v Speaker 4>This is just some nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

291
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:21.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agent issue or manager issue or tax </v>

292
00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.810
<v Speaker 4>issue or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems so physically daunting before</v>

293
00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:27.811
<v Speaker 4>the exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then afterwards when that aspect of </v>

294
00:13:27.811 --> 00:13:28.210
<v Speaker 4>the problem is alleviated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stress,</v>

295
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:33.450
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our bodies are just like confused as to </v>

296
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 4>what these problems actually are.</v>

297
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

298
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 3>I love your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your interpretation because it's exactly</v>

299
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.340
<v Speaker 3>the way that I would like to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>why we need this type of stress.</v>

300
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 3>I actually just like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually think that from an </v>

301
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.491
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary evolutionary perspective </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we were meant to be stressed.</v>

302
00:13:55.511 --> 00:14:00.511
<v Speaker 3>We were meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were meant to be out side either </v>

303
00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:00.760
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tilling the land for food,</v>

304
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to prepare food.</v>

305
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm bombarded by UVB radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is stressful.</v>

306
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.270
<v Speaker 3>We were designed to have stress and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean by designed was we have genetic </v>

307
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 3>switches which are supposed to be turned</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

308
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.500
<v Speaker 3>These genetic switches that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>activated by stress are supposed to be </v>

309
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 3>turned on and just like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in a building novel time now where</v>

310
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.190
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to till the land,</v>

311
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.630
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to hunt for our food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can sit,</v>

312
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.740
<v Speaker 3>we can sit on the couch on her butt all </v>
<v Speaker 3>day and order delivery or go to the </v>

313
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.260
<v Speaker 3>grocery store and we don't have to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>foods with polyphenols.</v>

314
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Flavonoids are things that are also </v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly stressful,</v>

315
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:49.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is kind of that concept before </v>

316
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.010
<v Speaker 3>me says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I like the way you explained it </v>

317
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.571
<v Speaker 3>because I really agree with you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that humans were meant to be stressed </v>

318
00:14:54.571 --> 00:14:56.570
<v Speaker 3>exercise as a form of that stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's different,</v>

319
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 3>various different types of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that stress.</v>

320
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

321
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:02.810
<v Speaker 3>and I think that we were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>switch on those,</v>

322
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.840
<v Speaker 3>those genetic switches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those genes that are helping us deal </v>

323
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:07.840
<v Speaker 3>with stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

324
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said you have a problem and I'm</v>

325
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 3>the same way with my Ronald,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some something that's bothering me.</v>

326
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:19.091
<v Speaker 3>I have to deal with whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in my mind I blow it up and may </v>

327
00:15:19.091 --> 00:15:22.331
<v Speaker 3>not even be that big of a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I go for a run with no new </v>

328
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.310
<v Speaker 3>information with nothing new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

329
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:30.311
<v Speaker 3>like I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's partly because I'm </v>

330
00:15:30.311 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 3>switching on all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

331
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 3>stress response pathways that helped me </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with the stress better.</v>

332
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 3>These antiinflammatory pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just all this really good,</v>

333
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:43.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these good genetic switches that are </v>

334
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:43.630
<v Speaker 3>being</v>

335
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 4>just switched on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when it totally makes sense,</v>

336
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.200
<v Speaker 4>I think this new time that we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't necessarily understand that</v>

337
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.500
<v Speaker 4>the body understands where the stress is</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming from.</v>

338
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:56.501
<v Speaker 4>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body is a physical organism and </v>

339
00:15:56.501 --> 00:15:59.561
<v Speaker 4>nature is an absolutely brutal thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has been for us as well as for all </v>

340
00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:03.401
<v Speaker 4>these other animals forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now for us it's not really that </v>

341
00:16:03.401 --> 00:16:04.820
<v Speaker 4>brutal anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so all these mechanisms are in place</v>

342
00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 4>to protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they don't get served and for me,</v>

343
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.130
<v Speaker 4>martial arts is always been like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best one to deal with.</v>

344
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're weight lifting's good to like a </v>

345
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.310
<v Speaker 4>good kettlebell workout does it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like the big ones for me are Jujitsu</v>

346
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:22.610
<v Speaker 4>and kickboxing because Jujitsu is </v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

347
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:26.780
<v Speaker 4>really hard to do and it's also you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>solving problems.</v>

348
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.330
<v Speaker 4>So I think Jujitsu serves two purposes.</v>

349
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:34.450
<v Speaker 4>It's incredibly grueling as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sparring process of just rolling and</v>

350
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 4>competing with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even in a friendly role.</v>

351
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.990
<v Speaker 4>Like with a guy that I really like and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're laughing and we slap hands every </v>

352
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 4>time someone gets tapped out or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

353
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.740
<v Speaker 4>It's so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your,</v>

354
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body's taxed so hard and your mind </v>

355
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.870
<v Speaker 4>is taxed because you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>countering.</v>

356
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.200
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with setting up moves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with,</v>

357
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.780
<v Speaker 4>you're thinking several steps ahead and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're.</v>

358
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:04.810
<v Speaker 4>You're adjusting those thoughts based on</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever this person that you're </v>

359
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 4>sparring with is doing too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people get really,</v>

360
00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:10.820
<v Speaker 4>really addicted to Jujitsu for all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right reasons.</v>

361
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:16.060
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I've found as</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Jujitsu people like for the most </v>

362
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.021
<v Speaker 4>part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are way more mellow than most people </v>

363
00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:21.440
<v Speaker 4>would expect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like way more chill about stuff like way</v>

364
00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:26.441
<v Speaker 4>less likely to respond to something in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>DM or an imbalanced way because they </v>

365
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.310
<v Speaker 4>whatever your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever these requirements are that </v>

366
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.270
<v Speaker 4>we're addressing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body has all that in Jujitsu,</v>

367
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.330
<v Speaker 4>but without the real real violence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

368
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:43.450
<v Speaker 4>Like the ones trying to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just trying to do this thing to </v>

369
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.231
<v Speaker 4>you and you're trying to do that thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to them and those things mimic actual </v>

370
00:17:47.231 --> 00:17:49.620
<v Speaker 4>combat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual real life and death struggle in a</v>

371
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 4>friendly.</v>

372
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And it also has this camaraderie built </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it too because you've kind of </v>

373
00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.711
<v Speaker 1>understand that you're going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>this incredibly intense thing together </v>

374
00:18:00.711 --> 00:18:04.520
<v Speaker 1>and you also understand that it takes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique person to go through that and get</v>

375
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>past all these psychological hurdles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these physiological hurdles,</v>

376
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.560
<v Speaker 1>and then you also are aware that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person understands like really clearly </v>

377
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.830
<v Speaker 1>the kinship that you all share in having</v>
<v Speaker 1>this experience together.</v>

378
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 3>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really neat.</v>

379
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.660
<v Speaker 3>I kind of relate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

380
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.420
<v Speaker 3>not to the same degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what you're,</v>

381
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.540
<v Speaker 3>what you're describing is on a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>other level.</v>

382
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:32.541
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I experienced something similar when </v>

383
00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:32.541
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm out surfing,</v>

384
00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:33.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

385
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:34.670
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

386
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting the physical exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also like a tackling these fears</v>

387
00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:43.761
<v Speaker 3>of these big waves and getting pulled </v>
<v Speaker 3>under and drowning and getting tangled </v>

388
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 3>with my court,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

389
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:50.630
<v Speaker 3>there's like a million and every time I </v>
<v Speaker 3>do I always have that fear paddling out </v>

390
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.820
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I get out there,</v>

391
00:18:50.821 --> 00:18:54.090
<v Speaker 3>there's a group of surfers and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting out there and there is a sort of</v>

392
00:18:55.170 --> 00:19:00.170
<v Speaker 3>friendship that we develop out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we all love surfing and we've </v>

393
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:00.170
<v Speaker 3>all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know,</v>

394
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 3>we know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

395
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here comes the wave.</v>

396
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.000
<v Speaker 3>We're helping each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

397
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:04.710
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one on the outside paddle out,</v>

398
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.790
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's Kinda like I'm completely like a</v>

399
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.640
<v Speaker 3>different level from what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>describing with Jujitsu,</v>

400
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:14.190
<v Speaker 3>but still I kind of can relate a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

401
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:14.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

402
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it is a different level </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of Jujitsu people surf as </v>

403
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.681
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's like a similar </v>

404
00:19:23.681 --> 00:19:25.571
<v Speaker 1>attraction to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because also you're a monster </v>

405
00:19:25.571 --> 00:19:27.971
<v Speaker 1>dodger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're out there in the monster </v>

406
00:19:27.971 --> 00:19:27.971
<v Speaker 1>soup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

407
00:19:27.971 --> 00:19:28.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

408
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is.</v>

409
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.970
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that I still haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

410
00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:36.971
<v Speaker 3>you'd think that after doing it for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many years that I would get over that </v>

411
00:19:36.971 --> 00:19:36.971
<v Speaker 3>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

412
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.000
<v Speaker 1>So they're so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

413
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you get over that fear?</v>

414
00:19:42.651 --> 00:19:47.651
<v Speaker 1>I'm my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane Dorian is a big wave surfer and </v>

415
00:19:47.651 --> 00:19:49.370
<v Speaker 1>he's been on the podcast before and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big time Paul Hunter too.</v>

416
00:19:49.371 --> 00:19:52.210
<v Speaker 1>And we talk all the time about this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

417
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he describes it is just,</v>

418
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.410
<v Speaker 1>it's so attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

419
00:19:57.411 --> 00:20:02.411
<v Speaker 1>I wanna try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not enough hours in the day </v>

420
00:20:02.411 --> 00:20:02.411
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>

421
00:20:02.411 --> 00:20:02.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

422
00:20:02.411 --> 00:20:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I get too addicted to things and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

423
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.890
<v Speaker 1>And I have a fucking real fear of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharks.</v>

424
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharks are scary,</v>

425
00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.200
<v Speaker 1>scary or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're real.</v>

426
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.950
<v Speaker 1>They're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a legit maniac.</v>

432
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that is what is how.</v>

433
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.010
<v Speaker 1>How high would you say that wave is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott?</v>

434
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.990
<v Speaker 1>To be 50 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

435
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Say It's in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called jaws is the name of the </v>

436
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:35.260
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

437
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that is so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so insane.</v>

438
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Like losing my mind is when I see these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys big wave surfing like this,</v>

439
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.380
<v Speaker 1>my heart starts racing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so anxious.</v>

440
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

441
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 1>it's so insane.</v>

442
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 2>That's more than 50 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

443
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I would say at the very peak of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does look like it's more than a 50 </v>

444
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 2>foot faith now when it comes down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>does it say there on the youtube thing,</v>

445
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.200
<v Speaker 2>what it comes down on you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

446
00:20:59.201 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really like that if it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that.</v>

447
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.480
<v Speaker 2>If you got smushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you fell and that came down on </v>

448
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:06.480
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

449
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:06.880
<v Speaker 2>you're probably fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

450
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

451
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the biggest way I've,</v>

452
00:21:11.091 --> 00:21:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I've ever surfed is like overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

453
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.160
<v Speaker 2>like over time and a half overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so not even double overhead.</v>

454
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.020
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was like,</v>

455
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

456
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:27.270
<v Speaker 2>scary moments where I was just tumbling </v>
<v Speaker 2>during donuts and I couldn't find which </v>

457
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 2>way was up or down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

458
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.340
<v Speaker 2>it's like I've had one time I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>surfing out in this place.</v>

459
00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:36.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm in San Diego called sunset cliffs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a brief break and it's really </v>

460
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:36.340
<v Speaker 2>hard to get out there so you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

461
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:41.370
<v Speaker 2>time you have to like jump out when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the wave breaks and then you </v>

462
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.210
<v Speaker 2>paddle out and there's all these kelp </v>
<v Speaker 2>beds.</v>

463
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.940
<v Speaker 2>And I was surfing there this one time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was back when I was really dumb</v>

464
00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:49.710
<v Speaker 2>and didn't wear a leash because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Alicia is,</v>

465
00:21:49.711 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to dance on my board and they get</v>

466
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:52.950
<v Speaker 2>in my way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I didn't release.</v>

467
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

468
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:00.550
<v Speaker 2>there was a big wave and I was writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I wiped out and I like got caught</v>

470
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:02.540
<v Speaker 2>in the kelp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

471
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.320
<v Speaker 2>And so it was like the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

472
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.480
<v Speaker 2>you have this moment where you panic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really bad,</v>

473
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 2>like panicking when you're like in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

474
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.350
<v Speaker 2>cause panic takes like your energy.</v>

475
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.280
<v Speaker 2>And I panicked and I was because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it was going to die.</v>

476
00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:19.670
<v Speaker 2>I was going to suffocate kelp bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I remember having nightmares,</v>

477
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I've had nightmares about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that stuck with me.</v>

478
00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one of those moments that,</v>

479
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of traumatizing in a way.</v>

480
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.200
<v Speaker 2>How long did it take to get out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelp?</v>

481
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember because it was just,</v>

482
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:35.530
<v Speaker 2>I think the panic sort of just lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>track.</v>

483
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.560
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like forever to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know how long it actually </v>

484
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.821
<v Speaker 2>took and of course I lost my board and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>like swimming and I got cut up on the </v>

485
00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:46.980
<v Speaker 2>reef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

486
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.850
<v Speaker 2>reefs are brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brutal.</v>

487
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually stick to a beach breaks now,</v>

488
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

489
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:55.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't even get to surf that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore because I just don't have.</v>

490
00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.550
<v Speaker 2>So people that when they surf breaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are over those reefs.</v>

491
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Like you just can't wipe out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wipe out,</v>

492
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:05.230
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go right into all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jag and shit.</v>

493
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on where the reef is.</v>

494
00:23:07.331 --> 00:23:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was riding the wave in kind of in</v>

495
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:12.670
<v Speaker 2>more so I was closer to where the wreath</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

496
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.220
<v Speaker 2>But yes you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

497
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.020
<v Speaker 2>it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're beginners should not ever go out</v>

498
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:19.330
<v Speaker 2>on a reef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen many beginners out there,</v>

499
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

500
00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:24.280
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely more dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel the scratches and cuts.</v>

501
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty,</v>

502
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.730
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty brutal.</v>

503
00:23:27.731 --> 00:23:29.680
<v Speaker 2>But any shark encounters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

504
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually.</v>

505
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say that's not,</v>

506
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.040
<v Speaker 2>that's not actually accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any scary shark encounters.</v>

507
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I served for a long time in La Jolla and</v>

508
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:45.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a breeding ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore I'm leopard sharks,</v>

509
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>which are not</v>

510
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 3>to be confused with tiger sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tiger sharks are definitely scary.</v>

511
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Leopard sharks are the ones that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the spots on them and they're really </v>

512
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.970
<v Speaker 3>harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're kinda like nurse sharks.</v>

513
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

514
00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.960
<v Speaker 3>don't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like,</v>

515
00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.180
<v Speaker 3>I really do like sand sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this around.</v>

516
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

517
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.700
<v Speaker 3>And they're really cool to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've never had,</v>

518
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:09.020
<v Speaker 3>I've never actually known anyone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>serves in southern California that has,</v>

519
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all the surfers that I've known </v>

520
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:14.160
<v Speaker 3>that has had an encounter in southern </v>
<v Speaker 3>California with a shark.</v>

521
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Do you know people that have encountered</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in the bay area?</v>

522
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Bay area is a big breeding ground </v>

523
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.000
<v Speaker 3>for great whites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never surf there.</v>

524
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

525
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.420
<v Speaker 3>I would never say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

526
00:24:22.421 --> 00:24:25.360
<v Speaker 3>I would never surf there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

527
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.240
<v Speaker 3>The sharks</v>

528
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:28.410
<v Speaker 1>look say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sharks.</v>

529
00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.330
<v Speaker 1>But they're all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all connected.</v>

530
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go outside.</v>

531
00:24:31.951 --> 00:24:36.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a bad neighborhood somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will stick and move around.</v>

532
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I guess just in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sort of like convinced myself that</v>

533
00:24:39.391 --> 00:24:41.310
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not coming to San Diego.</v>

534
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of a drone flying over </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malibu where some guy takes a drone and </v>

535
00:24:47.701 --> 00:24:51.720
<v Speaker 1>he's flying over the Malibu surf and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

536
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.960
<v Speaker 1>the drone is like maybe a few hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>yards away from some surfers and you see</v>

537
00:24:57.241 --> 00:25:01.530
<v Speaker 1>a big fucking great white just swimming </v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

538
00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.630
<v Speaker 1>just swimming along and show me this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

539
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Drone shark footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's these people.</v>

540
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 1>They're all on this board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came and were just southern </v>

541
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new big deal,</v>

542
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.670
<v Speaker 1>and when the drone keeps going further </v>
<v Speaker 1>and further out,</v>

543
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you see this fucking whopper shark </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not far away from these people </v>

544
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.620
<v Speaker 1>will find it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie will find it.</v>

545
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.650
<v Speaker 1>There's one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's this?</v>

546
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

547
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

548
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Just a shark right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>

549
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

550
00:25:35.641 --> 00:25:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't show me this.</v>

551
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a smart woman.</v>

552
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.600
<v Speaker 1>You understand monster soup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try not to think about the sharks.</v>

553
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a gold look.</v>

554
00:25:44.881 --> 00:25:49.881
<v Speaker 1>There's two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting book that surfer and two </v>

555
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:49.881
<v Speaker 1>sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No big deal guys.</v>

556
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.350
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

557
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.850
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just I know.</v>

558
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Catalina,</v>

559
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:03.260
<v Speaker 1>that whole area outside of Catalina is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shark fishing mecca where I have a</v>

560
00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:09.171
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine from Texas and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveled to Catalina Island and he said </v>

561
00:26:09.171 --> 00:26:12.660
<v Speaker 1>it is the most savage stretch of water </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all of North America.</v>

562
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.450
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just infested with Maaco sharks,</v>

563
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.200
<v Speaker 1>and they go out there to catch me kosher</v>
<v Speaker 1>are delicious.</v>

564
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Mako sharks are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good to eat too.</v>

565
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.520
<v Speaker 1>They taste like swordfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That tastes amazing.</v>

566
00:26:23.521 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Are they dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll fuck you know,</v>

567
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.640
<v Speaker 1>fight you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about sharks,</v>

568
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.670
<v Speaker 1>now it's because people are so silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the awareness of shark fin </v>

569
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:35.270
<v Speaker 1>soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 1>because shark fin soup is the practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>of acquiring shark fins is really brutal</v>

571
00:26:41.911 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>and not sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it's</v>

572
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:49.070
<v Speaker 4>really horrific and a lot of Asian </v>
<v Speaker 4>fisheries engage in these unsustainable </v>

573
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:54.951
<v Speaker 4>practices where they'll scoop up </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands and thousands of sharks cut </v>

574
00:26:54.951 --> 00:26:59.361
<v Speaker 4>their fins off and then throw them right</v>
<v Speaker 4>back in the water so they waste most of </v>

575
00:26:59.361 --> 00:27:02.931
<v Speaker 4>the shark in order to get the fins for </v>
<v Speaker 4>shark fish soup and so because they're </v>

576
00:27:02.931 --> 00:27:07.701
<v Speaker 4>trying to raise awareness of this now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are getting really upset at </v>

577
00:27:07.701 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 4>anyone who catches sharks even if they </v>
<v Speaker 4>catch sharks legally for food,</v>

578
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.460
<v Speaker 4>because sharks are not endangered and as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well as any in any more sense than tuna </v>

579
00:27:17.411 --> 00:27:22.411
<v Speaker 4>is endangered because tuna are in vastly</v>
<v Speaker 4>diminished numbers than they were just a</v>

580
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:28.610
<v Speaker 4>few decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you talked to anyone who's a </v>

581
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.610
<v Speaker 4>commercial fisherman or even a a sport </v>
<v Speaker 4>fisherman,</v>

582
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:29.460
<v Speaker 4>if these guys that run these charter </v>
<v Speaker 4>boats,</v>

583
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.130
<v Speaker 4>they'll tell you like to use to catch </v>
<v Speaker 4>way more tuna.</v>

584
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:37.190
<v Speaker 4>It used to be way more prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there was something that you </v>

585
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.320
<v Speaker 4>addressed in that Jiro Dreams of Sushi </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie as well,</v>

586
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.130
<v Speaker 4>is that the commercial fishing is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>brutalizing the tuna Martin,</v>

587
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.520
<v Speaker 4>but yet everybody is still eats tuna and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't think twice about it because </v>

588
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.121
<v Speaker 4>this campaign against shark fin soup is </v>
<v Speaker 4>made people like really upset at people </v>

589
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 4>that catch sharks to eat.</v>

590
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.920
<v Speaker 4>Even people that eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like we're so simplistic in like </v>

591
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.150
<v Speaker 4>are protesting and like people just have</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in their head that I heard you're not</v>

592
00:28:00.151 --> 00:28:05.151
<v Speaker 4>supposed to eat sharks anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like can you catch and sharks you </v>

593
00:28:05.151 --> 00:28:05.151
<v Speaker 4>fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

594
00:28:05.151 --> 00:28:09.360
<v Speaker 4>like that is the one thing that you want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk about like fish that don't do no</v>

595
00:28:09.361 --> 00:28:11.910
<v Speaker 4>harm to human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like sharks aren't on that list.</v>

596
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this,</v>

597
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 4>this is scary God damn animal and if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could eat that,</v>

598
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 4>I say Kudos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kudos to you</v>

599
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.420
<v Speaker 3>because sharks are higher up on the food</v>
<v Speaker 3>chain.</v>

600
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:26.750
<v Speaker 3>Don't they have higher mercury levels?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question because I know </v>

601
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.930
<v Speaker 3>like swordfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I would not eat swordfish.</v>

602
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.560
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

603
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.320
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

604
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.320
<v Speaker 3>There is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

605
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could remember the amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like 150 micrograms per </v>

606
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.950
<v Speaker 3>four ounces or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So compare that to a wild Atlantic </v>

607
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has like four micrograms.</v>

608
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

609
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:50.721
<v Speaker 3>Swordfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the ones that are really safe to eat </v>

610
00:28:50.721 --> 00:28:54.100
<v Speaker 3>that I know of are the wild wildlands </v>
<v Speaker 3>salmon,</v>

611
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 3>wild Alaskan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

612
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Analytic Wild Alaskan Salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cod.</v>

613
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

614
00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 3>White tuna is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the albacore tuna has a little bit </v>

615
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.340
<v Speaker 3>more mercury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like,</v>

616
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twice as much or something.</v>

617
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:16.130
<v Speaker 3>But I'm old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little thinking that shark would </v>

618
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.230
<v Speaker 3>be high on the mercury level.</v>

619
00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.760
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to find that out because I know</v>

620
00:29:18.761 --> 00:29:22.210
<v Speaker 4>that people have had issues that eat a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendous amount of Sushi.</v>

621
00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.720
<v Speaker 4>People that eat Sushi like every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know they have had issues with mercury</v>

622
00:29:25.721 --> 00:29:30.721
<v Speaker 4>in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually had an arsenic issue with </v>

623
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:32.170
<v Speaker 4>sardines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sardines,</v>

624
00:29:32.171 --> 00:29:36.340
<v Speaker 4>or bottom dwellers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I used to eat sardines all the time.</v>

625
00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Sardi.</v>

626
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love sardines too.</v>

627
00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 4>And if you eat canned sardines too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

628
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 2>got some blood work done and the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

629
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 2>you have some significant amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>arsenic in your system.</v>

630
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I being poisoned?</v>

631
00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

632
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that.</v>

633
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:56.100
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like someone's trying to kill </v>

634
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:56.100
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is like a dietary issue.</v>

635
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:56.260
<v Speaker 2>And then he asked me what I ate and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

636
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went through all my food.</v>

637
00:29:57.611 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing else.</v>

638
00:29:58.301 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

639
00:29:58.811 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 2>what about seafood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

640
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.360
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat seafood.</v>

641
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat a lot of sardines.</v>

642
00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

643
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sardines,</v>

644
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:07.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulate arsenic.</v>

645
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I backed off.</v>

646
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't eat sardines at all for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

647
00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue was completely resolved.</v>

648
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm besides sweat,</v>

649
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 2>you sweat out a lot of these heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>metals like mercury,</v>

650
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:20.390
<v Speaker 2>arsenic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

651
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.370
<v Speaker 2>garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the Beta mercaptans and garlic.</v>

652
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
<v Speaker 2>They key late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bind and key late mercury and help </v>

653
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.560
<v Speaker 2>pull it and excrete it out of your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the urine.</v>

654
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.290
<v Speaker 2>So like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I make salmon or fish,</v>

655
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:40.291
<v Speaker 2>which I actually do eat a lot of salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably like two or three times a </v>

656
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:40.291
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

657
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I always have fresh garlic with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

658
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:48.031
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Salmon is outstanding to because </v>

659
00:30:48.031 --> 00:30:48.031
<v Speaker 2>it's so high in essential fatty acids </v>
<v Speaker 2>strictly.</v>

660
00:30:48.031 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 2>It's really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

661
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:54.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really high in Omega three fatty </v>

662
00:30:54.661 --> 00:30:54.661
<v Speaker 2>acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>EPA and Dha.</v>

663
00:30:54.661 --> 00:30:58.111
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's got a modest amount of vitamin </v>

664
00:30:58.111 --> 00:30:59.851
<v Speaker 2>D.</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I'm sick I eat giant cloves of </v>

665
00:30:59.851 --> 00:31:03.211
<v Speaker 2>garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just break it down to point where </v>

666
00:31:03.211 --> 00:31:05.731
<v Speaker 2>it makes me feel horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have like a big glass of Kombucha </v>

667
00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:09.360
<v Speaker 2>and I'll take like a lump of garlic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll break off like four or five cloves </v>

668
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 2>and I'll just take off the skin and chew</v>
<v Speaker 2>those bitches down and Chug it.</v>

669
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.960
<v Speaker 2>With Kombucha it's off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes it,</v>

670
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:19.300
<v Speaker 2>it's painful as it's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my,</v>

671
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 2>my system is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck is this?</v>

672
00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could feel it inside my body burning.</v>

673
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

674
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I've done the same thing previously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

675
00:31:28.681 --> 00:31:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

676
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean garlic is very powerful.</v>

677
00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Antimicrobial compounds in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

678
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes perfect sense.</v>

679
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Lots of last time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

680
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I had to take a knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a knee to knee.</v>

681
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

682
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't actually go down,</v>

683
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:51.620
<v Speaker 2>but what I did was I put both my arms on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the counter and I went down like this,</v>

684
00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

685
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 2>because it was just burning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going down.</v>

686
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

687
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:02.020
<v Speaker 2>this is probably not even working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being retarded.</v>

688
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:07.290
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting back to some of those like </v>

689
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:07.290
<v Speaker 2>pungent compounds that are in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

690
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.250
<v Speaker 2>these plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that kind of gets back to what we</v>

691
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 2>were talking about a minute ago with </v>
<v Speaker 2>switching on those genetic switches that</v>

692
00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:16.800
<v Speaker 2>are meant to be switched on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

693
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.580
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to eat these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods,</v>

694
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.920
<v Speaker 2>garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broccoli,</v>

695
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.170
<v Speaker 2>cauliflower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kale,</v>

696
00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:25.180
<v Speaker 2>these things that have that pungent </v>
<v Speaker 2>mustard,</v>

697
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:26.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

698
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.150
<v Speaker 2>that pungent tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

699
00:32:28.151 --> 00:32:29.190
<v Speaker 2>these things are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

700
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:34.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>various different polyphenols and </v>

701
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.961
<v Speaker 2>compounds and one in particular I become</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with lately is sulfur fain and </v>

702
00:32:36.961 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 2>that's present in most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cruciferous family,</v>

703
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broccoli,</v>

704
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.160
<v Speaker 3>cabbage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brussel sprouts,</v>

705
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 3>Wasabi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bok Choy,</v>

706
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.430
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

707
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.560
<v Speaker 3>that whole family of vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much.</v>

708
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 3>I eat those vegetables a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I become very obsessed with this,</v>

709
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:57.040
<v Speaker 3>this compound that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually sulforaphane refrains,</v>

710
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.080
<v Speaker 3>not in the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets formed once you break the plant </v>

711
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:06.560
<v Speaker 3>tissue once it's like chewed or crushed </v>
<v Speaker 3>or blended or whatever,</v>

712
00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:11.561
<v Speaker 3>chopped somehow because it's stored as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>precursor and then once the tissue gets,</v>

713
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chapter or whatever,</v>

714
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:20.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it forms sulforaphane and that's </v>

715
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:20.130
<v Speaker 3>part of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

716
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:20.130
<v Speaker 3>hormetic response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

717
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:24.620
<v Speaker 3>it's plant response to try to ward off </v>
<v Speaker 3>insects or whatever thing.</v>

718
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it forms,</v>

719
00:33:26.091 --> 00:33:27.890
<v Speaker 3>but it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we ingest it,</v>

720
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 3>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

721
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:31.220
<v Speaker 3>really good for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

722
00:33:31.221 --> 00:33:34.690
<v Speaker 3>So the sulfur in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

723
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 3>which is actually really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really high in Broccoli sprouts.</v>

724
00:33:38.091 --> 00:33:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had Broccoli sprouts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Broccoli sprouts actually contained like</v>

725
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.140
<v Speaker 3>a hundred times more of it than mature </v>
<v Speaker 3>Broccoli.</v>

726
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.960
<v Speaker 3>So it's like probably the best source of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sulfur,</v>

727
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.330
<v Speaker 3>dietary source of sulfur fain out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>on your instagram that you,</v>

728
00:33:54.331 --> 00:33:55.670
<v Speaker 3>you make shakes with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

729
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

730
00:33:57.261 --> 00:34:02.261
<v Speaker 3>I've become sort of convinced that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a very powerful anti aging and also </v>

731
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:08.561
<v Speaker 3>powerful nootropic in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I could say.</v>

732
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can elaborate,</v>

733
00:34:10.701 --> 00:34:15.701
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've been doing these shakes where </v>

734
00:34:15.701 --> 00:34:15.701
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can sprout,</v>

735
00:34:15.701 --> 00:34:18.080
<v Speaker 3>you can sprout your own sprouts at home </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a relatively cheap.</v>

736
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:23.081
<v Speaker 3>You just buy some organic weed dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what about three point five </v>

737
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:26.570
<v Speaker 3>pounds of Broccoli spouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wink,</v>

738
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:29.530
<v Speaker 3>wink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they call it.</v>

739
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.730
<v Speaker 3>These kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not though,</v>

740
00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:33.410
<v Speaker 3>if you freeze them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was actually,</v>

741
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those bags are going in the freezer </v>

742
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.350
<v Speaker 3>when you freeze them because when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>freeze the plant,</v>

743
00:34:39.351 --> 00:34:41.360
<v Speaker 3>the tissue also gets like broken.</v>

744
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:47.050
<v Speaker 3>It actually doubles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some cases you can up to double the </v>

745
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:51.281
<v Speaker 3>amount of sulfur Fein because it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>has a longer time to form this so you </v>

746
00:34:51.281 --> 00:34:53.960
<v Speaker 3>can have more concentrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned that the hard way,</v>

747
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.020
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what hardware,</v>

748
00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:02.070
<v Speaker 3>let me just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's so pungent and powerful </v>

749
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:02.360
<v Speaker 3>that if you make a shake with it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing,</v>

750
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:07.510
<v Speaker 3>like at first I was doing fresh shakes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we start freezing them and I </v>

751
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:12.041
<v Speaker 3>was making shakes that were from </v>
<v Speaker 3>previously frozen sprouts and it's like </v>

752
00:35:12.041 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Speaker 3>I needed like half the dose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

753
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to feel,</v>

754
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 3>to feel the same thing or if I feel I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

755
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 3>So I guess I should probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:25.640
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you drink coffee,</v>

757
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you kind of just,</v>

758
00:35:27.351 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 3>you feel a little happy and good and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel a little more alert.</v>

759
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like that.</v>

760
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.900
<v Speaker 3>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>

761
00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:40.901
<v Speaker 3>is that it's been shown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there have been clinical studies in </v>

762
00:35:40.901 --> 00:35:45.360
<v Speaker 3>humans and this is very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's been shown like if you give</v>

763
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give,</v>

764
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even just a small amount.</v>

765
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:53.211
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like between seven to 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams of sulfur free in a day to </v>

766
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:58.470
<v Speaker 3>two young adults with autism that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>improved their autistic scores by like </v>

767
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 3>34 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And artistic scores,</v>

768
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:06.951
<v Speaker 3>they liked the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a range of different tests that </v>

769
00:36:06.951 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 3>are done to like measure different </v>
<v Speaker 3>various brain functions,</v>

770
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.530
<v Speaker 3>but improve this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He autistic autistic individuals by like</v>

771
00:36:13.531 --> 00:36:15.600
<v Speaker 3>34 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same was done.</v>

772
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a pilot study for people with </v>

773
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.970
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia were like improve their </v>
<v Speaker 3>symptoms so they're just,</v>

774
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 3>their brain functions better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

775
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

776
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:26.130
<v Speaker 3>and this is like pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

777
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:28.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the results were so powerful that,</v>

778
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was done at Johns Hopkins.</v>

779
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.130
<v Speaker 3>The study is now being repeated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

780
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:38.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like this is what is going </v>

781
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.270
<v Speaker 3>on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how is this affecting the brain?</v>

782
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.530
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

783
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 3>if you look at a lot of the animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies,</v>

784
00:36:39.961 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 3>there's lots and lots of animal studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have been done,</v>

785
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:43.980
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

786
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.930
<v Speaker 3>people aren't quite as convinced because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

787
00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:47.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of this relates to humans,</v>

788
00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:51.330
<v Speaker 3>but it's been shown to be as effective </v>
<v Speaker 3>as um,</v>

789
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.720
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the antidepressant Prozac in alleviating</v>

790
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:59.721
<v Speaker 3>depression and mice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they do all these battery of tests </v>

791
00:36:59.721 --> 00:37:01.210
<v Speaker 3>were they stress the mice out and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>them depressed and social defeat in like</v>

792
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.440
<v Speaker 3>the hanging by their tail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually just kind of gnarly.</v>

793
00:37:04.441 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's like,</v>

794
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:11.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of tests they do to see if </v>

795
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:11.060
<v Speaker 3>they're depressed and you give them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

796
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your placebo,</v>

797
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:12.640
<v Speaker 3>you give them Prozac or you give them </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

798
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Speaker 3>the Broccoli sprout extract and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>performed just as well.</v>

799
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it helps depression,</v>

800
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.880
<v Speaker 3>it's been shown to help with </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurodegenerative diseases,</v>

801
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point is,</v>

802
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:28.371
<v Speaker 3>I think that the reason it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>affecting all these brain functions and </v>

803
00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:33.111
<v Speaker 3>why even you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone like me may notice a small </v>

804
00:37:33.111 --> 00:37:36.471
<v Speaker 3>effect from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from eating them is because it has very </v>

805
00:37:36.471 --> 00:37:38.430
<v Speaker 3>profound effect on inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is because,</v>

806
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:39.740
<v Speaker 3>as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

807
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:45.170
<v Speaker 3>it switches on one of those switches </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was meant to be switched on a </v>

808
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:48.330
<v Speaker 3>pathway called NRF two and our body that</v>
<v Speaker 3>controls over 200 genes.</v>

809
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:53.331
<v Speaker 3>And so for Fein is the most potent </v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally occurring compound that we've </v>

810
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>discovered yet that activates this </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathway.</v>

811
00:37:56.011 --> 00:38:01.011
<v Speaker 3>So it's no other plant compound or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're naturally occurring plant </v>

812
00:38:01.011 --> 00:38:04.521
<v Speaker 3>compound can activate this pathway is </v>
<v Speaker 3>potent as sulforaphane and nrf two is,</v>

813
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:10.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been shown in multiple studies to </v>

814
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.651
<v Speaker 3>be involved in delaying aging and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that happens through lowering tons of</v>

815
00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:17.820
<v Speaker 3>different inflammatory genes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>activating anti-inflammatory genes,</v>

816
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.360
<v Speaker 3>lowering oxidative stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>glutathione related enzymes.</v>

817
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:26.360
<v Speaker 3>It helps with detoxifying compounds that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're exposed to on a daily basis like </v>

818
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 3>percentages and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that we're having a low level</v>

819
00:38:28.951 --> 00:38:31.770
<v Speaker 3>of this like inflammation stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're constantly being exposed to and it</v>

820
00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:33.390
<v Speaker 3>affects the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

821
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 3>so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get a dose of this,</v>

822
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:41.310
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may notice a small effect now with </v>

823
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:41.310
<v Speaker 3>someone that has autism or </v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia,</v>

824
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.440
<v Speaker 3>inflammation and oxidative stress had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been shown in previous studies on </v>

825
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.831
<v Speaker 3>multiple previous studies to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to play a role in the etiology of those </v>

826
00:38:49.831 --> 00:38:54.151
<v Speaker 3>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's how it may be </v>

827
00:38:54.151 --> 00:38:55.360
<v Speaker 3>effecting the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just affecting the brain.</v>

828
00:38:55.361 --> 00:38:57.740
<v Speaker 3>And probably one of the most well known,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

829
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 3>functions of sulfur Fein is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a very powerful,</v>

830
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.430
<v Speaker 3>a cancer preventative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

831
00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 3>compound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

832
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:08.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been shown to prevent cancer.</v>

833
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

834
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.940
<v Speaker 3>if you have men that had prostate cancer</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were given 60 milligrams of </v>

835
00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 3>sulfur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feign a day for,</v>

836
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember exactly how long,</v>

837
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:24.630
<v Speaker 3>but it lowered its slowed the doubling </v>
<v Speaker 3>rate of a tumor biomarker called </v>

838
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:30.060
<v Speaker 3>prostate specific Antigen Psa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what is usually measured when </v>

839
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 3>men have prostate cancer.</v>

840
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.340
<v Speaker 3>You mentioned the progression of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it has a doubling rate.</v>

841
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.680
<v Speaker 3>It doubles every so often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it slowed that doubling rate by 86 </v>

842
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty,</v>

843
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:40.750
<v Speaker 3>pretty profound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

844
00:39:40.751 --> 00:39:45.751
<v Speaker 3>there's lots and lots of associative </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies that have shown cruciferous </v>

845
00:39:45.751 --> 00:39:45.751
<v Speaker 3>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

846
00:39:45.751 --> 00:39:47.620
<v Speaker 3>if you eat more of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have lower risk of bladder,</v>

847
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:49.150
<v Speaker 3>ovarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prostate,</v>

848
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.250
<v Speaker 3>kidney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just all sorts of cancers.</v>

849
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's the clinical trials I think </v>

850
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:56.640
<v Speaker 3>are what's really telling because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

851
00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:01.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're giving someone this compound and </v>

852
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.811
<v Speaker 3>it's slowing a tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Progressive Progression Marker by 86 </v>

853
00:40:03.811 --> 00:40:03.811
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

854
00:40:03.811 --> 00:40:06.190
<v Speaker 3>there's another study which is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting also,</v>

855
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.410
<v Speaker 3>and this is kind of like what really got</v>
<v Speaker 3>me interested.</v>

856
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if other people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in it,</v>

857
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.050
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

858
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:17.890
<v Speaker 3>we're exposed to two compounds from like</v>
<v Speaker 3>air pollution.</v>

859
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.290
<v Speaker 3>So like living in Los Angeles for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

860
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:25.291
<v Speaker 3>is probably definitely one of the places</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to be more exposed to </v>

861
00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:25.291
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

862
00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:29.080
<v Speaker 3>So some of these airborne carcinogens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so benzenes one of them Aqualina.</v>

863
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.930
<v Speaker 3>These things are in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're breathing them in.</v>

864
00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.850
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting to some degree,</v>

865
00:40:33.851 --> 00:40:38.851
<v Speaker 3>we have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have benzene in our system and it is </v>

866
00:40:38.851 --> 00:40:41.761
<v Speaker 3>a carcinogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been shown to cause cancer </v>

867
00:40:41.761 --> 00:40:45.121
<v Speaker 3>specifically linked to leukemia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a smokers get a ton of it because </v>

868
00:40:45.121 --> 00:40:46.820
<v Speaker 3>it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in cigarettes.</v>

869
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.170
<v Speaker 3>So cigarettes smokers are like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>loaded up with benzene.</v>

870
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.440
<v Speaker 3>But there was a study where people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>given like 40 milligrams of sulforaphane</v>

871
00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:00.980
<v Speaker 3>in the form of a Broccoli sprout drink a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day for like a week and starting on day </v>

872
00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:05.911
<v Speaker 3>one of tea drinking this drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they excrete id 61 percent of the </v>

873
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:08.620
<v Speaker 3>benzene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on day one,</v>

874
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 3>61 percent of benzene which is coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of their urine,</v>

875
00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:12.970
<v Speaker 3>like as you measure metabolites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

876
00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.010
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is amazing.</v>

877
00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Like getting rid of some of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

878
00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:17.680
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

879
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:22.681
<v Speaker 3>because I'm definitely want to get rid </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the benzene and all that stuff that </v>

880
00:41:22.681 --> 00:41:22.681
<v Speaker 3>I'm being exposed to.</v>

881
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.830
<v Speaker 3>So that really got my attention too </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was just so significant and a</v>

882
00:41:26.831 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 3>profound effect just after one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

883
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:35.190
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was another sort of thing that got </v>

884
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.500
<v Speaker 3>me really it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the aging stuff where it's been</v>

885
00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:40.580
<v Speaker 3>shown some inflammation has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>identified as a key age or of aging.</v>

886
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Taking sulforaphane has been shown to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower inflammatory markers in people,</v>

887
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by like 20 percent c reactive protein,</v>

888
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:52.280
<v Speaker 3>other inflammatory markers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course there's like dozens of studies</v>

889
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 3>in animals that have been done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sort of,</v>

890
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I think the human studies are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting to talk about.</v>

891
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.150
<v Speaker 3>So definitely more relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

892
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.990
<v Speaker 3>and then also it's been shown to effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>a cardiovascular health because of the </v>

893
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:09.401
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so type two diabetics that were </v>

894
00:42:09.401 --> 00:42:09.401
<v Speaker 3>given,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

895
00:42:09.401 --> 00:42:09.401
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some dose,</v>

896
00:42:09.401 --> 00:42:11.890
<v Speaker 3>I think it was something around 40 </v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams as well as of sulforaphane.</v>

897
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.690
<v Speaker 3>They were given this daily and for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month,</v>

898
00:42:14.691 --> 00:42:18.560
<v Speaker 3>for four weeks and it lowered their </v>
<v Speaker 3>triglycerides by 20 percent.</v>

899
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.010
<v Speaker 3>It lowered their atherogenic index,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is measuring,</v>

900
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dangerous type of Ldl,</v>

901
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:27.260
<v Speaker 3>small dense ldl triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at all these things,</v>

902
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:32.300
<v Speaker 3>lower that by 50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>improve their blood sugar by almost 20 </v>

903
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.760
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like I'm getting my mouth,</v>

904
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get my mom on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

905
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom,</v>

906
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:41.530
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she definitely has got like high </v>

907
00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:41.530
<v Speaker 3>triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

908
00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:42.440
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm really convinced.</v>

909
00:42:42.441 --> 00:42:47.441
<v Speaker 3>And then there's been studies in animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just shown that it like delays </v>

910
00:42:47.441 --> 00:42:50.141
<v Speaker 3>aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm convinced that I think it's one </v>

911
00:42:50.141 --> 00:42:53.261
<v Speaker 3>of those things like you get it in Kale </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that I've been getting a </v>

912
00:42:53.261 --> 00:42:55.640
<v Speaker 3>good dose of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been drinking Kale smoothies.</v>

913
00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty regularly since I'm probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 2010.</v>

914
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably about six or seven years.</v>

915
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:08.950
<v Speaker 3>And I do feel like it's like help age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like help me age like a little better.</v>

916
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be completely in my mind,</v>

917
00:43:11.151 --> 00:43:12.880
<v Speaker 3>but just because I know it killed has </v>
<v Speaker 3>held,</v>

918
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.290
<v Speaker 3>killed with healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that I've found something to</v>

919
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:20.291
<v Speaker 3>take it to another level where I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm pretty convinced that if I </v>

920
00:43:20.291 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 3>continued taking the Sulforaphane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

921
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I think it will absolutely affect the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way I age and I think it will affect my </v>

922
00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:27.130
<v Speaker 3>brain aging as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

923
00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.380
<v Speaker 3>it's been shown to at least an animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies to affect brain aging,</v>

924
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:35.680
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you administered after </v>

925
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:35.680
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it improves.</v>

926
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:40.301
<v Speaker 3>Outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>improves your brain swelling and all </v>

927
00:43:40.301 --> 00:43:40.301
<v Speaker 3>that by like 50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

928
00:43:40.301 --> 00:43:44.201
<v Speaker 3>just all sorts of nones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like I could go on and I have </v>

929
00:43:44.201 --> 00:43:47.591
<v Speaker 3>a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did like a 45 minute video where I'm </v>

930
00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:49.130
<v Speaker 3>literally just talking about this for 45</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and then I went on Youtube.</v>

931
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.690
<v Speaker 3>It's on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

932
00:43:50.691 --> 00:43:52.280
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

933
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.530
<v Speaker 3>I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this research took month,</v>

934
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 3>many months and it's like a 16 page </v>
<v Speaker 3>article I wrote.</v>

935
00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hope to get published.</v>

936
00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to submit it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>publication because it's just,</v>

937
00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:06.701
<v Speaker 3>it was a lot of work and I haven't seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything in the literature as </v>

938
00:44:06.701 --> 00:44:08.060
<v Speaker 3>comprehensive covering every base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just,</v>

939
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:11.450
<v Speaker 3>I tried to cover everything that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a good study,</v>

940
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was important.</v>

941
00:44:12.831 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 3>And I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so um,</v>

942
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:17.160
<v Speaker 3>and then I flew out to Johns Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

943
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:22.180
<v Speaker 3>recently I was invited to give a talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and I met it just so happens the </v>

944
00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.750
<v Speaker 3>guy who discovered that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

945
00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:26.240
<v Speaker 3>the guy who discovered Sofer Fein is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

946
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:27.740
<v Speaker 3>but he's much older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't meet with.</v>

947
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I met with someone who trained with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

948
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:33.300
<v Speaker 3>who discovered that Broccoli sprouts are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best source of sulfur.</v>

949
00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.700
<v Speaker 3>And so he made that discovery back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nineties.</v>

950
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I interviewed him and he just went </v>

951
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:41.540
<v Speaker 3>on and on and on and talked about so far</v>
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>

952
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.970
<v Speaker 3>in addition to like what I had already </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about on one of the videos I did.</v>

953
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.560
<v Speaker 3>And he actually had some really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting stuff to talk about in terms</v>

954
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 3>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

955
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

956
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.330
<v Speaker 3>So in order to get the sulfur thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>

957
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:59.750
<v Speaker 3>the plant has to be crushed or chopped </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's because it has an enzyme in </v>

958
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:03.981
<v Speaker 3>it called my Ra cynase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my Ross cynase is I'm heat </v>

959
00:45:03.981 --> 00:45:04.110
<v Speaker 3>sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you,</v>

960
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.060
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you steam your Broccoli,</v>

961
00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:09.300
<v Speaker 3>when you boil your Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you saw your kill,</v>

962
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:14.690
<v Speaker 3>any of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately your inactivating my </v>

963
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Roston a's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're not getting as much sulfur</v>

964
00:45:16.371 --> 00:45:21.371
<v Speaker 3>fain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting dramatically less </v>

965
00:45:21.371 --> 00:45:21.810
<v Speaker 3>dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost not almost nonexistent.</v>

966
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.830
<v Speaker 3>The precursor Glucoraphanin is still in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that plant.</v>

967
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:30.831
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're getting the precursor and we </v>

968
00:45:30.831 --> 00:45:32.670
<v Speaker 3>do have some bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some types of bifido bacteria in our gut</v>

969
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.850
<v Speaker 3>that contain the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my ra,</v>

970
00:45:33.851 --> 00:45:38.851
<v Speaker 3>Annie's enzyme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly variable from individual to </v>

971
00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:41.571
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so you can convert some of that to </v>

972
00:45:41.571 --> 00:45:45.390
<v Speaker 3>sulforaphane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was interesting that he </v>

973
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.960
<v Speaker 3>mentioned is you can actually sprinkle </v>
<v Speaker 3>mustard powder,</v>

974
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.600
<v Speaker 3>like mustard powder that you buy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

975
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:54.950
<v Speaker 3>after you saw your Kale or after you </v>
<v Speaker 3>steam your vegetables or what if you </v>

976
00:45:55.051 --> 00:46:00.051
<v Speaker 3>cook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you apply heat to any of your </v>

977
00:46:00.051 --> 00:46:01.791
<v Speaker 3>cruciferous vegetables afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put the muscle paddle on mustard </v>

978
00:46:01.791 --> 00:46:02.820
<v Speaker 3>powder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has active my Ross and he's in it and</v>

979
00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:07.821
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The myrosinase in the mustard seed is </v>

980
00:46:07.821 --> 00:46:11.361
<v Speaker 3>more heat stable so you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>convert your precursor into the soul for</v>

981
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:15.090
<v Speaker 3>fame by adding the mustard powder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

982
00:46:15.091 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 3>that is a really great wow.</v>

983
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.760
<v Speaker 3>Like thing to know because now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I do cook a lot of.</v>

984
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.960
<v Speaker 3>I saw take all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

985
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

986
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.010
<v Speaker 3>I steam my Broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put some butter and salt,</v>

987
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.430
<v Speaker 3>pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I eat my broccoli.</v>

988
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:31.670
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are there any compounds in Kale or </v>

989
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:37.161
<v Speaker 3>broccoli or anything else that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>them more bioavailable when you do cook </v>

990
00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:37.161
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

991
00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:41.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of the minerals and stuff </v>

992
00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:41.960
<v Speaker 3>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like magnesium,</v>

993
00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:41.960
<v Speaker 3>the calcium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things are,</v>

994
00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.520
<v Speaker 3>those things become more bioavailable </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you cook them.</v>

995
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.840
<v Speaker 3>And so you would get that benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus if you just cooked it,</v>

996
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.080
<v Speaker 3>the mustard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the master seed powder,</v>

997
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:57.081
<v Speaker 3>you have to make sure it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I like to do is sprinkle a little </v>

998
00:46:57.081 --> 00:46:57.081
<v Speaker 3>bit on my hand and lick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lick it,</v>

999
00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 3>like it's got to give.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to have that bite.</v>

1000
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.750
<v Speaker 3>If it doesn't have the bite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1001
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.570
<v Speaker 3>it's been degraded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been on the shelf for too long.</v>

1002
00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:05.310
<v Speaker 3>It's been an Amazon shelves for too </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

1003
00:47:05.311 --> 00:47:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1004
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.230
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1005
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:12.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to have that light mustard bite </v>

1006
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.290
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you regular mustard?</v>

1007
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:13.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1008
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:16.260
<v Speaker 3>Mustard seed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mustard seed.</v>

1009
00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1010
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.060
<v Speaker 3>so that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was a very useful like,</v>

1011
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Sulforaphane,</v>

1012
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:24.610
<v Speaker 3>it's really good joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really am.</v>

1013
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get people to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the more people that get the </v>

1014
00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 3>sulforaphane in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're gonna be healthier.</v>

1015
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it can help prevent cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lower inflammation.</v>

1016
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm just so many different good things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So smokers,</v>

1017
00:47:36.401 --> 00:47:37.960
<v Speaker 3>for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a smoker,</v>

1018
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 3>they should be taking sulfur free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should be drinking those shakes.</v>

1019
00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:43.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking like every day,</v>

1020
00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they are getting so much </v>

1021
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Speaker 3>benzene.</v>

1022
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.930
<v Speaker 3>So two questions about this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where does someone get Broccoli sprouts?</v>

1023
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where would you get that?</v>

1024
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also the thing is,</v>

1025
00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:58.900
<v Speaker 3>is that you can borrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can buy Broccoli sprouts already,</v>

1026
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:03.901
<v Speaker 3>sprouted at like whole foods or sprouts </v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever your local grocery store is.</v>

1027
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most grocery stores contain a have </v>

1028
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sprouts,</v>

1029
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:16.740
<v Speaker 3>sprouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very rarely that you find Broccoli </v>

1030
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:16.740
<v Speaker 3>sprouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1031
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.260
<v Speaker 3>At whole foods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're at sprouts.</v>

1032
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 3>But the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem with buying sprouts,</v>

1033
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very prone to,</v>

1034
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:29.820
<v Speaker 3>to bacterial contamination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cookie Kolai that the longer they </v>

1035
00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.320
<v Speaker 3>sit on the shelf and a lot of times when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go into these grocery stores,</v>

1036
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.800
<v Speaker 3>they're sitting on the shelf and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably likely a little more </v>

1037
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.571
<v Speaker 3>contaminated with Nikolai then if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were to sprout them yourself and get </v>

1038
00:48:42.571 --> 00:48:45.330
<v Speaker 3>them fresh so you can buy them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1039
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they also charge like it's like five</v>

1040
00:48:50.141 --> 00:48:53.020
<v Speaker 3>bucks for like a little package of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1041
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.630
<v Speaker 3>it's like one shake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1042
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say one shake,</v>

1043
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.440
<v Speaker 3>whereas you can spend 20 bucks and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a pound of seeds.</v>

1044
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.890
<v Speaker 3>And so how do you grow it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1045
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:03.630
<v Speaker 3>well there's lots of different methods </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1046
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:05.110
<v Speaker 3>you can use hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1047
00:49:05.111 --> 00:49:08.190
<v Speaker 3>so previously we used to do these hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1048
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 3>hemp bags where we just put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put the seeds in the bag and you add</v>

1049
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:13.060
<v Speaker 3>some water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1050
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.120
<v Speaker 3>you basically just keep adding water to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and let it drip and they sprout </v>

1051
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.970
<v Speaker 3>within like four days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we started doing this jar method </v>

1052
00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:24.001
<v Speaker 3>where now we have mason jars with a lid </v>
<v Speaker 3>on top that has like little holes that </v>

1053
00:49:24.001 --> 00:49:25.150
<v Speaker 3>are big enough for water to come out </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

1054
00:49:25.151 --> 00:49:27.820
<v Speaker 3>but not for the seeds to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1055
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get these jars and you add water,</v>

1056
00:49:30.251 --> 00:49:32.620
<v Speaker 3>let it sit for like six hours and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>dump it out.</v>

1057
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:37.770
<v Speaker 3>And then you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after that you continually just add the </v>

1058
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:40.171
<v Speaker 3>water and dump it out and add the water </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpreter and kind of leave it tilted </v>

1059
00:49:40.171 --> 00:49:42.460
<v Speaker 3>so that the water isn't just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want the water just sitting in</v>

1060
00:49:42.461 --> 00:49:45.220
<v Speaker 3>there so that it's like growing bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>

1061
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 3>So like let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tilt the water and just wet.</v>

1062
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it really just takes like four days.</v>

1063
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:53.970
<v Speaker 3>And then you have sprouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing is you have,</v>

1064
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:55.670
<v Speaker 3>you do have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1065
00:49:55.870 --> 00:50:00.870
<v Speaker 3>clean like your counters all dirty and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hands are dirty and all the dish </v>

1066
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:05.560
<v Speaker 3>where you're using this dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're probably going to </v>

1067
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:05.560
<v Speaker 3>contaminate them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to like,</v>

1068
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.750
<v Speaker 3>be a little fastidious about the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>spread out these things.</v>

1069
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1070
00:50:09.011 --> 00:50:11.890
<v Speaker 3>but I think once you're aware of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's okay.</v>

1071
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.480
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1072
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.020
<v Speaker 3>and this is something that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to to the expert.</v>

1073
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:22.020
<v Speaker 3>His name is Dr Jed Fahy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recently interviewed him on my </v>

1074
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.261
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He mentioned something to me that like </v>

1075
00:50:25.261 --> 00:50:26.740
<v Speaker 3>caught my interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said the seed itself,</v>

1076
00:50:26.741 --> 00:50:31.741
<v Speaker 3>the Broccoli seed itself has the enzyme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has the precursor to sulforaphane.</v>

1077
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:35.780
<v Speaker 3>And if you break or crush the seed or </v>
<v Speaker 3>chew the seed,</v>

1078
00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.700
<v Speaker 3>then you're actually getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for refrain.</v>

1079
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:43.090
<v Speaker 3>So you can actually crush up the seed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like a coffee grinder or something </v>

1080
00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.210
<v Speaker 3>and like take a shot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>

1081
00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 3>is there's been no research doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>method.</v>

1082
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:50.480
<v Speaker 3>So all these studies that I just talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about in humans,</v>

1083
00:50:50.481 --> 00:50:54.730
<v Speaker 3>those were all done from like Broccoli </v>
<v Speaker 3>sprout powder extract from the sprouts.</v>

1084
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 3>Powder extracts is something they </v>
<v Speaker 3>goodbyes a supplement.</v>

1085
00:50:58.700 --> 00:50:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Great question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1086
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:04.690
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the powder extracts were mostly </v>

1087
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:04.690
<v Speaker 3>made by researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact Jed,</v>

1088
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:05.630
<v Speaker 3>jed is supplied a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1089
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.490
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different universities with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1090
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.750
<v Speaker 3>with the extract himself.</v>

1091
00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are so supplement wise,</v>

1092
00:51:12.231 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing that he really </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of illuminated for me because,</v>

1093
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:20.780
<v Speaker 3>because he's actually been measuring </v>
<v Speaker 3>this certain supplements that are on the</v>

1094
00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 3>market and like if they actually have </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they say they have.</v>

1095
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so because myrosinase is so </v>

1096
00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.781
<v Speaker 3>unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is hard to make a supplement with </v>

1097
00:51:31.781 --> 00:51:34.451
<v Speaker 3>sulfur roofing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is one supplement only one that I </v>

1098
00:51:34.451 --> 00:51:37.991
<v Speaker 3>know of that actually has sulforaphane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual active compound and that's </v>

1099
00:51:38.391 --> 00:51:43.391
<v Speaker 3>called prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's only available in France by </v>

1100
00:51:43.391 --> 00:51:48.011
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no affiliation with any of these </v>

1101
00:51:48.011 --> 00:51:48.011
<v Speaker 3>supplement companies at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just telling information.</v>

1102
00:51:48.011 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 3>It's only available in France.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only available in France and so and</v>

1103
00:51:51.231 --> 00:51:56.231
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he actually tested that one and </v>

1104
00:51:56.231 --> 00:51:58.631
<v Speaker 3>people that were given Prostif I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bioavailability of the soul for roofing </v>

1105
00:51:59.031 --> 00:52:04.031
<v Speaker 3>with 70 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so 70 percent of it ended up like in </v>

1106
00:52:04.031 --> 00:52:04.031
<v Speaker 3>their bloodstream.</v>

1107
00:52:04.031 --> 00:52:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another supplement called Avma </v>

1108
00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.441
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Avma McCall has Glucoraphanin plus </v>

1109
00:52:10.441 --> 00:52:11.470
<v Speaker 3>myrosinase in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't have the Sulforaphane,</v>

1110
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.480
<v Speaker 3>has the two compounds that can form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for a friend,</v>

1111
00:52:14.481 --> 00:52:16.350
<v Speaker 3>but it hasn't been together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1112
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:21.400
<v Speaker 3>that has been tested and that was a bout</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 percent by bioavailability.</v>

1113
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 3>So about 40 percent of it was you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually getting sulforaphane 40 percent</v>

1114
00:52:26.181 --> 00:52:31.181
<v Speaker 3>of the time and that was also tested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another supplement and that is </v>

1115
00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:36.371
<v Speaker 3>available in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another supplement by thorne </v>

1116
00:52:36.371 --> 00:52:40.360
<v Speaker 3>called Coursera I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Chris Sarah only has the precursor </v>

1117
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.950
<v Speaker 3>no enzyme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're totally relying on your gut </v>

1118
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:45.290
<v Speaker 3>bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people it's very variable,</v>

1119
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:47.870
<v Speaker 3>so that only had a 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>bioavailability.</v>

1120
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than that,</v>

1121
00:52:50.091 --> 00:52:53.780
<v Speaker 3>those are the three supplements that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>really could.</v>

1122
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.800
<v Speaker 3>And this isn't a study who just </v>
<v Speaker 3>published recently that he got behind.</v>

1123
00:52:57.801 --> 00:53:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I asked him about a few others because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had actually been taking,</v>

1124
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another one called Brocka Max by</v>

1125
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:09.341
<v Speaker 3>jarrow and he kind of was like asked him</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and he was kind of like </v>

1126
00:53:09.341 --> 00:53:12.380
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] has some of what it says in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there but not all,</v>

1127
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:13.160
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1128
00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:15.470
<v Speaker 3>and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that these supplements,</v>

1129
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:21.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the times like he was telling </v>

1130
00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:21.400
<v Speaker 3>me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeez,</v>

1131
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:26.450
<v Speaker 3>like seven out of 10 times these </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplements had like cloverleaf in them </v>

1132
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.450
<v Speaker 3>when they're supposed to have like</v>

1133
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:30.690
<v Speaker 2>the cruciferous precursor Glucoraphanin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like,</v>

1134
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.270
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of disgusting how supplement </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

1135
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:38.060
<v Speaker 2>how somebody a supplement companies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally just putting all this cloverleaf</v>

1136
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:39.930
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a study that came out like</v>

1137
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.090
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years ago on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1138
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.570
<v Speaker 2>like 75 percent of all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like herbal Achalasia,</v>

1139
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.470
<v Speaker 2>like all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1140
00:53:46.471 --> 00:53:47.800
<v Speaker 2>compounds that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1141
00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:50.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marketed for whatever,</v>

1142
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:54.000
<v Speaker 2>don't actually even contain economically</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever they say they contain.</v>

1143
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.010
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really kind of bad.</v>

1144
00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's a giant issue and if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>company that sells that stuff,</v>

1145
00:54:00.391 --> 00:54:04.050
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even getting it directly from</v>

1146
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:05.280
<v Speaker 2>the source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1147
00:54:05.281 --> 00:54:07.710
<v Speaker 2>they're buying it from companies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>supply it to them.</v>

1148
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:12.711
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of times these companies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in China and places where there were </v>

1149
00:54:12.711 --> 00:54:13.470
<v Speaker 2>regulations are not that strict.</v>

1150
00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get just with.</v>

1151
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had an issue with that when we first </v>

1152
00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:21.540
<v Speaker 2>started making Alpha brain where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would get stuff tested,</v>

1153
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:27.350
<v Speaker 2>we get batches tested in the batches of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different individual ingredients would </v>

1154
00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:32.271
<v Speaker 2>have stuff in it that they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to have in it just because </v>

1155
00:54:32.271 --> 00:54:32.271
<v Speaker 2>they're mixing it all up in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>bins.</v>

1156
00:54:32.271 --> 00:54:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1157
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.250
<v Speaker 2>There's also that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1158
00:54:35.251 --> 00:54:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to find a reliable brand,</v>

1159
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

1160
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:44.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thorn Thorn seems to be a pretty </v>

1161
00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:44.440
<v Speaker 2>reliable one that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1162
00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I've seen multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple different,</v>

1163
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>times where scientists were like,</v>

1164
00:54:48.841 --> 00:54:49.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've tested that.</v>

1165
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:51.660
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more expensive,</v>

1166
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:56.900
<v Speaker 2>but they seem to be pretty reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like the best method is a </v>

1167
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.580
<v Speaker 2>sprout your own Broccoli sprouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's the best method and it</v>

1168
00:54:59.581 --> 00:55:01.140
<v Speaker 2>seems like very cost effective to.</v>

1169
00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cost effective.</v>

1170
00:55:02.701 --> 00:55:05.610
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to have extra cash to buy</v>

1171
00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:10.611
<v Speaker 2>all these expensive supplements because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the all the ones I just mentioned that </v>

1172
00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:11.760
<v Speaker 2>actually are effective and have what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they say they're not cheap.</v>

1173
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:14.880
<v Speaker 2>So that those bags that you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that instagram photo,</v>

1174
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.950
<v Speaker 2>is that all sprouts that you'd made </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself a mason jars at two,</v>

1175
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.860
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1176
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:21.130
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1177
00:55:21.131 --> 00:55:22.190
<v Speaker 2>That's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean they get really dense to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fill up inside the jar.</v>

1179
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1180
00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I have like other pictures somewhere on </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1181
00:55:29.641 --> 00:55:32.640
<v Speaker 2>They were there with the jars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm thinking I might just do a quick</v>

1182
00:55:32.641 --> 00:55:37.641
<v Speaker 2>spreading video like a fiber six minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm already going in my head about </v>

1183
00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 2>how I'm going to start sprouting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1184
00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:41.060
<v Speaker 2>And they're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1185
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to do.</v>

1186
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I always sort of take it to the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

1187
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Like I make my shake and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1188
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:49.020
<v Speaker 2>but they're good on salads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1189
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sprinkle them on anything,</v>

1190
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1191
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:57.470
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked them on salads quite a </v>

1192
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.470
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's amazing.</v>

1193
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1194
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:59.060
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1195
00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.230
<v Speaker 2>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does the.</v>

1196
00:56:01.231 --> 00:56:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those.</v>

1197
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:05.730
<v Speaker 2>So those are the mason jars that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>holes already in them.</v>

1198
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can actually buy this sprouting kit.</v>

1199
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:11.820
<v Speaker 2>So these actually we found these are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>old lids we were using.</v>

1200
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:16.821
<v Speaker 2>We actually found better lids that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>even smaller holes because some of the </v>

1201
00:56:16.821 --> 00:56:19.290
<v Speaker 2>seeds were getting out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this came as a kit,</v>

1202
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:23.770
<v Speaker 2>a sprouting kit you can buy on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has like a little wooden going to set</v>

1203
00:56:23.771 --> 00:56:26.170
<v Speaker 2>the mason jars in so they're like tilted</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can like,</v>

1204
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drip the water out.</v>

1205
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.170
<v Speaker 2>They came with those lids.</v>

1206
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:34.950
<v Speaker 2>But then we did some experimentation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>found other leds that are superior to </v>

1207
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.950
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those,</v>

1208
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.030
<v Speaker 2>how much maintenance is involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>making these.</v>

1209
00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Like how often do you have to attend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things?</v>

1210
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like after the first initial,</v>

1211
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:43.720
<v Speaker 2>like six our water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1212
00:56:43.721 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 2>You let them sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like twice a day in the morning and</v>

1213
00:56:46.871 --> 00:56:49.690
<v Speaker 2>evening dump water on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to rip them out.</v>

1214
00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:53.590
<v Speaker 2>And how long does it take to grow that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was about five days,</v>

1215
00:56:53.591 --> 00:56:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four or five days.</v>

1216
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.790
<v Speaker 2>So for a guy like me who goes away on </v>
<v Speaker 2>weekends a lot,</v>

1217
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to make sure that I am home for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stretch where you can.</v>

1218
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:04.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could have Harvard is actually.</v>

1219
00:57:04.871 --> 00:57:07.570
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the longer you're letting them sprout.</v>

1220
00:57:07.571 --> 00:57:09.970
<v Speaker 2>So I was just trying to maximize and </v>
<v Speaker 2>went more dense,</v>

1221
00:57:09.971 --> 00:57:14.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted to get my bang for my </v>

1222
00:57:14.971 --> 00:57:14.971
<v Speaker 2>buck.</v>

1223
00:57:14.971 --> 00:57:18.300
<v Speaker 2>But you can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have Harvard is harvested </v>

1224
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:18.300
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably like early,</v>

1225
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.030
<v Speaker 2>like three days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three and a half days.</v>

1226
00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually the longer you wait,</v>

1227
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:24.130
<v Speaker 2>the more you have to be careful with </v>
<v Speaker 2>contamination too.</v>

1228
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:29.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better probably even to harvest </v>

1229
00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:29.460
<v Speaker 2>them sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freeze them.</v>

1230
00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:29.740
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1231
00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:33.220
<v Speaker 2>no bacteria that way you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're safe.</v>

1232
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:35.530
<v Speaker 2>And you're just putting them in a ziploc</v>
<v Speaker 2>storage bags.</v>

1233
00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever vacuum seal things and </v>

1234
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:41.050
<v Speaker 2>freeze them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I should do that with me.</v>

1235
00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good idea.</v>

1236
00:57:42.701 --> 00:57:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1237
00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.640
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a good idea to do.</v>

1238
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1239
00:57:47.231 --> 00:57:49.840
<v Speaker 2>that's really intense stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other question that I wanted to have</v>

1240
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:55.250
<v Speaker 2>a talk to you about was when you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying schizophrenia and how so fewer </v>

1241
00:57:56.140 --> 00:58:01.060
<v Speaker 2>feign can prevent or somehow mitigate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the effects of schizophrenia.</v>

1242
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that there is a possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation between a lot of these </v>

1243
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:10.270
<v Speaker 2>mental health diseases and a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper nutrition?</v>

1244
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1245
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:17.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that a lack of proper nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a huge component of a lot of mental </v>

1246
00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:21.100
<v Speaker 2>diseases and psychological diseases in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

1247
00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1248
00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:27.780
<v Speaker 2>inflammation is now it's really been </v>
<v Speaker 2>identified as I caused playing a causal </v>

1249
00:58:30.281 --> 00:58:32.210
<v Speaker 2>role in depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1250
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.720
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1251
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:37.570
<v Speaker 2>so with the depression thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1252
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.160
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

1253
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:40.780
<v Speaker 2>here's kind of a funny story and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not that funny.</v>

1254
00:58:40.781 --> 00:58:43.810
<v Speaker 2>It's actually kind of eye opening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back in the,</v>

1255
00:58:43.811 --> 00:58:47.600
<v Speaker 2>so the CDC has estimated that about 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of,</v>

1256
00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:53.060
<v Speaker 2>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans are on some sort of </v>

1257
00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:53.060
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eleven percent.</v>

1258
00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the story behind that.</v>

1259
00:58:55.400 --> 00:59:00.400
<v Speaker 2>So crazy it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know several people that are on </v>

1260
00:59:00.671 --> 00:59:02.740
<v Speaker 2>them or have taken them or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1261
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:08.130
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the story behind that is kind of </v>

1262
00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:10.150
<v Speaker 2>interesting because back in like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early seventies,</v>

1263
00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:15.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these clinical trials were </v>

1264
00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.611
<v Speaker 2>being done on antidepressants with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that had depression and at that </v>

1265
00:59:17.981 --> 00:59:20.640
<v Speaker 2>time people that had depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1266
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.520
<v Speaker 2>that were involved in these trials</v>

1267
00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:26.360
<v Speaker 3>were people that were severely depressed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hospitalized,</v>

1268
00:59:26.361 --> 00:59:29.450
<v Speaker 3>so they were so depressed that they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been hospitalized for depression.</v>

1269
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know many people that had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospitalized for depression nowadays,</v>

1270
00:59:32.451 --> 00:59:37.451
<v Speaker 3>but so they were hospitalized for </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression and then they were given </v>

1271
00:59:37.451 --> 00:59:40.760
<v Speaker 3>either placebo or an depressant and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple trials.</v>

1272
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:44.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>FDA had reviewed these trials 70 percent</v>

1273
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:46.060
<v Speaker 3>of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the antidepressant.</v>

1274
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:51.130
<v Speaker 3>So the antidepressant worked in 70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the patients compared to 30 </v>

1275
00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:51.650
<v Speaker 3>percent of the patients were placebo </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked,</v>

1276
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:54.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy percent is pretty good if you're</v>

1277
00:59:54.621 --> 00:59:56.680
<v Speaker 3>comparing that to 30 percent in placebo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1278
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:58.610
<v Speaker 3>well that's efficacious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems to work.</v>

1279
00:59:58.611 --> 01:00:03.611
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What then happened after those trials </v>

1280
01:00:03.611 --> 01:00:05.300
<v Speaker 3>were done starting in the seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>

1281
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 3>is that the clinical diagnostic manual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called the dsm.</v>

1282
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:13.760
<v Speaker 3>At that time it was the DSM two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they changed all their,</v>

1283
01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their diagnosis,</v>

1284
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:17.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1285
01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 3>markers and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1286
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:23.180
<v Speaker 3>symptoms for depression and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>expanded it a great,</v>

1287
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:23.870
<v Speaker 3>great deal.</v>

1288
01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 3>And they then called depression major </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressive disorder.</v>

1289
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.850
<v Speaker 3>So it became this sort of like broader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1290
01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.760
<v Speaker 3>a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote,</v>

1291
01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:39.761
<v Speaker 3>where it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just these people that are </v>

1292
01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.981
<v Speaker 3>severely hospitalized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's people that are feeling depressed </v>

1293
01:00:41.981 --> 01:00:42.470
<v Speaker 3>and anxious and sad or what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1294
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:45.590
<v Speaker 3>it's just basically you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting a bigger group of people,</v>

1295
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:48.030
<v Speaker 3>which is probably a great opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1296
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 3>for a pharmaceutical company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when clinical trials were </v>

1297
01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.550
<v Speaker 3>repeated on this new population of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1298
01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:57.530
<v Speaker 3>so these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are clinical trials that were done</v>

1299
01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.970
<v Speaker 3>from like the eighties all the way up </v>
<v Speaker 3>until like the 2000 year,</v>

1300
01:01:01.971 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 3>2000 when those were reviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reviewed by the FDA.</v>

1301
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:11.140
<v Speaker 3>What was found was quite shocking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was that only 40 percent of people </v>

1302
01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.970
<v Speaker 3>were now responding to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants.</v>

1303
01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:17.000
<v Speaker 3>SSRI is other norepinephrine reuptake </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhibitors,</v>

1304
01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:20.450
<v Speaker 3>lots of whatever the standard of care is</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to 30 percent placebo.</v>

1305
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:25.690
<v Speaker 3>So now you're talking about only 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're performing only this </v>

1306
01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:27.800
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants performing only 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent better than placebo.</v>

1307
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1308
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:34.810
<v Speaker 3>something so clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that the antidepressants don't </v>

1309
01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.931
<v Speaker 3>ever work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that we are now over </v>

1310
01:01:37.931 --> 01:01:41.471
<v Speaker 3>prescribing them to people that you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>or have this major depressive disorder </v>

1311
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 3>and they're not working on people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't,</v>

1312
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1313
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:49.780
<v Speaker 3>the initial group of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like severely depressed and </v>

1314
01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:49.780
<v Speaker 3>hospitalized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1315
01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.020
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1316
01:01:51.021 --> 01:01:53.870
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big problem because they're,</v>

1317
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:58.871
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're prescribed like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just like,</v>

1318
01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I can't even believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1319
01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:03.080
<v Speaker 3>I just have so many personal stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People I know,</v>

1320
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have gone,</v>

1321
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:07.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going through some crisis and personal,</v>

1322
01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.740
<v Speaker 3>a divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1323
01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:15.070
<v Speaker 3>and also in their given you some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>center giving some crazy drug and they </v>

1324
01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:15.410
<v Speaker 3>changed the personality of the person.</v>

1325
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:17.540
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please get off of this.</v>

1326
01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1327
01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I said,</v>

1328
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:21.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not like they don't ever work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that,</v>

1329
01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:26.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think once the clinical diagnostic </v>

1330
01:02:26.991 --> 01:02:31.990
<v Speaker 3>book changed the whole procedure for </v>
<v Speaker 3>diagnosing depression and became major </v>

1331
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:36.441
<v Speaker 3>depressive order disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you're getting people </v>

1332
01:02:36.441 --> 01:02:36.510
<v Speaker 3>that are now like having just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1333
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:41.810
<v Speaker 3>whatever stressful event in their life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's making them a little depressed </v>

1334
01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:45.330
<v Speaker 3>the time which everyone's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced are now being given this </v>

1335
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:46.410
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant when they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>need it.</v>

1336
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:49.770
<v Speaker 3>And there are effects that are not good </v>
<v Speaker 3>with taking some of these,</v>

1337
01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a depressant.</v>

1338
01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:53.730
<v Speaker 3>So it was a big effect on Libido.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1339
01:02:53.731 --> 01:02:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Onto the lobby.</v>

1340
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:59.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people that have taken </v>

1341
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.670
<v Speaker 4>it where their sex drive just goes away.</v>

1342
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's actually a gene that's a gene </v>

1343
01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.550
<v Speaker 3>polymorphism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a variation in a gene that,</v>

1344
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:09.620
<v Speaker 3>that is linked to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people that have it have even more </v>

1345
01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.940
<v Speaker 3>severe effect where they really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really have like sexual dysfunction</v>

1346
01:03:11.941 --> 01:03:14.100
<v Speaker 3>and response to a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just shuts down.</v>

1347
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1348
01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:16.920
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen to everyone quite as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

1349
01:03:16.921 --> 01:03:21.921
<v Speaker 3>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a percentage of people that it </v>

1350
01:03:21.921 --> 01:03:21.921
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really affects.</v>

1351
01:03:21.921 --> 01:03:22.530
<v Speaker 3>And there's lots of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>

1352
01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:24.870
<v Speaker 3>it's changing your brain chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1353
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.050
<v Speaker 4>It's not exact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an inexact science.</v>

1354
01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:33.070
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of experimentation going </v>

1355
01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:34.921
<v Speaker 4>on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend of mine who had gone to </v>

1356
01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:37.651
<v Speaker 4>several doctors and they had prescribed </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of different things to him and </v>

1357
01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:41.881
<v Speaker 4>he was severely depressed and eventually</v>
<v Speaker 4>they gave up and he had to find a much </v>

1358
01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:45.700
<v Speaker 4>better doctor that his care,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his whatever his insurance package would</v>

1359
01:03:45.701 --> 01:03:49.180
<v Speaker 4>not pay for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And once you found that doctor,</v>

1360
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:54.390
<v Speaker 4>then the doctor was just more </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledgeable about what potential </v>

1361
01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:56.320
<v Speaker 4>different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1362
01:03:56.321 --> 01:03:57.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many different ones </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>

1363
01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.130
<v Speaker 4>but they got them on something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually worked.</v>

1364
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:05.180
<v Speaker 4>He's off it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took them awhile and then eventually </v>

1365
01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.070
<v Speaker 4>got happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then oddly enough,</v>

1366
01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 4>which is an interesting thing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>people always want to connect </v>

1367
01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.080
<v Speaker 4>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to say depression is a disease</v>

1368
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.390
<v Speaker 4>and they want to say it almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1369
01:04:16.391 --> 01:04:17.230
<v Speaker 4>you got herpes.</v>

1370
01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.370
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1371
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:19.060
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1372
01:04:19.061 --> 01:04:20.290
<v Speaker 4>you've got depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1373
01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:22.450
<v Speaker 4>well you need medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for him,</v>

1374
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:27.870
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the big factors in fixing </v>

1375
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.290
<v Speaker 4>everything was his own success,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his own personal success,</v>

1376
01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:31.150
<v Speaker 4>and then he became more happy and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

1377
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:35.870
<v Speaker 4>the medication helped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He became more successful and then as he</v>

1378
01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:40.871
<v Speaker 4>became eventually really successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he started to experience like a better </v>

1379
01:04:40.871 --> 01:04:42.880
<v Speaker 4>quality of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was happier,</v>

1380
01:04:42.881 --> 01:04:47.881
<v Speaker 4>he was more confident and then he slowly</v>
<v Speaker 4>weaned himself off and now he has no </v>

1381
01:04:47.881 --> 01:04:51.631
<v Speaker 4>need for them to mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is so fascinating because so we're </v>

1382
01:04:51.631 --> 01:04:53.560
<v Speaker 4>not talking about necessarily a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he does not have cancer.</v>

1383
01:04:53.561 --> 01:04:55.870
<v Speaker 4>It's not like that they cured him of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

1384
01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:01.260
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a blanket that was keeping him </v>

1385
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:01.260
<v Speaker 4>warm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1386
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:05.821
<v Speaker 4>it was something that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was allowing him to bridge the gap </v>

1387
01:05:05.821 --> 01:05:08.590
<v Speaker 4>between an unhealthy mental state and </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy mental state.</v>

1388
01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:11.680
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of that health had to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>his own life.</v>

1389
01:05:11.681 --> 01:05:13.120
<v Speaker 4>He still eats like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1390
01:05:13.121 --> 01:05:16.450
<v Speaker 4>he's not like the healthiest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He eats a lot of fucking candy,</v>

1391
01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.360
<v Speaker 4>but a really healthy now as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 4>his mind,</v>

1392
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:22.090
<v Speaker 4>he's very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not lying,</v>

1393
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:23.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not faking it.</v>

1394
01:05:23.261 --> 01:05:25.300
<v Speaker 4>So to me it's always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1395
01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:26.380
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you know,</v>

1396
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:31.381
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to friends that have had </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good results with </v>

1397
01:05:31.381 --> 01:05:35.281
<v Speaker 4>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think there are some dark moments </v>

1398
01:05:35.281 --> 01:05:36.730
<v Speaker 4>in people's lives where that can kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>get them out of that,</v>

1399
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:42.150
<v Speaker 4>but then part of me doesn't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way to go because part of me </v>

1400
01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:42.760
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1401
01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:44.830
<v Speaker 4>well did you exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1402
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.010
<v Speaker 4>Did you take like really healthy foods?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1403
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Did you clean your life up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1404
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:52.270
<v Speaker 4>Did you like how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened here?</v>

1405
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:57.540
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these antidepressants do is they make </v>

1406
01:05:57.821 --> 01:06:00.910
<v Speaker 4>you not feel bad about stuff like about </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1407
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Like A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend who was on Zoloft and she</v>

1408
01:06:03.671 --> 01:06:05.830
<v Speaker 4>said like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she took it for a year and she's like,</v>

1409
01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:08.890
<v Speaker 4>I kind of lost a year of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't give a fuck about anything</v>

1410
01:06:08.891 --> 01:06:10.510
<v Speaker 4>during that year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like anything can happen.</v>

1411
01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.050
<v Speaker 4>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1412
01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 4>But that not giving a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1413
01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.170
<v Speaker 4>not feeling bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You also,</v>

1414
01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:22.650
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel great either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't feel like you don't feel like </v>

1415
01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:22.870
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good time to be alive.</v>

1416
01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.950
<v Speaker 4>Look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm healthy.</v>

1417
01:06:23.951 --> 01:06:24.740
<v Speaker 4>I can move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1418
01:06:24.741 --> 01:06:28.600
<v Speaker 4>like all those thoughts don't sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>come into play.</v>

1419
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like it dulls everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It dulls the highs and the dolls,</v>

1420
01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:33.910
<v Speaker 4>the lows and it keeps the pain away.</v>

1421
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:36.750
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not,</v>

1422
01:06:36.751 --> 01:06:40.110
<v Speaker 3>that's actually a symptom of depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called Hedonia or something</v>

1423
01:06:40.111 --> 01:06:44.070
<v Speaker 3>where someone's not really responsive to</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1424
01:06:44.071 --> 01:06:45.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1425
01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.640
<v Speaker 3>you just can't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1426
01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:49.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like excite them or,</v>

1427
01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:52.680
<v Speaker 3>or like make them super anxious either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just kind of like,</v>

1428
01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:58.490
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's actually kind of interesting </v>

1429
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:59.730
<v Speaker 3>that she was experiencing that while on </v>
<v Speaker 3>an antidepressant.</v>

1430
01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Will the results vary pretty widely?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

1431
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean with the same drugs,</v>

1432
01:07:04.651 --> 01:07:05.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1433
01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:05.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1434
01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.080
<v Speaker 4>Now is that because of biodiversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what,</v>

1435
01:07:08.081 --> 01:07:13.081
<v Speaker 4>what's causing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That you could take something and you </v>

1436
01:07:13.081 --> 01:07:15.630
<v Speaker 4>would have a totally different reaction?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can take something and it would just</v>

1437
01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:16.720
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:17.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1439
01:07:17.351 --> 01:07:22.351
<v Speaker 3>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we actually know really </v>

1440
01:07:22.351 --> 01:07:23.200
<v Speaker 3>why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we do know is that there are,</v>

1441
01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:25.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1442
01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:30.400
<v Speaker 3>we are different people and I've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>different genes that are regulating how </v>

1443
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.410
<v Speaker 3>much serotonin I making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much dope immune I'm making,</v>

1444
01:07:32.411 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 3>how much I'm metabolizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how quickly I'm metabolizing it than you</v>

1445
01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:38.980
<v Speaker 3>and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you like MP and this is,</v>

1446
01:07:38.981 --> 01:07:41.500
<v Speaker 3>this absolutely does affect how some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these drugs are,</v>

1447
01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:43.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're taken,</v>

1448
01:07:43.231 --> 01:07:48.231
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they are with their biological </v>

1449
01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:48.231
<v Speaker 3>effect is now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1450
01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:48.231
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

1451
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:49.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1452
01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.870
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely like a,</v>

1453
01:07:51.871 --> 01:07:56.871
<v Speaker 3>a genetic variation that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that affects the way our </v>

1454
01:07:56.871 --> 01:08:00.751
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitters are being fired away </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the way are I'm being metabolized.</v>

1455
01:08:00.971 --> 01:08:05.971
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're adding a drug that's changing </v>

1456
01:08:05.971 --> 01:08:06.460
<v Speaker 3>the way something's being metabolized </v>
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>

1457
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:08.920
<v Speaker 3>then it's gonna affect people </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently I think.</v>

1458
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but honestly,</v>

1459
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

1460
01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:13.830
<v Speaker 3>There's maybe like other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1461
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:15.620
<v Speaker 3>life situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1462
01:08:15.621 --> 01:08:18.950
<v Speaker 3>other dietary situations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things probably play a role,</v>

1463
01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:24.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the inflammation I was talking </v>

1464
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:24.320
<v Speaker 3>about actually playing a causal role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1465
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.990
<v Speaker 3>there've actually been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies were normal,</v>

1466
01:08:26.991 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 3>healthy people are injected with either </v>
<v Speaker 3>a placebo,</v>

1467
01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:32.800
<v Speaker 3>which is saline water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saltwater,</v>

1468
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:37.490
<v Speaker 3>or they're injected with something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>our gut produces called endotoxin.</v>

1469
01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Our gut produces it when our immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>cells in our gut attack the bacteria in </v>

1470
01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.010
<v Speaker 3>our gut because endotoxin is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 3>component of the bacterial cell membrane</v>

1471
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:50.420
<v Speaker 3>and that is released upon inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're eating a terrible diet,</v>

1472
01:08:50.421 --> 01:08:52.260
<v Speaker 3>lots of refined sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1473
01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:53.870
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually been shown,</v>

1474
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you release endotoxin and it causes </v>

1475
01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.571
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when people are injected with </v>

1476
01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:03.320
<v Speaker 3>endotoxin or they're injected with </v>
<v Speaker 3>proinflammatory cytokines,</v>

1477
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.870
<v Speaker 3>interferon gamma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we also make in our body,</v>

1478
01:09:05.871 --> 01:09:08.450
<v Speaker 3>when we're inflamed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people start to,</v>

1479
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:12.700
<v Speaker 3>at normal healthy people start to </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience feelings of depression.</v>

1480
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.890
<v Speaker 3>They start to feel depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxious,</v>

1481
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.070
<v Speaker 3>social withdraw.</v>

1482
01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:21.290
<v Speaker 3>People with the placebo did not </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that.</v>

1483
01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also they had elevated levels of other </v>

1484
01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:26.620
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory biomarkers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biomarkers in their blood.</v>

1485
01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.330
<v Speaker 3>So it really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just,</v>

1486
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:34.510
<v Speaker 3>this is causal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when we're talking about injecting </v>

1487
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:36.680
<v Speaker 3>in relation to inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden they're experiencing </v>

1488
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.741
<v Speaker 3>these depressive symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was actually people that were then </v>

1489
01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:39.410
<v Speaker 3>given.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the omega three fatty acids,</v>

1490
01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:44.411
<v Speaker 3>EPA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're given an actually a pretty high </v>

1491
01:09:44.411 --> 01:09:46.241
<v Speaker 3>dose of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was close to like two grams </v>

1492
01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:46.241
<v Speaker 3>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1493
01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:46.241
<v Speaker 3>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1494
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:48.170
<v Speaker 3>alleviated any of those symptoms so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1495
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:53.200
<v Speaker 3>So those people that were getting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory cytokine or the endotoxin </v>

1496
01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.440
<v Speaker 3>and the EPA did not experience those </v>
<v Speaker 3>symptoms.</v>

1497
01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:56.960
<v Speaker 3>So it was really like inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1498
01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.310
<v Speaker 3>driven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1499
01:09:58.311 --> 01:10:00.440
<v Speaker 3>these symptoms that were not experienced</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the placebo.</v>

1500
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's kind of,</v>

1501
01:10:02.001 --> 01:10:04.230
<v Speaker 3>and there's been multiple studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing this not,</v>

1502
01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just one studies,</v>

1503
01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.970
<v Speaker 3>multiple studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple studies.</v>

1504
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.680
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of like a new method people</v>

1505
01:10:09.681 --> 01:10:12.410
<v Speaker 3>are using to explore how inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 3>affects depression.</v>

1506
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:17.950
<v Speaker 3>It also has been shown the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenario where there's a placebo and </v>

1507
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:18.620
<v Speaker 3>they're injecting a inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>cytokine.</v>

1508
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Dopamine levels lower in the brains of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were injected with the </v>

1509
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 3>proinflammatory cytokines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not the saline water.</v>

1510
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.090
<v Speaker 3>And also the reward pathway in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

1511
01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:31.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is also decreased.</v>

1512
01:10:31.281 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1513
01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:33.410
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was mentioning,</v>

1514
01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.200
<v Speaker 3>you're not that excitable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

1515
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:37.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just kinda like and that,</v>

1516
01:10:37.161 --> 01:10:42.161
<v Speaker 3>and that was not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that did not happen in the placebo </v>

1517
01:10:42.161 --> 01:10:44.351
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was not just an effect of being </v>

1518
01:10:44.351 --> 01:10:44.351
<v Speaker 3>shot up with something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1519
01:10:44.351 --> 01:10:44.450
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1520
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:46.010
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1521
01:10:46.011 --> 01:10:47.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists have looked at some,</v>

1522
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.310
<v Speaker 3>some of the mechanisms and explored </v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

1523
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:53.240
<v Speaker 3>how is it that inflammation is affecting</v>
<v Speaker 3>dopamine in the brain?</v>

1524
01:10:53.241 --> 01:10:55.730
<v Speaker 3>How is it that it's effecting people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>mood?</v>

1525
01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.760
<v Speaker 3>It's thought now there's a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms.</v>

1526
01:10:58.761 --> 01:10:59.630
<v Speaker 3>One is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1527
01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:04.631
<v Speaker 3>these inflammatory cytokines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually cross the blood brain </v>

1528
01:11:04.631 --> 01:11:07.691
<v Speaker 3>barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the get into the brain and they disrupt </v>

1529
01:11:07.691 --> 01:11:10.720
<v Speaker 3>dopamine release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They disrupt serotonin release that </v>

1530
01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:10.720
<v Speaker 3>disrupt norepinephrine release,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1531
01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.920
<v Speaker 3>they're disrupting these </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitters being released.</v>

1532
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is that there's been </v>

1533
01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.860
<v Speaker 3>recently a discovered that the lymphatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>system is actually directly connected to</v>

1534
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:24.861
<v Speaker 3>the brain through the meninges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it was previously thought that </v>

1535
01:11:24.861 --> 01:11:27.861
<v Speaker 3>that was like cutoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brain was protected from the </v>

1536
01:11:27.861 --> 01:11:30.591
<v Speaker 3>lymphatic system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it turns out we were wrong in </v>

1537
01:11:30.591 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 3>everything that we learned in text books</v>
<v Speaker 3>for years and years and our science </v>

1538
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 3>classes was not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

1539
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:38.211
<v Speaker 3>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our lymphatic system is connected and </v>

1540
01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:38.211
<v Speaker 3>what that means is that our immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

1541
01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:43.040
<v Speaker 3>the chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inflammatory cytokines were </v>

1542
01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:43.040
<v Speaker 3>producing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1543
01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.670
<v Speaker 3>from our immune cells are getting into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain and disrupting </v>

1544
01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.010
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitter release and other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1545
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:55.010
<v Speaker 3>So there's obviously a really strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection to inflammation and </v>

1546
01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:58.200
<v Speaker 3>depression that's shown to be causal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you think about it,</v>

1547
01:11:58.201 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1548
01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 3>what causes inflammation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1549
01:12:00.571 --> 01:12:05.571
<v Speaker 3>well we can talk about the sugar stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's been shown eating a </v>

1550
01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:06.810
<v Speaker 3>terrible diet does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other thing that causes it,</v>

1551
01:12:06.811 --> 01:12:11.811
<v Speaker 3>and it's what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned that is a stressful event </v>

1552
01:12:11.811 --> 01:12:13.590
<v Speaker 3>in someone's life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an emotional event,</v>

1553
01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:14.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a breakup,</v>

1554
01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tragedy,</v>

1555
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.660
<v Speaker 3>work related stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social anxiety,</v>

1556
01:12:18.661 --> 01:12:23.661
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that causes you to release </v>

1557
01:12:23.661 --> 01:12:23.790
<v Speaker 3>cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress hormones,</v>

1558
01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:29.150
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things actually affect </v>

1559
01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:31.740
<v Speaker 3>inflammation in your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a two way street here.</v>

1560
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:34.800
<v Speaker 3>I think that previously you and I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about in other podcasts,</v>

1561
01:12:34.801 --> 01:12:38.180
<v Speaker 3>like how gut microbiome bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1562
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:43.220
<v Speaker 3>you can take microbiome bacteria from an</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxious mouse and transplanted into a </v>

1563
01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.610
<v Speaker 3>nonanxious mouse and make us anxious and</v>
<v Speaker 3>vice versa,</v>

1564
01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:44.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1565
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.200
<v Speaker 3>So there's like some sort of gut brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>access through with something called the</v>

1566
01:12:49.201 --> 01:12:50.350
<v Speaker 3>vagal nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1567
01:12:50.351 --> 01:12:55.351
<v Speaker 3>it goes both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go from the brain down to the </v>

1568
01:12:55.351 --> 01:12:55.351
<v Speaker 3>gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's been shown that like,</v>

1569
01:12:55.351 --> 01:12:57.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cortico releasing hormone,</v>

1570
01:12:57.511 --> 01:12:59.230
<v Speaker 3>which is a stress hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1571
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.580
<v Speaker 3>we get through the vagal nerve when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>release it,</v>

1572
01:13:02.581 --> 01:13:07.581
<v Speaker 3>goes into the gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It activates immune cells which then </v>

1573
01:13:07.581 --> 01:13:10.230
<v Speaker 3>activate other proteins in the gut that </v>
<v Speaker 3>chew up there called proteases.</v>

1574
01:13:10.231 --> 01:13:13.640
<v Speaker 3>They chew up the gut barrier and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you start to release more influent,</v>

1575
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:19.850
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which then like get in contact with </v>

1576
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.850
<v Speaker 3>bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more inflammation,</v>

1577
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:20.820
<v Speaker 3>and then it goes back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this feedback loop.</v>

1578
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:25.590
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's how stress also part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the mechanism,</v>

1579
01:13:25.591 --> 01:13:29.520
<v Speaker 3>how a stressful event and any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakup or tragedy,</v>

1580
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:32.370
<v Speaker 3>those sorts of things also cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>

1581
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:34.020
<v Speaker 3>They cause inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1582
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:39.910
<v Speaker 3>it's a totally off topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's one reason why people should </v>

1583
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:41.940
<v Speaker 3>never go and like get like blood work </v>
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>

1584
01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:46.590
<v Speaker 3>like like a day or two after some kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of traumatic event because get fired.</v>

1585
01:13:46.591 --> 01:13:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Don't get your blood work done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1586
01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:51.360
<v Speaker 3>Like do you not get your blood or break </v>
<v Speaker 3>up or whatever?</v>

1587
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they will like,</v>

1588
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:55.560
<v Speaker 3>it will skew everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1589
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

1590
01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:58.120
<v Speaker 4>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so amazing.</v>

1591
01:13:58.121 --> 01:14:01.960
<v Speaker 4>And when you discuss this and when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>lay all these facts out,</v>

1592
01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:07.140
<v Speaker 4>it makes it seem so irresponsible that </v>
<v Speaker 4>10 percent of the people are on this </v>

1593
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:08.380
<v Speaker 4>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eleven percent,</v>

1594
01:14:08.381 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are on this drug or whatever,</v>

1595
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:15.970
<v Speaker 4>a pet category of these drugs instead of</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with it.</v>

1596
01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:19.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean it seems like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1597
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:24.510
<v Speaker 4>we're in a weird place when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the holistic treatment of the human </v>

1598
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.580
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

1599
01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:28.000
<v Speaker 4>we're in a very weird place where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have all this information now,</v>

1600
01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:33.450
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't seem like it's being </v>
<v Speaker 4>applied when it comes to the average </v>

1601
01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:37.381
<v Speaker 4>person who is suffering the average </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who is dealing with the disease </v>

1602
01:14:37.381 --> 01:14:41.250
<v Speaker 4>or depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I guess you could call a disease </v>

1603
01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:45.120
<v Speaker 4>and it just seems so insane that with </v>
<v Speaker 4>all we know that we're treating it only </v>

1604
01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 4>with this chemical pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're only treating with a pill.</v>

1605
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:50.450
<v Speaker 4>This pharmacy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1606
01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:53.740
<v Speaker 4>this Pharma collage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>local solution to this,</v>

1607
01:14:53.741 --> 01:14:56.860
<v Speaker 4>which just seems so limited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upsetting.</v>

1608
01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.370
<v Speaker 3>It's so upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very upsetting.</v>

1609
01:14:59.371 --> 01:15:01.740
<v Speaker 3>I am like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a mission of mine,</v>

1610
01:15:01.741 --> 01:15:02.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1611
01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:08.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the problem is multifold </v>

1612
01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:08.740
<v Speaker 3>one is that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1613
01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:13.470
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrists and they're trained a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain way and people when their </v>

1614
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:17.061
<v Speaker 3>patients come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they expect that they're going to come </v>

1615
01:15:17.061 --> 01:15:17.061
<v Speaker 3>pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They come in because they want a pill.</v>

1616
01:15:17.061 --> 01:15:21.800
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come in because they don't want to </v>

1617
01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:21.800
<v Speaker 3>deal with it and they want a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1618
01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of a problem because they </v>

1619
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:29.250
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People need to understand that these </v>

1620
01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:29.250
<v Speaker 3>pills are not the magic bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just told you,</v>

1621
01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:33.531
<v Speaker 3>only 40 percent people are responding to</v>
<v Speaker 3>these antidepressants that are standard </v>

1622
01:15:33.531 --> 01:15:35.220
<v Speaker 3>of care compared to 30 percent that </v>
<v Speaker 3>respond to placebo.</v>

1623
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:38.440
<v Speaker 3>A sugar pill like that is ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1624
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:43.700
<v Speaker 3>So I think I would love if there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>some way to get a physician or I'm </v>

1625
01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:51.260
<v Speaker 3>usually their psychiatrist that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to for these sorts of problems to </v>

1626
01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.340
<v Speaker 3>like push someone to say you have to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>run,</v>

1627
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:55.770
<v Speaker 3>you know you're going to run six miles a</v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

1628
01:15:55.771 --> 01:15:57.210
<v Speaker 3>you're going to run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do that.</v>

1629
01:15:57.210 --> 01:15:59.330
<v Speaker 3>That is going to help you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1630
01:15:59.370 --> 01:16:00.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1631
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:02.160
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been shown.</v>

1632
01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.000
<v Speaker 3>It's been shown in multiple studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That exercise helps improve depression.</v>

1633
01:16:06.001 --> 01:16:11.001
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways it does it very </v>
<v Speaker 3>interestingly is that aerobic exercise </v>

1634
01:16:11.001 --> 01:16:13.860
<v Speaker 3>specifically has been shown that whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>serotonin pathway.</v>

1635
01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:17.400
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhibiting release of Serotonin.</v>

1636
01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inflammation affects serotonin.</v>

1637
01:16:19.861 --> 01:16:21.210
<v Speaker 3>And another way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah,</v>

1638
01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.090
<v Speaker 3>the precursor to Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin Tryptofan,</v>

1639
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.700
<v Speaker 3>when you have inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I said,</v>

1640
01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.120
<v Speaker 3>an emotional event causes inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have to be your sugar diet.</v>

1641
01:16:30.121 --> 01:16:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are,</v>

1642
01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation can be caused by your,</v>

1643
01:16:33.211 --> 01:16:38.211
<v Speaker 3>your cortisol release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have that inflammation in your </v>

1644
01:16:38.341 --> 01:16:41.040
<v Speaker 3>body thinks that it needs to fight off </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1645
01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:42.480
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1646
01:16:42.481 --> 01:16:43.080
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1647
01:16:43.081 --> 01:16:44.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got foreign invader,</v>

1648
01:16:44.821 --> 01:16:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I need to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the trip to fan,</v>

1649
01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.940
<v Speaker 3>which usually is being transported into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain to make Serotonin,</v>

1650
01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:54.570
<v Speaker 3>which plays a role in how you feel it </v>
<v Speaker 3>plays a role in lots of brain functions,</v>

1651
01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.260
<v Speaker 3>then gets diverted into another pathway </v>
<v Speaker 3>because your body's like,</v>

1652
01:16:58.261 --> 01:16:59.700
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to feel good.</v>

1653
01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.220
<v Speaker 3>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to survive and need to live.</v>

1654
01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:07.610
<v Speaker 3>So the trip to fan gets converted into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole other pathway called </v>

1655
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:08.280
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which helps with.</v>

1656
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:14.290
<v Speaker 3>It means basically immune cells need it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a different immune cells needed to </v>

1657
01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:15.050
<v Speaker 3>make different types of immune cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your body is like,</v>

1658
01:17:15.051 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trip,</v>

1659
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:17.580
<v Speaker 3>your going to this other pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need more immune cell,</v>

1660
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.600
<v Speaker 3>blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is that the journey and </v>

1661
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.330
<v Speaker 3>then gets converted into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now what you have is you're depleting</v>

1662
01:17:23.331 --> 01:17:24.560
<v Speaker 3>your brain of Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

1663
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:25.460
<v Speaker 3>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1664
01:17:25.461 --> 01:17:30.461
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're not sick and if you have </v>

1665
01:17:30.461 --> 01:17:30.980
<v Speaker 3>chronic inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're chronically stressed,</v>

1666
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:36.250
<v Speaker 3>chronically eating a terrible diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you are going to constantly be </v>

1667
01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:40.181
<v Speaker 3>diverting the Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the trip to fan and his other </v>

1668
01:17:40.181 --> 01:17:42.911
<v Speaker 3>pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be depleting your </v>

1669
01:17:42.911 --> 01:17:42.911
<v Speaker 3>cranium Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1670
01:17:42.911 --> 01:17:43.250
<v Speaker 3>So that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a twofold problem.</v>

1671
01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:48.251
<v Speaker 3>Then that whole kind of yearning thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets converted into something called </v>

1672
01:17:48.251 --> 01:17:51.401
<v Speaker 3>quinolinic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which actually crosses over the blood </v>

1673
01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:53.771
<v Speaker 3>brain barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes a neurotoxin and also has been </v>

1674
01:17:53.771 --> 01:17:56.981
<v Speaker 3>shown to cause depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not only you're not getting </v>

1675
01:17:56.981 --> 01:17:56.981
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting this gnarly shit and your</v>

1676
01:17:56.981 --> 01:18:01.070
<v Speaker 3>brain that's not supposed to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an exercise.</v>

1677
01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:06.190
<v Speaker 3>It's been shown specifically aerobic </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise causes your muscle to soak up </v>

1678
01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:11.111
<v Speaker 3>the Kenyan running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually another precursor to it so </v>

1679
01:18:11.111 --> 01:18:12.800
<v Speaker 3>that it can't form quinolinic acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't form the,</v>

1680
01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:16.190
<v Speaker 3>the neurotoxin park part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1681
01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:19.160
<v Speaker 3>exercise also caused you to make to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes trip to fan.</v>

1682
01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Go into your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1683
01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:25.440
<v Speaker 3>it alleviates some of the competition </v>
<v Speaker 3>with branch chain amino acids like </v>

1684
01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:25.440
<v Speaker 3>leucine and lysine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leucine,</v>

1685
01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.330
<v Speaker 3>so that's another way it's doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million things,</v>

1686
01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:27.530
<v Speaker 3>brain derived neurotrophic factor.</v>

1687
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:32.530
<v Speaker 3>We talked about at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast that also plays a role in </v>

1688
01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:32.530
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping prevent depression,</v>

1689
01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:33.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so neurogenesis,</v>

1690
01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.680
<v Speaker 3>neurogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff that helps growing new </v>

1691
01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:38.680
<v Speaker 3>brain cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making new connections helps.</v>

1692
01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Helps you deal with stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you make it.</v>

1693
01:18:40.851 --> 01:18:45.851
<v Speaker 3>When you stress your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like there could be some sort </v>

1694
01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:48.881
<v Speaker 3>of a whole holistic approach like or </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinic that looks at all of these </v>

1695
01:18:48.881 --> 01:18:52.841
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks at all these factors and </v>

1696
01:18:52.841 --> 01:18:52.841
<v Speaker 3>prescribes instead of just prescribing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pill,</v>

1697
01:18:52.841 --> 01:18:57.610
<v Speaker 3>prescribes a very specific diet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise routine and maybe even </v>

1698
01:18:57.610 --> 01:19:02.021
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even something that the practices </v>

1699
01:19:02.021 --> 01:19:03.950
<v Speaker 3>or or or or enhances mindfulness or </v>
<v Speaker 3>promotes mindfulness.</v>

1700
01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Something that allows you to manage the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way you're viewing and taking in </v>

1701
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.160
<v Speaker 3>scenarios and scenes and events in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and then processing them in a more </v>

1702
01:19:15.321 --> 01:19:20.321
<v Speaker 3>healthy manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like all of these things would </v>

1703
01:19:20.321 --> 01:19:22.250
<v Speaker 3>be as effective or maybe more effective </v>
<v Speaker 3>than just a pill.</v>

1704
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you and I'm hopeful for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1705
01:19:24.981 --> 01:19:29.981
<v Speaker 3>I think that the more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of scientists that are </v>

1706
01:19:29.981 --> 01:19:32.750
<v Speaker 3>studying this now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's becoming very common to look</v>

1707
01:19:32.751 --> 01:19:34.820
<v Speaker 3>in the scientific literature and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and see,</v>

1708
01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:40.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists researching inflammation and </v>

1709
01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.271
<v Speaker 3>the role of inflammation and depression </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the role of exercise in helping </v>

1710
01:19:43.271 --> 01:19:43.610
<v Speaker 3>treat it and the role of other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1711
01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.360
<v Speaker 3>dietary and lifestyle factors in causing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and treating depression.</v>

1712
01:19:47.361 --> 01:19:49.520
<v Speaker 3>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1713
01:19:49.521 --> 01:19:54.521
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really am hopeful that in the near </v>

1714
01:19:54.521 --> 01:19:54.710
<v Speaker 3>future that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

1715
01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:58.520
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a multipronged approach</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's not just a magic pill.</v>

1716
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:01.380
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying that's not also going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be included in some,</v>

1717
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:04.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying I think,</v>

1718
01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.710
<v Speaker 3>I think the Diet lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation exercise,</v>

1719
01:20:07.711 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 3>if we</v>

1720
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:11.360
<v Speaker 2>could just get that into like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1721
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:16.500
<v Speaker 2>the clinical world and if people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated enough to realize this will </v>

1722
01:20:16.531 --> 01:20:19.080
<v Speaker 2>really help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it really will.</v>

1723
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:22.170
<v Speaker 2>People will be so much happier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

1724
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I really think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>

1725
01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:25.890
<v Speaker 2>people just don't want to fuck an </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>

1726
01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:28.200
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would so much rather go to a doctor</v>

1727
01:20:28.201 --> 01:20:29.690
<v Speaker 2>and get a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1728
01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:32.100
<v Speaker 2>it's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people.</v>

1729
01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this fear of discomfort.</v>

1730
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:39.420
<v Speaker 2>People have this extreme feeling in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their mind,</v>

1731
01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:41.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to their associations with</v>

1732
01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to avoid discomfort.</v>

1733
01:20:44.581 --> 01:20:49.581
<v Speaker 2>They feel like any type of exercise is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like something to be avoided.</v>

1734
01:20:50.071 --> 01:20:51.570
<v Speaker 2>That's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

1735
01:20:51.571 --> 01:20:53.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to strain.</v>

1736
01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:58.460
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of times this association that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have is about the beginnings of </v>

1737
01:20:58.460 --> 01:20:58.800
<v Speaker 2>getting in shape.</v>

1738
01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not about once you're actually fit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because once you're actually fit,</v>

1739
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:03.630
<v Speaker 2>exercise is something you look forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1740
01:21:03.631 --> 01:21:05.250
<v Speaker 2>It's an alleviation of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1741
01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.400
<v Speaker 2>it feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I can't get a workout in,</v>

1742
01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:09.750
<v Speaker 2>I look at my schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1743
01:21:09.751 --> 01:21:10.380
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

1744
01:21:10.381 --> 01:21:15.381
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any time for a workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means I'm not going to get that </v>

1745
01:21:15.381 --> 01:21:15.720
<v Speaker 2>good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so instead of looking at it like,</v>

1746
01:21:15.721 --> 01:21:17.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to go grunt and sweat,</v>

1747
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking I'm not going to feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to feel relaxed,</v>

1748
01:21:21.721 --> 01:21:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to feel carefree and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to feel even appreciative,</v>

1749
01:21:25.421 --> 01:21:30.421
<v Speaker 2>like my appreciation of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it gets enhanced greatly after </v>

1750
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:31.980
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel better.</v>

1751
01:21:31.981 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I can take things in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they are rather than,</v>

1752
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the sensory data that I'm </v>

1753
01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.960
<v Speaker 2>getting from any event is just one more </v>
<v Speaker 2>distraction that gets in my way.</v>

1754
01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1755
01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:48.480
<v Speaker 2>that that's a lot of times how I look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>things if I'm overstressed or if I'm </v>

1756
01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.440
<v Speaker 2>working too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally beautifully put.</v>

1757
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that,</v>

1758
01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:55.820
<v Speaker 2>that that's exactly like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least what's been shown from like </v>

1759
01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.431
<v Speaker 2>neuro imaging studies is that exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>does what you're talking about is that </v>

1760
01:21:58.431 --> 01:22:02.781
<v Speaker 2>executive function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about feeling good </v>

1761
01:22:02.781 --> 01:22:03.350
<v Speaker 2>without that sensory stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the Amygdala,</v>

1762
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.360
<v Speaker 2>the emotional center that's been shown </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be decreased in activity after </v>

1763
01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.060
<v Speaker 2>exercise where the executive function is</v>
<v Speaker 2>increased.</v>

1764
01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:10.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1765
01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:12.330
<v Speaker 2>it's done exactly in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

1766
01:22:12.331 --> 01:22:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

1767
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:18.680
<v Speaker 2>you're able to logically think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this more and you feel good and it's </v>

1768
01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.280
<v Speaker 2>like you're not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sensory response that like gut,</v>

1769
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:26.870
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel it as much that that part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your brain is actually quieter after </v>

1770
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:27.720
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meditation does a similar thing,</v>

1771
01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:32.000
<v Speaker 2>but if there was just a way to get this </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge to,</v>

1772
01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.280
<v Speaker 2>to pay for people to understand people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are adverse to exercising,</v>

1773
01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:37.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was just some way,</v>

1774
01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:42.560
<v Speaker 2>and I'm really trying to find a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are many people that I </v>

1775
01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:45.621
<v Speaker 2>care about in my life that are that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that feel depressed and are on some </v>

1776
01:22:47.401 --> 01:22:52.401
<v Speaker 2>sort of know antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't really work for them </v>

1777
01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:52.470
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>

1778
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:58.070
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm trying to find a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like how like I can tell them I'm </v>

1779
01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:00.450
<v Speaker 2>having this conversation with you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get it because you experience it,</v>

1780
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.340
<v Speaker 2>you exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1781
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1782
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:05.100
<v Speaker 2>you eat healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you experienced these things.</v>

1783
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>But for someone that's</v>

1784
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:10.070
<v Speaker 4>never experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you communicate it to the.</v>

1785
01:23:10.071 --> 01:23:12.280
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard for people to start </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything new.</v>

1786
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:17.430
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for people to start a pottery </v>

1787
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.740
<v Speaker 4>class that's not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1788
01:23:17.741 --> 01:23:22.741
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to be involved with any </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical pain or any stress or any </v>

1789
01:23:22.741 --> 01:23:23.200
<v Speaker 4>exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

1790
01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.290
<v Speaker 4>there's not that feeling that you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're really tired,</v>

1791
01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:31.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the feeling that you get for me is </v>

1792
01:23:31.291 --> 01:23:32.140
<v Speaker 4>particularly difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doing boring stuff like on an elliptical</v>

1793
01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:34.390
<v Speaker 4>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like elliptical machine to me.</v>

1794
01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a great workout.</v>

1795
01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:41.911
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome if I'm at a gym because if </v>
<v Speaker 4>I go to a gym like at a hotel and you </v>

1796
01:23:41.911 --> 01:23:43.300
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have some bullshit weights and,</v>

1797
01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:44.830
<v Speaker 4>but they have an elliptical machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1798
01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:47.770
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this thing has a high setting,</v>

1799
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.920
<v Speaker 4>I could get a real workout on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those times when you're tired and </v>

1800
01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.550
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so fucking boring.</v>

1801
01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:58.900
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to listen to something.</v>

1802
01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 4>You have to watch something like others </v>
<v Speaker 4>stimuli has to come in,</v>

1803
01:24:02.411 --> 01:24:07.411
<v Speaker 4>in order to get you pumped up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I know this because I've done it a </v>

1804
01:24:07.411 --> 01:24:11.460
<v Speaker 4>thousand times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for someone who hasn't done it a </v>

1805
01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:11.460
<v Speaker 4>thousand times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1806
01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:12.040
<v Speaker 4>they get to that point like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck this,</v>

1807
01:24:12.041 --> 01:24:13.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1808
01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:15.100
<v Speaker 4>let me get a donut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1809
01:24:15.101 --> 01:24:15.970
<v Speaker 4>give me a coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

1810
01:24:15.971 --> 01:24:17.820
<v Speaker 4>Go outside and smoke a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

1811
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:18.910
<v Speaker 4>I feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1812
01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:24.040
<v Speaker 4>and it's so hard to get past that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we have all these connections in</v>

1813
01:24:24.071 --> 01:24:27.250
<v Speaker 4>our mind when it comes to comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comfort and stress,</v>

1814
01:24:27.251 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 4>comfort and like our bodies for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>

1815
01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people,</v>

1816
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:36.220
<v Speaker 4>their associations are to avoid anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's uncomfortable.</v>

1817
01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:41.400
<v Speaker 4>But it's so illogical because when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at comfort and you look at success </v>

1818
01:24:42.521 --> 01:24:47.521
<v Speaker 4>and progress and the eventual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the feelings of accomplishment and of </v>

1819
01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:52.180
<v Speaker 4>getting past certain hurdles and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of like how you feel about life,</v>

1820
01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.820
<v Speaker 4>a lot of those are connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>discomfort.</v>

1821
01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:59.140
<v Speaker 4>Discomfort is your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is like discomfort and,</v>

1822
01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:04.510
<v Speaker 4>and not being happy and content with </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain situations in life or certain </v>

1823
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:06.940
<v Speaker 4>feelings in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are massive,</v>

1824
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 4>massive motivators and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're amazing at,</v>

1825
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:16.620
<v Speaker 4>at facilitating change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet our instinct is to avoid those </v>

1826
01:25:17.261 --> 01:25:22.261
<v Speaker 4>and just sit on the couch and watch some</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking reality show about dudes and </v>

1827
01:25:22.261 --> 01:25:25.420
<v Speaker 4>make moonshine with our jaw open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's bizarre.</v>

1828
01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:26.950
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too much,</v>

1829
01:25:26.951 --> 01:25:31.951
<v Speaker 4>too much of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like stimuli or where you don't have to </v>

1830
01:25:31.951 --> 01:25:32.710
<v Speaker 4>do anything and you can still like get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get that sensory information.</v>

1831
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:38.590
<v Speaker 4>The need to act like to need to actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>go out there and act is so strong.</v>

1832
01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:43.450
<v Speaker 4>It's such an important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yet we resisted many people.</v>

1833
01:25:43.451 --> 01:25:44.590
<v Speaker 4>I know you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1834
01:25:44.591 --> 01:25:47.290
<v Speaker 4>but so many people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I feel the thing,</v>

1835
01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:48.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1836
01:25:48.370 --> 01:25:52.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't allow it to work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel that fuck this,</v>

1837
01:25:52.091 --> 01:25:53.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel it all the time.</v>

1838
01:25:53.861 --> 01:25:58.861
<v Speaker 4>Almost every time before I work out I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have at least an inclination of blow it </v>

1839
01:25:58.861 --> 01:26:00.850
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't ever embrace it,</v>

1840
01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.220
<v Speaker 4>but it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's there with everybody.</v>

1841
01:26:03.570 --> 01:26:08.570
<v Speaker 4>Like no one is like completely 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent healthy and without any </v>

1842
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.960
<v Speaker 4>resistance.</v>

1843
01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if also that has.</v>

1844
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:12.640
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about this being a super </v>
<v Speaker 3>ager.</v>

1845
01:26:12.641 --> 01:26:16.170
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if there is some association.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were,</v>

1846
01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're looking at,</v>

1847
01:26:17.770 --> 01:26:22.030
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at how it's important to </v>
<v Speaker 3>push past that uncomfortableness,</v>

1848
01:26:22.031 --> 01:26:25.660
<v Speaker 3>whether it's physical or mental and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's linked to being a super ager,</v>

1849
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:30.870
<v Speaker 3>but what if it's just like the ability </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make yourself do that is important </v>

1850
01:26:30.941 --> 01:26:31.540
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1851
01:26:31.541 --> 01:26:34.840
<v Speaker 3>It's not just the act that you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just the strenuous exercise,</v>

1852
01:26:34.930 --> 01:26:37.960
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously good and we know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good from science,</v>

1853
01:26:37.961 --> 01:26:40.840
<v Speaker 3>but what if it's just being able to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>push yourself.</v>

1854
01:26:40.841 --> 01:26:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe some people don't have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability for whatever reason or they just</v>

1855
01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.120
<v Speaker 3>haven't tapped into it enough because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't really experienced it.</v>

1856
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.860
<v Speaker 3>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a learned thing,</v>

1857
01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:53.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if I take time off,</v>

1858
01:26:53.111 --> 01:26:58.111
<v Speaker 4>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got sick recently and I couldn't work </v>

1859
01:26:58.111 --> 01:27:00.580
<v Speaker 4>out for like a week or six days or so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

1860
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:06.030
<v Speaker 4>the act of getting back into the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of ways we rely on </v>

1861
01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:10.801
<v Speaker 4>momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We rely on the momentum of past </v>

1862
01:27:10.801 --> 01:27:12.760
<v Speaker 4>experiences where you're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>conditioned to do that.</v>

1863
01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:17.260
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things that you do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>for me at least when I get,</v>

1864
01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.320
<v Speaker 4>when I would get like really disciplined</v>
<v Speaker 4>and really I get really consistent with </v>

1865
01:27:23.591 --> 01:27:25.930
<v Speaker 4>my workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I feel,</v>

1866
01:27:25.931 --> 01:27:30.931
<v Speaker 4>I almost feel momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's like a push behind </v>

1867
01:27:30.931 --> 01:27:30.931
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1868
01:27:30.931 --> 01:27:31.420
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1869
01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:32.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like after I get out of the gym,</v>

1870
01:27:32.741 --> 01:27:33.940
<v Speaker 4>I have a really good workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1871
01:27:33.941 --> 01:27:35.140
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'm doing it.</v>

1872
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:40.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing it all the time now and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking forward to the next time and it </v>

1873
01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:43.411
<v Speaker 4>makes that resistance much weaker and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes my motivation and my discipline </v>

1874
01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:44.680
<v Speaker 4>much stronger.</v>

1875
01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:48.460
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of it is based on just the</v>
<v Speaker 4>consistency,</v>

1876
01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the things that I talked </v>

1877
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:53.600
<v Speaker 4>about recently on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1878
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:53.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blowing something off.</v>

1879
01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:58.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not just not good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like blowing off of an exercise that you</v>

1880
01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:02.350
<v Speaker 4>planned is not just bad for you </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically.</v>

1881
01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:06.940
<v Speaker 4>It's also bad mentally because then that</v>
<v Speaker 4>option is now available.</v>

1882
01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:12.060
<v Speaker 4>The option to fuck off is available and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you did it before and you're probably </v>

1883
01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.600
<v Speaker 4>going to do it again and you'll get </v>
<v Speaker 4>mediocre results,</v>

1884
01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:18.601
<v Speaker 4>not just in that aspect of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe in all aspects of your life </v>

1885
01:28:18.601 --> 01:28:20.500
<v Speaker 4>because I think that option to fuck off </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you embrace it,</v>

1886
01:28:20.501 --> 01:28:25.501
<v Speaker 4>that is a pathway that you might choose </v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to dealing with conflict </v>

1887
01:28:25.501 --> 01:28:27.160
<v Speaker 4>and your personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with business decisions,</v>

1888
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:31.630
<v Speaker 4>dealing with career decisions like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable decision that you might be</v>

1889
01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:36.930
<v Speaker 4>faced with where you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you need to make a change as far </v>

1890
01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:40.381
<v Speaker 4>as like what your pathway is in life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't do it instead you fuck </v>

1891
01:28:40.381 --> 01:28:42.910
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that the inclination to fuck off.</v>

1892
01:28:42.911 --> 01:28:47.260
<v Speaker 4>I think that gathers momentum as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The inclination to be disciplined.</v>

1893
01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.950
<v Speaker 4>That comes with momentum too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think both things like you,</v>

1894
01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:55.951
<v Speaker 4>did you take a path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the path of the healthy person or the </v>

1895
01:28:55.951 --> 01:28:59.611
<v Speaker 4>path of the fuck off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like both of them are available and </v>

1896
01:28:59.611 --> 01:28:59.611
<v Speaker 4>whichever path you embrace.</v>

1897
01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

1898
01:29:00.831 --> 01:29:02.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that um,</v>

1899
01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:06.510
<v Speaker 3>the same thing goes for like lying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you,</v>

1900
01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very bad to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even if it's something that is </v>

1901
01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:13.210
<v Speaker 3>really benign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what they call it,</v>

1902
01:29:13.211 --> 01:29:14.600
<v Speaker 3>a little tiny white light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1903
01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1904
01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:20.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because then you start making these </v>

1905
01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:21.960
<v Speaker 3>neural connections in your brain and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>start to like get used to doing it.</v>

1906
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Like you were saying and I think that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kind of dawned on me as you were </v>

1907
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:30.921
<v Speaker 3>saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that with the motivation and the </v>

1908
01:29:30.921 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 3>momentum you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the same way.</v>

1909
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I think you're like building these </v>
<v Speaker 3>neural pathways,</v>

1910
01:29:34.281 --> 01:29:39.281
<v Speaker 3>these motivation pathways and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's really important for that </v>

1911
01:29:39.281 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 3>momentum to do it again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1912
01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:45.051
<v Speaker 3>there's been some studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few of them that have been done where </v>

1913
01:29:45.051 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 3>you can take a person and do that direct</v>
<v Speaker 3>transcranial stimulation,</v>

1914
01:29:48.601 --> 01:29:53.601
<v Speaker 3>which I don't know much about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember these studies and </v>

1915
01:29:53.601 --> 01:29:57.230
<v Speaker 3>stimulate a certain part of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's involved in motivation and you </v>

1916
01:29:57.230 --> 01:29:58.980
<v Speaker 3>can motivate them to go to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you motivate them to actually go work</v>

1917
01:29:58.981 --> 01:29:59.810
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's good.</v>

1918
01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:04.830
<v Speaker 4>More of those electrodes and they put on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a specific area of the outside of your </v>

1919
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:08.431
<v Speaker 4>head and then it's like a little nine </v>
<v Speaker 4>volt batteries attached to it and it </v>

1920
01:30:08.431 --> 01:30:08.530
<v Speaker 4>just zaps you a little bit,</v>

1921
01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:14.060
<v Speaker 3>saps you a little bit and like activates</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain brain region and that brain </v>

1922
01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:17.791
<v Speaker 3>region.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's activating specifically with this </v>

1923
01:30:17.791 --> 01:30:19.861
<v Speaker 3>study I was talking about actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of them were involved </v>

1924
01:30:19.861 --> 01:30:21.730
<v Speaker 3>in motivation and that's probably with </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I.</v>

1925
01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:26.730
<v Speaker 3>We already have those pathways activated</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we are constantly forcing </v>

1926
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:27.910
<v Speaker 3>ourselves to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I feel the same way.</v>

1927
01:30:27.911 --> 01:30:29.350
<v Speaker 3>There are times I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1928
01:30:29.351 --> 01:30:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go for a run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like once you do it,</v>

1929
01:30:32.501 --> 01:30:34.570
<v Speaker 3>God damn me feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel great and you know what?</v>

1930
01:30:34.571 --> 01:30:39.571
<v Speaker 3>You accomplished something so it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>only like you're feeling great from all </v>

1931
01:30:39.571 --> 01:30:42.481
<v Speaker 3>the neural mechanisms that are being </v>
<v Speaker 3>activated and all the biochemistry </v>

1932
01:30:42.481 --> 01:30:43.360
<v Speaker 3>that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've accomplished something.</v>

1933
01:30:43.361 --> 01:30:48.361
<v Speaker 3>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You push past them and you didn't want </v>

1934
01:30:48.361 --> 01:30:50.221
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you feel good about doing that </v>

1935
01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:50.221
<v Speaker 3>after magnetic</v>

1936
01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:52.770
<v Speaker 4>stimulation therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wilmington woman finds motivation.</v>

1937
01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.800
<v Speaker 4>Energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1938
01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:58.120
<v Speaker 4>There's a a radio lab about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a radiolab podcast.</v>

1939
01:30:58.121 --> 01:31:01.540
<v Speaker 4>It's called nine volt nirvana and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty good.</v>

1940
01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:02.520
<v Speaker 4>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1941
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:05.830
<v Speaker 4>I love radio lab and it actually deals </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the first story.</v>

1942
01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:10.840
<v Speaker 4>The opening story is amazing because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>deals with this woman who went to this </v>

1943
01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.060
<v Speaker 4>like sniper training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>simulation video,</v>

1944
01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:18.610
<v Speaker 4>video thing that they do where they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put you in front,</v>

1945
01:31:18.611 --> 01:31:22.330
<v Speaker 4>they give you like a fake gun and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>put you in front of a video screen and a</v>

1946
01:31:22.331 --> 01:31:27.331
<v Speaker 4>scenario plays out and then the scenario</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a terrorist attack and you </v>

1947
01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:29.260
<v Speaker 4>have to take out the bad guys and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>did it with her and she was.</v>

1948
01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:32.080
<v Speaker 4>It's 20 minutes long and she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>

1949
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:34.810
<v Speaker 4>She fucked it all up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just like a disaster,</v>

1950
01:31:34.811 --> 01:31:36.280
<v Speaker 4>like she didn't respond correctly.</v>

1951
01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:41.400
<v Speaker 4>Then they put these electrodes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you exactly call them?</v>

1952
01:31:41.471 --> 01:31:42.970
<v Speaker 4>One of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's electrodes,</v>

1953
01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:48.120
<v Speaker 4>so they put these on her brain in the or</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the outside of her head in very </v>

1954
01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:52.171
<v Speaker 4>specific areas and stimulated it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then recreated it and in the recreation </v>

1955
01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:58.080
<v Speaker 4>she was 100 percent effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She killed all the bad guys and she went</v>

1956
01:31:58.151 --> 01:32:00.730
<v Speaker 4>through this 20 thing and when it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>

1957
01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:06.090
<v Speaker 4>when they told her that it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she thought they were fucking with her </v>

1958
01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:06.090
<v Speaker 4>because she thought it was only two </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>

1959
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.510
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1960
01:32:07.511 --> 01:32:11.590
<v Speaker 4>like every is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing the way she describes it as</v>

1961
01:32:11.591 --> 01:32:13.240
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1962
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a little scary too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1963
01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.230
<v Speaker 2>just because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>

1964
01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.170
<v Speaker 2>can you like program someone to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

1965
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:23.680
<v Speaker 2>There's another study that was published</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two years ago,</v>

1966
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:27.660
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trans cranial direct stimulation and um,</v>

1967
01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked him,</v>

1968
01:32:28.931 --> 01:32:33.931
<v Speaker 2>so not an expert on any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just remember this study because </v>

1969
01:32:33.931 --> 01:32:36.250
<v Speaker 2>it was trying to investigate what part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the brain's fault in consciousness.</v>

1970
01:32:36.370 --> 01:32:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she said that the study was </v>

1971
01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:43.831
<v Speaker 2>designed in such a way where she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading a book and then they zapped or </v>

1972
01:32:43.831 --> 01:32:46.060
<v Speaker 2>in a certain part of the brain and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped reading the book,</v>

1973
01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:49.990
<v Speaker 2>this woman and just looked at them like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Zombie,</v>

1974
01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.940
<v Speaker 2>like no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>

1975
01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:53.020
<v Speaker 2>no talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1976
01:32:53.021 --> 01:32:54.900
<v Speaker 2>And then they zapped your again and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>started right.</v>

1977
01:32:54.930 --> 01:32:59.930
<v Speaker 2>She picked up right where she left off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no recollection at all of doing.</v>

1978
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:02.390
<v Speaker 2>So this was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1979
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.900
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out if this part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain is involved in consciousness.</v>

1980
01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a little scary.</v>

1981
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1982
01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 2>that is</v>

1983
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:09.490
<v Speaker 4>real concern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1984
01:33:09.491 --> 01:33:14.491
<v Speaker 4>Because one of the things about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcranial direct stimulation of </v>

1985
01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:18.910
<v Speaker 4>Radiolab podcast was that they talked </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how many people are out there just</v>

1986
01:33:18.911 --> 01:33:23.911
<v Speaker 4>fucking experimenting where there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole community online where people are </v>

1987
01:33:23.911 --> 01:33:28.351
<v Speaker 4>talking about like experimenting with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the voltages and experimenting with the </v>

1988
01:33:28.351 --> 01:33:30.760
<v Speaker 4>placement and one guy did something is </v>
<v Speaker 4>lost his sense of taste like,</v>

1989
01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:36.020
<v Speaker 4>but people are buying these and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it like you can go.</v>

1990
01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like you'd go to fucking radio lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The consequences of a world where anyone</v>

1991
01:33:41.981 --> 01:33:45.430
<v Speaker 4>with $20 in access to radio shack and </v>
<v Speaker 4>make their own brains Zapper.</v>

1992
01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

1993
01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:49.330
<v Speaker 4>is that from radiolab?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're their podcast page.</v>

1994
01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing because there's apparently </v>

1995
01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:55.750
<v Speaker 4>this gigantic community of it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on a second,</v>

1996
01:33:55.751 --> 01:33:57.310
<v Speaker 4>go back up there and make that larger </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1997
01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:01.190
<v Speaker 4>The last couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Itd tdcs,</v>

1998
01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:06.130
<v Speaker 4>trans direct cranial stimulation has </v>
<v Speaker 4>been all over the news.</v>

1999
01:34:06.131 --> 01:34:09.220
<v Speaker 4>Researchers claim that juicing the brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>with just 2 million amps,</v>

2000
01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:14.670
<v Speaker 4>nine volt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but think nine volt battery battery can </v>

2001
01:34:14.670 --> 01:34:15.370
<v Speaker 4>help with everything from learning </v>
<v Speaker 4>languages to quitting smoking,</v>

2002
01:34:15.371 --> 01:34:20.371
<v Speaker 4>to overcoming depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they brought it into a </v>

2003
01:34:20.371 --> 01:34:23.530
<v Speaker 4>neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Weiss and at Wright State </v>

2004
01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:23.980
<v Speaker 4>Research Institute into the studio to </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell them how it works.</v>

2005
01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.360
<v Speaker 4>Really interesting.</v>

2006
01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2007
01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:31.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like in terms of like treating </v>

2008
01:34:31.961 --> 01:34:32.930
<v Speaker 2>depression or helping people get </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated to go to the gym,</v>

2009
01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:35.060
<v Speaker 2>it may really have relevance,</v>

2010
01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:39.770
<v Speaker 4>but it also might be like slapping a </v>
<v Speaker 4>supercharger on an old chevy</v>

2011
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:42.260
<v Speaker 2>below the fucking engine on the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2012
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:43.280
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2013
01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really,</v>

2014
01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:47.240
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really know enough about what's</v>

2015
01:34:47.241 --> 01:34:52.241
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly wouldn't be experimenting </v>

2016
01:34:52.241 --> 01:34:52.241
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>

2017
01:34:52.241 --> 01:34:52.241
<v Speaker 2>Now let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

2018
01:34:52.241 --> 01:34:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about going to radio shack </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio shack right after I get outta </v>

2019
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:57.170
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really,</v>

2020
01:34:57.171 --> 01:34:57.920
<v Speaker 2>but sort of.</v>

2021
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just interesting.</v>

2022
01:34:59.570 --> 01:34:59.840
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2023
01:34:59.841 --> 01:35:04.841
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing that we are really some </v>

2024
01:35:04.841 --> 01:35:07.580
<v Speaker 4>sort of a system and you can choose that</v>
<v Speaker 4>system like electricity here,</v>

2025
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.110
<v Speaker 4>a little vitamin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2026
01:35:09.330 --> 01:35:10.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little,</v>

2027
01:35:10.211 --> 01:35:12.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Broccoli sprouts here.</v>

2028
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:17.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the weirdest thing about people </v>

2029
01:35:17.290 --> 01:35:20.211
<v Speaker 4>and one of the weirdest things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>people is how variable we are depending </v>

2030
01:35:20.211 --> 01:35:22.940
<v Speaker 4>upon what we put inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we don't think of it that way.</v>

2031
01:35:22.941 --> 01:35:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time we think of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>as ourselves.</v>

2032
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you think of yourself as Rhonda</v>

2033
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:32.830
<v Speaker 4>Patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Rhonda Patrick relies on a bunch of </v>

2034
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:32.830
<v Speaker 4>fucking chemicals to be Rhonda Patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2035
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:37.721
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of stuff going on in </v>

2036
01:35:37.721 --> 01:35:37.721
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just,</v>

2037
01:35:37.721 --> 01:35:39.740
<v Speaker 4>it's not this one like this is a laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2038
01:35:39.741 --> 01:35:43.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm not adding shit to this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I can put programs in it and stuff.</v>

2039
01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:45.230
<v Speaker 4>But I mean this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything in there.</v>

2040
01:35:45.231 --> 01:35:46.640
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2041
01:35:46.641 --> 01:35:48.950
<v Speaker 4>there's a processor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a motherboard,</v>

2042
01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:53.951
<v Speaker 4>it's all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this junk is in place and the </v>

2043
01:35:53.951 --> 01:35:54.770
<v Speaker 4>electricity plugs into the back and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really variable.</v>

2044
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2045
01:35:55.771 --> 01:36:00.771
<v Speaker 4>the human body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So fucking variable and pliable and </v>

2046
01:36:00.771 --> 01:36:04.091
<v Speaker 4>malleable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many different things that </v>

2047
01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:05.920
<v Speaker 4>you can do to make yourself better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had this conversation with a </v>

2048
01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:09.431
<v Speaker 4>friend of mine who's a not a physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>fitness guy and he's kind of a realist </v>

2049
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:11.270
<v Speaker 4>and nihilist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you would say.</v>

2050
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:15.110
<v Speaker 4>I never say that word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just read it and he's,</v>

2051
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:20.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a little bit of a curmudgeon and </v>

2052
01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:20.140
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2053
01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:20.140
<v Speaker 4>what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2054
01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:23.150
<v Speaker 4>like really what is appointment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're always doing all his martial arts</v>

2055
01:36:23.151 --> 01:36:24.080
<v Speaker 4>and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2056
01:36:24.081 --> 01:36:27.470
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I could give you a pill and that pill</v>

2057
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:30.320
<v Speaker 4>would turn you essentially into a super </v>

<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2059
01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:34.180
<v Speaker 4>You could lift weights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't lift,</v>

2060
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 4>you could beat people up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could do physical fitness fits feats</v>

2061
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:44.200
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what you right now are totally </v>

2062
01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.530
<v Speaker 4>insurmountable and outside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility which take that pill.</v>

2063
01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.010
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2064
01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.600
<v Speaker 4>so simple.</v>

2065
01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:48.470
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't go.</v>

2066
01:36:48.471 --> 01:36:49.670
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2067
01:36:50.050 --> 01:36:55.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I could give you a pill that would </v>

2068
01:36:55.050 --> 01:36:57.941
<v Speaker 4>prevent you from being a decaying old </v>
<v Speaker 4>man and you could stay in the state you </v>

2069
01:36:57.941 --> 01:36:59.270
<v Speaker 4>are right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you take that?</v>

2070
01:36:59.630 --> 01:37:00.110
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2071
01:37:00.111 --> 01:37:01.550
<v Speaker 4>I probably would take that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2072
01:37:01.551 --> 01:37:03.700
<v Speaker 4>well that's how it feels like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Motherfucker.</v>

2073
01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:07.130
<v Speaker 4>Like that's how it feels like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're a decaying old man,</v>

2074
01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's not much.</v>

2075
01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:12.080
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a year older than me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he looks like he's 50 years old.</v>

2076
01:37:12.081 --> 01:37:17.081
<v Speaker 4>I mean he made his body's all humped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's cute legs go ponch it doesn't have </v>

2077
01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:17.780
<v Speaker 4>any muscle tone.</v>

2078
01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:18.620
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2079
01:37:18.650 --> 01:37:22.340
<v Speaker 4>all of that is just physical fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not broken.</v>

2080
01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Like there's nothing wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you got on like a steady yoga </v>

2081
01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:31.421
<v Speaker 4>routine and started doing some </v>
<v Speaker 4>resistance training and started maybe </v>

2082
01:37:31.421 --> 01:37:32.060
<v Speaker 4>swimming or something like that a year </v>
<v Speaker 4>from now,</v>

2083
01:37:32.061 --> 01:37:33.830
<v Speaker 4>you would have a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>

2084
01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:35.210
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so talking to me,</v>

2085
01:37:35.211 --> 01:37:38.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done it my whole life.</v>

2086
01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:41.990
<v Speaker 4>So like stuff that I can do stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't think is possible.</v>

2087
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:46.300
<v Speaker 4>And to me it's like two times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three times a week I do that stuff like,</v>

2088
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:51.310
<v Speaker 4>this is not like your body is like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>race car that you can juice up yourself.</v>

2089
01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:55.950
<v Speaker 4>Like you can add the fat tires,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can add the improved suspension,</v>

2090
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 4>you can beef up the horsepower in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>engine,</v>

2091
01:37:58.111 --> 01:38:03.111
<v Speaker 4>you could do all that yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or You could just choose to have this </v>

2092
01:38:03.111 --> 01:38:04.140
<v Speaker 4>shitty body that's always fallen apart </v>
<v Speaker 4>on you.</v>

2093
01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:06.610
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>

2094
01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:08.900
<v Speaker 3>you and I are both choosing to do as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2095
01:38:08.901 --> 01:38:13.901
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're both kind of obsessed with </v>

2096
01:38:13.901 --> 01:38:13.901
<v Speaker 3>nutrition and aging and being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2097
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:18.950
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as optimal as we can in terms of our </v>

2098
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:21.241
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately what we are doing is </v>

2099
01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:22.380
<v Speaker 3>delaying the aging process by switching </v>
<v Speaker 3>on all these switches and like,</v>

2100
01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise and getting all the </v>

2101
01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.171
<v Speaker 3>micronutrients and avoiding the refined </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar which is causing inflammation and,</v>

2102
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:34.450
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really because that stuff is </v>

2103
01:38:34.450 --> 01:38:35.090
<v Speaker 3>part of the aging process and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerates the aging process.</v>

2104
01:38:35.091 --> 01:38:38.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I don't think people that don't do</v>

2105
01:38:38.181 --> 01:38:42.230
<v Speaker 3>this stuff realize that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just about looking good,</v>

2106
01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:47.290
<v Speaker 3>it's about aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about like being older and being </v>

2107
01:38:47.290 --> 01:38:51.821
<v Speaker 3>fit and being mentally sharp and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>being degenerate and decrepit and how.</v>

2108
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how awful would that be?</v>

2109
01:38:54.891 --> 01:38:56.840
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like 60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is young.</v>

2110
01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean 60 is still young and to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2111
01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:01.180
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Broken,</v>

2112
01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:03.170
<v Speaker 3>which is really common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super common,</v>

2113
01:39:03.171 --> 01:39:05.330
<v Speaker 3>especially for sedentary people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2114
01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:10.370
<v Speaker 3>It's under Ip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most sedentary people are people that </v>

2115
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:12.821
<v Speaker 3>also choose to eat terrible diets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like not only are they </v>

2116
01:39:12.821 --> 01:39:17.411
<v Speaker 3>sedentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also eating crappy food and not </v>

2117
01:39:17.411 --> 01:39:20.720
<v Speaker 3>getting all the nutrients they need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just like this mega explosion,</v>

2118
01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.430
<v Speaker 3>dynamite of just bad</v>

2119
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:27.870
<v Speaker 4>increasing inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think intelligent people like my </v>

2120
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:31.071
<v Speaker 4>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is intelligent and I think he </v>

2121
01:39:31.071 --> 01:39:33.381
<v Speaker 4>connects vanity with those things and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks vanities for fools and he thinks </v>

2122
01:39:33.381 --> 01:39:34.230
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2123
01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:37.890
<v Speaker 4>it's a trait that he finds </v>
<v Speaker 4>reprehensible.</v>

2124
01:39:37.891 --> 01:39:40.500
<v Speaker 4>He just doesn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sees people that are,</v>

2125
01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:43.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2126
01:39:43.141 --> 01:39:47.610
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's flashy clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's the way they wear their hair,</v>

2127
01:39:47.611 --> 01:39:49.560
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is he thinks is </v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous.</v>

2128
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:52.230
<v Speaker 4>He connects that with physical fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2129
01:39:52.231 --> 01:39:57.231
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's your vehicle and it's like how </v>

2130
01:39:57.231 --> 01:39:57.960
<v Speaker 4>you get through this life and it's how </v>
<v Speaker 4>you think it's,</v>

2131
01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:03.020
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so many different things that are </v>

2132
01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:04.941
<v Speaker 4>all connected into one super organism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the life that you're living.</v>

2133
01:40:05.991 --> 01:40:06.540
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2134
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:08.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2135
01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:13.710
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody knows now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not something we grew up </v>

2136
01:40:13.710 --> 01:40:16.941
<v Speaker 4>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody knows now about your gut </v>

2137
01:40:16.941 --> 01:40:16.941
<v Speaker 4>biome.</v>

2138
01:40:16.941 --> 01:40:19.820
<v Speaker 4>This is a really huge factor in how you </v>
<v Speaker 4>exist as an organism or as maybe even an</v>

2139
01:40:21.991 --> 01:40:25.230
<v Speaker 4>organism is the wrong word because we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially ecosystems,</v>

2140
01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:26.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're,</v>

2141
01:40:26.281 --> 01:40:31.281
<v Speaker 4>we're in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This weird consciousness that has all </v>

2142
01:40:31.281 --> 01:40:34.551
<v Speaker 4>this resistance and has all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>inclination towards comfort and fucking </v>

2143
01:40:34.551 --> 01:40:38.751
<v Speaker 4>off and blowing things off is what is in</v>
<v Speaker 4>charge of making all these things happen</v>

2144
01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:44.300
<v Speaker 4>that keep this ecosystem healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like if earth itself had </v>

2145
01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:46.500
<v Speaker 4>like a shitty manager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2146
01:40:46.501 --> 01:40:50.610
<v Speaker 4>if like there was a manager of a natural</v>
<v Speaker 4>manager of earth that was like,</v>

2147
01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who cares if it rains?</v>

2148
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2149
01:40:55.901 --> 01:40:57.280
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's let you know I'm,</v>

2150
01:40:57.310 --> 01:41:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop growing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit anymore.</v>

2151
01:41:00.161 --> 01:41:03.490
<v Speaker 2>It's all stupid anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's literally like the,</v>

2152
01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:05.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just blow it out.</v>

2153
01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just kill all the life.</v>

2154
01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 2>It's all going to die eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2155
01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.920
<v Speaker 2>the sun only lasts 7 billion years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see that is the perspective a lot of </v>

2156
01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.930
<v Speaker 2>people take with aging where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2157
01:41:16.931 --> 01:41:18.340
<v Speaker 2>you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to age.</v>

2158
01:41:18.341 --> 01:41:20.050
<v Speaker 2>You can't stop aging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2159
01:41:20.051 --> 01:41:21.040
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2160
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:24.850
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is to age better.</v>

2161
01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is to increase your health </v>

2162
01:41:30.170 --> 01:41:30.170
<v Speaker 2>span,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2163
01:41:30.170 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know is possible.</v>

2164
01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Like that can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>

2165
01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:37.110
<v Speaker 2>there's some of these centenarians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Supercentenarians I've seen that are </v>

2166
01:41:37.110 --> 01:41:37.250
<v Speaker 2>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2167
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:42.270
<v Speaker 2>over 100 years old and they're like </v>
<v Speaker 2>riding bikes and racing and it's like </v>

2168
01:41:42.370 --> 01:41:43.390
<v Speaker 2>they're old.</v>

2169
01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:46.030
<v Speaker 2>They are very old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're experiencing a very good quality</v>

2170
01:41:46.031 --> 01:41:51.031
<v Speaker 2>of life and experiencing a quality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life that these other people that don't </v>

2171
01:41:51.031 --> 01:41:55.741
<v Speaker 2>exercise feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They physically feel their own body </v>

2172
01:41:55.741 --> 01:41:56.590
<v Speaker 2>diminishing and they just feel it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable.</v>

2173
01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is what it is.</v>

2174
01:41:57.821 --> 01:41:59.770
<v Speaker 2>You're wasting your time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're out there running around,</v>

2175
01:41:59.950 --> 01:42:03.130
<v Speaker 2>but no we're not because this experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

2176
01:42:03.131 --> 01:42:06.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not like no one's under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>illusion that you're gonna live forever,</v>

2177
01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:11.280
<v Speaker 2>but you are enhancing the experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're currently involved in right </v>

2178
01:42:11.591 --> 01:42:14.050
<v Speaker 2>now and you are alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are alive.</v>

2179
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:19.080
<v Speaker 2>You do experience this life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you experience this life </v>

2180
01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:19.080
<v Speaker 2>optimally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

2181
01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:23.340
<v Speaker 2>is it as enjoyable as it can be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we all know that there's a spectrum </v>

2182
01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:24.970
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enjoyability like we've all had times in</v>

2183
01:42:24.971 --> 01:42:29.971
<v Speaker 2>our life where it's not been so great </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then times in a life where </v>

2184
01:42:29.971 --> 01:42:30.100
<v Speaker 2>everything came together like what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking great day,</v>

2185
01:42:30.101 --> 01:42:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

2186
01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Like make more of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you could make more of those and </v>

2187
01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:39.301
<v Speaker 2>then the whole things better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when that whole thing is </v>

2188
01:42:39.301 --> 01:42:39.520
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it affects everybody.</v>

2189
01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:44.521
<v Speaker 2>You touch everybody that's around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody you come in contact with and </v>

2190
01:42:44.521 --> 01:42:45.880
<v Speaker 2>that in turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it sounds so grandiose,</v>

2191
01:42:45.881 --> 01:42:49.480
<v Speaker 2>but in turn can affect the entire race </v>
<v Speaker 2>of human beings.</v>

2192
01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

2193
01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I love the way you put it about like</v>

2194
01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.900
<v Speaker 2>the feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just about,</v>

2195
01:42:56.650 --> 01:42:58.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>staving off cancer,</v>

2196
01:42:58.691 --> 01:43:03.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just about what's going to </v>

2197
01:43:03.691 --> 01:43:03.691
<v Speaker 2>happen 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years from now.</v>

2198
01:43:03.691 --> 01:43:04.630
<v Speaker 2>It's about now it's about not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed.</v>

2199
01:43:04.631 --> 01:43:05.440
<v Speaker 2>We know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2200
01:43:05.441 --> 01:43:07.570
<v Speaker 2>it's about feeling better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about being smarter,</v>

2201
01:43:07.571 --> 01:43:09.040
<v Speaker 2>it's about having more executive </v>
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>

2202
01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:12.700
<v Speaker 2>having more longterm planning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less emotional Amygdala,</v>

2203
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:16.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety that is like right here,</v>

2204
01:43:16.301 --> 01:43:17.470
<v Speaker 2>right now that is happening.</v>

2205
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:18.400
<v Speaker 2>That is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2206
01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:20.950
<v Speaker 2>it's not just longterm effects which you</v>
<v Speaker 2>also are,</v>

2207
01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:23.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also effecting which is very good.</v>

2208
01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:26.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a win win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not just affecting the future.</v>

2209
01:43:26.501 --> 01:43:29.200
<v Speaker 2>You're affecting right now how you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you perform,</v>

2210
01:43:29.230 --> 01:43:30.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2211
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:35.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an important concept that I </v>

2212
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:39.360
<v Speaker 2>continue to try to get across to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also will optimize everything </v>

2213
01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:40.840
<v Speaker 2>else you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's creative pursuits,</v>

2214
01:43:40.841 --> 01:43:42.880
<v Speaker 2>whether it's relationships that you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

2215
01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.920
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those things are predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you feel as you enter them,</v>

2216
01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:51.040
<v Speaker 2>how you feel when you participate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and you can enhance,</v>

2217
01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>you can</v>

2218
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.370
<v Speaker 1>enhance that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

2219
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:59.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird thing that people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they want to pretend they're not </v>

2220
01:43:59.050 --> 01:43:59.050
<v Speaker 1>trying to do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2221
01:43:59.050 --> 01:43:59.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's great.</v>

2222
01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

2223
01:44:01.491 --> 01:44:02.000
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2224
01:44:02.001 --> 01:44:04.550
<v Speaker 1>you're putting out effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of you.</v>

2225
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:10.060
<v Speaker 1>You have a mindset or you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection in your brain with putting </v>

2226
01:44:10.281 --> 01:44:15.281
<v Speaker 1>out more effort and connecting that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort and that connecting things to</v>

2227
01:44:15.771 --> 01:44:17.150
<v Speaker 1>discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever,</v>

2228
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:22.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Pressfield has a book called the </v>

2229
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:23.300
<v Speaker 1>war of art have brought up in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast a million times.</v>

2230
01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a copy of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it to you afterwards because I</v>

2231
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:28.840
<v Speaker 1>bought like 50 copies of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I handed it,</v>

2232
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I handed out to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great and he's been on this podcast</v>

2233
01:44:32.391 --> 01:44:37.391
<v Speaker 1>before and his book is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly about the creative pursuit and </v>

2234
01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:42.671
<v Speaker 1>it's about resistance that people feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know you should write or you </v>

2235
01:44:42.671 --> 01:44:45.440
<v Speaker 1>know you should paint or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to sculpt whatever these things are</v>

2236
01:44:45.441 --> 01:44:50.441
<v Speaker 1>that you pursue and that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that comes up that tries to keep </v>

2237
01:44:50.441 --> 01:44:53.090
<v Speaker 1>you from doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this resistance,</v>

2238
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a battle that you will fight for</v>

2239
01:44:55.311 --> 01:44:56.120
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your life.</v>

2240
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:58.610
<v Speaker 1>But the key is to fight it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to give in,</v>

2241
01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.200
<v Speaker 1>don't give in to that resistance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2242
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:04.910
<v Speaker 1>just to fight that resistance and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so everyday you do so you have won</v>

2243
01:45:04.911 --> 01:45:07.460
<v Speaker 1>the battle for that day and you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to fight that battle.</v>

2244
01:45:07.610 --> 01:45:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And if you continue to fight that battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that same mindset,</v>

2245
01:45:09.951 --> 01:45:12.830
<v Speaker 1>you will win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a guy that like up until the</v>

2246
01:45:12.831 --> 01:45:15.200
<v Speaker 1>time he was 40 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was basically a loser.</v>

2247
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:17.780
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a failed writer.</v>

2248
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And then he kind of just figured it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and got his shit together and then wrote</v>

2249
01:45:20.901 --> 01:45:24.350
<v Speaker 1>books about it and now he's a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished author and it's a,</v>

2250
01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:26.720
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing story and he's a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool guy too.</v>

2251
01:45:26.721 --> 01:45:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I had them on for a podcast and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2252
01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:34.470
<v Speaker 1>in his enthusiasm and the way he </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches it in this book because it's </v>

2253
01:45:35.050 --> 01:45:39.520
<v Speaker 1>very pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can see the steps and he left.</v>

2254
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:43.970
<v Speaker 1>He lays it all out in a way that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to digest.</v>

2255
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2256
01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2257
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2258
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that's something that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important part of,</v>

2259
01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:56.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human experience is pushing past </v>

2260
01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:57.590
<v Speaker 1>that resistance to whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2261
01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:58.550
<v Speaker 1>and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2262
01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:01.130
<v Speaker 1>once you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get better at it next time too.</v>

2263
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still there,</v>

2264
01:46:01.971 --> 01:46:03.590
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do get better at it next time.</v>

2265
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:08.770
<v Speaker 1>There's also a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what it comes up when you </v>

2266
01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:11.870
<v Speaker 1>and I are doing these podcasts where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much data,</v>

2267
01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:17.380
<v Speaker 1>there is so much to take in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have done how many podcasts </v>

2268
01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:17.680
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sixth or seventh?</v>

2269
01:46:17.681 --> 01:46:21.920
<v Speaker 1>One a lot and every one of them is three</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of like,</v>

2270
01:46:21.921 --> 01:46:24.530
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does she know all this?</v>

2271
01:46:24.531 --> 01:46:27.080
<v Speaker 1>And just notebooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I put it up on twitter,</v>

2272
01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:27.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2273
01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:29.540
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>

2274
01:46:29.541 --> 01:46:31.220
<v Speaker 1>get your notebook out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

2275
01:46:31.221 --> 01:46:34.460
<v Speaker 1>that's like the number one response in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the comments.</v>

2276
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:35.820
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2280
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:45.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that can make me better or things</v>

2281

<v Speaker 1>So I like to</v>

2284
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.540
<v Speaker 3>share that with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>

2285
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2286
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:59.300
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about an aging pill and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of came into my mind when you were </v>

2287
01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:00.980
<v Speaker 3>talking about giving your friend that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take a pill I could,</v>

2288
01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delay the way you age or make you live.</v>

2289
01:47:03.930 --> 01:47:06.210
<v Speaker 3>You no longer are better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2290
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:09.420
<v Speaker 3>have you heard of like nicotinamide </v>
<v Speaker 3>riboside or Nicotinamide Adenine?</v>

2291
01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Dinucleotide not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>

2292
01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.480
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

2293
01:47:12.481 --> 01:47:13.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like,</v>

2294
01:47:13.561 --> 01:47:18.561
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's maybe it's not made its way</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the popular media media as much as </v>

2295
01:47:18.561 --> 01:47:23.241
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's definitely blown up in the </v>

2296
01:47:23.241 --> 01:47:23.241
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2297
01:47:23.241 --> 01:47:23.241
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2298
01:47:23.241 --> 01:47:25.700
<v Speaker 3>it's so nicotinamide riboside and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nicotine,</v>

2299
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:29.580
<v Speaker 3>my model nucleotide there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like precursor forums to vitamin</v>

2300
01:47:29.581 --> 01:47:34.581
<v Speaker 3>B three and in the body they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>converted into something called Nad.</v>

2301
01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:40.300
<v Speaker 3>And Nad is something that you absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>have your mitochondria which make energy</v>

2302
01:47:40.890 --> 01:47:42.270
<v Speaker 3>have to have to make energy.</v>

2303
01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't oxidize fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fatty acids,</v>

2304
01:47:45.241 --> 01:47:50.241
<v Speaker 3>you can't oxidize glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't make energy from any of the </v>

2305
01:47:50.241 --> 01:47:52.881
<v Speaker 3>food you eat without an because your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mitochondria and need it to make the </v>

2306
01:47:52.881 --> 01:47:56.151
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's very important for your </v>

2307
01:47:56.151 --> 01:47:56.151
<v Speaker 3>mitochondria to function,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make energy.</v>

2308
01:47:56.151 --> 01:47:56.300
<v Speaker 3>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2309
01:47:57.060 --> 01:48:01.260
<v Speaker 3>it's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the levels of Nad always rise.</v>

2310
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:03.330
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're fasting in between </v>
<v Speaker 3>meals.</v>

2311
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:06.740
<v Speaker 3>So like between breakfast and lunch or </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakfast and dinner,</v>

2312
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:11.750
<v Speaker 3>whatever your nad levels go up like </v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly after a meal and during the </v>

2313
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:14.370
<v Speaker 3>fasting state and also when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>

2314
01:48:14.430 --> 01:48:16.440
<v Speaker 3>So the levels of Nad will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

2315
01:48:16.530 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 3>will go up somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm the,</v>

2316
01:48:18.721 --> 01:48:21.240
<v Speaker 3>so these are precursors to Nad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2317
01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you this because this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of the studies that have been done.</v>

2318
01:48:25.651 --> 01:48:30.651
<v Speaker 3>All the mechanisms go back to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>forming nad nad is something that </v>

2319
01:48:30.651 --> 01:48:30.810
<v Speaker 3>decreases with age.</v>

2320
01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that,</v>

2321
01:48:32.131 --> 01:48:32.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2322
01:48:32.631 --> 01:48:35.310
<v Speaker 3>it's very important for aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime you're inflamed,</v>

2323
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:38.550
<v Speaker 3>all the nad gets sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sucked up into that inflammation because</v>

2324
01:48:38.551 --> 01:48:40.020
<v Speaker 3>your energy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2325
01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:45.500
<v Speaker 3>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it requires energy to like have your </v>

2326
01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:45.960
<v Speaker 3>immune cells to be activated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting off whatever they think they're</v>

2327
01:48:45.961 --> 01:48:49.350
<v Speaker 3>fighting off whether or not it's refined</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar or actual infection,</v>

2328
01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:50.750
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2329
01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:52.590
<v Speaker 3>DNA damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex it up.</v>

2330
01:48:52.591 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2331
01:48:53.371 --> 01:48:58.371
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's basically a limiting factor in a </v>

2332
01:48:58.371 --> 01:49:01.011
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's been all these studies over </v>

2333
01:49:01.011 --> 01:49:01.011
<v Speaker 3>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2334
01:49:01.011 --> 01:49:03.420
<v Speaker 3>I'd say like six years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably now,</v>

2335
01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:07.710
<v Speaker 3>five or six years where various </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists are,</v>

2336
01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:08.850
<v Speaker 3>have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2337
01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:11.300
<v Speaker 3>feeding mice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2338
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:16.510
<v Speaker 3>this nick attendant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my driver's side or nicotine mind </v>

2339
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.510
<v Speaker 3>monitor nucleotide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're finding that,</v>

2340
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2341
01:49:16.621 --> 01:49:19.050
<v Speaker 3>if you feed them nicotine and wide </v>
<v Speaker 3>mononuclear nucleotide,</v>

2342
01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:23.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it delays aging in their liver and their</v>

2343
01:49:23.041 --> 01:49:26.790
<v Speaker 3>bones in their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their muscle.</v>

2344
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's basically like their tissues are</v>

2345
01:49:29.641 --> 01:49:32.610
<v Speaker 3>aging better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have enhanced endurance,</v>

2346
01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:37.640
<v Speaker 3>they have a better mitochondrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>function and these are doses like human </v>

2347
01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:41.190
<v Speaker 3>equivalent dose to like 24 milligrams </v>
<v Speaker 3>per kilogram body weight per day,</v>

2348
01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:46.220
<v Speaker 3>which could be a lot if you weigh a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm showing that it improves </v>

2349
01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:50.481
<v Speaker 3>mitochondrial function and nicotine </v>
<v Speaker 3>riboside which gets converted into </v>

2350
01:49:50.481 --> 01:49:54.241
<v Speaker 3>nicotinamide Adenine dinucleotide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of confusing on it just </v>

2351
01:49:54.241 --> 01:49:54.241
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of studies on that.</v>

2352
01:49:54.241 --> 01:49:58.621
<v Speaker 3>Showing that it like if you give it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mice that have some sort of </v>

2353
01:49:58.621 --> 01:49:58.930
<v Speaker 3>mitochondrial defect in their muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all atrophying,</v>

2354
01:49:59.230 --> 01:50:04.230
<v Speaker 3>a Co completely reverses that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their muscles are like they're making </v>

2355
01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:07.561
<v Speaker 3>lots of Mitochondria and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>improves muscle function and enhanced </v>

2356
01:50:07.561 --> 01:50:09.670
<v Speaker 3>performance anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you get the idea like lots and lots</v>

2357
01:50:09.671 --> 01:50:14.671
<v Speaker 3>of animal studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recently there's been a human clinical </v>

2358
01:50:14.671 --> 01:50:17.491
<v Speaker 3>trial done with nicotinamide riboside </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that just to show that it's safe and</v>

2359
01:50:18.431 --> 01:50:20.910
<v Speaker 3>that it actually does increase nad </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels in,</v>

2360
01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:22.570
<v Speaker 3>in human blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it does,</v>

2361
01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:27.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even even as low as a 100 milligrams </v>

2362
01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:28.690
<v Speaker 3>dose a day and this is a supplement that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can buy.</v>

2363
01:50:28.730 --> 01:50:33.010
<v Speaker 3>So the nicotine in my mano,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nucleotide is not,</v>

2364
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:36.730
<v Speaker 3>that's found in Broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Broccoli's really high in it.</v>

2365
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:40.770
<v Speaker 3>Cucumbers are really high in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cabbage is high and in May,</v>

2366
01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:46.200
<v Speaker 3>but nicotine might arrive aside which </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets converted into that which </v>

2367
01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.180
<v Speaker 3>eventually makes its way to nad is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a supplement.</v>

2368
01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:52.120
<v Speaker 3>So a few scientists actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2369
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 3>some big name scientist in the aging </v>
<v Speaker 3>field,</v>

2370
01:50:54.221 --> 01:50:58.030
<v Speaker 3>like linen warranty and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>others have started a supplement company</v>

2371
01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:00.830
<v Speaker 3>called a Elisia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come to me,</v>

2372
01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.100
<v Speaker 3>me that pad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2373
01:51:02.101 --> 01:51:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I forgot to put a pad over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to write that down.</v>

2374
01:51:05.150 --> 01:51:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:09.640
<v Speaker 3>And so it's called a lease iom and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has nicotine in them.</v>

2376
01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Like the Matt Damon Movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2377
01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:14.410
<v Speaker 3>E L Y S I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>u m.</v>

2378
01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have it.</v>

2379
01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:19.570
<v Speaker 3>So it has nicotine in my and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's affiliation.</v>

2380
01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:23.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any affiliation with any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a supplement company.</v>

2381
01:51:23.171 --> 01:51:28.171
<v Speaker 3>What is the company?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a company called the </v>

2382
01:51:28.171 --> 01:51:28.180
<v Speaker 3>company's called Lisa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the supplements,</v>

2383
01:51:28.210 --> 01:51:33.210
<v Speaker 3>the supplements called Elysium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how do you spell the actual </v>

2384
01:51:33.210 --> 01:51:34.960
<v Speaker 3>nicotinamide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicotinamide,</v>

2385
01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:40.080
<v Speaker 3>and I see a nick o,</v>
<v Speaker 3>t I n a,</v>

2386
01:51:40.451 --> 01:51:45.451
<v Speaker 3>m I d e right beside R I b o s I d e.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2387
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:52.390
<v Speaker 3>So it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also there's another company I </v>

2388
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:54.670
<v Speaker 3>think thorne makes makes one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with it in it,</v>

2389
01:51:54.671 --> 01:51:55.800
<v Speaker 3>but born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2390
01:51:55.860 --> 01:52:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Thorn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that's interesting about the </v>

2391
01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:00.960
<v Speaker 3>Elysium though that I found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I started looking into this,</v>

2392
01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:04.000
<v Speaker 3>I've met lenny warranty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who um,</v>

2393
01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:09.540
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose lab the whole pathway that Rivera </v>

2394
01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:12.820
<v Speaker 3>trawl Axon was discovered that act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Nad switches on this whole,</v>

2395
01:52:12.821 --> 01:52:17.821
<v Speaker 3>like genetic pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like anti aging and it just </v>

2396
01:52:17.821 --> 01:52:18.130
<v Speaker 3>changes all these epigenetic factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2397
01:52:18.370 --> 01:52:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Without getting into all the details and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like boring people to death,</v>

2398
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:25.540
<v Speaker 3>it's like it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's basically nad levels rise that acts</v>

2399
01:52:25.541 --> 01:52:28.600
<v Speaker 3>as a switch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This rises Nad levels.</v>

2400
01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:30.760
<v Speaker 3>So this is a supplement that's rising </v>
<v Speaker 3>nad levels,</v>

2401
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:36.030
<v Speaker 3>but what's interesting about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>illicium is that it has something in it </v>

2402
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:38.791
<v Speaker 3>called terrorists still being Charles </v>
<v Speaker 3>still being is found in blueberries and </v>

2403
01:52:38.791 --> 01:52:40.630
<v Speaker 3>blueberries is probably the one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best sources of it.</v>

2404
01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:46.290
<v Speaker 3>But what was so interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to figure out like why are </v>

2405
01:52:46.290 --> 01:52:47.020
<v Speaker 3>they putting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out why they're putting</v>

2406
01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:52.040
<v Speaker 3>terrell still being with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nicotinamide riboside because </v>

2407
01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 3>nicotinamide riboside is affecting nad </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's affecting mitochondrial biogenesis,</v>

2408
01:52:54.141 --> 01:52:56.900
<v Speaker 3>which it's been shown to increase </v>
<v Speaker 3>mitochondrial biogenesis.</v>

2409
01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these mice and mice,</v>

2410
01:52:58.880 --> 01:52:59.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2411
01:52:59.271 --> 01:53:04.271
<v Speaker 3>we're um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're performing like 42 percent better </v>

2412
01:53:04.271 --> 01:53:06.200
<v Speaker 3>at different endurance activities after </v>
<v Speaker 3>being supplemented with this.</v>

2413
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.120
<v Speaker 3>So that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:13.180
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're giving a lot like the 32 to </v>

2415
01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:14.250
<v Speaker 3>24 to 32 milligrams per kilogram body </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

2416
01:53:14.251 --> 01:53:16.840
<v Speaker 3>It would be the human equivalent dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2417
01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:17.900
<v Speaker 3>figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>

2418
01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:20.630
<v Speaker 3>That's probably like four grams a day or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2419
01:53:20.631 --> 01:53:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For like a 160 or 80 pound person,</v>

2420
01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:25.490
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2421
01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Terrell still beans interesting </v>

2422
01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:30.520
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2423
01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:31.490
<v Speaker 3>in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because it's actually,</v>

2424
01:53:31.491 --> 01:53:35.130
<v Speaker 3>it's chemically similar to raspberry </v>
<v Speaker 3>trawl and um,</v>

2425
01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:40.630
<v Speaker 3>but it's four times more bioavailable </v>
<v Speaker 3>than was trial and it actually has been </v>

2426
01:53:40.630 --> 01:53:44.711
<v Speaker 3>compared side by side in mouse studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>to like to a different mouse studies </v>

2427
01:53:45.231 --> 01:53:50.231
<v Speaker 3>that I've looked at cognitive function </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's better at improving cognitive </v>

2428
01:53:50.231 --> 01:53:54.131
<v Speaker 3>function in animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then risperidol is largely because it's </v>

2429
01:53:54.131 --> 01:53:55.370
<v Speaker 3>four times more bioavailable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2430
01:53:55.371 --> 01:53:56.210
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2431
01:53:56.211 --> 01:53:58.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's why they're doing</v>

2432
01:53:58.041 --> 01:54:00.230
<v Speaker 3>it because it's not affecting the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathway.</v>

2433
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:05.830
<v Speaker 3>But then I came across something really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting in that is I'm terrible </v>

2434
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:07.370
<v Speaker 3>still being actually has been shown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2435
01:54:07.371 --> 01:54:12.371
<v Speaker 3>this is an animal study to increase the </v>
<v Speaker 3>type of bacteria in the gut that causes </v>

2436
01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:14.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2437
01:54:15.110 --> 01:54:18.680
<v Speaker 3>conversion of certain compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alijah Tannins,</v>

2438
01:54:18.710 --> 01:54:21.170
<v Speaker 3>which are found in berries and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuts,</v>

2439
01:54:21.230 --> 01:54:26.230
<v Speaker 3>but really high and pomegranate Alijah </v>
<v Speaker 3>tannins get converted into something </v>

2440
01:54:26.230 --> 01:54:27.620
<v Speaker 3>called teros still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean called,</v>

2441
01:54:27.621 --> 01:54:28.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2442
01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:30.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within a by your gut bacteria,</v>

2443
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:32.870
<v Speaker 3>which is what pterostilbene is </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasing that gut bacteria.</v>

2444
01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:38.020
<v Speaker 3>So Tara soybeans actually increasing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>production of your urine within a from </v>

2445
01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:39.140
<v Speaker 3>berries that are having this other </v>
<v Speaker 3>compound.</v>

2446
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:44.590
<v Speaker 3>You're in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What that does is this has been shown </v>

2447
01:54:44.590 --> 01:54:48.191
<v Speaker 3>also in other studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It causes my defeat Mito faigy or my </v>

2448
01:54:48.191 --> 01:54:52.871
<v Speaker 3>topic g,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the clearing away of damaged </v>

2449
01:54:52.871 --> 01:54:56.231
<v Speaker 3>mitochondria a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're basically clearing away </v>

2450
01:54:56.231 --> 01:54:56.930
<v Speaker 3>damaged mitochondria like they eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

2451
01:54:56.930 --> 01:55:01.930
<v Speaker 3>So faigy would be eating itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like [inaudible] or [inaudible] </v>

2452
01:55:01.930 --> 01:55:05.550
<v Speaker 3>as it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a self sort of a damaged cell </v>

2453
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:08.201
<v Speaker 3>that gets cleared away and eats itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens a lot during the fasting </v>

2454
01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:08.201
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2455
01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:11.840
<v Speaker 3>this Mito faigy is doing it specifically</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Mitochondria and this the reason why</v>

2456
01:55:11.841 --> 01:55:15.680
<v Speaker 3>this is so cool and I'm going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>not bore you,</v>

2457
01:55:15.681 --> 01:55:17.670
<v Speaker 3>but I can go on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2458
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:21.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason this is so cool is because.</v>

2459
01:55:21.771 --> 01:55:26.771
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitochondria are very important for the </v>

2460
01:55:26.771 --> 01:55:26.771
<v Speaker 3>way we age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just muscle function,</v>

2461
01:55:26.771 --> 01:55:31.601
<v Speaker 3>brain function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're providing energy for everything </v>

2462
01:55:31.601 --> 01:55:31.640
<v Speaker 3>like period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your mitochondrial decay,</v>

2463
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:33.830
<v Speaker 3>you decay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way it is like period.</v>

2464
01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:37.670
<v Speaker 3>So their mitochondria as you are aging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're decaying,</v>

2465
01:55:37.671 --> 01:55:39.050
<v Speaker 3>they're getting damaged and all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2466
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this whole repair system where</v>

2467
01:55:41.511 --> 01:55:42.560
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have,</v>

2468
01:55:42.561 --> 01:55:44.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of Mitochondria inside one cell,</v>

2469
01:55:44.970 --> 01:55:47.220
<v Speaker 3>let's say you have one damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitochondria and one healthy.</v>

2470
01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.790
<v Speaker 3>What they do is they fuse together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exchange all their content and fizz back</v>

2471
01:55:50.791 --> 01:55:55.791
<v Speaker 3>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were kind of like repair each </v>

2472
01:55:55.791 --> 01:55:55.791
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have a healthy one,</v>

2473
01:55:55.791 --> 01:55:58.461
<v Speaker 3>a damaged one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The healthy one kind of mixes with the </v>

2474
01:55:58.461 --> 01:55:59.910
<v Speaker 3>unhealthy one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to healthyish ones,</v>

2475
01:55:59.911 --> 01:56:04.911
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is happening constantly inside </v>

2476
01:56:04.911 --> 01:56:04.911
<v Speaker 3>every cell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ever,</v>

2477
01:56:04.911 --> 01:56:08.901
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the Mitochondria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never like you never see </v>

2478
01:56:08.901 --> 01:56:08.901
<v Speaker 3>Mitochondria by themselves are always </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2479
01:56:08.901 --> 01:56:11.070
<v Speaker 3>like a network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they look like Vermicelli Spaghetti</v>

2480
01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:13.320
<v Speaker 3>because they're constantly doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2481
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:18.350
<v Speaker 3>if you clear away the damaged ones and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you increase mitochondrial biogenesis </v>

2482
01:56:19.111 --> 01:56:24.111
<v Speaker 3>with nicotinamide riboside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not only are you getting rid of the </v>

2483
01:56:24.111 --> 01:56:27.740
<v Speaker 3>damaged pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're now creating new ones that are </v>

2484
01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:27.750
<v Speaker 3>like brand new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>

2485
01:56:27.751 --> 01:56:32.751
<v Speaker 3>young brimming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young mitochondria like you had when </v>

2486
01:56:32.751 --> 01:56:32.751
<v Speaker 3>you're a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young child.</v>

2487
01:56:32.751 --> 01:56:33.930
<v Speaker 3>So now your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2488
01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:39.020
<v Speaker 3>your pool that you're mixing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like not mitochondrial biogenesis </v>

2489
01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:39.870
<v Speaker 3>is good in and of itself because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>making new mitochondria,</v>

2490
01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:43.410
<v Speaker 3>but having damaged one still around can </v>
<v Speaker 3>still dilute the pool out,</v>

2491
01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:45.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still diluted.</v>

2492
01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:48.690
<v Speaker 3>So if you get clear out those damaged </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones and you're making new ones,</v>

2493
01:56:48.691 --> 01:56:53.691
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get like young new </v>

2494
01:56:53.691 --> 01:56:56.110
<v Speaker 3>mitochondria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that possibly is a,</v>

2495
01:56:56.111 --> 01:56:59.340
<v Speaker 3>another reason why they combine those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's completely speculation.</v>

2496
01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:00.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

2497
01:57:00.541 --> 01:57:01.930
<v Speaker 3>he learned some cool shit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists.</v>

2498
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:04.500
<v Speaker 3>You're lifting A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2499
01:57:04.501 --> 01:57:06.990
<v Speaker 3>my might've age is a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2500
01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:12.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise to some degree it can increase </v>

2501
01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:12.340
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fasting does.</v>

2502
01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:13.340
<v Speaker 3>And why does fasting increases?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2503
01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:14.620
<v Speaker 3>when you're fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2504
01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:17.160
<v Speaker 3>you try to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Nad levels rise,</v>

2505
01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:20.640
<v Speaker 3>you try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to conserve some of your energy.</v>

2506
01:57:20.641 --> 01:57:22.770
<v Speaker 3>And the way you do that is by eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>different Organelles,</v>

2507
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:24.420
<v Speaker 3>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating the cell itself,</v>

2508
01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:26.550
<v Speaker 3>which can then provide energy for other </v>
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

2509
01:57:26.551 --> 01:57:31.551
<v Speaker 3>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So usually what happens is fasting will </v>

2510
01:57:31.551 --> 01:57:34.260
<v Speaker 3>selectively get rid of some of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>damaged cells are damaged Mitochondria.</v>

2511
01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:36.090
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens during,</v>

2512
01:57:36.091 --> 01:57:37.610
<v Speaker 3>during the fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense when you.</v>

2513
01:57:37.630 --> 01:57:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's interesting though that the body</v>

2514
01:57:40.381 --> 01:57:44.620
<v Speaker 3>manages it so well that it goes after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the damaged ones before I know it's,</v>

2515
01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:45.150
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2516
01:57:45.151 --> 01:57:48.090
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of like molecular </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms that have been,</v>

2517
01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:49.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out why that is.</v>

2518
01:57:49.651 --> 01:57:54.651
<v Speaker 3>And that's because the damage one there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their mitochondrial membrane potentials </v>

2519
01:57:54.651 --> 01:57:57.000
<v Speaker 3>like different and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all this complicated stuff,</v>

2520
01:57:57.001 --> 01:58:02.001
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all works out perfectly where it's </v>

2521
01:58:02.001 --> 01:58:02.001
<v Speaker 3>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2522
01:58:02.001 --> 01:58:02.660
<v Speaker 3>these enzymes that like targeted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2523
01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:04.050
<v Speaker 3>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2524
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.930
<v Speaker 3>to basically become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2525
01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:11.360
<v Speaker 3>to undergo Mito faigy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they recognize this certain </v>

2526
01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:14.391
<v Speaker 3>one with a lower membrane potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>which happens to be more of a damaged </v>

2527
01:58:14.391 --> 01:58:17.771
<v Speaker 3>mitochondria and it's just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of beautiful how it just all </v>

2528
01:58:17.771 --> 01:58:17.771
<v Speaker 3>works out that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2529
01:58:17.771 --> 01:58:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was I going to say?</v>

2530
01:58:20.411 --> 01:58:24.030
<v Speaker 3>I completely like was going to say I </v>
<v Speaker 3>lost my train of thought there.</v>

2531
01:58:24.031 --> 01:58:26.280
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2532
01:58:26.281 --> 01:58:27.980
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you can like,</v>

2533
01:58:28.050 --> 01:58:31.230
<v Speaker 3>have new mitochondria is like pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2534
01:58:31.231 --> 01:58:34.410
<v Speaker 3>that's Kinda like the big thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with aging and it's been that for a long</v>

2535
01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:39.411
<v Speaker 3>time is like young new mitochondria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're probably aware of this </v>

2536
01:58:39.411 --> 01:58:43.551
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they injected old mice with the </v>

2537
01:58:43.551 --> 01:58:43.551
<v Speaker 3>blood</v>

2538
01:58:43.551 --> 01:58:47.220
<v Speaker 1>of young mice and they found that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old mice started behaving more lively </v>

2539
01:58:47.771 --> 01:58:52.771
<v Speaker 1>and then they did the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They injected the young mice with the </v>

2540
01:58:52.771 --> 01:58:54.020
<v Speaker 1>blood of old mice and the mice struggled</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2541
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:59.430
<v Speaker 1>and deteriorated and now there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy new startup were for was like </v>

2542
01:58:59.430 --> 01:59:04.320
<v Speaker 1>eight grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fill you up with a blood of young </v>

2543
01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:04.420
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2544
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you mentioned that recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

2545
01:59:07.121 --> 01:59:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I know Peter Teal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paypal.</v>

2546
01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does that.</v>

2547
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:12.850
<v Speaker 1>He's he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that he's.</v>

2548
01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:15.040
<v Speaker 1>He's on trump's board now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't he?</v>

2549
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like one of the first people that </v>

2550
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.790
<v Speaker 1>trump hired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fascinating.</v>

2551
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:21.290
<v Speaker 1>So fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2552
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

2553
01:59:23.081 --> 01:59:25.390
<v Speaker 1>He's talked about how he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets blood injections.</v>

2554
01:59:25.570 --> 01:59:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly what,</v>

2556
01:59:29.321 --> 01:59:34.321
<v Speaker 1>just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he said anything about </v>

2557
01:59:34.321 --> 01:59:35.791
<v Speaker 1>whether it's doing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think let's just start showing up </v>

2558
01:59:35.791 --> 01:59:35.791
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>

2559
01:59:35.791 --> 01:59:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's got a snapchat filter on.</v>

2560
01:59:37.630 --> 01:59:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing that was really </v>

2561
01:59:42.630 --> 01:59:43.981
<v Speaker 1>interesting about this whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been following this field </v>

2562
01:59:43.981 --> 01:59:46.771
<v Speaker 1>for awhile too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I find it very interesting for </v>

2563
01:59:46.771 --> 01:59:46.771
<v Speaker 1>multiple reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2564
01:59:46.771 --> 01:59:47.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like it could be applicable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2565
01:59:47.141 --> 01:59:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but various look at him.</v>

2566
01:59:49.670 --> 01:59:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks young as fuck.</v>

01:59:50.621 --> 01:59:55.150
<v Speaker 1>He's nine years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wants inject himself with young people's</v>

2568
01:59:55.151 --> 02:00:00.151
<v Speaker 1>blood or is doing it.</v>

02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Did they outed him as gay or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked him and they,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:34.240
<v Speaker 1>so when you go back to the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

2582
02:00:34.410 --> 02:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I want to change the articles there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2583
02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>so what he's doing a given fields </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession with warding off death.</v>

2584
02:00:41.890 --> 02:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>It comes as no surprise to silicon </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley billionaire is interested in </v>

2585
02:00:46.890 --> 02:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>lease one radical way of doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>injecting himself with a young person's </v>

2586
02:00:50.010 --> 02:00:50.320
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2587
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>INC magazine published part of a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old interview with thiel and which the </v>

2588
02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:59.641
<v Speaker 1>venture capitalists explains that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in power of biosis twist </v>

2589
02:00:59.641 --> 02:01:04.001
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes the practice of getting </v>

2590
02:01:04.001 --> 02:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>transfusions of blood from a younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>person as a means of improving health </v>

2591
02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>and potentially reversing aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

2592
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking into this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really interesting.</v>

2593
02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2595
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:16.210
<v Speaker 1>It's unclear whether the 48 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur is currently receiving.</v>

2596
02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Guaranteed you is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2597
02:01:18.610 --> 02:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>reports that are fuel capital employee.</v>

2598
02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Actually the personal health director </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a personal health director,</v>

2599
02:01:25.630 --> 02:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>personal health director to Peter Thiel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2600
02:01:28.271 --> 02:01:30.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do when you're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>baller.</v>

2601
02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get a personal health </v>
<v Speaker 1>director is the same company.</v>

2602
02:01:34.511 --> 02:01:39.511
<v Speaker 1>Ambrosia LLC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the one that we were talking </v>

2603
02:01:39.511 --> 02:01:39.511
<v Speaker 1>about the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2604
02:01:39.511 --> 02:01:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2605
02:01:39.891 --> 02:01:43.490
<v Speaker 1>So this is actually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says thiel spends $40,000</v>

2606
02:01:43.491 --> 02:01:48.491
<v Speaker 1>per quarter per quarter to get an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infusion of blood from an 18 year old </v>

2607
02:01:49.701 --> 02:01:54.701
<v Speaker 1>based on research conducted at Stanford </v>
<v Speaker 1>on extending the lives of mice.</v>

2608
02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>So he's got one fucking 18 year old that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's vampiress one kid.</v>

2609
02:01:59.181 --> 02:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>He's given them beats and Broccoli </v>
<v Speaker 1>sprouts and making them run up hills.</v>

2610
02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what you would have to hope that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids not doing meth,</v>

2611
02:02:08.650 --> 02:02:10.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's got this 18 year old.</v>

2612
02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:13.630
<v Speaker 1>All these biomarkers in the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

2613
02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to make sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's so weird.</v>

2615
02:02:16.431 --> 02:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>We're going to farm off young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

2616
02:02:19.130 --> 02:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2624
02:02:40.751 --> 02:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2625
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was saying when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with them.</v>

2626
02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2627
02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's basing all of.</v>

2628
02:02:47.271 --> 02:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>He's putting all of his eggs in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basket of science.</v>

2629
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:54.350
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that science and things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Peter thiels doing it's going to be</v>

2630
02:02:54.351 --> 02:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>able to mitigate all this stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing,</v>

2631
02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:57.530
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2632
02:02:57.531 --> 02:03:00.410
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking stuck in a position where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2633
02:03:00.411 --> 02:03:01.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can delay the aging,</v>

2634
02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:04.790
<v Speaker 1>but like you're stuck like now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2635
02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:08.480
<v Speaker 1>you can't make you like 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can stop you from dying,</v>

2636
02:03:08.481 --> 02:03:09.290
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

2637
02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:10.790
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

2638
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:11.870
<v Speaker 1>So He's going to be stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2639
02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:14.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also does an exercise.</v>

2640
02:03:14.710 --> 02:03:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I found him to be perplexing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed talking to him,</v>

2641
02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>but I found him to be quite perplexing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the booze and because of the </v>

2642
02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:24.410
<v Speaker 1>lack of exercise and his big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy gandalf beard.</v>

2643
02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude?</v>

2644
02:03:26.121 --> 02:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on here and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

2645
02:03:28.090 --> 02:03:30.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of image here,</v>

2646
02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:33.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree on a lot of nutrition.</v>

2647
02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh well hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me talk about that.</v>

2648
02:03:35.151 --> 02:03:40.151
<v Speaker 1>But in some say that the pay to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate study with the potential to </v>

2649
02:03:40.151 --> 02:03:42.590
<v Speaker 1>collect up to four point 8 million from </v>
<v Speaker 1>as many as 600 participants as mounts to</v>

2650
02:03:42.591 --> 02:03:43.280
<v Speaker 1>a scam.</v>

2651
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>What certain is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's based on some intriguing if </v>

2652
02:03:50.410 --> 02:03:50.450
<v Speaker 1>inconclusive science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car,</v>

2653
02:03:50.451 --> 02:03:55.451
<v Speaker 1>maisie in a 32 year old Princeton </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate and competitive rower said he </v>

2654
02:03:55.451 --> 02:03:59.381
<v Speaker 1>was inspired by studies on mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That research it's sewn together with </v>

2655
02:03:59.381 --> 02:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>their veins conjoined in a procedure </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Para biosis.</v>

2656
02:04:01.281 --> 02:04:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're talking about.</v>

2657
02:04:02.481 --> 02:04:06.200
<v Speaker 1>That study about mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did you guys disagree with?</v>

2658
02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2659
02:04:07.671 --> 02:04:09.470
<v Speaker 1>just the role that nutrition plays in </v>
<v Speaker 1>aging.</v>

2660
02:04:09.650 --> 02:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't think it was a big role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't think it was a big race.</v>

2661
02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>He's boozing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2662
02:04:13.870 --> 02:04:15.110
<v Speaker 1>it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not working out.</v>

2663
02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you ignore all the science on </v>

2664
02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>the positive benefits of exercise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition?</v>

2665
02:04:20.910 --> 02:04:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of studies showing that </v>

2666
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.910
<v Speaker 1>that diet and lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2667
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:26.360
<v Speaker 1>have a huge impact on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on aging.</v>

2668
02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one more thing about this pair </v>

2669
02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>biosis there because it's kind of.</v>

2670
02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>People were thinking that it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

2671
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>There was something in the young blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

2672
02:04:35.721 --> 02:04:40.721
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present the 11 that it just said on the </v>

2673
02:04:40.721 --> 02:04:40.721
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was actually 11.</v>

2674
02:04:40.721 --> 02:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2675
02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:42.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a growth factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>

2676
02:04:42.930 --> 02:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was thought that this was what was</v>

2677
02:04:45.631 --> 02:04:50.631
<v Speaker 1>responsible for rejuvenating tissues and</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing new brain cells because that's </v>

2678
02:04:50.631 --> 02:04:51.440
<v Speaker 1>what happened when you gave it to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2679
02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:56.660
<v Speaker 1>older mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then other studies started to come </v>

2680
02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>out also out of Stanford showing that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

2681
02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:01.380
<v Speaker 1>it may not be something that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>young blood,</v>

2682
02:05:01.381 --> 02:05:05.190
<v Speaker 1>but something that's in the old blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually causing the aging,</v>

2683
02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:09.330
<v Speaker 1>something called a v Cam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that starts to,</v>

2684
02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:14.420
<v Speaker 1>you start to make it as you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>older and it causes inflammation in the </v>

2685
02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:18.861
<v Speaker 1>brain and starts messing up things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a recent study that just </v>

2686
02:05:18.861 --> 02:05:22.521
<v Speaker 1>came out and show that if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make an antibody against that v Cam one </v>

2687
02:05:22.521 --> 02:05:23.310
<v Speaker 1>and prevent it from doing its action.</v>

2688
02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:25.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can stop that from </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

2689
02:05:25.710 --> 02:05:27.960
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot to be figured out,</v>

2690
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>body that they're currently working on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to make some kind of </v>

2691
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:37.040
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some something that you can take God </v>

2692
02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:37.040
<v Speaker 1>damn solution that was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

2693
02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be weird if you see like </v>
<v Speaker 1>old people become young,</v>

2694
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:45.020
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be weird if people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get any older will be kind of </v>

2695
02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:45.600
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like if I came,</v>

2696
02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I ran into you like 20 years from now </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Damn Rhonda,</v>

2697
02:05:48.271 --> 02:05:50.550
<v Speaker 1>you exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be cool,</v>

2698
02:05:50.670 --> 02:05:55.670
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't freak me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would freak me out of Arnold </v>

2699
02:05:55.670 --> 02:05:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Schwartzenegger started looking like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was when he was 20 again.</v>

2700
02:05:56.710 --> 02:06:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Like that would freak me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if we start seeing the change in </v>

2701
02:06:01.710 --> 02:06:02.820
<v Speaker 1>the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started seeing things reverse,</v>

2702
02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>not just halt or slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we kind of have seen with like </v>

2703
02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>really healthy people.</v>

2704
02:06:08.290 --> 02:06:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Like some people know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people kind of defy aging least to </v>

2705
02:06:13.290 --> 02:06:16.170
<v Speaker 1>a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Tom Cruise is a perfect example.</v>

2706
02:06:16.171 --> 02:06:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what they're filling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude up with.</v>

2707
02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Who else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think who I was thinking that defied </v>

2708
02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:23.880
<v Speaker 1>aging like famous wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keanu reeves.</v>

2709
02:06:23.881 --> 02:06:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that guys look the same for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a long time.</v>

2710
02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's in his fifties now.</v>

2711
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:33.920
<v Speaker 1>He looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks great and I think he smokes </v>

2712
02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:33.920
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2713
02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:34.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2714
02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

2715
02:06:36.260 --> 02:06:38.760
<v Speaker 1>that's just show you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some kind of like genetic there</v>

2716
02:06:38.761 --> 02:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There definitely are Tom Cruise 1983,</v>

2717
02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:46.820
<v Speaker 1>2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're injecting him with some kind of </v>

2718
02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:46.820
<v Speaker 1>young fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2719
02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2720
02:06:48.690 --> 02:06:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got fucking ungodly sums of money </v>

2721
02:06:54.450 --> 02:06:57.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of a part of the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2722
02:06:57.940 --> 02:07:02.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they that you can definitely do things </v>

2723
02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:04.590
<v Speaker 1>with money that badge and make you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>

2724
02:07:05.170 --> 02:07:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Trying to figure out what surgery wise </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

2725
02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's doing surgery though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2726
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:10.910
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't.</v>

2727
02:07:11.010 --> 02:07:15.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that they think is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that picture up above?</v>

2728
02:07:15.690 --> 02:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>What's that one with the shirt off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One up there.</v>

2729
02:07:17.991 --> 02:07:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Is that him working out of there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that chose aging.</v>

2730
02:07:22.290 --> 02:07:25.620
<v Speaker 1>So one on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's got substantially less tone to</v>

2731
02:07:25.621 --> 02:07:27.180
<v Speaker 1>his muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that could just be.</v>

2732
02:07:27.450 --> 02:07:31.230
<v Speaker 1>He's been busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says the maverick days are over,</v>

2733
02:07:31.650 --> 02:07:33.000
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back.</v>

2734
02:07:33.930 --> 02:07:38.930
<v Speaker 1>What does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it from 1986 to right on the set </v>

2735
02:07:38.930 --> 02:07:39.720
<v Speaker 1>yesterday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2736
02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:44.920
<v Speaker 1>that's also that there's not that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a variability there that could easily</v>

2737
02:07:44.921 --> 02:07:47.080
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hasn't been working out as hard.</v>

2738
02:07:47.081 --> 02:07:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you're on a movie set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working 15,</v>

2739
02:07:49.271 --> 02:07:54.271
<v Speaker 1>16 hours a day sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially these gigantic big budget </v>

2740
02:07:54.271 --> 02:07:55.120
<v Speaker 1>budget blockbusters where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2741
02:07:55.150 --> 02:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>involved in these crazy stunts and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

2742
02:07:58.790 --> 02:08:00.160
<v Speaker 1>So interesting.</v>

2743
02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2744
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:06.830
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to this like diet aging thing that </v>

2745
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.830
<v Speaker 3>like Aubrey and I just read on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2746
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:11.600
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird that someone that's he's </v>

2747
02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:11.600
<v Speaker 3>familiar with the aging literature </v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

2748
02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:14.760
<v Speaker 3>would disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some of the science out there.</v>

2749
02:08:14.761 --> 02:08:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Like there's been studies looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2750
02:08:16.741 --> 02:08:21.741
<v Speaker 3>people that have like 1:12</v>
<v Speaker 3>ounce can of like sugar water or sugar </v>

2751
02:08:22.711 --> 02:08:26.280
<v Speaker 3>soda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of sugary drink a day.</v>

2752
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:28.380
<v Speaker 3>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at them,</v>

2753
02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:30.750
<v Speaker 3>their telomeres in their white blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

2754
02:08:30.751 --> 02:08:34.530
<v Speaker 3>So telomeres are a biomarker for aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at their team number link,</v>

2755
02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:39.560
<v Speaker 3>their telomeres are shorter compared to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that don't have that soda every </v>

2756
02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:42.450
<v Speaker 3>day and that corresponds to like four </v>
<v Speaker 3>point six years of biological aging.</v>

2757
02:08:42.930 --> 02:08:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like someone that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same exact age as you,</v>

2758
02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:48.540
<v Speaker 3>but has a team member that looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2759
02:08:48.870 --> 02:08:51.560
<v Speaker 3>either five years older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>younger,</v>

2760
02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:52.860
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2761
02:08:52.861 --> 02:08:53.730
<v Speaker 3>It's totally insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All,</v>

2762
02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:56.940
<v Speaker 3>all based off of like this refined sugar</v>
<v Speaker 3>soda.</v>

2763
02:08:57.170 --> 02:09:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's all a personal thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him because he knows that he's not </v>

2764
02:09:02.170 --> 02:09:05.141
<v Speaker 1>addressing that and his own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why he's decided to put up </v>

2765
02:09:05.141 --> 02:09:05.330
<v Speaker 1>these blinders and ignore the science.</v>

2766
02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think also he's interested in </v>

2767
02:09:10.930 --> 02:09:10.930
<v Speaker 3>extending lifespan to like a massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

2768
02:09:10.930 --> 02:09:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Sugary soft drinks may be linked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerate a DNA aging study.</v>

2769
02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:16.310
<v Speaker 1>So he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2770
02:09:16.370 --> 02:09:21.370
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's putting all his eggs in the basket </v>

2771
02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:22.430
<v Speaker 1>of science just of who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

2772
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:28.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of interesting that he is </v>

2773
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:29.990
<v Speaker 1>doing that though because he will </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate very heavily on that.</v>

2774
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:35.350
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were talking about all this </v>

2775
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.350
<v Speaker 1>nutrition and exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of it like,</v>

2776
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much to study,</v>

2777
02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:41.920
<v Speaker 1>there's so much that it maybe his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe his desire to shoe that and go </v>

2778
02:09:42.711 --> 02:09:47.711
<v Speaker 1>straight to the science of it only and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about genetic manipulation and all </v>

2779
02:09:47.711 --> 02:09:49.670
<v Speaker 1>these other different variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe,</v>

2780
02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:53.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you really can't spend enough time</v>

2781
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:55.070
<v Speaker 1>in both fields.</v>

2782
02:09:55.630 --> 02:09:56.440
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2783
02:09:56.441 --> 02:09:57.640
<v Speaker 3>I think that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2784
02:09:57.641 --> 02:10:00.160
<v Speaker 3>and I do think that there's hope for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2785
02:10:00.161 --> 02:10:05.161
<v Speaker 3>things like genetic engineering and stem</v>
<v Speaker 3>cell therapies that will help tune </v>

2786
02:10:05.161 --> 02:10:07.900
<v Speaker 3>humans up eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that will make a big difference in.</v>

2787
02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Have I talked to you about my stem cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments?</v>

2788
02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:12.100
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2789
02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been getting stem cell shots.</v>

2790
02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I got them for an injured shoulder to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder that.</v>

2791
02:10:19.251 --> 02:10:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a rotator cuff tear,</v>

2792
02:10:20.811 --> 02:10:25.670
<v Speaker 1>biceps tendon tear and labral tear in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder and it was most likely had been</v>

2793
02:10:25.671 --> 02:10:30.671
<v Speaker 1>dislocated before and I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just the side effects of years </v>

2794
02:10:31.581 --> 02:10:34.250
<v Speaker 1>of doing difficult stuff with your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially Jujitsu.</v>

2795
02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is all about joint manipulations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and joint locks.</v>

2796
02:10:37.851 --> 02:10:40.250
<v Speaker 1>And Chokes and grappling and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of,</v>

2797
02:10:40.590 --> 02:10:42.740
<v Speaker 1>just a lot of damage that your body goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

2798
02:10:42.741 --> 02:10:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Everybody and I know that does Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a certain point in time either has to</v>

2799
02:10:46.101 --> 02:10:51.101
<v Speaker 1>get some form of surgery or has some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty significant injuries that they </v>

2800
02:10:51.101 --> 02:10:51.590
<v Speaker 1>have to work around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2801
02:10:51.591 --> 02:10:52.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2802
02:10:52.761 --> 02:10:53.580
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2803
02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:55.820
<v Speaker 1>went to a doctor that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2804
02:10:56.330 --> 02:10:58.980
<v Speaker 1>you probably have to get surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is gonna if,</v>

2805
02:10:59.150 --> 02:11:04.150
<v Speaker 1>if not now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometime really soon because every time </v>

2806
02:11:04.150 --> 02:11:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I would work out and we get really sore </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd have to ice it afterwards,</v>

2807
02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:09.870
<v Speaker 1>I get these shots and they're doing them</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

2808
02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:14.900
<v Speaker 1>they're extracting the stem cells from </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's placenta and they take the stem </v>

2809
02:11:15.231 --> 02:11:20.231
<v Speaker 1>cells and then they shoot them into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>area where you have the injury and the </v>

2810
02:11:20.231 --> 02:11:22.220
<v Speaker 1>results are fucking freakish.</v>

2811
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:25.700
<v Speaker 1>You heal like wolverine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really bizarre.</v>

2812
02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:29.270
<v Speaker 1>And now this same shoulder that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2813
02:11:29.271 --> 02:11:32.930
<v Speaker 1>like a real problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was worried about needing surgery.</v>

2814
02:11:33.290 --> 02:11:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I do 90 pound presses with kettlebells </v>
<v Speaker 1>with one shoulder and it's not,</v>

2815
02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:39.350
<v Speaker 1>have no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no pain,</v>

2816
02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:42.520
<v Speaker 1>no discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not bothering me at all and it's,</v>

2817
02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:47.480
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable how much strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>function that the shoulder has now.</v>

2818
02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:52.540
<v Speaker 1>That's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize they were doing that </v>

2819
02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:52.670
<v Speaker 1>with placental stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Placental stem cells are like,</v>

2820
02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a goldmine because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2821
02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.780
<v Speaker 1>they possess a tap of stem cell called </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiphoton stem cell,</v>

2822
02:11:59.781 --> 02:12:04.781
<v Speaker 1>which is able to form multiple different</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of cartilage cells that form </v>

2823
02:12:04.781 --> 02:12:07.580
<v Speaker 1>cartilage cells that form bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even cells that form neurons,</v>

2824
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:10.040
<v Speaker 1>so they're able to form lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different types of cells.</v>

2825
02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and usually placenta just like thrown </v>

2826
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.270
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2827
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:19.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of cool that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's companies that are </v>

2828
02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:21.290
<v Speaker 1>freezing them down and I'm finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>donors that match.</v>

2829
02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you the name of the company.</v>

2830
02:12:22.881 --> 02:12:24.520
<v Speaker 1>So people who are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the.</v>

2831
02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:29.530
<v Speaker 1>My doctor's name is Dr Roddy Mcgee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in Las Vegas and the company is a </v>

2832
02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:36.200
<v Speaker 1>listed here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

2833
02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I've got it on my instagram and my pen </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready here to let me know.</v>

2834
02:12:39.621 --> 02:12:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I won't let you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a second.</v>

2835
02:12:40.971 --> 02:12:45.971
<v Speaker 1>I'll scroll through my instagram and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find him because it wasn't that </v>

2836
02:12:45.971 --> 02:12:45.971
<v Speaker 1>long ago that I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2837
02:12:45.971 --> 02:12:46.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2838
02:12:46.251 --> 02:12:51.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted something about it on </v>

2839
02:12:51.251 --> 02:12:51.251
<v Speaker 1>Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am a,</v>

2840
02:12:51.251 --> 02:12:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believer in it and I've had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

2841
02:12:51.711 --> 02:12:56.711
<v Speaker 1>my friend John Dudley who's an archer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was experiencing a tendinitis in one of </v>

2842
02:12:57.291 --> 02:13:02.291
<v Speaker 1>his elbows for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had it and it was something </v>

2843
02:13:02.481 --> 02:13:07.481
<v Speaker 1>that he had been working through for </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a few years and he had one stem </v>

2844
02:13:07.851 --> 02:13:10.850
<v Speaker 1>cell shot and within two weeks the pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>was completely gone.</v>

2845
02:13:11.150 --> 02:13:12.470
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2846
02:13:12.471 --> 02:13:17.471
<v Speaker 1>it's freaky what they're able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine to get stem cell therapies.</v>

2847
02:13:17.661 --> 02:13:22.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I'm extremely </v>

2848
02:13:22.661 --> 02:13:24.701
<v Speaker 1>excited about for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But have you ever tried a hydrolyzed </v>

2849
02:13:24.701 --> 02:13:25.700
<v Speaker 1>collagen powder or like bone broth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2850
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I drink bone broth every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>

2851
02:13:29.290 --> 02:13:30.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2852
02:13:30.150 --> 02:13:31.400
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing like,</v>

2853
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:31.950
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

2854
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I've been getting into the bone broth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was doing hydraulic add,</v>

2855
02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:40.550
<v Speaker 2>hydrolyzed collagen powder to like my </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee in the morning and also my </v>

2856
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.650
<v Speaker 2>smoothies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what does that do?</v>

2857
02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>

2858
02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:43.770
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got a lot of the same things.</v>

2859
02:13:43.771 --> 02:13:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Is Bone broth bone broth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably actually even better because it</v>

2860
02:13:46.291 --> 02:13:49.680
<v Speaker 2>has more stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's been shown in animal studies.</v>

2861
02:13:49.681 --> 02:13:54.681
<v Speaker 2>If you take the hydrolyzed collagen </v>
<v Speaker 2>powder and like radio label it so you </v>

2862
02:13:54.681 --> 02:13:57.561
<v Speaker 2>can follow where it goes and an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes right to the cartilage in the </v>

2863
02:13:57.561 --> 02:13:58.230
<v Speaker 2>joints and ligaments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2864
02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:03.860
<v Speaker 2>I used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has helped me heal like injured </v>

2865
02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:03.860
<v Speaker 2>wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2866
02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:04.950
<v Speaker 2>obviously like my injuries are like way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2867
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:08.520
<v Speaker 2>like less magnitude and something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're experiencing in your shoulder.</v>

2868
02:14:08.850 --> 02:14:13.850
<v Speaker 2>It is a total sports medicine in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the name of the company that,</v>

2869
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:15.150
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2870
02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Does this stem cell injections or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the company that you applied?</v>

2871
02:14:19.051 --> 02:14:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Biologics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called a flow graft.</v>

2872
02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Amniotic fluid therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're calling it a,</v>

2873
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:28.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's total sports medicine in Las </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>

2874
02:14:28.261 --> 02:14:30.600
<v Speaker 2>That's where I got the stem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So biologics,</v>

2875
02:14:30.601 --> 02:14:32.580
<v Speaker 2>is that the company that freezes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Placenta?</v>

2876
02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Applied biologics flow graft,</v>

2877
02:14:35.401 --> 02:14:38.190
<v Speaker 2>amniotic fluid therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2878
02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:39.200
<v Speaker 2>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2879
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Rodney Mcgee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Rodney Mcgee is a total sports </v>

2880
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:44.610
<v Speaker 2>medicine in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>

2881
02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:47.280
<v Speaker 2>He's such a knowledgeable guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ever wanted to talk to him,</v>

2882
02:14:47.281 --> 02:14:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I get you in contact with them and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>can explain all the details.</v>

2883
02:14:50.101 --> 02:14:54.330
<v Speaker 2>He talks like you took a fucking geek </v>
<v Speaker 2>out together and confuse the shit out of</v>

2884
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:55.800
<v Speaker 2>anybody standing next to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2885
02:14:55.801 --> 02:15:00.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty soon they actually there you can </v>

2886
02:15:00.801 --> 02:15:00.801
<v Speaker 2>make stem cells from skin cells now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2887
02:15:00.801 --> 02:15:02.100
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they did that with a woman.</v>

2888
02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:07.100
<v Speaker 2>They created a new bladder for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had bladder cancer and they created </v>

2889
02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:11.181
<v Speaker 2>a completely new bladder from her skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells in a laboratory environment and </v>

2890
02:15:11.791 --> 02:15:14.400
<v Speaker 2>then replaced her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her damaged bladder.</v>

2891
02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:19.460
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had only heard about the clinical </v>

2892
02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:19.590
<v Speaker 2>study that they did with [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>where like the woman,</v>

2893
02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:22.320
<v Speaker 2>some woman was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had some sort of blindness and they were</v>

2894
02:15:22.321 --> 02:15:24.510
<v Speaker 2>able to use skin cells from her own </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>

2895
02:15:25.570 --> 02:15:26.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clocks.</v>

2896
02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm into becoming retinal cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bladder is really cool too.</v>

2897
02:15:29.401 --> 02:15:34.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's these lots and lots of </v>

2898
02:15:34.401 --> 02:15:34.401
<v Speaker 2>animals studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every once in a while there's like a</v>

2899
02:15:34.401 --> 02:15:36.180
<v Speaker 2>new clinical study where they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of piloting,</v>

2900
02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:38.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this and seeing the safety in,</v>

2901
02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:43.740
<v Speaker 2>in humans and that is where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait like it's crazy stem cell </v>

2902
02:15:44.701 --> 02:15:47.150
<v Speaker 2>injections for my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2903
02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm shooting her rent money or it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be very bizarre when we get </v>

2904
02:15:53.701 --> 02:15:55.950
<v Speaker 2>past a healthy human state.</v>

2905
02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:58.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm really not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

2906
02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:02.280
<v Speaker 2>not concerned about rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but curious about like it's curious,</v>

2907
02:16:02.281 --> 02:16:05.820
<v Speaker 2>it's not even a strong enough word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like within our lifetimes,</v>

2908
02:16:05.821 --> 02:16:07.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's 50 years or whatever it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be,</v>

2909
02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:12.800
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be able to engineer a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human body to perform and I'm sure </v>

2910
02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:17.780
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of myostatin inhibitors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefits that they've shown that the</v>

2911
02:16:18.091 --> 02:16:20.850
<v Speaker 2>accidental ones that they've done with </v>
<v Speaker 2>like whippets and cows,</v>

2912
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:24.450
<v Speaker 2>but now they've started to do it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose for mice and they're,</v>

2913
02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:27.670
<v Speaker 2>the mice are living longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're super nice.</v>

2914
02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:30.610
<v Speaker 2>They're are like way more muscular.</v>

2915
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I think they're like two to three times </v>
<v Speaker 1>more muscular than the average mouse.</v>

2916
02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:39.300
<v Speaker 1>They look freakish when they kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they killed him and they skin them </v>

2917
02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:42.391
<v Speaker 1>and they show the body of the miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to with the muscle structure </v>

2918
02:16:42.391 --> 02:16:42.400
<v Speaker 1>and comparison to the body of a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouse.</v>

2919
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:44.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck are you doing here?</v>

2920
02:16:44.801 --> 02:16:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like the hulk.</v>

2921
02:16:47.350 --> 02:16:50.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're making a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tiny thing,</v>

2922
02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:52.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're putting all this extra muscle</v>

2923
02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:55.090
<v Speaker 1>on it and for whatever reason it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>living longer.</v>

2924
02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

2925
02:16:56.290 --> 02:16:58.780
<v Speaker 1>that's the interesting part that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>living longer.</v>

2926
02:16:59.050 --> 02:17:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Trying to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what you know,</v>

2927
02:17:01.390 --> 02:17:03.460
<v Speaker 1>because usually there's some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade off where you're like,</v>

2928
02:17:03.461 --> 02:17:05.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we could find that.</v>

2929
02:17:05.231 --> 02:17:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing,</v>

2930
02:17:06.011 --> 02:17:11.011
<v Speaker 1>the Mile Staton inhibitor studies they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did on mice because their physical </v>

2931
02:17:11.011 --> 02:17:12.100
<v Speaker 1>performance was extraordinary.</v>

2932
02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Like they could do things that the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>mice just could not do,</v>

2933
02:17:14.770 --> 02:17:17.090
<v Speaker 1>but on top of that they actually live </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

2934
02:17:17.370 --> 02:17:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2935
02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:21.730
<v Speaker 1>that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they were doing it with like pigs</v>

2936
02:17:21.731 --> 02:17:25.010
<v Speaker 1>too or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seen some pigs or they'd done since,</v>

2937
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I think they were doing gene engineering</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them with the and inhibitor.</v>

2938
02:17:27.941 --> 02:17:30.430
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

2939
02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:35.460
<v Speaker 1>it's all very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done it with animals that you </v>

2940
02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:35.460
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

2941
02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:40.231
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking that you could do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with animals that we use for food and </v>

2942
02:17:40.231 --> 02:17:41.170
<v Speaker 1>they would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would provide more meat that way,</v>

2943
02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:44.630
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's man exactly what.</v>

2944
02:17:44.770 --> 02:17:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I found some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of different studies.</v>

2945
02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Some were older than like 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know.</v>

2946
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2947
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:55.230
<v Speaker 1>It's cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muscle mass and muscle fiber in aged </v>

2948
02:17:55.230 --> 02:17:58.171
<v Speaker 1>mice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does not increase bone density or </v>

2949
02:17:58.171 --> 02:17:58.171
<v Speaker 1>bone strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2950
02:17:58.171 --> 02:17:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snap.</v>

2951
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:05.920
<v Speaker 1>That's an old study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The [inaudible] from 2009.</v>

2952
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:09.190
<v Speaker 1>It's 2013 is the one I clicked on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2953
02:18:09.490 --> 02:18:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 2013 is probably where I saw it.</v>

2954
02:18:12.610 --> 02:18:17.610
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those images click on those </v>

2955
02:18:17.610 --> 02:18:17.610
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2956
02:18:17.610 --> 02:18:17.610
<v Speaker 1>because some of those images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2957
02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you could see they had the like go down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there with the mice carcasses right </v>

2958
02:18:22.890 --> 02:18:24.870
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see the difference in the size and</v>

2959
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>

2960
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually the one where you </v>

2961
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that</v>

2962
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:32.070
<v Speaker 5>uh hm.</v>

2963
02:18:32.730 --> 02:18:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Well there's plenty to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2964
02:18:35.191 --> 02:18:40.191
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see the difference in the </v>

2965
02:18:40.191 --> 02:18:42.750
<v Speaker 1>muscle size from the average mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is on the left versus the </v>

2966
02:18:42.750 --> 02:18:45.570
<v Speaker 1>milestone and mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the milestone knockout mouse.</v>

2967
02:18:45.810 --> 02:18:50.810
<v Speaker 1>But look at what they're standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one mouse just looks like a giant </v>

2968
02:18:50.810 --> 02:18:53.580
<v Speaker 1>ass power lifter mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are strange times when it comes to</v>

2969
02:18:53.581 --> 02:18:55.890
<v Speaker 1>the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really strange times.</v>

2970
02:18:56.660 --> 02:18:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle mass is,</v>

2971
02:18:58.530 --> 02:19:01.830
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the one that I saw</v>

2972
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:04.940
<v Speaker 5>pool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good Lord.</v>

2973
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:07.250
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible.</v>

2974
02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got like two levels of it.</v>

2975
02:19:10.061 --> 02:19:12.280
<v Speaker 1>You've got level one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>level a,</v>

2976
02:19:12.281 --> 02:19:14.560
<v Speaker 1>and level b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the natural mouse,</v>

2977
02:19:14.561 --> 02:19:16.690
<v Speaker 1>which is on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this image?</v>

2978
02:19:16.691 --> 02:19:17.450
<v Speaker 1>What does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2979
02:19:17.530 --> 02:19:18.790
<v Speaker 1>image title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

2980
02:19:18.791 --> 02:19:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2981
02:19:19.511 --> 02:19:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Bodybuilding and Myostatin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's an image of three mice.</v>

2982
02:19:22.601 --> 02:19:24.520
<v Speaker 1>One is a control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the average mouse.</v>

2983
02:19:24.850 --> 02:19:26.900
<v Speaker 1>The other ones has dominant negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2984
02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:31.040
<v Speaker 1>how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go at Trib Trib two eyes,</v>

2985
02:19:31.530 --> 02:19:36.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other one is follow staten and </v>

2986
02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:39.140
<v Speaker 1>in the false downton want it is just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Lee Haney of mice,</v>

2987
02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:41.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a giant ass mouse.</v>

2988
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:46.750
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like double the size of the middle </v>

2989
02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:49.901
<v Speaker 1>mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is double the size of the other </v>

2990
02:19:49.901 --> 02:19:51.390
<v Speaker 1>mount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either of those pathways are or what </v>

2991
02:19:51.390 --> 02:19:55.451
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but clearly they regulate muscle mass </v>

2992
02:19:55.451 --> 02:19:57.480
<v Speaker 1>was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be kinda weird to like do an </v>

2993
02:19:57.480 --> 02:20:01.361
<v Speaker 1>injection and like all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gaining lean muscle mass without </v>

2994
02:20:01.361 --> 02:20:02.630
<v Speaker 1>like doing not doing anything.</v>

2995
02:20:02.650 --> 02:20:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like those mice are </v>

2996
02:20:07.650 --> 02:20:07.650
<v Speaker 1>working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2997
02:20:07.650 --> 02:20:07.650
<v Speaker 1>That would be super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2998
02:20:07.650 --> 02:20:08.690
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2999
02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the misconceptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about steroids.</v>

3000
02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:12.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think like you do.</v>

3001
02:20:12.441 --> 02:20:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Steroids just get bigger and muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually have to work it out.</v>

3002
02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:18.620
<v Speaker 1>What this is a guy says is a milestone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>

3003
02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:24.160
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just don't even click on that </v>

3004
02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:27.370
<v Speaker 1>can take that fucking off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's lies that these goddamn </v>

3005
02:20:27.370 --> 02:20:27.680
<v Speaker 1>supplement companies that do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really gross.</v>

3006
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:32.710
<v Speaker 1>One of the things they do is they pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone to get in really great shape so </v>

3007
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:33.770
<v Speaker 1>someone gets in really great shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they'll give them steroids,</v>

3008
02:20:33.771 --> 02:20:36.290
<v Speaker 1>they'll pump them up and then they pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to get fat.</v>

3009
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:41.830
<v Speaker 1>So they pay him to stop working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get fat and then they changed the </v>

3010
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:42.260
<v Speaker 1>way the lighting is like.</v>

3011
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:47.290
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you could see </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with fraudulent </v>

3012
02:20:47.290 --> 02:20:47.290
<v Speaker 1>companies is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3013
02:20:47.290 --> 02:20:51.610
<v Speaker 1>these shirt off picks before and after </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a transformation is like in the,</v>

3014
02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:56.780
<v Speaker 1>the good picture there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tan and the lighting is really good for </v>

3015
02:20:56.780 --> 02:20:57.440
<v Speaker 1>accentuating muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3016
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3017
02:20:58.451 --> 02:21:00.770
<v Speaker 1>the shape of the muscles and the shadows</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

3018
02:21:00.771 --> 02:21:02.660
<v Speaker 1>They look ripped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one,</v>

3019
02:21:02.661 --> 02:21:06.110
<v Speaker 1>they're like pasty and white and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay these guys to get fat.</v>

3020
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:07.910
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they paid him to do it.</v>

3021
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things right here.</v>

3022
02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the after is the fucking before.</v>

3023
02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:19.120
<v Speaker 1>And the guy on the left that before is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they paid that guy to stop working out </v>

3024
02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:20.750
<v Speaker 1>and give facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People live with themselves.</v>

3025
02:21:20.751 --> 02:21:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Like doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just don't.</v>

3026
02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:25.520
<v Speaker 1>It seems like people are douchebags </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraudulent.</v>

3027
02:21:25.690 --> 02:21:26.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of monsters out there.</v>

3028
02:21:27.070 --> 02:21:28.100
<v Speaker 1>This is from bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

3029
02:21:28.101 --> 02:21:30.290
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this was actually taken like the</v>

3030
02:21:30.290 --> 02:21:31.490
<v Speaker 1>same day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3031
02:21:31.491 --> 02:21:36.491
<v Speaker 1>what did some photoshop they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that too,</v>

3032
02:21:37.581 --> 02:21:39.860
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They definitely do that too.</v>

3033
02:21:39.861 --> 02:21:44.861
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our friend Chris Bell and Mark Bell who </v>

3034
02:21:44.861 --> 02:21:44.861
<v Speaker 1>were in bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

3035
02:21:44.861 --> 02:21:45.710
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3036
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:47.660
<v Speaker 1>they know a lot more about that than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

3037
02:21:47.661 --> 02:21:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a picture of him right </v>
<v Speaker 1>above that that if you haven't seen that</v>

3038
02:21:50.751 --> 02:21:52.910
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I highly recommend it bigger,</v>

3039
02:21:52.911 --> 02:21:53.630
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>

3040
02:21:53.631 --> 02:21:57.770
<v Speaker 1>which talks about the supplement </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry and the use of steroids and all</v>

3041
02:21:57.771 --> 02:21:59.760
<v Speaker 1>these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of the interesting.</v>

3042
02:21:59.810 --> 02:22:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the weird practices they do,</v>

3043
02:22:01.371 --> 02:22:04.640
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at any of those before </v>
<v Speaker 1>and after pictures,</v>

3044
02:22:04.641 --> 02:22:06.680
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly what you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3045
02:22:06.681 --> 02:22:11.681
<v Speaker 1>unless they're like a really ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>company and they hired someone to take </v>

3046
02:22:11.681 --> 02:22:14.681
<v Speaker 1>their product and continue to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even then it's like when you show a </v>

3047
02:22:14.681 --> 02:22:14.990
<v Speaker 1>before and after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the guy doing before?</v>

3048
02:22:14.991 --> 02:22:16.910
<v Speaker 1>What was the guy doing after?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that has diet?</v>

3049
02:22:16.911 --> 02:22:19.310
<v Speaker 1>How much that is exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do you know,</v>

3050
02:22:19.311 --> 02:22:21.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you get a blood test on this guy?</v>

3051
02:22:21.661 --> 02:22:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Is he on steroids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

3052
02:22:22.890 --> 02:22:24.080
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening here?</v>

3053
02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should just focus on</v>

3054
02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:27.590
<v Speaker 2>ways we can actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3055
02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:31.140
<v Speaker 2>science and ways we know like we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase muscle mass,</v>

3056
02:22:31.141 --> 02:22:31.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

3057
02:22:32.350 --> 02:22:37.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight lifting and I don't mean to beat </v>

3058
02:22:37.350 --> 02:22:37.350
<v Speaker 2>up on Aubrey de grey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you,</v>

3059
02:22:37.350 --> 02:22:40.140
<v Speaker 2>when you brought up the science of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and the factors,</v>

3060
02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:41.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3061
02:22:41.051 --> 02:22:42.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive benefits of it.</v>

3062
02:22:42.990 --> 02:22:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Like what was his reaction and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes of this podcast,</v>

3063
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:51.420
<v Speaker 2>the podcast that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what episode,</v>

3064
02:22:51.421 --> 02:22:55.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's been a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least I would say.</v>

3065
02:22:55.980 --> 02:22:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his exact reaction.</v>

3066
02:22:59.251 --> 02:23:04.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell if you listen to the pot I </v>

3067
02:23:04.251 --> 02:23:04.251
<v Speaker 2>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk a lot about,</v>

3068
02:23:04.251 --> 02:23:08.270
<v Speaker 2>we talk a lot about crispr and stem cell</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of these possible therapies </v>

3069
02:23:09.421 --> 02:23:11.970
<v Speaker 2>that are being used that can potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>extend lifespan.</v>

3070
02:23:12.330 --> 02:23:17.330
<v Speaker 2>But there's a point in the podcast where</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition comes up and you can tell it </v>

3071
02:23:18.001 --> 02:23:23.001
<v Speaker 2>gets a little awkward between the two of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us because we kind of have different </v>

3072
02:23:23.001 --> 02:23:25.701
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of not trying to be rude </v>

3073
02:23:25.701 --> 02:23:25.920
<v Speaker 2>because look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking wizard.</v>

3074
02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:31.340
<v Speaker 2>We were like so close and his office and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's anyways,</v>

3075
02:23:32.610 --> 02:23:35.310
<v Speaker 2>he's an odd guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That beard is fucking awesome though.</v>

3076
02:23:35.370 --> 02:23:38.640
<v Speaker 2>God Damn that point was just that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

3077
02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:42.660
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna extend lifespan by,</v>

3078
02:23:43.170 --> 02:23:48.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 or 50 percent with diet and that's </v>

3079
02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:48.170
<v Speaker 2>what he wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3080
02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:50.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point that I think,</v>

3081
02:23:50.970 --> 02:23:51.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3082
02:23:52.060 --> 02:23:57.060
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to say that and another </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to kind of disregard nutrition </v>

3083
02:23:57.060 --> 02:23:57.060
<v Speaker 2>altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3084
02:23:57.060 --> 02:24:00.360
<v Speaker 2>because that's because that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid nutrition plays a role in the way</v>

3085
02:24:00.361 --> 02:24:02.100
<v Speaker 2>you age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that should be,</v>

3086
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be something that people </v>

3087
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.670
<v Speaker 2>should completely disregard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disregard and not think about and not.</v>

3088
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:09.900
<v Speaker 2>And not even not thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when they talk publicly,</v>

3089
02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:11.070
<v Speaker 2>talk it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3090
02:24:11.071 --> 02:24:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's fine.</v>

3091
02:24:13.321 --> 02:24:15.450
<v Speaker 2>If you want to focus on technologies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3092
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:16.850
<v Speaker 2>and I agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>

3093
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3094
02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:21.960
<v Speaker 2>all these gene therapy technologies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>crispr and you know,</v>

3095
02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:24.840
<v Speaker 2>induced pluripotent stem cells and I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>

3096
02:24:24.841 --> 02:24:29.841
<v Speaker 2>huge fan of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that being a fan of </v>

3097
02:24:29.841 --> 02:24:32.500
<v Speaker 2>that and being excited about what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and what new technologies are,</v>

3098
02:24:32.770 --> 02:24:35.040
<v Speaker 2>are gonna be able to bring us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

3099
02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:40.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make us talk about like kind of poop on </v>

3100
02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:40.080
<v Speaker 2>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3101
02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Watching the also a big factor is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way you feel and a big factor too.</v>

3102
02:24:45.301 --> 02:24:50.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume they just doesn't just want to </v>

3103
02:24:50.301 --> 02:24:50.301
<v Speaker 2>extend a shitty life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3104
02:24:50.301 --> 02:24:52.380
<v Speaker 2>You want to extend a life where you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful,</v>

3105
02:24:52.381 --> 02:24:53.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3106
02:24:53.141 --> 02:24:56.820
<v Speaker 2>And well if your booze and all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>like he is that guy boozes every day.</v>

3107
02:24:57.330 --> 02:24:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him like we were drunk as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck in New York.</v>

3108
02:24:59.821 --> 02:25:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I went to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3109
02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:03.750
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2045 conference.</v>

3110
02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

3111
02:25:04.771 --> 02:25:09.771
<v Speaker 2>a conference in New York where all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these nutty people who think you're </v>

3112
02:25:09.771 --> 02:25:13.440
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to download your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a super computer and the year 20,</v>

3113
02:25:13.441 --> 02:25:18.441
<v Speaker 2>45 like this extended life conference </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of it was run by this Russian </v>

3114
02:25:18.441 --> 02:25:19.580
<v Speaker 2>billionaire that I talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

3115
02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:23.680
<v Speaker 2>who was a very odd character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was building a robot that they</v>

3116
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.320
<v Speaker 1>were not satisfied with the results of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this robot.</v>

3117
02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:27.700
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3118
02:25:27.730 --> 02:25:31.000
<v Speaker 1>they never a unearthed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never unveiled it rather.</v>

3119
02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:35.050
<v Speaker 1>But these all these people is 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 conference in New York.</v>

3120
02:25:35.051 --> 02:25:40.051
<v Speaker 1>We're all like this gathering of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>super geeks that are all in various ways</v>

3121
02:25:41.650 --> 02:25:44.530
<v Speaker 1>trying to extend life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Aubrey de Grey was there as well and</v>

3122
02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I met him at the bar and we just got </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hammered.</v>

3123
02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:48.970
<v Speaker 1>We got hammered and we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3124
02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:51.080
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we extending life that's going on?</v>

3125
02:25:51.090 --> 02:25:52.480
<v Speaker 1>It feels like we're just drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>guinness.</v>

3126
02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:57.610
<v Speaker 1>You are causing massive inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brain cell death.</v>

3127
02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:00.370
<v Speaker 1>This is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>

3128
02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:07.380
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are two very contrary ways of </v>

3129
02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:09.190
<v Speaker 1>existing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to extend life.</v>

3130
02:26:09.191 --> 02:26:13.270
<v Speaker 1>But yet to diminish the potential of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life you're currently experiencing,</v>

3131
02:26:13.450 --> 02:26:13.830
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3132
02:26:13.950 --> 02:26:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's having fun,</v>

3133
02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:15.690
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3134
02:26:15.691 --> 02:26:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3135
02:26:16.501 --> 02:26:19.260
<v Speaker 2>he was an interesting guy and I enjoyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to him,</v>

3136
02:26:19.261 --> 02:26:24.261
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to talk bad about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I was very shocked when I </v>

3137
02:26:24.261 --> 02:26:27.561
<v Speaker 2>walked into his office that literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 11 in the morning and he had </v>

3138
02:26:27.561 --> 02:26:28.300
<v Speaker 2>already down two beers and you respond </v>
<v Speaker 2>is third.</v>

3139
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:32.280
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

3140
02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't expecting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't.</v>

3141
02:26:35.070 --> 02:26:37.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was completely shocking to me.</v>

3142
02:26:38.310 --> 02:26:43.110
<v Speaker 2>God bless him out there hammering it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3143
02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3144
02:26:43.951 --> 02:26:46.800
<v Speaker 2>But I guess there's a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>approaches and I think he's,</v>

3145
02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:48.450
<v Speaker 2>his approach is welcomed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

3146
02:26:48.451 --> 02:26:48.920
<v Speaker 2>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3147
02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:53.980
<v Speaker 2>it's just as important to have a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that that's kind of fucking up his </v>

3148
02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:56.000
<v Speaker 2>body and still still after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3149
02:26:56.001 --> 02:26:57.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>

3150
02:26:57.350 --> 02:26:58.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3151
02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:01.140
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was saying though,</v>

3152
02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:04.800
<v Speaker 2>the thing that with him and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3153
02:27:04.801 --> 02:27:09.801
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the major differences is focusing on </v>

3154
02:27:09.801 --> 02:27:09.801
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and that's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3155
02:27:09.801 --> 02:27:12.750
<v Speaker 2>that I want to get the message across </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I want something to do right now.</v>

3156
02:27:12.910 --> 02:27:14.550
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you can do right now until an </v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

3157
02:27:14.551 --> 02:27:18.660
<v Speaker 2>In the meanwhile still telling people </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the awesome science coming out.</v>

3158
02:27:18.661 --> 02:27:21.360
<v Speaker 2>But until then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's keep,</v>

3159
02:27:21.570 --> 02:27:23.970
<v Speaker 2>let's keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not mutually exclusive.</v>

3160
02:27:24.030 --> 02:27:26.280
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not mutually exclusive.</v>

3161
02:27:27.090 --> 02:27:27.990
<v Speaker 2>The other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3162
02:27:27.991 --> 02:27:30.630
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that when we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the muscle mass,</v>

3163
02:27:30.631 --> 02:27:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I started thinking about this time </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted eating.</v>

3164
02:27:34.410 --> 02:27:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard about this at all time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Restricted eating a little bit,</v>

3165
02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:40.830
<v Speaker 2>like eating within a certain time </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

3166
02:27:40.831 --> 02:27:45.831
<v Speaker 2>That correlates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corresponds to like the day it has </v>

3167
02:27:45.831 --> 02:27:48.780
<v Speaker 2>really profound effects on muscle mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>without any other factors that having to</v>

3168
02:27:48.781 --> 02:27:53.781
<v Speaker 2>exercise or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that's extremely </v>

3169
02:27:53.781 --> 02:27:53.781
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

3170
02:27:53.781 --> 02:27:56.370
<v Speaker 2>But this time restricted eating is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very important for,</v>

3171
02:27:56.400 --> 02:28:01.400
<v Speaker 2>for health and metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also something I've been obsessed </v>

3172
02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:03.540
<v Speaker 2>with since like probably early summer </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing it like just,</v>

3173
02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:09.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fanatically making sure that I'm </v>

3174
02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:09.280
<v Speaker 2>eating within like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3175
02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:11.820
<v Speaker 2>no more than 12 hour period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to do like 10 hours.</v>

3176
02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:16.520
<v Speaker 2>So like when you wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a cup of coffee or you know,</v>

3177
02:28:16.770 --> 02:28:21.620
<v Speaker 2>you eat even a cup of black coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you put into your system</v>

3178
02:28:21.621 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 2>that's not</v>

3179
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:26.330
<v Speaker 3>water starts all these metabolic enzymes</v>
<v Speaker 3>start some in your liver,</v>

3180
02:28:26.570 --> 02:28:31.570
<v Speaker 3>your gut starts using these enzymes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>those enzymes are on a clock because </v>

3181
02:28:31.570 --> 02:28:35.441
<v Speaker 3>humans are diurnal creatures where we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>meant to be awake and working and active</v>

3182
02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:38.120
<v Speaker 3>and thinking during the day and we sleep</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night,</v>

3183
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:43.150
<v Speaker 3>which is different from nocturnal </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures like some rodents and other </v>

3184
02:28:43.150 --> 02:28:43.150
<v Speaker 3>animals that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3185
02:28:43.150 --> 02:28:44.120
<v Speaker 3>sleep during the day and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or night.</v>

3186
02:28:44.330 --> 02:28:47.120
<v Speaker 3>So because we're men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are active during the day.</v>

3187
02:28:47.121 --> 02:28:48.140
<v Speaker 3>We're diurnal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these,</v>

3188
02:28:48.141 --> 02:28:50.150
<v Speaker 3>all of our metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>metabolism,</v>

3189
02:28:50.151 --> 02:28:52.910
<v Speaker 3>enzymes and all these things are active </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the day.</v>

3190
02:28:53.470 --> 02:28:56.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things that activate them are light,</v>

3191
02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:01.730
<v Speaker 3>light exposure and also food intake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And xenobiotic is also something,</v>

3192
02:29:01.731 --> 02:29:05.540
<v Speaker 3>so anything that gets metabolized like </v>
<v Speaker 3>buyer buyer system by your liver,</v>

3193
02:29:05.550 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 3>whatever activates these enzymes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>once they're activated,</v>

3194
02:29:09.380 --> 02:29:12.110
<v Speaker 3>they're on this like 12 hour clock where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3195
02:29:12.111 --> 02:29:14.870
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're metabolizing glucose,</v>

3196
02:29:14.871 --> 02:29:16.310
<v Speaker 3>fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things,</v>

3197
02:29:16.311 --> 02:29:21.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if you're eating within that 12 </v>

3198
02:29:21.311 --> 02:29:23.801
<v Speaker 3>hour clock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you go beyond that 12 hour </v>

3199
02:29:23.801 --> 02:29:26.471
<v Speaker 3>clock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when things start to go really </v>

3200
02:29:26.471 --> 02:29:28.010
<v Speaker 3>wrong because your metabolism enzymes </v>
<v Speaker 3>start to shut down and they're not doing</v>

3201
02:29:28.011 --> 02:29:28.700
<v Speaker 3>things properly.</v>

3202
02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:33.700
<v Speaker 3>So you're not like insulin responsive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not even fatty acids and things </v>

3203
02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:37.601
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just metabolism in general is not </v>

3204
02:29:37.601 --> 02:29:37.601
<v Speaker 3>working as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3205
02:29:37.601 --> 02:29:40.280
<v Speaker 3>after 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's kind of a big eyeopener.</v>

3206
02:29:40.310 --> 02:29:41.680
<v Speaker 3>I know there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3207
02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:45.290
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people think they eat 12 hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>time period.</v>

3208
02:29:45.291 --> 02:29:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were to survey them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3209
02:29:46.611 --> 02:29:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat more than 12 hours.</v>

3210
02:29:49.041 --> 02:29:54.041
<v Speaker 3>But there's actually a study done by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine who's a expert in this </v>

3211
02:29:54.041 --> 02:29:54.880
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's at the Sulk Institute.</v>

3212
02:29:54.881 --> 02:29:58.490
<v Speaker 3>His name is satchin panda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very good scientists.</v>

3213
02:29:58.550 --> 02:30:02.720
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed him on my podcast and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>done a lot of research on this,</v>

3214
02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:07.900
<v Speaker 3>this topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he did the human study where he had </v>

3215
02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:09.950
<v Speaker 3>like this app where people logged there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took pictures of the food that they</v>

3216
02:30:09.951 --> 02:30:11.560
<v Speaker 3>ate and it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3217
02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:16.600
<v Speaker 3>sent it to some database they had and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a timestamp on it so they could see </v>

3218
02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:16.600
<v Speaker 3>when the clock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>

3219
02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:18.560
<v Speaker 3>when their first cup of coffee or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever was in the morning,</v>

3220
02:30:18.561 --> 02:30:19.190
<v Speaker 3>and then when they were eating.</v>

3221
02:30:19.210 --> 02:30:23.450
<v Speaker 3>And I turned out most people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually eating in a 15 hour clock.</v>

3222
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:26.330
<v Speaker 3>So they were having their cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3223
02:30:26.331 --> 02:30:28.100
<v Speaker 3>at eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven in the morning.</v>

3224
02:30:28.101 --> 02:30:28.880
<v Speaker 3>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3225
02:30:28.890 --> 02:30:31.790
<v Speaker 3>they're eating at like nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

3226
02:30:31.791 --> 02:30:32.780
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10:00.</v>

3227
02:30:32.781 --> 02:30:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're eating much later.</v>

3228
02:30:35.050 --> 02:30:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3229
02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:39.050
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that when you do that,</v>

3230
02:30:39.051 --> 02:30:41.480
<v Speaker 3>you start to gain more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more fat.</v>

3231
02:30:41.481 --> 02:30:44.000
<v Speaker 3>You start to become more insulin </v>
<v Speaker 3>insensitive and you start to like,</v>

3232
02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:47.120
<v Speaker 3>your muscle starts to waste regardless </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what you eat,</v>

3233
02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:49.040
<v Speaker 3>regardless of what you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3234
02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:50.120
<v Speaker 3>so okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3235
02:30:50.121 --> 02:30:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I take that back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

3236
02:30:52.611 --> 02:30:54.920
<v Speaker 3>if you eat healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you eat healthy,</v>

3237
02:30:54.980 --> 02:30:57.770
<v Speaker 3>so if you're eating a terrible diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're eating a terrible diet,</v>

3238
02:30:58.040 --> 02:31:00.560
<v Speaker 3>and this has been shown in mice like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lard,</v>

3239
02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:03.800
<v Speaker 3>fat plus sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two together,</v>

3240
02:31:03.801 --> 02:31:08.801
<v Speaker 3>which is the actual bad combination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you brought that up and I'm gonna </v>

3241
02:31:08.801 --> 02:31:09.450
<v Speaker 3>make a note to keep those two are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad combination.</v>

3242
02:31:09.451 --> 02:31:10.790
<v Speaker 3>So if you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're eating that,</v>

3243
02:31:10.791 --> 02:31:15.791
<v Speaker 3>if you're feeding the mice that and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>let them eat whenever they want so they </v>

3244
02:31:15.791 --> 02:31:18.941
<v Speaker 3>can eat their nocturnal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just going to call it day and </v>

3245
02:31:18.941 --> 02:31:19.160
<v Speaker 3>their day is actually night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just know that that's true.</v>

3246
02:31:19.380 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 3>If they're eating</v>

3247
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:22.890
<v Speaker 2>during the day and night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gain like,</v>

3248
02:31:22.980 --> 02:31:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of ways to come.</v>

3249
02:31:24.430 --> 02:31:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Fat become like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3250
02:31:25.831 --> 02:31:27.840
<v Speaker 2>type two diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fatty liver.</v>

3251
02:31:27.841 --> 02:31:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're just a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're breaking down like,</v>

3252
02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:34.200
<v Speaker 2>like earlier than they should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you eat normal,</v>

3253
02:31:34.201 --> 02:31:36.870
<v Speaker 2>so if you're eating a healthy diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not high fat,</v>

3254
02:31:36.871 --> 02:31:39.330
<v Speaker 2>high sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily,</v>

3255
02:31:39.331 --> 02:31:41.550
<v Speaker 2>you're not necessarily gonna gain more </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

3256
02:31:42.020 --> 02:31:47.020
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't become type two diabetic and </v>

3257
02:31:47.020 --> 02:31:47.020
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not eating all the crap.</v>

3258
02:31:47.020 --> 02:31:50.870
<v Speaker 2>So you probably just going to be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you take that same mouse who </v>

3259
02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:55.910
<v Speaker 2>eating a healthy diet and you make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat within a time restricted window of </v>

3260
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:58.050
<v Speaker 2>at least 12 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the best wisdom,</v>

3261
02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:02.040
<v Speaker 2>nine to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gain way more muscle mass.</v>

3262
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:04.200
<v Speaker 2>This is on a normal diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just way more muscle mass.</v>

3263
02:32:04.201 --> 02:32:09.201
<v Speaker 2>And if they ate within a nine hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>window they had like a really improved </v>

3264
02:32:09.201 --> 02:32:09.201
<v Speaker 2>endurance.</v>

3265
02:32:09.201 --> 02:32:11.670
<v Speaker 2>That's something I've noticed in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat within a nine hour window and I go</v>

3266
02:32:11.671 --> 02:32:16.671
<v Speaker 2>for a run the next morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My endurance is like very noticeably </v>

3267
02:32:16.921 --> 02:32:19.860
<v Speaker 2>improved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like extremely noticeably improved.</v>

3268
02:32:19.890 --> 02:32:22.850
<v Speaker 2>So do you have like a timer or like how </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you do,</v>

3269
02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:25.200
<v Speaker 2>do you time yourself at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your day?</v>

3270
02:32:25.201 --> 02:32:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Like when you first eat and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3271
02:32:27.511 --> 02:32:32.511
<v Speaker 2>So I typically will make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my friend Kevin rose has an APP that </v>

3272
02:32:32.511 --> 02:32:34.110
<v Speaker 2>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called darn what did he.</v>

3273
02:32:34.770 --> 02:32:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Kevin rose has an APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3274
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had them on.</v>

3275
02:32:37.731 --> 02:32:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3276
02:32:38.731 --> 02:32:41.560
<v Speaker 2>he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just cute agenda proponent as well.</v>

3277
02:32:42.030 --> 02:32:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't actually do Keto anymore </v>

3278
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:48.771
<v Speaker 2>because it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after he got a bunch of blood work done </v>

3279
02:32:48.771 --> 02:32:49.830
<v Speaker 2>and I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's different,</v>

3280
02:32:49.831 --> 02:32:54.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes that people have that can affect </v>

3281
02:32:54.831 --> 02:32:54.831
<v Speaker 2>the way they respond to that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

3282
02:32:54.831 --> 02:32:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time people can respond </v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

3283
02:32:55.651 --> 02:33:00.651
<v Speaker 2>but there's a dizzy was on here just one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them long ago introducing zero that's</v>

3284
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:04.410
<v Speaker 2>app to help you fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he has an app that helps you do that.</v>

3285
02:33:04.411 --> 02:33:06.090
<v Speaker 2>That actually works really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>

3286
02:33:06.091 --> 02:33:11.091
<v Speaker 2>what I do is I'm just kind of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and I just remember it that </v>

3287
02:33:11.091 --> 02:33:11.091
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

3288
02:33:11.091 --> 02:33:13.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my first cup of coffee at 8:00</v>

3289
02:33:13.770 --> 02:33:18.770
<v Speaker 2>AM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his app actually is really cool </v>

3290
02:33:18.770 --> 02:33:18.770
<v Speaker 2>because it really helps you keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragging.</v>

3291
02:33:18.770 --> 02:33:19.770
<v Speaker 2>It sends you reminders so like helps </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3292
02:33:19.771 --> 02:33:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And it's a free app.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So powerful.</v>

3293
02:33:22.201 --> 02:33:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Kevin rose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

3294
02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:28.760
<v Speaker 2>it's really cool because you can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally these mice were gaining </v>

3295
02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:32.181
<v Speaker 2>more muscle mass just not by doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything but eating within this time </v>

3296
02:33:32.181 --> 02:33:33.080
<v Speaker 2>restricted window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3297
02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:36.300
<v Speaker 2>the thing that was also very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this was that,</v>

3298
02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:41.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could cheat a couple of days a week </v>

3299
02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:45.230
<v Speaker 2>so they could like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say weekends when you have </v>

3300
02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:45.510
<v Speaker 2>like social events and you're like out </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking or whatever,</v>

3301
02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:51.260
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can cheat two nights and still have </v>

3302
02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:51.810
<v Speaker 2>the same benefits so that at least in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mice,</v>

3303
02:33:51.811 --> 02:33:53.130
<v Speaker 2>we don't know if that's the same for </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

3304
02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Sachin's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to aggregate some data with </v>

3305
02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:01.011
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually has an ongoing trial that </v>

3306
02:34:01.011 --> 02:34:01.011
<v Speaker 2>anyone can sign up for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3307
02:34:01.011 --> 02:34:05.240
<v Speaker 2>it's called my circadian clock and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>an also an app on his phone that you </v>

3308
02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:07.290
<v Speaker 2>just basically all you do is sign a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consent form,</v>

3309
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:12.110
<v Speaker 2>take pictures of your food and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like allow certain data,</v>

3310
02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:13.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

3311
02:34:13.411 --> 02:34:14.970
<v Speaker 2>different fitness data for them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>collect.</v>

3312
02:34:14.971 --> 02:34:16.920
<v Speaker 2>And so they're doing this clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>

3313
02:34:17.410 --> 02:34:19.030
<v Speaker 2>humans from data that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggregating,</v>

3314
02:34:19.031 --> 02:34:22.150
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jen is fasting tracker right now.</v>

3315
02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do,</v>

3316
02:34:23.801 --> 02:34:26.230
<v Speaker 2>he has different options for Kevin's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting.</v>

3317
02:34:26.231 --> 02:34:29.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like the circadian option,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the one I'm talking about.</v>

3318
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:34.590
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing intermittent fasting and what's </v>

3319
02:34:34.590 --> 02:34:35.580
<v Speaker 2>the circadian option?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the time restricted eating.</v>

3320
02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:40.600
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just basically circadian is the </v>

3321
02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:40.600
<v Speaker 2>circadian clock you're on.</v>

3322
02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:42.160
<v Speaker 2>So that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this 24 hour cycle day,</v>

3323
02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:47.280
<v Speaker 2>day night cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So eating within at least a 12 hour </v>

3324
02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:49.720
<v Speaker 2>window is so 12 hour is the most you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever most.</v>

3325
02:34:49.721 --> 02:34:54.721
<v Speaker 2>So if you get up at 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and that's when you have </v>

3326
02:34:54.721 --> 02:34:54.721
<v Speaker 2>your first cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when it starts.</v>

3327
02:34:54.721 --> 02:34:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Not with food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts with First Cup of coffee.</v>

3328
02:34:56.561 --> 02:35:01.561
<v Speaker 2>Because that's interesting because a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people don't think that they think </v>

3329
02:35:01.561 --> 02:35:02.110
<v Speaker 2>that they're still fast and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cup of coffee and then they go run.</v>

3330
02:35:02.350 --> 02:35:05.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so because coffee,</v>

3331
02:35:05.711 --> 02:35:10.711
<v Speaker 2>even if it's black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people think if they have black </v>

3332
02:35:10.711 --> 02:35:10.711
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fasting and they go run.</v>

3333
02:35:10.711 --> 02:35:12.790
<v Speaker 2>But black coffee is caffeine is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>xenobiotic.</v>

3334
02:35:12.791 --> 02:35:15.370
<v Speaker 2>It's something that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolized by liver enzymes.</v>

3335
02:35:15.371 --> 02:35:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Your gut processes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anything that happens in water,</v>

3336
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:20.680
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything other than water.</v>

3337
02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:25.740
<v Speaker 2>And the same goes for like taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin pills and drinking herbal tea </v>

3338
02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:25.740
<v Speaker 2>late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the same,</v>

3339
02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:26.980
<v Speaker 2>the same thing goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even herbal tea.</v>

3340
02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Herbal tea is also got irb stuff in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Kevin non-caffeinated herbal tea.</v>

3341
02:35:32.130 --> 02:35:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because those are xenobiotics camomile.</v>

3342
02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean that stuff's got to be processed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by your liver,</v>

3343
02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:38.410
<v Speaker 2>your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3344
02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:41.320
<v Speaker 2>it's not water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

3345
02:35:41.321 --> 02:35:46.321
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that's kind of a </v>

3346
02:35:46.321 --> 02:35:46.321
<v Speaker 2>big question and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3347
02:35:46.321 --> 02:35:47.230
<v Speaker 2>if the fascinate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're,</v>

3348
02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:52.320
<v Speaker 2>you're eating within a nine hour window </v>
<v Speaker 2>or 10 hour window is optimal.</v>

3349
02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Nine hours is really what I found to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimal for endurance in terms of the </v>

3350
02:35:58.200 --> 02:35:59.920
<v Speaker 2>animal studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 10 hours.</v>

3351
02:35:59.921 --> 02:36:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Also if they eating their healthy diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>within 10 hours,</v>

3352
02:36:02.921 --> 02:36:07.030
<v Speaker 2>they still had um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they increase their lean muscle mass.</v>

3353
02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:11.020
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have to do anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No extra exercising it just because what</v>

3354
02:36:11.021 --> 02:36:13.480
<v Speaker 2>was happening is they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were basically,</v>

3355
02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their mitochondria are working better </v>

3356
02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.530
<v Speaker 2>and they were also.</v>

3357
02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting rid of fat easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

3358
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:23.140
<v Speaker 2>so it increased their lean muscle mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible because I,</v>

3359
02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:26.710
<v Speaker 2>I late at night all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you're a comedian.</v>

3360
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably eat after a show or </v>

3361
02:36:31.950 --> 02:36:31.950
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came home last night at 2:00</v>

3362
02:36:31.950 --> 02:36:32.230
<v Speaker 2>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigged out after a show.</v>

3363
02:36:32.260 --> 02:36:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was healthy food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Kiefer and pistachio nuts.</v>

3364
02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I buy those big jugs of shelled </v>
<v Speaker 2>pistachios shells,</v>

3365
02:36:42.010 --> 02:36:47.010
<v Speaker 2>so I just eat like piles of pistachios </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like I'm not eating </v>

3366
02:36:47.010 --> 02:36:47.530
<v Speaker 2>anything bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good for you.</v>

3367
02:36:47.890 --> 02:36:51.210
<v Speaker 2>But this knowledge now knowing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to.</v>

3368
02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:54.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to cut that out now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please let me know how that goes.</v>

3369
02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:55.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3370
02:36:55.871 --> 02:36:57.100
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3371
02:36:57.101 --> 02:36:58.060
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can cheat.</v>

3372
02:36:58.061 --> 02:36:59.980
<v Speaker 2>There is cheating at least in mice </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice.</v>

3373
02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Twice a week was okay.</v>

3374
02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Two Times a week is a good cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3375
02:37:03.581 --> 02:37:05.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of cool because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a weekend.</v>

3376
02:37:05.231 --> 02:37:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3377
02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:07.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have your social event it,</v>

3378
02:37:07.991 --> 02:37:10.360
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to do with social events and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3379
02:37:10.361 --> 02:37:15.361
<v Speaker 2>If you have like something late and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of have to fast are all early in </v>

3380
02:37:15.361 --> 02:37:16.070
<v Speaker 2>the morning all the way up and so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do it later,</v>

3381
02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:21.520
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do a lot of workouts fasted now </v>

3382
02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:24.740
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that I like to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is I'd get up in the morning without </v>

3383
02:37:24.740 --> 02:37:26.470
<v Speaker 2>having anything and then I work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've been having coffee so I,</v>

3384
02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:28.430
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will see.</v>

3385
02:37:28.431 --> 02:37:33.431
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is kind of what I was talking </v>

3386
02:37:33.431 --> 02:37:33.431
<v Speaker 2>with Satya and about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's,</v>

3387
02:37:33.431 --> 02:37:37.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're fasting itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fasting itself is having a positive </v>

3388
02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:38.120
<v Speaker 2>effect on all these enzymes.</v>

3389
02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:42.590
<v Speaker 2>So maybe there's some sort of canceled </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3390
02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:43.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3391
02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:45.890
<v Speaker 2>it's not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not as good I would say.</v>

3392
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:51.250
<v Speaker 2>So just water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have actual empirical data on </v>

3393
02:37:51.250 --> 02:37:51.250
<v Speaker 2>that saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3394
02:37:51.250 --> 02:37:55.361
<v Speaker 2>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that Satya and </v>

3395
02:37:55.361 --> 02:37:55.361
<v Speaker 2>would like to look at and humans because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big question.</v>

3396
02:37:55.361 --> 02:37:57.480
<v Speaker 2>What if you are just fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3397
02:37:57.490 --> 02:37:59.870
<v Speaker 2>in the bay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In theory it's not,</v>

3398
02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:02.360
<v Speaker 2>you're starting all those clocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The clocks are difficult.</v>

3399
02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Caffeine starts the clocks that's around</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3400
02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:05.860
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3401
02:38:05.950 --> 02:38:08.330
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting changes your metabolism in a way</v>

3402
02:38:08.331 --> 02:38:09.350
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes it better.</v>

3403
02:38:09.351 --> 02:38:12.710
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's not quite as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not quite as bad,</v>

3404
02:38:12.711 --> 02:38:14.120
<v Speaker 2>but not as formal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3405
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's perfect.</v>

3406
02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So shoot for nine hours.</v>

3407
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:21.500
<v Speaker 2>That was like that nine hours is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>

3408
02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:24.050
<v Speaker 2>especially for endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like enhancements,</v>

3409
02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:27.440
<v Speaker 2>like really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get up and you're at,</v>

3410
02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:29.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're up at 8:00</v>

3411
02:38:29.571 --> 02:38:31.040
<v Speaker 2>in the morning or 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning,</v>

3412
02:38:31.041 --> 02:38:36.041
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you almost have to eat dinner like at </v>

3413
02:38:36.041 --> 02:38:36.041
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>

3414
02:38:36.041 --> 02:38:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>

3415
02:38:36.681 --> 02:38:41.681
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to either fast in the morning </v>

3416
02:38:41.681 --> 02:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>where you have to eat early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really hard for working people </v>

3417
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:45.470
<v Speaker 2>nine to fivers yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like you're eating breakfast</v>

3418
02:38:45.471 --> 02:38:48.570
<v Speaker 2>before you go to work unless you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

3419
02:38:48.700 --> 02:38:50.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of the problem for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are going,</v>

3420
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:52.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans,</v>

3421
02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:54.780
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3422
02:38:54.890 --> 02:38:57.550
<v Speaker 2>life is kind of different now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

3423
02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:02.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people that we're talking </v>

3424
02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:04.061
<v Speaker 2>about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just take their breakfast to work </v>

3425
02:39:04.061 --> 02:39:04.061
<v Speaker 2>and they wait so they'll wait till like </v>
<v Speaker 2>10:00</v>

3426
02:39:04.061 --> 02:39:07.841
<v Speaker 2>to eat or something like that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>also there's people that like to go to </v>

3427
02:39:07.841 --> 02:39:08.480
<v Speaker 2>the gym after work and so that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3428
02:39:08.481 --> 02:39:11.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like you gotta get a racist clock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to eat,</v>

3429
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:16.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so really if you can start the clock </v>

3430
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:18.371
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's possible for people that are </v>

3431
02:39:18.371 --> 02:39:18.590
<v Speaker 2>working like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have flexible hours,</v>

3432
02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:23.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then it would be better to start </v>

3433
02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:23.900
<v Speaker 2>the clock later.</v>

3434
02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:27.100
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of human data on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just looking at like the </v>

3435
02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:30.311
<v Speaker 2>associations between people that eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>within an 11 hour period and fast for 13</v>

3436
02:39:31.161 --> 02:39:32.750
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

3437
02:39:32.751 --> 02:39:34.850
<v Speaker 2>women that do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have already had breast cancer,</v>

3438
02:39:34.851 --> 02:39:38.480
<v Speaker 2>they reduced their breast cancer risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>recurrence by like 40 percent,</v>

3439
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:39.740
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3440
02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it lowers,</v>

3441
02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:42.130
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3442
02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:46.220
<v Speaker 2>it causes insulin sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it lowers igf one levels.</v>

3443
02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:47.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

3444
02:39:47.250 --> 02:39:50.840
<v Speaker 2>it lowers all these hormones and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are known to promote cancer growth.</v>

3445
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:53.690
<v Speaker 2>It's really a powerful thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>improves metabolism,</v>

3446
02:39:53.930 --> 02:39:56.700
<v Speaker 2>really improves metabolism and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that um,</v>

3447
02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:01.960
<v Speaker 2>a couple of scientists that I've talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that are at UCFC are looking at and </v>

3448
02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:04.110
<v Speaker 2>actively seeing that it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be really important.</v>

3449
02:40:04.111 --> 02:40:07.640
<v Speaker 2>And obviously people doing shift work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nurses are kind of.</v>

3450
02:40:07.730 --> 02:40:12.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other kind of fucked when you're </v>

3451
02:40:12.730 --> 02:40:12.730
<v Speaker 2>doing that late shift stuff and they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3452
02:40:12.730 --> 02:40:14.020
<v Speaker 2>They have twice the cancer incidents </v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

3453
02:40:14.270 --> 02:40:15.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twice,</v>

3454
02:40:15.390 --> 02:40:19.110
<v Speaker 3>twice shift workers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're also much more likely to be type</v>

3455
02:40:19.111 --> 02:40:20.260
<v Speaker 3>two diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3456
02:40:20.261 --> 02:40:22.890
<v Speaker 3>it's because you're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating.</v>

3457
02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating,</v>

3458
02:40:25.501 --> 02:40:27.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your metabolism is all screwed up.</v>

3459
02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Not only are you like when you're eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the 12 hour clock are you not as </v>

3460
02:40:32.900 --> 02:40:36.420
<v Speaker 3>insulin sensitive and so your blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>glucose levels are higher also.</v>

3461
02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:39.300
<v Speaker 3>You're confusing your clock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it Kinda like it says,</v>

3462
02:40:39.301 --> 02:40:41.430
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm restarting now because it's late.</v>

3463
02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:45.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting my first signal in its after</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been after 12 hours.</v>

3464
02:40:45.261 --> 02:40:47.350
<v Speaker 3>And it confused it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then when you go to sleep,</v>

3465
02:40:47.351 --> 02:40:52.351
<v Speaker 3>say you eat at two in the morning and go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sleep and you wake up the next </v>

3466
02:40:52.351 --> 02:40:55.700
<v Speaker 3>morning and you have your meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's already going to have started that </v>

3467
02:40:55.700 --> 02:40:58.521
<v Speaker 3>clock a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you won't be as insulin sensitive </v>

3468
02:40:58.521 --> 02:41:01.790
<v Speaker 3>because the earlier in the day you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>the more the more insulin sensitive you </v>

3469
02:41:01.790 --> 02:41:01.790
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

3470
02:41:01.790 --> 02:41:05.300
<v Speaker 3>So you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you kind of like confused in the </v>

3471
02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:05.300
<v Speaker 3>clock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this.</v>

3472
02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:09.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very complicated but I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>important mechanism and system for </v>

3473
02:41:10.381 --> 02:41:13.470
<v Speaker 3>people to understand and time restricted</v>
<v Speaker 3>time restricted eating,</v>

3474
02:41:14.100 --> 02:41:19.100
<v Speaker 3>like I have really implemented that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think that's something that </v>

3475
02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:22.190
<v Speaker 3>also will affect the aging process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to people like at </v>

3476
02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:26.451
<v Speaker 3>conferences I've given a talk at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have come up to me afterwards and there </v>

3477
02:41:26.451 --> 02:41:30.340
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about how they've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a ketogenic diet for two years and </v>

3478
02:41:30.340 --> 02:41:30.660
<v Speaker 3>how it would reverse your type two </v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetes.</v>

3479
02:41:30.661 --> 02:41:35.661
<v Speaker 3>It's been great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still their fasting blood glucose </v>

3480
02:41:35.661 --> 02:41:37.410
<v Speaker 3>levels were still in the high end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3481
02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:39.450
<v Speaker 3>even though they're no longer a type two</v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetic,</v>

3482
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:44.590
<v Speaker 3>which is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they started doing the time </v>

3483
02:41:44.590 --> 02:41:47.181
<v Speaker 3>restricted eating or they're eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>within a nine hour window and it </v>

3484
02:41:47.181 --> 02:41:47.181
<v Speaker 3>completely resolved.</v>

3485
02:41:47.181 --> 02:41:50.900
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely resolved it and it actually </v>

3486
02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:53.130
<v Speaker 3>had multiple people tell me that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the amazing thing is the increase</v>

3487
02:41:53.131 --> 02:41:56.010
<v Speaker 3>in muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the muscle is really the increase,</v>

3488
02:41:56.050 --> 02:41:57.870
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the interesting part.</v>

3489
02:41:58.170 --> 02:42:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I would like to like talk to such and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more about that and have him do more </v>

3490
02:42:03.170 --> 02:42:03.230
<v Speaker 3>experiments of possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3491
02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:07.080
<v Speaker 3>because we didn't dive as much into that</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the podcast and we chatted,</v>

3492
02:42:07.081 --> 02:42:09.840
<v Speaker 3>but he is such a phenomenal scientist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's very,</v>

3493
02:42:10.090 --> 02:42:13.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proactive and into health and all this,</v>

3494
02:42:13.321 --> 02:42:18.321

<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great person at the salk institute in La</v>

<v Speaker 3>Very prestigious place to be.</v>

3497
02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:22.730
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of really good scientists </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I met with him there.</v>

3500

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3502
02:42:30.571 --> 02:42:32.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to meet with people when I,</v>

3503
02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:34.420
<v Speaker 3>when I interviewed them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3504
02:42:34.570 --> 02:42:35.110
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3505
02:42:35.730 --> 02:42:39.210

<v Speaker 3>ones and they're just,</v>

3506
02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:42.270
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's a disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something missing.</v>

3507
02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nice for you is you actually have</v>

3508

<v Speaker 3>a studio and people come to your studio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right now I'm,</v>

3509
02:42:47.980 --> 02:42:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm like going around to institutes and </v>

02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:55.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3511
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:55.550
<v Speaker 3>talk and I'm like this great scientist </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3512
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:56.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask people to,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's his,</v>

3516
02:43:09.181 --> 02:43:11.920
<v Speaker 3>because he's Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we shortened to Satchin</v>

3517
02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:16.210
<v Speaker 2>but he's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a really good person to talk to you</v>

3518

<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he is very uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

3520
02:43:19.451 --> 02:43:21.820
<v Speaker 2>he speaks eloquently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He explained things well.</v>

3521
02:43:21.821 --> 02:43:23.920
<v Speaker 2>He's a little bit of an Indian accent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3522
02:43:23.921 --> 02:43:25.690
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like cute,</v>

3523
02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:29.830
<v Speaker 2>but his science has changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3524
02:43:29.950 --> 02:43:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my circadian knowledge.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3526
02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:38.060
<v Speaker 2>I've been following him for a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really looked up to him for if in </v>

3527
02:43:38.060 --> 02:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>fact I don't even know if I told them </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3528
02:43:38.231 --> 02:43:40.300
<v Speaker 2>but I was interested in doing a post doc</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>

3529
02:43:40.730 --> 02:43:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like after I'd finished my phd because I</v>

3530
02:43:43.061 --> 02:43:48.061
<v Speaker 2>thought his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was back back in 2012 when I </v>

3531
02:43:48.061 --> 02:43:50.851
<v Speaker 2>graduated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was making these discoveries about </v>

3532
02:43:50.851 --> 02:43:51.370
<v Speaker 2>late night eating and how it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it makes you,</v>

3533
02:43:51.371 --> 02:43:52.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3534
02:43:52.090 --> 02:43:57.040
<v Speaker 2>more so you basically more insulin </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistant,</v>

3535
02:43:57.041 --> 02:44:02.041
<v Speaker 2>how it's like screwing up brain function</v>
<v Speaker 2>to all these things that I didn't even </v>

3536
02:44:02.041 --> 02:44:02.041
<v Speaker 2>talk about and start.</v>

3537
02:44:02.041 --> 02:44:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I got really interested in it because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know a lot of people that eat late at </v>

3538
02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:08.320
<v Speaker 2>night and people that are having trouble</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing weight and all that,</v>

3539
02:44:08.321 --> 02:44:09.520
<v Speaker 2>they're eating late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

3540
02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

3541
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to listen to his podcast with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and,</v>

3542
02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:15.480
<v Speaker 2>or your podcasts with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3543
02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:17.080
<v Speaker 2>check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

3544
02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:18.820
<v Speaker 2>that sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be cool.</v>

3545
02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:22.720
<v Speaker 2>So the saturated fat sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you wanted to narrow that down?</v>

3546
02:44:22.970 --> 02:44:27.970
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you actually sent me an article </v>

3547
02:44:27.970 --> 02:44:30.451
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I found was really fascinating </v>

3548
02:44:30.451 --> 02:44:31.270
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although saturated fat is important,</v>

3549
02:44:31.271 --> 02:44:34.300
<v Speaker 2>it's how would you describe it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>precursor to hormones?</v>

3550
02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:37.300
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a precursor to hormones,</v>

3551
02:44:37.330 --> 02:44:39.130
<v Speaker 2>so saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat,</v>

3552
02:44:39.550 --> 02:44:44.550
<v Speaker 2>increases ldl cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ldl lipoproteins,</v>

3553
02:44:45.650 --> 02:44:47.670
<v Speaker 2>proteins which carry cholesterol and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatty acids.</v>

3554
02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:50.140
<v Speaker 2>We always call it cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a type of it.</v>

3555
02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:55.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a transporter of cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also transports fatty acids and </v>

3556
02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:55.500
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

3557
02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:57.380
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3558
02:44:57.490 --> 02:45:01.120
<v Speaker 2>the Ldl is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important because,</v>

3559
02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:06.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you make a new cell in your </v>

3560
02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:06.500
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is happening constantly,</v>

3561
02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:07.570
<v Speaker 2>you're always making new immune cells </v>
<v Speaker 2>are making new kidney cells.</v>

3562
02:45:07.571 --> 02:45:09.190
<v Speaker 2>You're making new liver cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3563
02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:12.370
<v Speaker 2>it's happening all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you make a new cell,</v>

3564
02:45:12.371 --> 02:45:17.371
<v Speaker 2>you need ldl there to transport </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol and fatty acids because cell</v>

3565
02:45:18.041 --> 02:45:19.510
<v Speaker 2>membrane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cell itself,</v>

3566
02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:24.720
<v Speaker 2>the membrane is made of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has fatty acids and cholesterol and </v>

3567
02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:25.870
<v Speaker 2>phospholipids and other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so you need that cholesterol.</v>

3568
02:45:26.020 --> 02:45:28.060
<v Speaker 2>When you damage the cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3569
02:45:28.061 --> 02:45:30.760
<v Speaker 2>and you're repairing that damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cholesterol needs to be there.</v>

3570
02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:31.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3571
02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:33.940
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really need cholesterol.</v>

3572
02:45:33.941 --> 02:45:35.920
<v Speaker 2>LDL cholesterol is very important for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3573
02:45:35.980 --> 02:45:38.800
<v Speaker 2>for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and without it you're kind of screwed,</v>

3574
02:45:39.430 --> 02:45:44.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't like repair damaged as </v>

3575
02:45:44.430 --> 02:45:46.591
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to make as many new </v>

3576
02:45:46.591 --> 02:45:47.881
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all these people that are avoiding </v>

3577
02:45:47.881 --> 02:45:48.280
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat and cholesterol in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

3578
02:45:48.340 --> 02:45:53.340
<v Speaker 2>they're doing the literal doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally doing their cell regeneration </v>

3579
02:45:53.810 --> 02:45:55.330
<v Speaker 2>the disservice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3580
02:45:55.331 --> 02:46:00.331
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make that broad state </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know what else they're </v>

3581
02:46:00.331 --> 02:46:02.950
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're getting other types of </v>

3582
02:46:02.950 --> 02:46:02.950
<v Speaker 2>fatty acids that also helped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

3583
02:46:02.950 --> 02:46:04.030
<v Speaker 2>people that are like on stands for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

3584
02:46:04.390 --> 02:46:09.390
<v Speaker 2>which is a very broad way of inhibiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>like cholesterol synthesis</v>

3585
02:46:11.060 --> 02:46:13.040
<v Speaker 3>brought like fullstop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3586
02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:16.850
<v Speaker 3>that's why a lot of those people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>statens I'm one of the major,</v>

3587
02:46:16.851 --> 02:46:19.790
<v Speaker 3>major side effects is muscle atrophy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle wasting.</v>

3588
02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:21.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because your muscles,</v>

3589
02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:26.230
<v Speaker 3>one of those cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're constantly repairing damage and </v>

3590
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.230
<v Speaker 3>making the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a big,</v>

3591
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:28.790
<v Speaker 3>big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge problem with Staton staton users.</v>

3592
02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:31.310
<v Speaker 3>It also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a colleague of mine,</v>

3593
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Ron Kraus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's at a children's hospital in </v>

3594
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:40.061
<v Speaker 3>Oakland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has been studying status and their </v>

3595
02:46:40.061 --> 02:46:42.731
<v Speaker 3>effect on Mitochondria and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me that it's like toxic to </v>

3596
02:46:42.731 --> 02:46:45.600
<v Speaker 3>mitochondria and he's trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out why is.</v>

3597
02:46:45.630 --> 02:46:48.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's partly why it's.</v>

3598
02:46:48.051 --> 02:46:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm also causing muscle wasting.</v>

3599
02:46:51.790 --> 02:46:56.790
<v Speaker 4>So if people don't consume saturated </v>
<v Speaker 4>fats or they lower their radically lower</v>

3600
02:46:57.461 --> 02:47:02.461
<v Speaker 4>the saturated fat in their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does their body produced new cell </v>

3601
02:47:02.461 --> 02:47:02.500
<v Speaker 4>membranes?</v>

3602
02:47:03.060 --> 02:47:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3603
02:47:03.601 --> 02:47:04.470
<v Speaker 3>you still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3604
02:47:04.471 --> 02:47:09.030
<v Speaker 3>you're making cholesterol in your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're making it from there.</v>

3605
02:47:09.031 --> 02:47:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Getting fatty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're getting it from plants.</v>

3606
02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:13.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean plant sterols,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting them from,</v>

3607
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:15.630
<v Speaker 3>from other sources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3608
02:47:15.631 --> 02:47:20.280
<v Speaker 3>but I think the problem with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the saturated fat was,</v>

3609
02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:24.450
<v Speaker 3>it's not so much that because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>still get it to some degree.</v>

3610
02:47:24.451 --> 02:47:26.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not an optimal.</v>

3611
02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3612
02:47:28.110 --> 02:47:29.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't attack.</v>

3613
02:47:29.850 --> 02:47:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to see like the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it varies depending on what else</v>

3614
02:47:33.061 --> 02:47:34.370
<v Speaker 3>they're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3615
02:47:34.380 --> 02:47:39.380
<v Speaker 3>the Pr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the problem was that saturated </v>

3616
02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:39.380
<v Speaker 3>fat was demonized.</v>

3617
02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was demonized in a very corrupt way,</v>

3618
02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:42.080
<v Speaker 4>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3619
02:47:42.090 --> 02:47:44.580
<v Speaker 4>the recent New York Times article that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was released,</v>

3620
02:47:44.581 --> 02:47:49.581
<v Speaker 4>which was a mindblower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which detailed how the sugar industry </v>

3621
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:54.590
<v Speaker 4>had bribed scientists to release data </v>
<v Speaker 4>blaming saturated fat for heart disease </v>

3622
02:47:56.641 --> 02:48:01.641
<v Speaker 4>and obesity and all these issues when it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was in fact sugar that was causing all </v>

3623
02:48:01.641 --> 02:48:05.361
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they were literally rigging the </v>

3624
02:48:05.361 --> 02:48:08.061
<v Speaker 4>system and paying scientists and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>a horrible article because that </v>

3625
02:48:08.061 --> 02:48:10.830
<v Speaker 4>propaganda and these lies that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>spread,</v>

3626
02:48:10.831 --> 02:48:12.720
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here it is,</v>

3627
02:48:12.721 --> 02:48:17.721
<v Speaker 4>how the sugar industry shifted the blame</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fat and it's if you get a chance and </v>

3628
02:48:17.851 --> 02:48:21.210
<v Speaker 4>you want to feel sick at what can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>done with money,</v>

3629
02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:24.870
<v Speaker 4>watch or read that because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's awful.</v>

3630
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:27.730
<v Speaker 4>It is really awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

3631
02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:32.900
<v Speaker 4>it was an internal sugar industry </v>
<v Speaker 4>document that was discovered by a </v>

3632
02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:33.870
<v Speaker 4>researcher at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 4>California in San Francisco.</v>

3633
02:48:33.871 --> 02:48:36.740
<v Speaker 4>And it was published,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said Monday when this was out,</v>

3634
02:48:36.750 --> 02:48:40.290
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was a couple of months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was amazing.</v>

3635
02:48:40.291 --> 02:48:45.291
<v Speaker 4>It suggested that five decades of </v>
<v Speaker 4>research into the role of nutrition in </v>

3636
02:48:45.291 --> 02:48:49.041
<v Speaker 4>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including many of today's dietary </v>

3637
02:48:49.041 --> 02:48:51.171
<v Speaker 4>recommendations may have been largely </v>
<v Speaker 4>shaped by the sugar industry and </v>

3638
02:48:51.171 --> 02:48:55.731
<v Speaker 4>propaganda and money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They spent money to literally bribe </v>

3639
02:48:55.731 --> 02:48:57.540
<v Speaker 4>scientists to release false data.</v>

3640
02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:00.700
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really nasty,</v>

3641
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:03.040
<v Speaker 3>but I mean the thing is not that much </v>
<v Speaker 3>money either there.</v>

3642
02:49:03.041 --> 02:49:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Here's</v>

3643
02:49:03.250 --> 02:49:04.190
<v Speaker 4>a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go back to it.</v>

3644
02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They paid three Harvard scientists </v>

3645
02:49:09.700 --> 02:49:12.270
<v Speaker 4>equivalent of $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>in today's dollars to publish in 1967.</v>

3646
02:49:12.271 --> 02:49:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Review of research on sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fat and heart disease.</v>

3647
02:49:15.140 --> 02:49:19.140
<v Speaker 4>Studies using the review were handpicked</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the Sugar Group and the article which</v>

3648
02:49:19.141 --> 02:49:20.680
<v Speaker 4>was published in the prestigious New </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jersey.</v>

3649
02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:25.700
<v Speaker 4>New England Journal of medicine minimize</v>
<v Speaker 4>the link between sugar and heart health </v>

3650
02:49:25.700 --> 02:49:29.510
<v Speaker 4>and cast aspirations on the role of </v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat even though the influence </v>

3651
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:31.620
<v Speaker 4>peddling revealed and documents dates </v>
<v Speaker 4>back to nearly 50 years.</v>

3652
02:49:32.070 --> 02:49:37.070
<v Speaker 4>More recent reports show that the food </v>
<v Speaker 4>industry has continued to influence </v>

3653
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:37.070
<v Speaker 4>nutrition science.</v>

3654
02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:42.860
<v Speaker 3>This had such a negative like con.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was such negative consequences </v>

3655
02:49:45.121 --> 02:49:47.490
<v Speaker 3>from this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from from the demonization and saturated</v>

3656
02:49:47.491 --> 02:49:52.080
<v Speaker 3>fat because people then obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>started eating more refined,</v>

3657
02:49:52.140 --> 02:49:54.630
<v Speaker 3>like for breakfast in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of having eggs,</v>

3658
02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:59.900
<v Speaker 3>you're having like cereal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real problem was the trans fats </v>

3659
02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:01.890
<v Speaker 3>because trans fats can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can have similar,</v>

3660
02:50:01.891 --> 02:50:03.960
<v Speaker 3>but their hydrogenated hydrogenated </v>
<v Speaker 3>fats,</v>

3661
02:50:03.961 --> 02:50:05.450
<v Speaker 3>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take like a,</v>

3662
02:50:05.950 --> 02:50:08.910
<v Speaker 3>a mono saturated fat and hydrated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have similar properties,</v>

3663
02:50:08.940 --> 02:50:10.890
<v Speaker 3>properties as a saturated fat like </v>
<v Speaker 3>butter,</v>

3664
02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:14.730
<v Speaker 3>how it's solid and then melts at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher temperature.</v>

3665
02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:20.240
<v Speaker 3>But these trans fats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember my mom had a big tub </v>

3666
02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:24.231
<v Speaker 3>of margarine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we used to put margin on our </v>

3667
02:50:24.231 --> 02:50:26.490
<v Speaker 3>mashed potatoes and everybody thought it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was healthy and it was so.</v>

3668
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:28.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just unhealthy.</v>

3669
02:50:28.561 --> 02:50:30.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's called,</v>

3670
02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:32.850
<v Speaker 3>it causes heart disease because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trans fats,</v>

3671
02:50:32.851 --> 02:50:37.851
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take these fats up into your new </v>

3672
02:50:37.851 --> 02:50:37.851
<v Speaker 3>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3673
02:50:37.851 --> 02:50:37.851
<v Speaker 3>Because that's part of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3674
02:50:37.851 --> 02:50:42.200
<v Speaker 3>fatty acids and cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of what you're doing with </v>

3675
02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:44.211
<v Speaker 3>them in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The transplants get taken up and the </v>

3676
02:50:44.211 --> 02:50:46.551
<v Speaker 3>whole structure of it's screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when this happens in the endothelial </v>

3677
02:50:46.551 --> 02:50:47.790
<v Speaker 3>cells lining your blood vessels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes them real stiff,</v>

3678
02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:51.270
<v Speaker 3>real stiff and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just like screws it up.</v>

3679
02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:54.310
<v Speaker 3>So trans fats are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have known about the,</v>

3680
02:50:54.350 --> 02:50:59.350
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that trans fats are </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing a causal role in heart disease </v>

3681
02:50:59.350 --> 02:51:03.351
<v Speaker 3>for decades and the FDA finally in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2015,</v>

3682
02:51:03.571 --> 02:51:08.571
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally banned them from the u s and </v>

3683
02:51:08.571 --> 02:51:11.601
<v Speaker 3>gave all the companies that are still </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting them in their process foods and </v>

3684
02:51:11.601 --> 02:51:15.440
<v Speaker 3>a lot of fast foods companies use crisco</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's cheaper three years to get </v>

3685
02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:17.970
<v Speaker 3>it off the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have until 2018 Jesus Christ,</v>

3686
02:51:17.971 --> 02:51:19.500
<v Speaker 3>three years to get rid of poison.</v>

3687
02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:22.350
<v Speaker 3>And that's after already like decades of</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing.</v>

3688
02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:25.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that this is like,</v>

3689
02:51:25.170 --> 02:51:27.030
<v Speaker 3>it's like so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3690
02:51:27.031 --> 02:51:30.260
<v Speaker 3>so bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

3691
02:51:30.261 --> 02:51:31.290
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole.</v>

3692
02:51:31.470 --> 02:51:36.470
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the major repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then obviously then people became </v>

3693
02:51:36.470 --> 02:51:38.220
<v Speaker 3>scared of saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing,</v>

3694
02:51:38.250 --> 02:51:43.250
<v Speaker 3>the thing with the sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is kind of what you were </v>

3695
02:51:43.250 --> 02:51:44.630
<v Speaker 3>initially hinting at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a lot of there,</v>

3696
02:51:44.670 --> 02:51:47.100
<v Speaker 3>there have been a lot of studies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have linked,</v>

3697
02:51:47.410 --> 02:51:49.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that weren't corrupt by the shirt,</v>

3698
02:51:49.430 --> 02:51:54.430
<v Speaker 3>like these were the early study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there have been studies that have </v>

3699
02:51:54.430 --> 02:51:54.430
<v Speaker 3>linked saturated fat and take to heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease and,</v>

3700
02:51:54.430 --> 02:51:58.470
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of those studies were also </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people were eating,</v>

3701
02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:03.620
<v Speaker 3>in addition to saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't correct for like refined </v>

3702
02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:04.440
<v Speaker 3>sugar intake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really what the problem is.</v>

3703
02:52:04.441 --> 02:52:06.730
<v Speaker 3>And that has now shown in multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>

3704
02:52:06.730 --> 02:52:11.730
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this came down to actually being </v>

3705
02:52:11.730 --> 02:52:12.700
<v Speaker 3>able to have new technology available </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was able to then,</v>

3706
02:52:13.300 --> 02:52:14.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ldl is not,</v>

3707
02:52:14.560 --> 02:52:19.560
<v Speaker 3>there's not just one ldl cholesterol in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the body comes in all sizes and types.</v>

3708
02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:22.720
<v Speaker 3>The type that we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good type is the large,</v>

3709
02:52:22.721 --> 02:52:25.030
<v Speaker 3>buoyant type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what saturated fat increases.</v>

3710
02:52:25.450 --> 02:52:30.450
<v Speaker 3>There's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets processed into smaller parts </v>

3711
02:52:30.450 --> 02:52:33.421
<v Speaker 3>that are small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dense ldl and that's what gets </v>

3712
02:52:33.421 --> 02:52:34.120
<v Speaker 3>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't get recycled back to the liver.</v>

3713
02:52:34.121 --> 02:52:39.121
<v Speaker 3>So it stays around the bloodstream and </v>
<v Speaker 3>undergoes inflammatory transformations </v>

3714
02:52:39.121 --> 02:52:39.790
<v Speaker 3>and sticks in the blood vessels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It causes all this problem,</v>

3715
02:52:39.791 --> 02:52:42.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what refined sugar increases.</v>

3716
02:52:42.221 --> 02:52:43.780
<v Speaker 3>And that's been shown in clinical </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>

3717
02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:49.020
<v Speaker 3>So like healthy young men that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>given 20 ounces of soda a day for three </v>

3718
02:52:49.020 --> 02:52:53.371
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It totally healthy young young men </v>

3719
02:52:53.371 --> 02:52:53.410
<v Speaker 3>increase this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>increased their ldl,</v>

3720
02:52:53.770 --> 02:52:58.770
<v Speaker 3>small dense ldl particles like massively</v>
<v Speaker 3>increased small dense ldl particles and </v>

3721
02:52:58.770 --> 02:53:00.160
<v Speaker 3>also increase their inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>markers.</v>

3722
02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:02.980
<v Speaker 3>C reactive protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like almost 100 percent,</v>

3723
02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:07.900
<v Speaker 3>which is like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're talking about like,</v>

3724
02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:13.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the refined sugar is what can make </v>

3725
02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:16.141
<v Speaker 3>saturated fat dangerous is when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>combine the two because the ldl gets </v>

3726
02:53:16.141 --> 02:53:18.040
<v Speaker 3>processed into the small dense and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>refined sugar that does that.</v>

3727
02:53:18.570 --> 02:53:21.430
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so small dense ldl versus ldl.</v>

3728
02:53:21.460 --> 02:53:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the thing is is that even now </v>

3729
02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:27.160
<v Speaker 3>it's not standard of care at a lag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Measure all the particles sizes.</v>

3730
02:53:27.161 --> 02:53:30.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like we've known about this for at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least a decade now.</v>

3731
02:53:30.840 --> 02:53:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Like so Ron Kraus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is,</v>

3732
02:53:32.651 --> 02:53:34.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy who actually pioneered this</v>

3733
02:53:34.721 --> 02:53:36.850
<v Speaker 3>assay and figured out how to measure </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3734
02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:37.870
<v Speaker 3>The small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dense ldl.</v>

3735
02:53:37.871 --> 02:53:42.280
<v Speaker 3>It's called the ion mobility as say a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in a quest labs does it,</v>

3736
02:53:42.281 --> 02:53:47.281
<v Speaker 3>but you can also ask your physician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can ask your physician to measure </v>

3737
02:53:47.281 --> 02:53:47.281
<v Speaker 3>the particle size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3738
02:53:47.281 --> 02:53:52.110
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that because it's not something </v>

3739
02:53:52.110 --> 02:53:54.721
<v Speaker 3>that's standard of care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go in to measure ldl </v>

3740
02:53:54.721 --> 02:53:54.760
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol and it's above a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>number,</v>

3741
02:53:55.090 --> 02:53:56.740
<v Speaker 3>physicians are like freaking out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3742
02:53:56.741 --> 02:53:57.460
<v Speaker 3>you should get on Stanton's.</v>

3743
02:53:57.460 --> 02:54:00.580
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is that you need to look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the small dense ldl.</v>

3744
02:54:00.610 --> 02:54:05.610
<v Speaker 3>That's what's actually puts you at risk </v>
<v Speaker 3>for heart disease and that's just not </v>

3745
02:54:05.610 --> 02:54:07.390
<v Speaker 3>standard of care that you have to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically ask for it,</v>

3746
02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:12.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so crazy that there's such a vast </v>

3747
02:54:12.780 --> 02:54:12.780
<v Speaker 3>difference in the consequences for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>

3748
02:54:12.780 --> 02:54:15.010
<v Speaker 3>But yet it's not tested even though the </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge is there.</v>

3749
02:54:15.340 --> 02:54:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was saying with the Trans </v>

3750
02:54:20.340 --> 02:54:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the knowledge was there.</v>

3751
02:54:20.340 --> 02:54:23.310
<v Speaker 3>Like I was talking to my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 88 year old mentor Bruce Ames and </v>

3752
02:54:23.310 --> 02:54:24.730
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember back in the eighties though,</v>

3753
02:54:24.731 --> 02:54:26.500
<v Speaker 3>we stayed away from that and never gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>margin.</v>

3754
02:54:26.501 --> 02:54:27.430
<v Speaker 3>And my children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3755
02:54:27.431 --> 02:54:29.380
<v Speaker 3>well you're a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my mom wasn't,</v>

3756
02:54:29.381 --> 02:54:32.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's known about this for like when</v>

3757
02:54:32.141 --> 02:54:33.910
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like five,</v>

3758
02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:39.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's known for 30 fucking years and now </v>

3759
02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:39.880
<v Speaker 3>2015 is when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3760
02:54:39.970 --> 02:54:43.060
<v Speaker 3>there's always a lag between research </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the application of it.</v>

3761
02:54:43.061 --> 02:54:45.890
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much of A.</v>

3762
02:54:46.210 --> 02:54:47.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it takes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3763
02:54:47.711 --> 02:54:52.711
<v Speaker 3>maybe these regulatory committees May.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's probably a lot more than I know </v>

3764
02:54:52.711 --> 02:54:54.410
<v Speaker 3>that goes into like figuring out like </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you make these regulations.</v>

3765
02:54:54.490 --> 02:54:57.880
<v Speaker 3>It's only financially motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's disgusting about it.</v>

3766
02:54:57.881 --> 02:55:00.940
<v Speaker 3>They're given these companies three </v>
<v Speaker 3>years to get poison out of food.</v>

3767
02:55:01.030 --> 02:55:03.410
<v Speaker 3>That is what really upsets me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3768
02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:04.310
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3769
02:55:04.310 --> 02:55:07.050
<v Speaker 2>you finally finally have banded in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>US,</v>

3770
02:55:07.070 --> 02:55:12.070
<v Speaker 2>but you're given three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like three years for people to profit </v>

3771
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:15.041
<v Speaker 2>off of poisoning for killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't realize you should have a </v>

3772
02:55:15.041 --> 02:55:19.481
<v Speaker 2>fucking cancer recommendation or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>warning the same way you have on </v>

3773
02:55:19.481 --> 02:55:20.120
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not even like you can go.</v>

3774
02:55:20.121 --> 02:55:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Like people go to the supermarket and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll say no trans fats on their food.</v>

3775
02:55:24.291 --> 02:55:26.420
<v Speaker 2>And all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they go to fast food or they go</v>

3776
02:55:26.421 --> 02:55:28.400
<v Speaker 2>to some restaurant where they're using </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris crisco's,</v>

3777
02:55:28.430 --> 02:55:30.330
<v Speaker 2>they're not even going to know they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting it.</v>

3778
02:55:30.331 --> 02:55:35.150
<v Speaker 2>And I'm telling you this was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

3779
02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:36.950
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn on the budget.</v>

3780
02:55:36.951 --> 02:55:39.290
<v Speaker 2>This was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You blow my mind every time.</v>

3781
