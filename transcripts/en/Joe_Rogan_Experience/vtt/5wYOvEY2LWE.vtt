1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.880
The joe rogan experience.
What was that kid like?
I mean it was,

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.190
uh,
it was frustrating.
They didn't like,

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.540
because I started when he started late night with Jimmy Fallon,

4
00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:16.541
so I was one of the first guys there and they didn't like any of my jokes.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.910
Like it was just,
it was,

6
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:22.200
it was impossible to mean or just like this is going to make Jimmy unlikable.

7
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.320
Luckily it wasn't about being funny so much.

8
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:29.490
It's like coming off as smart and uh,
and friendly,
you know,

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:30.570
unlikable the day.

10
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.770
That's what I was there for a year and then they barely used anything I ever
did,

11
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.211
but they knew I was funny.

12
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.660
They liked me and I thought for some reason in my head I thought that if I quit

13
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.170
before a year that it will like follow me.
People be like,

14
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:45.330
what happened with Fallon?
Why were you only there a year?
That like,

15
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.330
and then when I left it was like no one would have given a shit if I had left

16
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:51.600
after 10 weeks,
you know,
it wouldn't have mattered at all.
Yeah,
it was,

17
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.200
it was good.
It's an interesting experience.

18
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.480
But I did not enjoy it.

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.740
Being a writer for other people's voices has got to be very difficult.
It's,

20
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.910
I mean,
for me it's impossible.

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.790
It's like I write in my voice and you either like it or you don't.

22
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.650
Like I've written for Jimmy Kimmel,
Sarah Silverman,
and they'd,

23
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.140
if I love the joke,
they loved it too.
Uh,
but with Fallon,
that was not the case.

24
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.300
You know,
it was,
he was,
it was almost never like he,
he,

25
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.160
he would laugh at the joke,
but he be like,
I can't say this.
I can't do it.

26
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.190
What are they trying to do?
Like what,
what is he trying to do?

27
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.370
And he's trying to be like Middle America.
Like there's not a market for that.

28
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:29.040
Right.
Is that what it is?
He just wants everyone to love him.
You know,

29
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:31.920
he just wants everyone to,
uh,
everyone to love him.

30
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.240
And that's like not a bad trait to have in a late night host.
Right.

31
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.010
Probably the best trait to have an elite.

32
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.520
I noticed [inaudible] I'd like to see him drunk one day.

33
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.870
Just shitting on everybody though.
I think it'd be hilarious.
Hilarious.

34
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.810
Does it do that?
Oh yeah.
Cause I mean,
I,
I've,

35
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.190
I've heard that he quit drinking.
I don't know if that's true,
but he would like,

36
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.900
he liked to get drunk and like,

37
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.570
and like shitty bars and like hang out like with the,

38
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.670
with the staff and the crew like he was,

39
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.670
he's like a man of the people and he didn't just want to go home and drink.

40
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.410
He wanted to go out and go to some weird bar that was like in a subway that no

41
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:12.000
one knew about and have beers.
Like he was,
uh,
he was like a fun drunk,
you know.

42
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.250
But he did a lot.
Yeah.
There was always those rumors that he's got a problem.

43
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.930
She didn't,
he fell.
It's got a problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.

44
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.220
Do you think that's like the pressure of just being this like super friendly,

45
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:30.690
sweet guy on TV wanting everybody to love you?
Then you're like,
oh my God,

46
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:33.960
get me a fucking drank so I can cut loose.
I'm,
I'm,

47
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.570
I think that could be part of it,
you know?
That's why I was,

48
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.190
I was thought like with my persona,

49
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.810
like let's be the meanest person you can so that you can,

50
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.790
it allows you to be nice offstage.
The other thing too is that,
how would you,

51
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.570
let's just say things are going to shit really quickly.
Right?
Right.

52
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.300
There's a nuclear power plant that's going to blow up any second,
any second.

53
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.700
How would you,
are you like a,
I know you're an outdoorsy guy.
You Hunt,

54
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.500
you kill harvest as they say.
Sorry.

55
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.640
How long do you think you could survive if things went to shit really quickly?

56
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.090
If you have to survive,
you have all the money you want,
right?

57
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.390
But like how long you think you could survive in the wilderness?

58
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.050
It would be very hard.
It's not easy.
And not only that,

59
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.190
you've got to get through the winter,

60
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.670
so you're going to have to build some sort of a shelter.
But it doesn't have,

61
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.570
to me,
there's no winter here that was there.
I mean,
um,
what's it called?

62
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.280
It gets here in la,
but in big bear,

63
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.170
which is only a couple of hours north of here.
Yeah.

64
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.840
I mean there's plenty of places where you could drive in a couple hours.

65
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.720
You could go to big bear and then you can go down to the beach.

66
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:33.340
You could experience the desert.
Yeah,

67
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.990
you could experience a lot of different climates.

68
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.470
It would really depend upon where you were stuck and what,
what you would eat.

69
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.200
So things,
if you want to stay in the La area,

70
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.610
you're dead because you're not gonna be able to eat shit.
There's nothing here.

71
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.060
Would you stay in your head?
Like would you migrate,

72
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:48.580
give your kids and you gotta get Outta here.
So you'd leave,

73
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:52.600
you'd drive your Tesla.
Which carbon?
No Way.
What?
No Way.

74
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.320
It was a big debate that I had in the,
in a crisis situation.
Right.

75
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.080
Would you take the test or would you take,
what would your take?

76
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.560
I have a Toyota Land Cruiser with the VA gallon gas tank.

77
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.290
I got a apocalypse immobile,
but so now I went through a big debate.
I got,

78
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.830
I got shit on so much for this.

79
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.250
I said the same exact thing and like listen in a Oh shit situation,

80
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.200
I would leave the tussle behind.
Who argued with you about that?
Lot of people.

81
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.410
Uh,
I leave that behind.
I take my pickup truck like Tacoma,

82
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.360
that's what I deal with.
Gas numbers,
500%.
You know,

83
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.600
in an emergency crisis situation,
you don't have access to the gap.

84
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.130
What if the gasoline didn't work?
We'd go to the liquor store.

85
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.640
You fill it up with alcohol.
We'll run where we had the hurricane in Florida.
Oh,

86
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.210
now everyone's saying like,
yeah,

87
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.100
the gas pumps wouldn't work because the electricity was shut off,

88
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.820
but the superchargers still work and you could get to your destination still.

89
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:44.830
And like Tesla's use less energy.

90
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.680
It's like at the end of the day I happened to pick up truck with like two

91
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:51.220
shotguns and like five things at gasoline and be fine.
I don't understand that.

92
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.750
Yeah.
They also make tanks that you can put in your gas tank,
uh,
in your,
uh,

93
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.420
the bed of your truck.
The like the survival tanks,

94
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.420
the drive as far as you want it 800 miles.
Yeah.
And the more,

95
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.840
and they you drive thousands of miles.
There's a guy who actually,

96
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:09.841
there was a podcast that I was listening to this guy who is like an extreme

97
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:15.511
prepper and he actually made a trip with one tank of gas from Arizona to Canada.

98
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.540
Damn.
He drove all the way up to Canada,

99
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.630
all the way across with one tank of gas because this massive tank in the back of

100
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:29.380
his pickup truck,
right.
It feeds directly into his primary gas tank.
Yeah.
Yeah.

101
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:33.160
And you can get these,
they're like these survival tanks and you know,

102
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:36.820
they'll host like hundreds of gallons.
We're also a title.
I probably should,

103
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.460
I probably shoot it.
That guy's car.
That's what I think to do that.

104
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.950
So I don't know.
All of a sudden you're lawless.

105
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.940
See the lights go off for five minutes.
Want to kill everyone here.

106
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.750
Starting to fires shooting cars.
Yeah.
So,
so then,
all right,
so you leave,

107
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:52.410
you take your family,
right?
You have your kids.
If your wife were,

108
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:54.130
where are you going to go?
You hop in your Land Cruiser.

109
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.700
Where are you going to go?
You have a real powerful,

110
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.830
what are you going to bring you?

111
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.110
You would have to bring things to start a fire and things to kill animals,
right?

112
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.380
Those are the things that it would be very important.
Oh,
I would bring guns,

113
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.280
right?
I'd bring Bose.
I'd bring ammunition and arrows,

114
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.280
but I would realistically realize that,
first of all,

115
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.920
I'm not going to make more bullets and I'm not going to make more arrows.

116
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.980
What am I going to do and how long am I going to last?
You think marijuana?
No.

117
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.690
Okay.
No,
no.
I'd be just trying to stay alive.
Yeah,

118
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.490
but you'd also be trying to stay alive for a long period of time,
right?

119
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:30.380
You might want to bring it needs the pain.
No,
really?
No,
it's not going to that.

120
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.600
I mean,
marijuana for pain relief.
I'm going against.
It works.
Yeah,

121
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.210
but that's not what I use.
A paint night of the impending doom here.
Yeah.

122
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.700
You'd be freaking out even more.
I'm freaking out.
Plenty.

123
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.150
I just can't wait til the day where they can do it genetically.

124
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.130
Where a woman really becomes a woman,

125
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.970
like a man becomes a woman or a woman becomes a man.
But guess what?

126
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.580
Even if they do,
here's the issue.

127
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.970
If you knew that a woman took steroids for 30 years and developed insane tendon

128
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.940
strength and muscle strength and then stopped doing steroids,

129
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.330
it is a scientific fact that you are going to keep a very big percentage of

130
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:09.020
those gains.
What are the game?

131
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.140
What is the percentage at 30% or 40% whatever the fuck it is,

132
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.290
whatever percentage that you would keep after you get off the steroids,

133
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.960
that is significant.

134
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.410
And even if you're not currently on these performance enhancing drugs,

135
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.680
your body has been artificially boosted to this superior level through these

136
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:30.890
drugs.
Yeah.
And you lose a lot of the feminine.

137
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.570
He lose the breasts does,
might not come back.
Uh,
well,
I mean,

138
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:37.440
I think if you take estrogen,
they'll probably call me.

139
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.920
I don't know how to fucking doctor.
I'm a moron.

140
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.370
But what I do know is when this is,
we're in nonsense land.
Yeah.
It's not,

141
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.260
it's not saying that someone can become a woman and be a woman and I'll talk,

142
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:50.570
I'll call them a woman.
I'll treat him like a woman.

143
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.760
I'm cool with it and I'm 100% cool with it.

144
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.200
I'm in this open mind is I come with this,
but this is,
this is unfair for women,

145
00:07:57.201 --> 00:07:59.460
which is what's so ironic about this.
Yeah.

146
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.520
Because everyone's supposed to be looking out for women.

147
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.810
If you're looking out for women,

148
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.770
but you're also blindly progressive to the point where you let and shit like

149
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:09.290
this fly,
well now you're not looking out for women.
Right.

150
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:12.770
Because now women are in this weird position where you're putting them at an

151
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.660
unfair disadvantage.
Right.
It's fucking crazy.
I agree.
Was it the first one?

152
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.270
Yeah,
that was 43 and 51 days.

153
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.310
43 marathons in a row and 51 days with no training at a,

154
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:29.180
definitely.
I did have training that six weeks training.
Yeah.
Which is not a lot,

155
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.190
but they di,
they said that,
you know,

156
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:33.860
sometimes if you run a math and you should train for nine months before that.

157
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.980
And I thought,
well if I'm going to do 43,
that's going to be,

158
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:40.460
I haven't been training forever and I can't be bothered with that.
So I,

159
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.530
but you know,
and this happened to your civil war and maybe an any wool,
uh,

160
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.810
I,
I,
I'm kind of so,

161
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.660
so encyclopedic about you will civil war and revolution motivated two,

162
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.500
but on the spot training,
you know,
training as you go along.
That's what I did.

163
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:59.130
The first 10 marathons trains you for the next 33.

164
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.010
What was it like when you got over the first day though?
The first marathon?

165
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.870
Preston's okay.
Fuck my first day is okay.
Well it's,
it's,
it's all in your head.

166
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.710
There's a,
um,
it's more mental than it is physical.

167
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.530
And so the first math that I've heard of people who are running marathons run,

168
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:17.760
walk,
staggered,
not very fast.
Get it done.
Boom.
The second math in his weight.

169
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:22.560
Cause you go,
I've done one,
I'm on the second.
And you can't really rejoice.

170
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.830
You come punch the sky.
You can't put a medal around your neck.
You're already,

171
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.530
you've got up at five or six in the morning and you're,
it's mid day and you're,

172
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.680
you're going through your second one and then let's do the third one.

173
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:34.550
And then you threw the fourth one and then it was raining and my feet was

174
00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:39.120
shredding the oyster.
It was,
yes,
it made it too soft.
Yeah.

175
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.150
And they were rubbing on the,
on the running shoes.

176
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.640
And I didn't know how to,

177
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.970
how do I fix it when I'm actually wearing on it all the time.

178
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.630
So we started bathing in surgical spirit,
which you call something else.
Um,

179
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.020
it's a,
it's an ethanol,
methanol.
Anyways,

180
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:57.990
it's some sort of alcoholic spirits and it,
uh,

181
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:01.680
it takes the moisture out of your feet.
And,
um,

182
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.500
so it became like stones.
It's kind of,
um,
uh,

183
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:09.140
anyway,
if anyone does have some surgical spear,

184
00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:11.400
if you Google it now you'll see what it's called in America,

185
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.670
but it's some sort of alcoholic thing that just removes moisture.

186
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.730
And so it made my feet,
my toes,
like little stones.

187
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.260
And kind of tough and actually that got us through and then I started and also

188
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:23.040
apparently,

189
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.390
cause I did 27 mountains in 27 days in South Africa in 2016 and that was,

190
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.740
the temperatures were crazy on that,

191
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.040
but it seems that the body was switch on a healing property that we've got

192
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:36.360
Leighton in ourselves that we don't use and you will heal quicker,

193
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.570
you will heal faster the more you get.

194
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.600
So I got you get stronger and both the British one and the South African one,

195
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.410
I got stronger as I went on the first 10 days of the other key thing.

196
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:48.930
And after that it's kind of easy.
You're used to it.

197
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.030
Your body just adapts and understands this crazy ass hole is going to do this

198
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.730
crazy also.
And the brain goes,
what kind of math than shall we run today?

199
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.510
As opposed to what the value you doing?
What kind of marathon?
Yeah.

200
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:02.930
Well I think that's what the brain's doing because the first day is going,

201
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.170
you got to do what?
This marathon,
but be okay the second day,
the way it's going.

202
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.790
Now we're going to s during another one,
third day,
fourth day,
fifth day.

203
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:14.760
This is insane.
And then the data and the brain going,
okay,

204
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.610
you're on this kind of cake or something.
I understand.
Let's,

205
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.390
let's try a betterment of this.
Don't push it too hard.
You know,
you,

206
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.890
the brain starts talking to the body and somehow it levels out around about

207
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:29.220
Maine.
Then they get surreal marathon.
18 wrath and 23.

208
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:33.870
I remember Madison 31 that was a level of meeting so weird.

209
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.170
There's a lot of this is subconscious behaviors that go on.
God,

210
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.290
why aren't people so God damn crazy?
I don't know.
Trauma,

211
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.860
you know what I call Yung?
Is it the call young,
uh,

212
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.040
fucking a line that says that,

213
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:49.620
which we don't work out in our subconscious.

214
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.340
We will act out as fate in our lives.
How about that?

215
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.250
Cause you will relive patterns.
You'll relive trauma.

216
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.270
You will relive these patterns and you'll do it on your own terms and you'll

217
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:04.450
wonder why you keep foe.
Why do you keep dating the same person?

218
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.430
Why do you keep falling into the same problem?

219
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.760
Why after two years is this go bad?
What?
What is that?
Well,

220
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:14.761
there's a way to actually creatively at least sit with that and observe it and

221
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:16.030
be aware of it.

222
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.570
That's what therapy does is even at the unconscious conscious,

223
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:25.120
it will direct your life and you will call it fate.
What a great quote.
Wow.

224
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.120
Until you make the unconscious conscious.
Yeah.

225
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:30.280
I mean there's a lot of fucking strings pulling on.

226
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:32.380
You will direct your life and you will call it fate.

227
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.090
Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of

228
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:41.260
other people.
Yeah.
Well that's a Nietzsche.
That's what I like.
Niches,
niches,

229
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:45.730
niches.
Idea was like,
look man,
you can have these false models of life,

230
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.810
which is a lot of times life is a bitch,
right?
And you're not going to,

231
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.430
you're not going be able to compete or you don't want it.

232
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.280
So what you'll do is you'll go,
it's okay.
Meek will inherit the earth.

233
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.530
That's all right,
I am,
but you have money.
But is he happy?
Is He happy?

234
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.680
You know,
there's a lot.
We make all of us do this.
We make excuses,

235
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:07.290
not live our best life.
And he was like,
Nah,
live dangerously.
And,
uh,

236
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.570
try to be the best you can be.
Just work your ass off.
And if you have to die,

237
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.280
if you have to take risks and die,

238
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.970
leave a good looking corpse is the idea of turn your life into a fucking circus.
