1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Liquid insulated walls put in five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Someone's got a new netflix show.</v>

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't think of any other way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start.</v>

5
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:20.981
<v Speaker 2>Officer of what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.540
<v Speaker 1>so you do have new netflix specials?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

7
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this to be like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.610
<v Speaker 1>but I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually proud of it,</v>

11
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm still proud of it,</v>

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually a certain amount of time will go</v>

13
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>by where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

14
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 1>like my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even now I've gotten it better on the </v>

15
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 1>road because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.561
<v Speaker 1>the day after you shoot it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go out on the road and you're a </v>

18
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 1>murderer and you have a little fun with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then you go.</v>

19
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:52.411
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm still proud of it and it was my </v>

20
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:52.411
<v Speaker 1>favorite thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've it,</v>

21
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>the guy did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Rowe is the guy who,</v>

22
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.110
<v Speaker 1>and Scott Moran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just everything I wanted,</v>

23
00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:59.080
<v Speaker 1>they did it perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

24
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.920
<v Speaker 1>The look the way I did it at the lyric </v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

25
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>and the lyric is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no desk is the lyric in La,</v>

26
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.060
<v Speaker 1>the lyric is in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like at Melrose and melrose and </v>

27
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.701
<v Speaker 1>libray pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they sort of used it as a shell and </v>

28
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>it's already a pretty cool club.</v>

29
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.050
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

30
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>the biggest compliment I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said,</v>

31
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's weird about your special I want </v>

32
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>to go there and it doesn't exist a what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like,</v>

33
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>where is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had good set people date.</v>

34
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:31.270
<v Speaker 1>It just looked like a cool jazz club in </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City.</v>

35
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>That was maybe but not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't small because it was an after.</v>

36
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's small but it's shitty.</v>

37
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the look and it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a,</v>

38
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kitchen?</v>

39
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that word is.</v>

40
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the look they want.</v>

41
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I think that's bad because some</v>

42
00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:51.241
<v Speaker 1>people have done that really well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cool way to see a comedian just </v>

43
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>in a cool little raw space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want it small.</v>

44
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a jazz club in New York City,</v>

45
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's like 150 bucks to get in and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>holds 100 people.</v>

46
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Run like a theater.</v>

47
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you helped design one of my all time </v>

48
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>favorite clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helium and Philly.</v>

49
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.240
<v Speaker 1>You helped design that place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't you?</v>

50
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Mark Mark,</v>

51
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he acme at Lewis,</v>

52
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:14.770

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.110

<v Speaker 1>he'll probably love to give you advice.</v>

54
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>So when it was just a warehouse like </v>
<v Speaker 1>cement and I met him down there and he's</v>

55
00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:28.831
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of open up a club and you </v>

56
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:28.831
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told them a lot of stuff I wrote,</v>

57
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:28.831
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

58
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I made like well email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.010
<v Speaker 1>like six pages of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 1>here's the very detailed things and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

61
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He listened to a lot of it.</v>

62
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Like I give him credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.980
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great fucking club.</v>

64
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about those </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate spaces.</v>

65
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've noticed when</v>

66
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I take people on the road with me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

67
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 1>guys who have never worked at theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it takes a few tries to get.</v>

68
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.670
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

69
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a whole different thing.</v>

70
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kind of project to them.</v>

71
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

72
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel them the way you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>them at the,</v>

73
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 3>in the Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are on like a Wednesday night,</v>

74
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or um,</v>

75
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 3>comedy works in Denver where they're on </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of you.</v>

76
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel the people,</v>

77
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 3>they're more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

78
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you learn it pretty quick </v>

79
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you ever do the belly room at the </v>

81
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 3>store?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it a few times.</v>

82
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.070
<v Speaker 3>And of course it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love little rooms.</v>

83
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 3>Like I love like woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to do tempe.</v>

84
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.860
<v Speaker 3>You always did that side room on </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose.</v>

85
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 3>They will do the big place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with the side place,</v>

86
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to get too,</v>

87
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 3>but you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was jealous.</v>

88
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I remember I came over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the other,</v>

89
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 3>the regular one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

90
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I was having a good time is but the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

91
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 3>joey and I went next door and watched </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

92
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is better as well.</v>

93
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Even in DC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is a good example.</v>

94
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:57.721
<v Speaker 3>DC has a 60 seat room and whenever I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there I go,</v>

95
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 3>I give it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a two piece band playing with a </v>

96
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 3>black tablecloth on all the tables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lights or Gel blue,</v>

97
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:09.661
<v Speaker 3>so now people are turning corner into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this thick blue room with two guys with </v>

98
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 3>black suits playing jazz as they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>being seeded in eating.</v>

99
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 3>So now I don't feel like it's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterthought what you just said and I'll</v>

100
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:22.141
<v Speaker 3>take it as a compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other comedian that's in the main </v>

101
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:22.141
<v Speaker 3>room there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is awesome room,</v>

102
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 3>but you look into the little room and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

103
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 3>it just looks like something's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's how I want it to look.</v>

104
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense.</v>

105
00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

106
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 3>it does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

107
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.340
<v Speaker 3>it's more of a hang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

108
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.430
<v Speaker 3>The big show and your style so loose on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage like lends itself to intimacy.</v>

109
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 3>It lends itself to those nice compact </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

110
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever do the Ice House that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>annex room?</v>

111
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean not forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

112
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean.</v>

113
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.080
<v Speaker 3>The craziest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Ice House is about as deep as this </v>

114
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.080
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking.</v>

115
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 3>It goes side to side a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the whole room,</v>

116
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 3>that annex only gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

117
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:02.221
<v Speaker 3>Like 70 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 70 people and all the chairs are </v>

118
00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 3>like facing the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that says,</v>

119
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.530
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

120
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.810
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

121
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

122
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:09.571
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to say goodbye to your </v>

123
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:11.191
<v Speaker 3>friend for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some of the Improv and then people </v>

124
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:16.261
<v Speaker 3>were watching the show like this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to kind of turn to look past </v>

125
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.201
<v Speaker 3>the person next to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to feed you food to like </v>

126
00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:19.201
<v Speaker 3>you're working in a half restaurant.</v>

127
00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 3>The thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will say this about a good club.</v>

128
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:26.461
<v Speaker 3>Most of the foods been served or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't do what I'm about to tell you </v>

129
00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 3>that I've done so that the club has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>at least be good to go.</v>

130
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Now we get the food that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>food we can get out.</v>

131
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 3>But the time the show started we tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have the whole room service,</v>

132
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 3>so in the event and like helium does </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

133
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so I started making this </v>

134
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.931
<v Speaker 3>announcement and I would tell people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I do my own pre show </v>

135
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:45.721
<v Speaker 3>announcement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to do with what you said about </v>

136
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:45.721
<v Speaker 3>when they're sitting sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would just go real calm,</v>

137
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:45.721
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go.</v>

138
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Other than that folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey now's a good time to turn your chair</v>

139
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:53.401
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always going to have to annoy </v>

140
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:53.401
<v Speaker 3>someone to the right or left you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now's the time to do it.</v>

141
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 3>And once all the chairs are facing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sage will get this thing started.</v>

142
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Play a little house and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't do</v>

143
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but another 30 seconds I'd go.</v>

144
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.230
<v Speaker 4>So we're just waiting for all those </v>
<v Speaker 4>chairs to get turned around and then </v>

145
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.391
<v Speaker 4>we'll get it started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it looks like we're close to show </v>

146
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:07.391
<v Speaker 4>time and the second time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

147
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:07.391
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

148
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:07.391
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

149
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every chair in the room they're like,</v>

150
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:10.720
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

151
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a pain in the ass.</v>

152
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 4>And if I was in the audience I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to turn my chair around.</v>

153
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 4>But guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once someone made me do it,</v>

154
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 4>you'd enjoy the show better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they do.</v>

155
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 4>We got,</v>

156
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.590
<v Speaker 5>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you ever do those,</v>

157
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 5>use those yonder bags,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those bags are.</v>

158
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:26.800
<v Speaker 5>And to make people put their cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a bag.</v>

159
00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:31.801
<v Speaker 5>Denver has them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Denver uses them for all their shows </v>

160
00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:31.801
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started using them for all my show.</v>

161
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.190
<v Speaker 4>So you just accompany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes in and just does it for you?</v>

162
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hire them,</v>

163
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.710
<v Speaker 5>they come in and then when they put the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bag,</v>

164
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 5>the phone in the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they still hold onto their phone and </v>

165
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 5>they can leave the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they get a phone call,</v>

166
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.240
<v Speaker 5>like you have a kid or something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and someone's watching the kid.</v>

167
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Speaker 5>You can always get out of the room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make call,</v>

168
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.560
<v Speaker 5>but you can't call people when you're in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the room.</v>

169
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:53.950
<v Speaker 5>And I was having people calling people </v>
<v Speaker 5>and talking on the phone.</v>

170
00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:58.951
<v Speaker 5>You could see them talking on the phone </v>
<v Speaker 5>while the show's going on and people </v>

171
00:06:58.951 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 5>around them would be getting pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

172
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.770
<v Speaker 5>someone on twitter comment on it and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

173
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.720
<v Speaker 5>everyone's got their phones up and look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I've done it too.</v>

174
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I saw honey honey with Gary Clark,</v>

175
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.810
<v Speaker 5>even performing this little tiny room in</v>
<v Speaker 5>downtown La was a midnight show and like</v>

176
00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:15.460
<v Speaker 5>a Tuesday and I filmed it and I put it </v>
<v Speaker 5>on my instagram.</v>

177
00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:20.461
<v Speaker 5>So I know I'm a hypocrite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was a rare occasion that it </v>

178
00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:22.480
<v Speaker 5>wasn't a comedy show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a comedy show.</v>

179
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:24.850
<v Speaker 5>You have to pay attention to what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck's going on.</v>

180
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.530
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're filming it,</v>

181
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:28.330
<v Speaker 5>you're definitely not paying full </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention.</v>

182
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.560
<v Speaker 5>You're going to miss some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not the same thing when you </v>

183
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.650
<v Speaker 5>filming shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody is just,</v>

184
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.470
<v Speaker 5>even if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're checking this and checking texts.</v>

185
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:43.471
<v Speaker 5>And boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got a real addiction problem in this </v>

186
00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:43.471
<v Speaker 5>country with these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are new things.</v>

187
00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:44.290
<v Speaker 5>Is your new object.</v>

188
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.420
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realize because I'm not delusional </v>

189
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.251
<v Speaker 4>that the amount of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can put most of it to breast with </v>

190
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:52.860
<v Speaker 4>appreciate announcement where I'm at in </v>
<v Speaker 4>my career.</v>

191
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.350
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you get to different levels,</v>

192
00:07:55.351 --> 00:07:58.050
<v Speaker 4>there's different intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't I get it.</v>

193
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.330
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

194
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I changed my pre show announcement when </v>

195
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 4>I went to see Brian Regan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person next to me,</v>

196
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.920
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were texting,</v>

197
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't hear them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter of fact even had their light </v>

198
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you think,</v>

199
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.980
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what could bother me?</v>

200
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 4>And it did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it didn't matter if it was right or </v>

201
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what it was.</v>

202
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.161
<v Speaker 4>I wanted the person next to him and it'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>be loving him as much as I was loving </v>

203
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:26.601
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that I saw them on their </v>

204
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:26.601
<v Speaker 4>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on or even they weren't making a peep,</v>

205
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:30.030
<v Speaker 4>it started to bother the fuck out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was getting angry and then I went,</v>

206
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:30.870
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

207
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do the same thing at my </v>
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

208
00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:34.320
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't turn your thing all the way down.</v>

209
00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:39.321
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you think and you'll pull it out </v>

210
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:39.321
<v Speaker 4>into your knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

211
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:42.051
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you pull your phone out after this </v>

212
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:42.051
<v Speaker 4>announcement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

213
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:45.230
<v Speaker 4>you look like a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go and we're glad you're here and you </v>

214
00:08:45.931 --> 00:08:50.931
<v Speaker 4>know what it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just have to pick it out an </v>

215
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:50.931
<v Speaker 4>announcement a little longer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it works.</v>

216
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm worried about people are really are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a really new thing.</v>

217
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 5>The more I'm thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more like looking</v>

218
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 3>at your phone constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really only 10 years old,</v>

219
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like 2008 ish.</v>

220
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Then the iphone came around 2009 right </v>
<v Speaker 3>before that people were a little text </v>

221
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 3>diy people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people more tech savvy than others.</v>

222
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:14.361
<v Speaker 3>They really got into text messages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once that iphone came out and once </v>

223
00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 3>people started doing a bunch of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and apps and stuff on your phone,</v>

224
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 3>it changed the whole game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

225
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this topic,</v>

226
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 3>if I'm like I could be way off or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be off kilter the way I come to my</v>

227
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.430
<v Speaker 3>conclusion about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

228
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

229
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 3>it is a weird thing and even me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could acknowledge it.</v>

230
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't acknowledge it,</v>

231
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to tell some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposing side if they don't think you </v>

232
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.891
<v Speaker 3>get what you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just seems like in the past now </v>

233
00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 3>this could be different with.</v>

234
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no snarkiness it.</v>

235
00:09:41.171 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this could be a different thing.</v>

236
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Every time they think there's one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things like TV radio too seems </v>

237
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 3>like when we get past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

238
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 3>I think we'll get past it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

239
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:54.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think the world was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>explode,</v>

240
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.920
<v Speaker 3>but I'm worried about certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not worried about the human race,</v>

241
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 3>but I'm worried about the lives of </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain people,</v>

242
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.150
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's like saying like,</v>

243
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 3>are you worried that cracks can destroy </v>
<v Speaker 3>the human race?</v>

244
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:11.871
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not worried that crack is going to </v>

245
00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:11.871
<v Speaker 3>destroy it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think you can destroy the lives</v>

246
00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:14.100
<v Speaker 3>of some people and I feel the same way </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>

247
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the texting,</v>

248
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.930
<v Speaker 3>like it's not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like being plugged into electronic </v>

249
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 3>to the point where that's where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting most of your stimuli from.</v>

250
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.180
<v Speaker 3>You're getting artificial stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My concern,</v>

251
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:32.210
<v Speaker 3>this is a real concern is that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting really into that and then </v>

252
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 3>we're going to let it take the next step</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is some sort of an implant.</v>

253
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.160
<v Speaker 3>I feel like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in a movie within a movie about a </v>

254
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.761
<v Speaker 3>person that becomes a machine and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching this rationalization process as</v>

255
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 3>we slowly get more and more ingrained </v>
<v Speaker 3>and interconnected with technology.</v>

256
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 3>We'll definitely in our lifetime have </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody 100 percent.</v>

257
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.040
<v Speaker 3>I try like what you were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>addressing.</v>

258
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Like we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

259
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.680
<v Speaker 3>I catch myself and I really try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I had to give myself a grade on </v>

260
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 3>how much I've improved on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like turning the phone off,</v>

261
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 3>like loving it for what's great about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

262
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I give myself maybe a c minus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it means I've made some strides and </v>

263
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 3>like turning it off.</v>

264
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 3>You're not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Enough.</v>

265
00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Not for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matter of fact.</v>

266
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.360
<v Speaker 3>I remember a week ago I was going into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the grove and I went,</v>

267
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm not meeting anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I left my phone in the car.</v>

268
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.280
<v Speaker 3>It was strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move strong to ideas,</v>

269
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 3>to ideas and I was high and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to write them down.</v>

270
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

271
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:34.290
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about leaving your </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone in the car.</v>

272
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.790
<v Speaker 3>They'll take a picture or show someone a</v>
<v Speaker 3>picture or it doesn't have to always be.</v>

273
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:40.470
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to go and,</v>

274
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>

275
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.580
<v Speaker 3>never walking through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never walking through a line that </v>

276
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:46.580
<v Speaker 3>actually could encourage you to write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

277
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just use hate writing,</v>

278
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 3>but I mean saying you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can only use your phone when you </v>

279
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 3>have a note or an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only time you could use it.</v>

280
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a loophole.</v>

281
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm pretending that I don't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>have this phone unless I need to make a </v>

282
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:02.880
<v Speaker 3>note.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

283
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 3>I could put it on airplane mode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could put it on airplane mode,</v>

284
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.130
<v Speaker 3>then you still have all the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although a ways my pants down.</v>

285
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Oddly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

286
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Good conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

287
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 3>It does do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pulled my pants up and shit.</v>

288
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like fanny packs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just mocked me relentlessly.</v>

289
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Can I tell you something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way I say it all the time </v>

290
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 3>when I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if I have my altoids and then</v>

291
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 3>I have a pipe and then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

292
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 3>You're a pipe guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

293
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I still do for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're old school.</v>

294
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 3>It's all toys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

295
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.470
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like jazz clubs,</v>

296
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.070
<v Speaker 3>pipes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

297
00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Like what is your typical way?</v>

298
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Mostly joints or vape pens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

299
00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 3>it's the rolling of the joint that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a question for you.</v>

300
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you might know the answer.</v>

301
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 3>I smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to like,</v>

302
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressured,</v>

303
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:54.450
<v Speaker 3>blame you if something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I can switch conversation </v>

304
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:54.450
<v Speaker 3>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you might have.</v>

305
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 3>I have two things I want to ask you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

306
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Did I interrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

307
00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

308
00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.910
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

309
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 3>I smoke now seven nights a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

310
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:08.070
<v Speaker 3>So I'll have like a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say if I had to put it in joint </v>

311
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:08.260
<v Speaker 3>size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a joint per night.</v>

312
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 3>So it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a tremendous amount.</v>

313
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 3>None of that just at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I'm saying I want a prize for </v>

314
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just for me.</v>

315
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 3>It works better at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I say I quit smoking and I did.</v>

316
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 3>I quit smoking.</v>

317
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:25.240
<v Speaker 3>I used to smoke around a pack and a half</v>
<v Speaker 3>a month is this as bad pack and a half a</v>

318
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 3>month is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't horrendous,</v>

319
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:29.400
<v Speaker 3>but I quit because I had a of day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

320
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.110
<v Speaker 3>Is this smoking seven nights with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>joint as bad as when I smoke cigarettes?</v>

321
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:36.250
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

322
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.230
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even close.</v>

323
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence that marijuana smoke</v>

324
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:43.970
<v Speaker 3>causes cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

325
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Do is get respiratory irritation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get.</v>

326
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.300
<v Speaker 3>It can fuck with your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about Tara?</v>

327
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.770
<v Speaker 3>You can avoid all that stuff is what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to say with the vaporizer </v>

328
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:55.770
<v Speaker 3>vaporizers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to go,</v>

329
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.550
<v Speaker 3>but it is a different high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oddly enough,</v>

330
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.470
<v Speaker 3>vaporizer seems like a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>clean in some weird way,</v>

331
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:05.170
<v Speaker 3>like when I get high with a vaporizer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always like,</v>

332
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.240
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like a.</v>

333
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 3>it's almost as if this is gonna sound so</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

334
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.560
<v Speaker 3>There's something that's something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to do with the fire interacting with</v>

335
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:22.321
<v Speaker 3>the plant that connects you to nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about a lit joint this</v>

336
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 3>to take it in and you just feel natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I vaporized,</v>

337
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:32.140
<v Speaker 3>I feel alien when I vaporize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like this.</v>

338
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:37.290
<v Speaker 3>What this is is like let's extract all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what it is to be a living thing and </v>

339
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 3>get to the molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the molecule?</v>

340
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:45.270
<v Speaker 3>What temperature to heat those bitches </v>
<v Speaker 3>up or I can shove them right in your </v>

341
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:45.270
<v Speaker 3>bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the vapor.</v>

342
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.000
<v Speaker 3>I proceeded to vaporize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang on hand up like whoa.</v>

343
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not connected the same way.</v>

344
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.960
<v Speaker 3>It's connected a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's both.</v>

345
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 3>They're both amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judgment will probably agree.</v>

346
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people do.</v>

347
00:14:58.281 --> 00:14:59.390
<v Speaker 3>I think there'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

348
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:03.350
<v Speaker 3>I know even a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't roll joints because I'm lazy,</v>

349
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 3>but whenever someone has a joint and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they put it,</v>

350
00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:06.820
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is when I.</v>

351
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.080
<v Speaker 3>This just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

352
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get a little higher.</v>

353
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.780
<v Speaker 3>I like to smoke joints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

354
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.550
<v Speaker 3>it's feels like it's real clear what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

355
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of these vape pens.</v>

356
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 3>You got to press five times then hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and you're sucking it in.</v>

357
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what's in that oil man </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's making that stuff and they get </v>

358
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.820
<v Speaker 3>yelled at and yell at you when you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

359
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:29.830
<v Speaker 3>Just press it twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

360
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.520
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work with the press it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got one more thing.</v>

361
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever fuck around with spray jumbo</v>
<v Speaker 3>spray?</v>

362
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.430
<v Speaker 3>You ever fuck around with jumbo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what John?</v>

363
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:40.830
<v Speaker 3>He put it in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

364
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Super Organic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really high end edibles and spray.</v>

365
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.490
<v Speaker 3>And this fucking spray will put you on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon.</v>

366
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any?</v>

367
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

368
00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 3>But I have to drive.</v>

369
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.430
<v Speaker 3>I have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of hanging with me today,</v>

370
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.080
<v Speaker 3>John Bryan Wagner is a shout out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if this is this,</v>

371
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:04.210
<v Speaker 3>this is a thousand milligram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you drank the whole bottle,</v>

372
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 3>it's a thousand milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's too much to have.</v>

373
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.490
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have a half of spray </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

374
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm safe to do it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always fun to experiment spread.</v>

375
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Especially because you're saying to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

376
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why it's more comfortable?</v>

377
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Because if something happens to me and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't blame me,</v>

378
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:19.940
<v Speaker 3>blame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

379
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.280
<v Speaker 3>let's do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

380
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 3>let's to do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like the worst crack dealer.</v>

381
00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:31.091
<v Speaker 3>However you can do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to do taste and then I </v>

382
00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:35.570
<v Speaker 3>want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do have a question.</v>

383
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might have an answer.</v>

384
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.570
<v Speaker 3>What did you have a half a spray one </v>
<v Speaker 3>spray good enough.</v>

385
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

386
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 3>We're in.</v>

387
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.680
<v Speaker 3>What was the other question you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I asking you this?</v>

388
00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 3>But I think you might've been answered </v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

389
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:56.490
<v Speaker 3>but I'm being totally honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm exhausted from dealing with like I,</v>

390
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.420
<v Speaker 3>it's not like it's a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like the first time you,</v>

391
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 3>whether you could admit major things in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>

392
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:01.850
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

393
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I have a drinking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can Be stupid little things.</v>

394
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:09.071
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine is eating like I'm exhausted from </v>

395
00:17:09.071 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 3>doing it the wrong way and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes back to me for self control.</v>

396
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.030
<v Speaker 3>So when people want to tell me about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>

397
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 3>I know it's not portions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what portions are.</v>

398
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:20.530
<v Speaker 3>I just want to eat more so it's all down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to how do I fucking get self control.</v>

399
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.930
<v Speaker 3>I have zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I'm not going to call it zero </v>

400
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.241
<v Speaker 3>self control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I don't know what the hell I'm </v>

401
00:17:28.241 --> 00:17:28.241
<v Speaker 3>going to call it.</v>

402
00:17:28.241 --> 00:17:28.880
<v Speaker 3>But as you heard about it for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hard on yourself.</v>

403
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I think you have selfcontrol todd think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a wonderful man,</v>

404
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.160
<v Speaker 3>but you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hilarious.</v>

405
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 3>And one of the reasons why you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious because you're so.</v>

406
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.010
<v Speaker 3>You're free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're impulsive and that sort of that.</v>

407
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.300
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult for that to lend </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself to dietary discipline.</v>

408
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:45.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like when I eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

409
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.080
<v Speaker 3>Fucking need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

410
00:17:48.081 --> 00:17:53.081
<v Speaker 3>That's you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's also part of what makes you </v>

411
00:17:53.081 --> 00:17:55.041
<v Speaker 3>such a hilarious comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have these impulses that </v>

412
00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:56.870
<v Speaker 3>makes me feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to comfort,</v>

413
00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 3>at least with what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want discomfort and you want </v>

414
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 3>to have fun and it's like it's right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

415
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 3>They want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to eat that food.</v>

416
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the thought of me like picture me </v>

417
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.931
<v Speaker 3>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the cancer shoving cheesecake human </v>

418
00:18:11.931 --> 00:18:11.931
<v Speaker 3>in my mouth and my friends are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at me like todd and I go,</v>

419
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.010
<v Speaker 6>Joe Rogan said that because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>creative,</v>

420
00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.980
<v Speaker 6>I should eat whatever I want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

421
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.020
<v Speaker 6>go listen to his podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

422
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 6>I shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He told Joe Rogen and you can go listen.</v>

423
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.870
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>clear up the mini bar before you get in </v>

424
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:30.520
<v Speaker 6>your hotel bed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if you're not really hungry.</v>

425
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.700
<v Speaker 6>Creative.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

426
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.500
<v Speaker 6>So I don't have control over this.</v>

427
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.650
<v Speaker 3>There's also a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another problem with discipline.</v>

428
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.600
<v Speaker 3>This is a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that hit me already.</v>

429
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

430
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably just the,</v>

431
00:18:45.761 --> 00:18:47.560
<v Speaker 3>we'd hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a little while for this prayer.</v>

432
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.280
<v Speaker 3>Get usually a few more minutes than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

433
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot my point point about,</v>

434
00:18:56.591 --> 00:18:58.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the self control.</v>

435
00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you really disciplined people </v>

436
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.110
<v Speaker 3>and comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't go well together that much </v>

437
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.020
<v Speaker 3>either because if you're too driven and </v>
<v Speaker 3>too disciplinary,</v>

438
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.700
<v Speaker 3>that's almost always dickie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll,</v>

439
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.800
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

440
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd be able to disciplined too </v>
<v Speaker 3>rigid,</v>

441
00:19:17.441 --> 00:19:22.441
<v Speaker 3>too determined and in and to like too </v>
<v Speaker 3>enthusiastic about success.</v>

442
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.110
<v Speaker 3>You get Dickie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this.</v>

443
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't.</v>

444
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.760
<v Speaker 3>This thought could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm okay with thinking something </v>

445
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.100
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe finding out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whenever a comedian,</v>

446
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:38.410
<v Speaker 3>and I bet there's funny ones out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely because over the years I </v>

447
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.280
<v Speaker 3>remember my can't think of which ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they definitely exist.</v>

448
00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.130
<v Speaker 3>They are funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are funny,</v>

449
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 3>but they've never smoked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drank out.</v>

450
00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Can you be a good comedian if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't done those things?</v>

451
00:19:49.511 --> 00:19:52.480
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be a good comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a man,</v>

452
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.640
<v Speaker 3>you could be a good comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a woman,</v>

453
00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:57.790
<v Speaker 3>you could be a good comedian if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay or trans,</v>

454
00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.010
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you a good comedian.</v>

455
00:20:00.011 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 3>If you're a good comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

456
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Why do I ask that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm not.</v>

457
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:08.541
<v Speaker 3>I should be embarrassed to ask that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of people that are really </v>

458
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:08.541
<v Speaker 3>good that don't do shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never.</v>

459
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:09.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

460
00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.850
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a desire to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

461
00:20:11.851 --> 00:20:16.851
<v Speaker 3>it's just everybody's brain works </v>
<v Speaker 3>different and some people like the idea </v>

462
00:20:16.851 --> 00:20:19.840
<v Speaker 3>of losing control with a substance is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not not fun.</v>

463
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't like that feeling,</v>

464
00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.610
<v Speaker 3>but they can keep their shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

465
00:20:24.611 --> 00:20:29.611
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people that don't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't do anything but they keep </v>

466
00:20:29.611 --> 00:20:30.910
<v Speaker 3>their shit together and maybe that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>better for them.</v>

467
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.680
<v Speaker 3>They feel like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

468
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:34.860
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

469
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:39.100
<v Speaker 3>as I asked that you gave me the answer </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know to go.</v>

470
00:20:39.101 --> 00:20:39.850
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

471
00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.650
<v Speaker 3>But like I asked it means that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>questioned about that and I,</v>

472
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.840
<v Speaker 3>and I think I've talked about this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the past and once I was like somebody </v>

473
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:48.840
<v Speaker 3>was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he may be,</v>

474
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.950
<v Speaker 3>what if you're not experimental?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

475
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:54.640
<v Speaker 3>there's a billion ways to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do those things.</v>

476
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.500
<v Speaker 3>You used pot to do without the pod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

477
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.950
<v Speaker 3>Edit that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use yoga for that too,</v>

478
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love going to a hot yoga class fucking</v>

479
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:07.120
<v Speaker 3>hard and it's like a drug like you get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of thinking done in there,</v>

480
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're just holding these poses and</v>

481
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 3>there's no no music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>

482
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Just everybody in the class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Breathing is a 90 minute class.</v>

483
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 3>There's some sort of psychedelic effect.</v>

484
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.200
<v Speaker 3>There is some sort of cleansing of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind and I think that's one of the </v>

485
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.071
<v Speaker 3>things that we overlook when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental health that your brain needs to </v>

486
00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:29.491
<v Speaker 3>be cleaned out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just stagnate and think on </v>

487
00:21:29.491 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 3>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You bring these to your physical body,</v>

488
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:36.570
<v Speaker 3>can clean your brain out a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get rid of some of the stress and </v>

489
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.960
<v Speaker 3>tension and you can see things clear </v>
<v Speaker 3>like those terms.</v>

490
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 3>Stress Reduction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tension relief.</v>

491
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.420
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means the way you fucking think,</v>

492
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing something to your body that</v>

493
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:51.571
<v Speaker 3>radically alters the way you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about things and everybody's </v>

494
00:21:51.571 --> 00:21:55.230
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the problems in societies </v>

495
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.780
<v Speaker 3>that you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have these instincts that are </v>

496
00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 3>built into your body from thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of what the.</v>

497
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Speaker 3>You know the what people ask of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies 20,</v>

498
00:22:03.101 --> 00:22:06.580
<v Speaker 3>30 generations ago were all those same </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

499
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:11.730
<v Speaker 3>So if we don't deal with what our body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just some physical activity getting,</v>

500
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.470
<v Speaker 3>he's got to get the blood flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't,</v>

501
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.410
<v Speaker 3>your whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

502
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 3>you're like an overflowing battery or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

503
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.640
<v Speaker 3>I as far as the stopping thing think I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a great idea for people to do to </v>

504
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:26.590
<v Speaker 3>get a smidget of what it's like to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go,</v>

505
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:28.090
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't meditate or I won't do this.</v>

506
00:22:28.091 --> 00:22:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

507
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.760
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do it,</v>

508
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:32.680
<v Speaker 3>I promise whoever does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's listening will go.</v>

509
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.920
<v Speaker 3>You'll get a little taste of it and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>all happens naturally,</v>

510
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.860
<v Speaker 3>but it started by accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then we started realizing it's about</v>

511
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:43.861
<v Speaker 3>stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like one night it was about probably </v>

512
00:22:43.861 --> 00:22:44.320
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago after dinner or before </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner,</v>

513
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:46.630
<v Speaker 3>I had some hot wash cloths and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

514
00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:51.631
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just I get a Chinese restaurant joking </v>

515
00:22:51.631 --> 00:22:51.631
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we all did it.</v>

516
00:22:51.631 --> 00:22:52.040
<v Speaker 3>And then we realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

517
00:22:52.041 --> 00:22:56.620
<v Speaker 3>that really stopped us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The heat putting it on your face.</v>

518
00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Speaker 3>So now I make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a ritual that I do.</v>

519
00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:03.220
<v Speaker 3>I have it all figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the less people the better because</v>

520
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 3>the hot wash cloth has a short shelf </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

521
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.460
<v Speaker 3>It has to be so scorching hot when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand that to people.</v>

522
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.080
<v Speaker 3>So by the time they get it to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>

523
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:13.000
<v Speaker 3>you know he can't take warm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I use the tea kettle,</v>

524
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:14.200
<v Speaker 3>pour it all over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like six of them.</v>

525
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.140
<v Speaker 3>And here's the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The radio goes off.</v>

526
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:22.141
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you think I'll leave it on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like walking over and </v>

527
00:23:22.141 --> 00:23:22.141
<v Speaker 3>turning off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

528
00:23:22.141 --> 00:23:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's jazz off and I ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

529
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 3>check the pulse of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If everyone,</v>

530
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.580
<v Speaker 3>if you take yours off and you're ready </v>
<v Speaker 3>to start talking,</v>

531
00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:28.000
<v Speaker 3>but you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

532
00:23:28.001 --> 00:23:32.110
<v Speaker 3>three people still have it on their face</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

533
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:33.660
<v Speaker 3>I'll break it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just once the.</v>

534
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.830
<v Speaker 3>Once you get the hot wash cloth in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands,</v>

535
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be hot.</v>

536
00:23:36.911 --> 00:23:38.710
<v Speaker 3>You're going to want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would taught it's way too hot.</v>

537
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:40.810
<v Speaker 3>It's hotter than you think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just get ready.</v>

538
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I give everybody one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put it on their face.</v>

539
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>No one</v>

540
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.570
<v Speaker 7>even has to tell them to take a deep </v>
<v Speaker 7>breath.</v>

541
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.520
<v Speaker 7>You naturally do after like a second </v>
<v Speaker 7>because you need to see though.</v>

542
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 7>Then you let it out and then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>

543
00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:00.250
<v Speaker 7>and then you literally spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you shut down and then you wipe your </v>

544
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:00.250
<v Speaker 7>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Literally take some of the dirt off your</v>

545
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.740
<v Speaker 7>answer in the day and we always think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit.</v>

546
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 7>Resetting yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a simple way to get a taste of an</v>

547
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:09.890
<v Speaker 7>a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We always make the joke,</v>

548
00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 7>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

549
00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:15.401
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're just going to eat and then we're </v>

550
00:24:15.401 --> 00:24:15.401
<v Speaker 7>going to go on throughout the whole day </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then put our food.</v>

551
00:24:15.401 --> 00:24:15.401
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

552
00:24:15.401 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 7>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>

553
00:24:15.411 --> 00:24:18.950
<v Speaker 7>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you got us and that hot wash cloth.</v>

554
00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:20.090
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck.</v>

555
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think your brain has requirements for </v>

556
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:25.980
<v Speaker 7>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those kind of things.</v>

557
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.471
<v Speaker 7>I think those,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those kind of moments are really good </v>

558
00:24:29.471 --> 00:24:29.471
<v Speaker 7>for your.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just good for your outlook.</v>

559
00:24:29.471 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 7>A reset.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's like the same field than </v>

560
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 7>a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

561
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.941
<v Speaker 7>maybe a primitive man would get when he </v>
<v Speaker 7>would like walk up to the edge of a </v>

562
00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:41.201
<v Speaker 7>cliff and see like some crazy view and </v>
<v Speaker 7>see nature and birds flying around the </v>

563
00:24:41.201 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 7>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This was,</v>

564
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.170
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

565
00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:45.100
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is a.</v>

566
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.110
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm getting chased by leopards every </v>

567
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.110
<v Speaker 7>day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But look,</v>

568
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.930
<v Speaker 7>this is fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like a renewed enthusiasm about life,</v>

569
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.540
<v Speaker 7>about life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the simplest things.</v>

570
00:24:56.541 --> 00:25:01.541
<v Speaker 7>Obviously I have a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't give myself any credit when I </v>

571
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:01.541
<v Speaker 7>have these talks when things are going </v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

572
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:02.660
<v Speaker 7>like it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It helps you know,</v>

573
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:07.670
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if I can be in a tense moment and </v>

574
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.241
<v Speaker 7>get out of it where I would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I give them that I'll be proud of </v>

575
00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:10.241
<v Speaker 7>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

576
00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing about all that </v>
<v Speaker 7>motivational speaking stuff,</v>

577
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:17.321
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it's like the guy who's doing all </v>

578
00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:20.861
<v Speaker 7>the motivational speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if he's pulling up in a Rolls Royce and </v>

579
00:25:20.861 --> 00:25:20.861
<v Speaker 7>he lives in a big mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so like,</v>

580
00:25:20.861 --> 00:25:22.100
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're enthusiastic.</v>

581
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everything's going great.</v>

582
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.290
<v Speaker 7>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>If someone takes all this stuff away </v>

583
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:29.600
<v Speaker 7>then and it becomes like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can you,</v>

584
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.720
<v Speaker 7>can you be stoic?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can you be at peace when you're broke </v>

585
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.240
<v Speaker 7>and you're by yourself and some one </v>
<v Speaker 7>bedroom apartment somewhere,</v>

586
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.460
<v Speaker 7>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can you do it all over again?</v>

587
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.890
<v Speaker 7>That's the suburbs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

588
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.080
<v Speaker 7>Could you imagine if someone told you </v>
<v Speaker 7>Dane Cook was the first one ever heard </v>

589
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:50.080
<v Speaker 7>talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So give him credit for that.</v>

590
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.870
<v Speaker 7>He said I would never want to try to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>standup again.</v>

591
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 7>I don't think I could do it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was so hard to do that.</v>

592
00:25:57.201 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 7>I would never want to start and do it </v>
<v Speaker 7>again.</v>

593
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.090
<v Speaker 7>Did you ever think like what it would be</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you start again?</v>

594
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.990
<v Speaker 7>Like right now you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have zero jokes.</v>

595
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:10.991
<v Speaker 7>You've never done stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But somehow I know that you have this </v>

596
00:26:10.991 --> 00:26:13.901
<v Speaker 7>vague memory of the grind that it takes </v>
<v Speaker 7>to become an actual professional.</v>

597
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Speaker 7>I think I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think definitely,</v>

598
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.260
<v Speaker 7>definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 7>definitely,</v>

599
00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:20.840
<v Speaker 7>definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but death because you already know,</v>

600
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.180
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You already know you could do it.</v>

601
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.030
<v Speaker 7>It'd be a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A question now that I think about it.</v>

602
00:26:28.031 --> 00:26:29.770
<v Speaker 7>Fuck Dane Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just kidding.</v>

603
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 7>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dane,</v>

604
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.950
<v Speaker 7>they'll get upset,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm saying if you.</v>

605
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:39.100
<v Speaker 7>If you think about it like that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>even make any sense because of course </v>

606
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.911
<v Speaker 7>you would know that you could make it so</v>
<v Speaker 7>it'd be way easier even if you just </v>

607
00:26:42.911 --> 00:26:44.580
<v Speaker 7>started all can't in 21 again doing </v>
<v Speaker 7>stand up.</v>

608
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.970
<v Speaker 7>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you.</v>

609
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.150
<v Speaker 7>Are you 21 again or you just are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You are.</v>

610
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.030
<v Speaker 7>You didn't have to start from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just do it to go get younger.</v>

611
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 7>But then once you made the decision you </v>
<v Speaker 7>would in.</v>

612
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 7>Unless you live in some bizarro world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're allowed to live two lives.</v>

613
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.590
<v Speaker 7>You would never even have memory,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

614
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.940
<v Speaker 7>You'd need 21.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I would.</v>

615
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 7>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All I'd have to do is just say yes,</v>

616
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:04.440
<v Speaker 7>that'd be 21.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>

617
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 7>this is a stupid fucking question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe yet.</v>

618
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.570
<v Speaker 7>Maybe you haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe he'd be like,</v>

619
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:11.550
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said this and that.</v>

620
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 7>I don't think he thought it through.</v>

621
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.260
<v Speaker 7>You said something a minute ago and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's when I should wait.</v>

622
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 7>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was it about the food thing?</v>

623
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:23.580
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

624
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:28.581
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What were you just talking about before </v>

625
00:27:28.581 --> 00:27:28.581
<v Speaker 7>the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're talking about discipline,</v>

626
00:27:28.581 --> 00:27:31.731
<v Speaker 7>like hard acids and then um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then we got to like how difficult it </v>

627
00:27:31.731 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 7>would be to start over,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do it.</v>

628
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:35.520
<v Speaker 7>I think anything like if you said that </v>
<v Speaker 7>to a brain surgeon,</v>

629
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.710
<v Speaker 7>you want to start from scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 7>start from,</v>

630
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

631
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:41.400
<v Speaker 7>right after you graduated high school,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you want to take it from day one,</v>

632
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:42.270
<v Speaker 7>freshman year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>college.</v>

633
00:27:42.271 --> 00:27:44.250
<v Speaker 7>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

634
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.480
<v Speaker 7>just get them through.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

635
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Speaker 7>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you ever think of like,</v>

636
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:52.290
<v Speaker 7>I know two things I would have done like</v>
<v Speaker 7>before.</v>

637
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.900
<v Speaker 7>When did you start standup?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eight.</v>

638
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 7>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was 21.</v>

639
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.010
<v Speaker 7>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is there a job you.</v>

640
00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:03.020
<v Speaker 7>When you were in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did you think you thought you knew what </v>

641
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:03.020
<v Speaker 7>you wanted to do?</v>

642
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:03.020
<v Speaker 7>Maybe for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not really.</v>

643
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:07.820
<v Speaker 7>My,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my number one option was teaching </v>

644
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:07.820
<v Speaker 7>taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which already was doing.</v>

645
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 7>That's what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mostly you were already,</v>

646
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.840
<v Speaker 7>but I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't want to fight anymore and I </v>

647
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.380
<v Speaker 7>didn't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

648
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:22.390
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't think that dude be like a real </v>

649
00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:23.010
<v Speaker 7>future in me teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't really like teaching everybody.</v>

650
00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 7>I only liked teaching people that were </v>
<v Speaker 7>super enthusiastic because I was,</v>

651
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.200
<v Speaker 7>I was young at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like when I first started teaching on my</v>

652
00:28:31.201 --> 00:28:32.190
<v Speaker 7>own,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was 19.</v>

653
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.030
<v Speaker 7>I was teaching at Boston University.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had my own school.</v>

654
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 7>You 21.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nineteen.</v>

655
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.010
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

656
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.180
<v Speaker 7>And in Boston and Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

657
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.960
<v Speaker 7>I taught,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I taught a pass,</v>

658
00:28:43.961 --> 00:28:48.961
<v Speaker 7>fail a class.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like they can get credit for it and I </v>

659
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Speaker 7>would say all you have to do is just </v>
<v Speaker 7>show up and you get an a,</v>

660
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.600
<v Speaker 7>just try.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just trying to get an a.</v>

661
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.600
<v Speaker 7>it's has nothing to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 7>physical performance because the idea </v>

662
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:56.600
<v Speaker 7>that everybody's starting on the same </v>
<v Speaker 7>page as ridiculous.</v>

663
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.410
<v Speaker 7>Some of these people have serious </v>
<v Speaker 7>athletic backgrounds.</v>

664
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.620
<v Speaker 7>Some of these people never worked out a </v>
<v Speaker 7>day in their life and they thought it'd </v>

665
00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:03.620
<v Speaker 7>be fun to try something new.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the idea of like grading them against</v>

666
00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.650
<v Speaker 7>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said I'll give you guys all in a.</v>

667
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.230
<v Speaker 7>and I was their age.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you allowed to do that as a teacher?</v>

668
00:29:10.231 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 7>Like they were.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The worst they can do is fire.</v>

669
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:17.511
<v Speaker 7>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't care because it only paid like </v>

670
00:29:17.511 --> 00:29:17.511
<v Speaker 7>200 bucks a month or something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't expensive.</v>

671
00:29:17.511 --> 00:29:20.550
<v Speaker 7>Wasn't a valuable thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it was a prestigious thing.</v>

672
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.220
<v Speaker 7>It's like I'm teaching at a university </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I'm 19.</v>

673
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:28.340
<v Speaker 7>Did most people get the a everybody got </v>
<v Speaker 7>an a no show up or all the times I </v>

674
00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:30.510
<v Speaker 7>taught.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I taught for a couple of years.</v>

675
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 7>One or two people just didn't show up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

676
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.050
<v Speaker 7>you're always gonna have that one or two</v>
<v Speaker 7>people just say fuck you,</v>

677
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.470
<v Speaker 7>they fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I just made it fun.</v>

678
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:39.390
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was their age and so we just,</v>

679
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 7>we did a lot of cool shit and kick pads </v>
<v Speaker 7>and</v>

680
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:47.370
<v Speaker 5>I taught him about the Turner hip and </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff and you know how to get power </v>

681
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:47.550
<v Speaker 5>things you could see them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

682
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 5>there's something very enthusiastic </v>
<v Speaker 5>about someone regardless of what their </v>

683
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.431
<v Speaker 5>physical ability is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Getting a little bit better and seeing </v>

684
00:29:56.431 --> 00:29:56.431
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

685
00:29:56.431 --> 00:29:57.490
<v Speaker 5>even if they start from nothing and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see just yes,</v>

686
00:29:57.491 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're getting it,</v>

687
00:29:58.301 --> 00:30:00.750
<v Speaker 5>you're getting it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then see them beam like this.</v>

688
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:06.130
<v Speaker 5>That that to me was what I was into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I wasn't into as people that needed</v>

689
00:30:06.551 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 5>to be motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just didn't.</v>

690
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.560
<v Speaker 5>They couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would just half ass things.</v>

691
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 5>They weren't enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were distracted.</v>

692
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they were talking too much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you could do all that stuff another</v>

693
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you want to get good at this,</v>

694
00:30:19.361 --> 00:30:24.361
<v Speaker 5>there's only one way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be really interested in </v>

695
00:30:24.361 --> 00:30:27.811
<v Speaker 5>getting good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to be really focused on all the </v>

696
00:30:27.811 --> 00:30:27.811
<v Speaker 5>things you're doing right or wrong,</v>

697
00:30:27.811 --> 00:30:28.910
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see a comedian like,</v>

698
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.130
<v Speaker 4>do you go back a year to a club?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You saw a comedian,</v>

699
00:30:31.131 --> 00:30:34.580
<v Speaker 4>he's a newer comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he has been going up at least twice a</v>

700
00:30:34.581 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 4>week and it's 52 weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fun to see that type of improvement</v>

701
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.310
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

702
00:30:40.311 --> 00:30:40.940
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

703
00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.090
<v Speaker 4>maybe I've gone up what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300 times since you've been here,</v>

704
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:46.040
<v Speaker 4>but you can tell if they haven't.</v>

705
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.390
<v Speaker 5>Do you have any friends that you knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you were professional and they were</v>

706
00:30:49.391 --> 00:30:50.260
<v Speaker 5>open?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mike makers.</v>

707
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean like they're professionals now?</v>

708
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were a full blown professional.</v>

709
00:30:55.891 --> 00:30:58.950
<v Speaker 4>You met them when they were an open mic </v>
<v Speaker 4>or matter of fact.</v>

710
00:30:58.951 --> 00:31:01.060
<v Speaker 4>It leads me to a little plug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

711
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.530
<v Speaker 4>it does look like you set a set me up </v>
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>

712
00:31:04.531 --> 00:31:09.531
<v Speaker 4>But Blake Wexler is a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a professional comedian now and he </v>

713
00:31:09.531 --> 00:31:13.611
<v Speaker 4>met me when he was 15 or 16 at helium </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was wearing a conestoga shirt.</v>

714
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:15.360
<v Speaker 4>That's where I went to high school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So of course you're like,</v>

715
00:31:15.361 --> 00:31:16.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he said he's a new comedian,</v>

716
00:31:16.711 --> 00:31:19.710
<v Speaker 4>so right away went to your high school </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's doing standup comedy.</v>

717
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.460
<v Speaker 4>He was with his dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talked and I go,</v>

718
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:27.470
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to come back with your </v>

719
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.470
<v Speaker 4>friend Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

720
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.470
<v Speaker 4>here's my number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll put you on the guest list.</v>

721
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.220
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>years year goes by.</v>

722
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.020
<v Speaker 4>I was in Philly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called them.</v>

723
00:31:31.021 --> 00:31:31.760
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey Blake,</v>

724
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.980
<v Speaker 4>thanks for whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be a message I was leaving.</v>

725
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got your friends on the guest list for </v>

726
00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's these messages.</v>

727
00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.301
<v Speaker 4>Then we became good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he told me I saved every one of your </v>

728
00:31:44.301 --> 00:31:45.240
<v Speaker 4>messages about a year ago and I've had </v>
<v Speaker 4>people say that before,</v>

729
00:31:45.241 --> 00:31:50.241
<v Speaker 4>but then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got to race there when they got my </v>

730
00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:53.151
<v Speaker 4>computer and they lost them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He came over about a year ago with like </v>

731
00:31:53.151 --> 00:31:57.770
<v Speaker 4>50 messages and so we put them on a CD </v>
<v Speaker 4>and put them on itunes and it's a 12 </v>

732
00:32:00.331 --> 00:32:02.310
<v Speaker 4>years of messages from Todd Glass to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Blake Wexler.</v>

733
00:32:02.311 --> 00:32:05.710
<v Speaker 4>Simple name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reason I think it's really pure,</v>

734
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:11.090
<v Speaker 4>which is a weird way to maybe say it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just for me to him now.</v>

735
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:16.130
<v Speaker 4>There was probably three or four at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end where I knew they'd probably end up </v>

736
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.130
<v Speaker 4>on there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mentioned it.</v>

737
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.260
<v Speaker 4>I go now this whole thing is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>ruined because I know you're making that</v>

738
00:32:19.261 --> 00:32:21.270
<v Speaker 4>CD.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm aware of it,</v>

739
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.760
<v Speaker 4>but most of them I never thought they'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>end up on a seat.</v>

740
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.910
<v Speaker 4>So it's just me talking to Blake and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of tells our friendship.</v>

741
00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:29.370
<v Speaker 4>You see the friendship grow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's there,</v>

742
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:29.990
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

743
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.150
<v Speaker 4>there are some very funny to hear them </v>
<v Speaker 4>years later.</v>

744
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:33.770
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

745
00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:39.150
<v Speaker 5>that's a cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a cool thing to watch someone like </v>

746
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:39.150
<v Speaker 5>that become a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

747
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 5>And just see them when they're</v>

748
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 3>first starting out and that first year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who fuck knows what's gonna happen,</v>

749
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did.</v>

750
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.360
<v Speaker 3>You decide I want to try stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you start going to open mic nights </v>

751
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 3>that first year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what's going to happen.</v>

752
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:54.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean you might eat it a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>times and I'd be like,</v>

753
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:56.630
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is too painful.</v>

754
00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what other jobs that painful when </v>

755
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:01.660
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you fuck up.</v>

756
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.290
<v Speaker 3>I know I couldn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even think about getting a </v>

757
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:05.290
<v Speaker 3>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like because you did the MC,</v>

758
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.750
<v Speaker 3>I was on Wednesday and then sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would a host.</v>

759
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:13.780
<v Speaker 3>That was a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to host the open mic night </v>

760
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:13.780
<v Speaker 3>and then do Thursday best affiliate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but getting a week.</v>

761
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.960
<v Speaker 3>And I remember once sitting around with </v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend,</v>

762
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.840
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think you'll get a weekend ever?</v>

763
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

764
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know why I didn't think I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a weekend.</v>

765
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what you think when you first</v>

766
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:25.160
<v Speaker 3>start now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

767
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.770
<v Speaker 3>I know some door guy told me I'd get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

768
00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get a weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I thought?</v>

769
00:33:29.781 --> 00:33:34.781
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know what the fuck he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about because I'm not going to </v>

770
00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:37.661
<v Speaker 3>be so stupid to figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Tony knows I'm going to get a </v>

771
00:33:37.661 --> 00:33:37.661
<v Speaker 3>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he probably did know he was,</v>

772
00:33:37.661 --> 00:33:39.760
<v Speaker 3>he was around comedy a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably knew something,</v>

773
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.760
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

774
00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:41.800
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll be,</v>

775
00:33:41.801 --> 00:33:42.910
<v Speaker 3>he'll get a weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

776
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.800
<v Speaker 3>I got a weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

777
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

778
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 3>when you talk and when you're talking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>an open Miker,</v>

779
00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.540
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're talking to someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to make a journey that like </v>

780
00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.331
<v Speaker 3>if you had 100 open migrants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the odds that they become </v>

781
00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:01.650
<v Speaker 3>professional?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

782
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.550
<v Speaker 3>they make it to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

783
00:34:03.551 --> 00:34:05.450
<v Speaker 3>a working stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing.</v>

784
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 3>I want to guess it's one out of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

785
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.650
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say it that way,</v>

786
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a bigger number,</v>

787
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:19.001
<v Speaker 3>but if you take an isolated area like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia or whatever city and you </v>

788
00:34:19.001 --> 00:34:19.001
<v Speaker 3>don't have any of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

789
00:34:19.001 --> 00:34:21.890
<v Speaker 3>when you go into a town sometimes I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>know like some of the newer Comedians,</v>

790
00:34:21.891 --> 00:34:23.210
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hang out a lot.</v>

791
00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they work at the club because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're new,</v>

792
00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.620
<v Speaker 3>but there's like a group of them and out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that group,</v>

793
00:34:27.621 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 3>whatever city it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always think somebody's going to maybe</v>

794
00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 3>to even maybe three different levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one or two at each level.</v>

795
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.450
<v Speaker 3>But there's always a hundred guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

796
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Like I started out with meeting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cream of the crop.</v>

797
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Well you definitely are if it's in La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

798
00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Talking about like when you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>road lately or New York or when they </v>

799
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.381
<v Speaker 3>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean like Bloomington has a scene </v>

800
00:34:53.381 --> 00:34:53.381
<v Speaker 3>and you think a lot of those people you </v>
<v Speaker 3>two years later,</v>

801
00:34:53.381 --> 00:34:54.020
<v Speaker 3>like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look how good they're doing.</v>

802
00:34:54.021 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 3>And they're in New York now and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>so in a small group.</v>

803
00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.170
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the.</v>

804
00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Probably on the all the comedians in </v>
<v Speaker 3>every city that are doing it right now.</v>

805
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.630
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's a lot lower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

806
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.650
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If what I'm saying is from the person </v>

807
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.310
<v Speaker 3>who makes it onstage the first time </v>
<v Speaker 3>every week at the comedy store,</v>

808
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:12.980
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they get?</v>

809
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:18.220
<v Speaker 3>16 people in a night and probably more </v>
<v Speaker 3>20 people on an open mic night because </v>

810
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.551
<v Speaker 3>they do three minutes each.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just say they get up 20 people a </v>

811
00:35:22.551 --> 00:35:25.901
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of those people are going to </v>

812
00:35:25.901 --> 00:35:28.520
<v Speaker 3>become professionals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's might be one out of 100.</v>

813
00:35:28.521 --> 00:35:29.340
<v Speaker 3>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

814
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.070
<v Speaker 3>and that on that because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

815
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:33.200
<v Speaker 3>and then how many people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people go up once,</v>

816
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.130
<v Speaker 3>so Mike's are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I encourage anyone,</v>

817
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 3>if you're not</v>

818
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:43.610
<v Speaker 7>even into doing standup,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just to go watch an open mic night and </v>

819
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 7>see the mania and the madness and what </v>
<v Speaker 7>some of it is.</v>

820
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 7>Just someone who you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You what you're seeing as potential,</v>

821
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or no potential.</v>

822
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.040
<v Speaker 7>You're seeing one of those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Either you see it,</v>

823
00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:00.120
<v Speaker 7>someone where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that person is fucking never going to be</v>

824
00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:01.890
<v Speaker 7>a standup comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no way,</v>

825
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.600
<v Speaker 7>there's just no way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

826
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.670
<v Speaker 7>like there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then you're saying,</v>

827
00:36:05.671 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 7>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe she was funny.</v>

828
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:14.570
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes when you say the first one </v>

829
00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:14.570
<v Speaker 7>where he would go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no way.</v>

830
00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:14.570
<v Speaker 7>It's not even.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They did a bay.</v>

831
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.190
<v Speaker 7>It's never based on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're basing it on something.</v>

832
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:22.340
<v Speaker 7>It's still a guest,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we're basically on something pretty </v>

833
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.411
<v Speaker 7>fair.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not like they're joke didn't go </v>

834
00:36:24.411 --> 00:36:24.411
<v Speaker 7>over and we're going on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

835
00:36:24.411 --> 00:36:27.261
<v Speaker 7>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes it's the vanilla illness of </v>

836
00:36:27.261 --> 00:36:27.480
<v Speaker 7>the personality might not lend itself to</v>
<v Speaker 7>be.</v>

837
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.230
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes their brains broken to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some people just,</v>

838
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:36.110
<v Speaker 7>their brain's not working right and they</v>
<v Speaker 7>can kind of get by and regular life kind</v>

839
00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:39.440
<v Speaker 7>of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you see them like express himself.</v>

840
00:36:39.441 --> 00:36:44.441
<v Speaker 7>Like I'm going to prepare something and </v>
<v Speaker 7>bring it to the stage and then people </v>

841
00:36:44.441 --> 00:36:47.721
<v Speaker 7>go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what in the fuck is going on in your </v>

842
00:36:47.721 --> 00:36:47.721
<v Speaker 7>head,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sir?</v>

843
00:36:47.721 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 7>There's those people and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 7>not.</v>

844
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.750
<v Speaker 7>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It may be,</v>

845
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:56.780
<v Speaker 7>might be perfect for music.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They might be perfect for being the </v>

846
00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.480
<v Speaker 7>front of a punk band or something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is,</v>

847
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:03.290
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>certain people like I think it might be </v>

848
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.021
<v Speaker 7>one out of 100,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like if you bomb on stage with a song </v>

849
00:37:06.021 --> 00:37:07.240
<v Speaker 7>has got to be pretty bad too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

850
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:12.980
<v Speaker 7>But you have like the others obviously </v>
<v Speaker 7>the people that have just so nobody </v>

851
00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.120
<v Speaker 7>thinks we're being babies here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The people that have physical risks,</v>

852
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.560
<v Speaker 7>that's way worse thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

853
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 7>First responders,</v>
<v Speaker 7>police officers,</v>

854
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.690
<v Speaker 7>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even in sports,</v>

855
00:37:21.691 --> 00:37:26.691
<v Speaker 7>I always say I could never do it because</v>
<v Speaker 7>in a comedy show and often it happens.</v>

856
00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:31.911
<v Speaker 7>Everybody can win in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if you're on the road and you're </v>

857
00:37:31.911 --> 00:37:31.911
<v Speaker 7>with two other comedians or three or </v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever,</v>

858
00:37:31.911 --> 00:37:33.180
<v Speaker 7>there's so many nights where everybody </v>
<v Speaker 7>wins.</v>

859
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.860
<v Speaker 7>But in the sports,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as you know,</v>

860
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 7>I'm always thinking I could,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could,</v>

861
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 7>I can't oppress you and I'm not even </v>
<v Speaker 7>into sports.</v>

862
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 7>I don't give a shit about sports,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when I watch a game,</v>

863
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:43.950
<v Speaker 7>I get a stomach ache for the other team.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

864
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:49.010
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't take what some of comedy is a </v>

865
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.010
<v Speaker 7>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know why?</v>

866
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 7>It's because like you're attacking </v>
<v Speaker 7>things that aren't there.</v>

867
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:56.150
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you're going after stupid laws and </v>

868
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:59.370
<v Speaker 7>dumb shit that happened and like you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're literally by using your words and</v>

869
00:37:59.371 --> 00:38:04.371
<v Speaker 7>the way you're describing things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Literally having a little battle with </v>

870
00:38:04.371 --> 00:38:05.280
<v Speaker 7>something that's not even there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I call them verbal.</v>

871
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 7>I hope I say right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Verbal Shit.</v>

872
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.460
<v Speaker 7>What's it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When in prison they.</v>

873
00:38:08.461 --> 00:38:11.700
<v Speaker 7>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shifts shifts or so?</v>

874
00:38:11.701 --> 00:38:15.580
<v Speaker 7>White Shank,</v>
<v Speaker 7>shank a verbal shawntia.</v>

875
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.090
<v Speaker 7>Shift them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>shift them with your shank.</v>

876
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.680
<v Speaker 7>We'll be back.</v>

877
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:29.070
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes when a comedian like has just </v>

878
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:29.070
<v Speaker 7>a turn of phrase that would fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I always go,</v>

879
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:29.810
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's shifted him with his words.</v>

880
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 7>He just a verbal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that was correct.</v>

881
00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 7>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's fun to watch.</v>

882
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.910
<v Speaker 7>If</v>

883
00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.660
<v Speaker 3>somebody knows how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

884
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 3>That's what roast battle was all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rose battles essentially a support.</v>

885
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would fucking mock each other,</v>

886
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:48.160
<v Speaker 3>mock each other's lives in jokes and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>really mean.</v>

887
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some of it was like,</v>

888
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.880
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would talk about their looks like,</v>

889
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are.</v>

890
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.560
<v Speaker 3>It's painful and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and enjoyed it.</v>

891
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:59.290
<v Speaker 3>I saw it up because it's almost a parody</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a roast battle.</v>

892
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 3>I sold at the comedy store in the little</v>
<v Speaker 3>room and it was crazy.</v>

893
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 3>But when I'm watching I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too sensitive.</v>

894
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would crush me,</v>

895
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 3>it would just fucking crushed me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to know the jokes that they</v>

896
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:13.510
<v Speaker 3>would make and of course some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't care,</v>

897
00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:15.490
<v Speaker 3>but to watch other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

898
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

899
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 3>it was exhilarating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Joke.</v>

900
00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 3>Writing exercise.</v>

901
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.770
<v Speaker 3>It is unfortunately some people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at that and then.</v>

902
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.930
<v Speaker 3>But when it comes to their act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

903
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.960
<v Speaker 3>they don't explore as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So think about like if you're writing </v>

904
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.620
<v Speaker 3>about someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's some people.</v>

905
00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:37.650
<v Speaker 3>My point is that there's some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've seen that are really good at </v>

906
00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:37.650
<v Speaker 3>that roast battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see a lot of people do it,</v>

907
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.750
<v Speaker 3>but then you see their set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their actual standup set and like it's </v>

908
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:42.820
<v Speaker 3>missing a spark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

909
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:47.821
<v Speaker 3>There was a spark that you had when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were in combat with this other person </v>

910
00:39:47.821 --> 00:39:48.310
<v Speaker 3>because you knew they were going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>firing at us.</v>

911
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.470
<v Speaker 3>So you were firing at them and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>all in fun,</v>

912
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:55.590
<v Speaker 3>but it was also a chance to flex your </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedic writing skills will then when </v>

913
00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:56.970
<v Speaker 3>you're on stage and it's just you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what?</v>

914
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.540
<v Speaker 3>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any.</v>

915
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.880
<v Speaker 3>Where's the juice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you upset?</v>

916
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Are you excited?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you like,</v>

917
00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:08.941
<v Speaker 3>what are you just pretending it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big deal that you're onstage with a </v>

918
00:40:08.941 --> 00:40:12.361
<v Speaker 3>microphone in front of you because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real problem too or you're </v>

919
00:40:12.361 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 3>pretending it's not weird that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice is amplified,</v>

920
00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:18.160
<v Speaker 3>motivate someone to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a great way to say that like,</v>

921
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:23.020
<v Speaker 3>why are you pretending it's not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to jump down,</v>

922
00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:24.270
<v Speaker 3>but come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on here?</v>

923
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you pretending you're not fully </v>

924
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:29.620
<v Speaker 3>aware that people are standing in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of you,</v>

925
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:30.790
<v Speaker 3>hanging on your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every word.</v>

926
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.870
<v Speaker 3>There was a comedian like that in A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't even say the city,</v>

927
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:36.490
<v Speaker 3>but they had a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a roast,</v>

928
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.770
<v Speaker 3>a battle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a roast battle.</v>

929
00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:43.980
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were some people from the history </v>

930
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.140
<v Speaker 3>like Napoleon and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

931
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.960
<v Speaker 3>That sounds awesome because it was also </v>
<v Speaker 3>a weight.</v>

932
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.080
<v Speaker 3>That's why I said it was a writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>sample because you know if you were </v>

933
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.080
<v Speaker 3>writing jokes you could also make </v>
<v Speaker 3>statements,</v>

934
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.820
<v Speaker 3>political statements and and go back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one gets hurt because you're making </v>

935
00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.361
<v Speaker 3>fun of Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still have to write great jokes </v>

936
00:41:00.361 --> 00:41:01.150
<v Speaker 3>and one guy that did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was amazing.</v>

937
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Like what the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just thought,</v>

938
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:04.720
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he should know that he should be writing</v>

939
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:10.140
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his standup is exactly what you just </v>

940
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:10.140
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't.</v>

941
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:10.600
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

942
00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:10.980
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

943
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I hope he knows like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

944
00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:14.970
<v Speaker 3>that's your strong point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is the standup,</v>

945
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>like when when you're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

946
00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:19.720
<v Speaker 3>you have a little bit more freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more open ended,</v>

947
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 3>but on the STANDUP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

948
00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:25.060
<v Speaker 3>People are paying to see you and you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be getting laughs.</v>

949
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're not getting laughs is </v>

950
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.201
<v Speaker 3>this feeling of disappointment in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience and when you're doing new </v>

951
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:32.201
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

952
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:34.580
<v Speaker 3>this is a distinct possibility.</v>

953
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.580
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna be no fucking laughs in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the spot where you wanted there to be </v>

954
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:39.580
<v Speaker 3>laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

955
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:39.580
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yikes.</v>

956
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funnier idea,</v>

957
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 3>or maybe I just fucked up the way I said</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

958
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:48.851
<v Speaker 3>or maybe I just have to stretch it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and figure out where the good spots are </v>

959
00:41:48.851 --> 00:41:49.520
<v Speaker 3>and then start hacking it up and editing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

960
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just going to be a real problem with</v>

961
00:41:52.731 --> 00:41:53.810
<v Speaker 3>bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna,</v>

962
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:56.310
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna be have to be comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 3>with saying dot joke.</v>

963
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.670
<v Speaker 3>That's just not that good and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people just aren't.</v>

964
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 3>So they get to that spot and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

965
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:02.450
<v Speaker 3>Let's do some tried and true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

966
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 3>let's hit them with some proven stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

967
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:09.140
<v Speaker 3>I know you got me nervous one night at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store when you were like,</v>

968
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:10.370
<v Speaker 3>just everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were right.</v>

969
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.480
<v Speaker 3>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

971
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

972
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:15.440
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

973
00:42:15.441 --> 00:42:20.441
<v Speaker 3>because we were supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the show or something where I </v>

974
00:42:20.441 --> 00:42:20.441
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was up on stage.</v>

975
00:42:20.441 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

976
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:23.090
<v Speaker 3>maybe he's never seen this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

977
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Well we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't a stand up on the spot.</v>

978
00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:26.480
<v Speaker 3>So there was nick use of show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The thing was that,</v>

980
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.350
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

981
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Speaker 3>that show you're supposed to only work </v>
<v Speaker 3>on new shit.</v>

982
00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:36.450
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to only work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have like a weird rule where when you</v>

983
00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.490
<v Speaker 3>sit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I came up with it,</v>

984
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.560
<v Speaker 3>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

985
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.840
<v Speaker 3>it can't be any older than six weeks old</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he bit,</v>

986
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:45.860
<v Speaker 3>you have to self police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but any bit older than six weeks old you</v>

987
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:50.861
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to remember exactly because I </v>

988
00:42:50.861 --> 00:42:50.861
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have fought that because that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good move.</v>

989
00:42:50.861 --> 00:42:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six weeks,</v>

990
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:54.310
<v Speaker 3>six weeks is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got some time to.</v>

991
00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:56.270
<v Speaker 3>You're saying it's fresh and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

992
00:42:56.271 --> 00:42:57.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's new enough,</v>

993
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.170
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like you should have </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked it out a little bit.</v>

994
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 3>That's more than fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More than fair,</v>

995
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:03.710
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more than fair.</v>

996
00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.130
<v Speaker 3>It might even be four weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four weeks might be the real.</v>

997
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:09.560
<v Speaker 3>She'll pull it back a little bit back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little three,</v>

998
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.140
<v Speaker 3>three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe three with dangerous three.</v>

999
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.020
<v Speaker 3>That means you've said it five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six times.</v>

1000
00:43:15.021 --> 00:43:20.021
<v Speaker 3>What more do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes there's a bit that works real </v>

1001
00:43:20.021 --> 00:43:20.780
<v Speaker 3>good and then doesn't ever see those </v>
<v Speaker 3>bits.</v>

1002
00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 3>They just die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one's going to be a quarterback and</v>

1003
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:27.140
<v Speaker 3>then sometimes I never know either if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>videotape myself,</v>

1004
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:29.090
<v Speaker 3>maybe I've learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you record yourself?</v>

1005
00:43:29.091 --> 00:43:29.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1006
00:43:29.961 --> 00:43:34.961
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm so embarrassed because I know </v>

1007
00:43:34.961 --> 00:43:34.961
<v Speaker 3>how good it is to do it.</v>

1008
00:43:34.961 --> 00:43:37.870
<v Speaker 3>I did it five or six times in my whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>career and it was,</v>

1009
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 3>it did so much good that would think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because I'm lazy,</v>

1010
00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:42.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

1011
00:43:42.481 --> 00:43:44.930
<v Speaker 3>you know what you're just saying about </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to a joke and it's just dead,</v>

1012
00:43:44.931 --> 00:43:45.430
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1013
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 3>just say I started doing this thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it really helps me get out of those </v>

1014
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 3>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll just,</v>

1015
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.380
<v Speaker 3>I'll hit the punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1016
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.730
<v Speaker 3>So whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go black.</v>

1017
00:43:52.731 --> 00:43:53.830
<v Speaker 3>And then it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1018
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll make up a punchline and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>blue,</v>

1019
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I realized instantly,</v>

1020
00:43:58.551 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 3>so here's what I just did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes in comedy,</v>

1021
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:02.780
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to an end of a joke and it's not</v>

1022
00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:05.350
<v Speaker 3>the crowds fault because you're great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just doesn't land.</v>

1023
00:44:05.351 --> 00:44:07.340
<v Speaker 3>And it's uncomfortable for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel bad for you.</v>

1024
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.340
<v Speaker 3>So what I did when I hit that period </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 30 seconds ago,</v>

1025
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:15.490
<v Speaker 3>I just been talking nonstop ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now we're here and everybody's </v>

1026
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:19.361
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's perfect.</v>

1027
00:44:19.431 --> 00:44:22.450
<v Speaker 3>That's a perfect for like 15 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they figured out.</v>

1028
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.720
<v Speaker 3>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they going to figure I go,</v>

1029
00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:26.480
<v Speaker 3>so about 15 seconds ago I hit a punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't your fault.</v>

1030
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 3>And now everybody's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey.</v>

1031
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:35.600
<v Speaker 7>And then the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a whole new premise,</v>

1032
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.740
<v Speaker 7>whole new premise launches those like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like Jesus Christ,</v>

1033
00:44:39.741 --> 00:44:43.790
<v Speaker 7>it's like building a house out of your </v>
<v Speaker 7>planting a seed and then you're watering</v>

1034
00:44:43.791 --> 00:44:48.791
<v Speaker 7>the ground and then the tree comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got to wait for it to grow and then </v>

1035
00:44:48.791 --> 00:44:49.000
<v Speaker 7>cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1036
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:52.130
<v Speaker 7>you're talking about not a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 7>premise,</v>

1037
00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:56.690
<v Speaker 7>like weird out their premises or </v>
<v Speaker 7>premises you've never discussed before.</v>

1038
00:44:56.691 --> 00:45:01.691
<v Speaker 7>Things you never thought of before you </v>
<v Speaker 7>go into a whole new way of thinking </v>

1039
00:45:01.691 --> 00:45:02.300
<v Speaker 7>about stuff is so much fun,</v>
<v Speaker 7>isn't it?</v>

1040
00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:03.530
<v Speaker 7>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's awesome.</v>

1041
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.980
<v Speaker 7>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I still like it really is just and the,</v>

1042
00:45:06.981 --> 00:45:08.180
<v Speaker 7>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

1043
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:09.430
<v Speaker 7>you know</v>

1044
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.130
<v Speaker 1>the recorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on the phone,</v>

1045
00:45:11.131 --> 00:45:16.131
<v Speaker 1>that's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because I don't like writing </v>

1046
00:45:16.131 --> 00:45:16.131
<v Speaker 1>stuff down and I can say that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

1047
00:45:16.131 --> 00:45:18.210
<v Speaker 7>Did you do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do the text speech to text?</v>

1048
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.610
<v Speaker 7>Will you just talk into it and writes </v>
<v Speaker 7>her notes for you?</v>

1049
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.380
<v Speaker 7>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every one of my.</v>

1050
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.130
<v Speaker 7>I can just put jokes on there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but in five I,</v>

1051
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:26.580
<v Speaker 7>you know the recorder.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well that recorder man,</v>

1052
00:45:26.581 --> 00:45:28.650
<v Speaker 7>that just cleaned my head up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1053
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.750
<v Speaker 7>recorders.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Giant to pick deal.</v>

1054
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.900
<v Speaker 7>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He anything where you can catch those </v>

1055
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:35.900
<v Speaker 7>slippery thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

1056
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.280
<v Speaker 7>I think Neal Brennan said it best.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think he called his notebook.</v>

1057
00:45:38.281 --> 00:45:43.281
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is like a net where I attach ideas </v>

1058
00:45:43.281 --> 00:45:43.281
<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ooh,</v>

1059
00:45:43.281 --> 00:45:47.660
<v Speaker 7>that is a great way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is a great way of looking at it </v>

1060
00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.900
<v Speaker 7>because some ideas just go away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like they're so profound.</v>

1061
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:55.250
<v Speaker 7>It's so profound.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then a couple of hours later you're </v>

1062
00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:55.250
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck was I thinking?</v>

1063
00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:59.540
<v Speaker 7>That always used to get me where I'd </v>
<v Speaker 7>have this amazing idea what I thought </v>

1064
00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.690
<v Speaker 7>was an amazing idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I go,</v>

1065
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.040
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's such a good idea.</v>

1066
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:03.740
<v Speaker 7>I'll remember it in the morning and I go</v>
<v Speaker 7>to school</v>

1067
00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.850
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1068
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I still pull that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never remembered it.</v>

1069
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:07.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1070
00:46:07.541 --> 00:46:09.020
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still pulled out.</v>

1071
00:46:09.021 --> 00:46:11.120
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing if my phone,</v>

1072
00:46:11.121 --> 00:46:14.900
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't have my charger now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally got a court in next to the bed.</v>

1073
00:46:14.901 --> 00:46:16.790
<v Speaker 1>So I always have a cord to plug in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

1074
00:46:16.791 --> 00:46:20.060
<v Speaker 1>But I'd never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I not half the time.</v>

1075
00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I still have out.</v>

1076
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:23.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a good idea.</v>

1077
00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Never Hedberg had a job,</v>

1078
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:30.030
<v Speaker 7>too lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>too lazy to get up to get a pen to write</v>

1079
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:32.610
<v Speaker 7>something down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I just could fence myself.</v>

1080
00:46:32.611 --> 00:46:33.480
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't that funny in the.</v>

1081
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:38.400
<v Speaker 1>But what's great is that that was a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>he did on stage and it would kill.</v>

1082
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1083
00:46:39.251 --> 00:46:44.251
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't remember the way you get </v>

1084
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:44.251
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1085
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:45.200

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do drugs.</v>

1087

<v Speaker 1>I still do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I used to to.</v>

1088
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:52.350

<v Speaker 1>I hope this goes somewhere.</v>

1106
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.200
<v Speaker 1>So I used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1107
00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did the uh,</v>

1108
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.000
<v Speaker 7>I used to do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1109
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 7>so my friend asked me if I still do </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1110
00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:35.770
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I still do,</v>

1113
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:45.970
<v Speaker 7>but I used to to do something and it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>amazing that you kept it all together.</v>

<v Speaker 7>It makes sense,</v>

1116
00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.880
<v Speaker 7>but you nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You dismounted.</v>

1117
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 7>I shouldn't try feet flat on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So solid dismount.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

1121
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:00.910
<v Speaker 7>Mitch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>

1122
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:06.210
<v Speaker 7>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the more amazing comedians ever </v>

1123
00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.731
<v Speaker 7>because what he would do was a complete </v>
<v Speaker 7>nonsequitors who would go from one non </v>

1124
00:48:08.731 --> 00:48:12.700
<v Speaker 7>sequitur to another nonsequitor nothing </v>
<v Speaker 7>connected together other than here.</v>

1125
00:48:12.701 --> 00:48:14.620
<v Speaker 7>Here's some other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought up.</v>

1126
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.880
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's another shit I wrote down and,</v>

1127
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 7>and even though not through probably a </v>
<v Speaker 7>good idea for everyone to know that does</v>

1128
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:24.490
<v Speaker 7>one liners,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that there still has to be an essence of</v>

1129
00:48:24.491 --> 00:48:24.700
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>

1130
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:29.700
<v Speaker 7>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even though he's jokes didn't segue </v>

1131
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 7>together like they seem you're still,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you knew who he was,</v>

1132
00:48:29.801 --> 00:48:31.810
<v Speaker 7>but his jokes obviously like the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1133
00:48:31.811 --> 00:48:32.720
<v Speaker 7>he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1134
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.810
<v Speaker 7>he definitely had there not just </v>
<v Speaker 7>individual jokes,</v>

1135
00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:38.110
<v Speaker 7>just glued it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were all so silly.</v>

1136
00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:39.430
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

1137
00:48:39.431 --> 00:48:44.431
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've always said the best way to </v>

1138
00:48:44.431 --> 00:48:47.671
<v Speaker 7>describe him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's like one of my favorite silly </v>

1139
00:48:47.671 --> 00:48:47.671
<v Speaker 7>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>

1140
00:48:47.671 --> 00:48:47.671
<v Speaker 7>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people you don't hear,</v>

1141
00:48:47.671 --> 00:48:52.140
<v Speaker 7>always complimentary.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Of course it's silly and that's what I </v>

1142
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.620
<v Speaker 7>realized later after he died,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like how silly.</v>

1143
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:54.250
<v Speaker 7>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Silly,</v>

1144
00:48:54.251 --> 00:48:56.290
<v Speaker 7>so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that was who he was.</v>

1145
00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:57.330
<v Speaker 7>Very silly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that,</v>

1146
00:48:57.331 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 7>that's what you know about him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1147
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 7>he was the type of comedian he would get</v>
<v Speaker 7>into his rhythm,</v>

1148
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:06.541
<v Speaker 7>like I would listen to him a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>times on the way to the airport because </v>

1149
00:49:06.541 --> 00:49:06.541
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was,</v>

1150
00:49:06.541 --> 00:49:10.601
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that traffic on the way to the airport </v>

1151
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:10.601
<v Speaker 7>is annoying.</v>

1152
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:10.601
<v Speaker 7>He just wanted to just chill out and </v>
<v Speaker 7>giggle.</v>

1153
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:14.560
<v Speaker 7>So I'd put on some Mitch Hedberg I just </v>
<v Speaker 7>be fucking giggling like,</v>

1154
00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:17.560
<v Speaker 7>and when you're just smiling when you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>not,</v>

1155
00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.410
<v Speaker 7>when he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1156
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.380
<v Speaker 7>in between punchlines and just have a </v>
<v Speaker 7>big smile on your face because he,</v>

1157
00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:25.660
<v Speaker 7>he would put on this silly vibe and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>would get caught up in it because it was</v>

1158
00:49:25.661 --> 00:49:30.661
<v Speaker 7>really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then he had such great writing too </v>

1159
00:49:30.661 --> 00:49:30.661
<v Speaker 7>and playful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was,</v>

1160
00:49:30.661 --> 00:49:30.661
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1161
00:49:30.661 --> 00:49:31.540
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1162
00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:36.580
<v Speaker 7>His Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think in Rodney had a lot of that too.</v>

1163
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.430
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Rodney's seriously,</v>

1164
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 7>seriously underrated comedian and his </v>
<v Speaker 7>style.</v>

1165
00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.830
<v Speaker 7>There was a great article about it </v>
<v Speaker 7>recently,</v>

1166
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:47.570
<v Speaker 7>didn't we talk about this on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 7>at Rod.</v>

1167
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.710
<v Speaker 7>There was an article that was written </v>
<v Speaker 7>recently about Rodney,</v>

1168
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 7>I forget who wrote it like esquire and </v>
<v Speaker 7>one of those things,</v>

1169
00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:58.740
<v Speaker 7>but they were talking about how long it </v>
<v Speaker 7>took him to become a good comedian that </v>

1170
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:04.801
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't until he was in his fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he figured it out and it's like </v>

1171
00:50:04.801 --> 00:50:09.000
<v Speaker 7>talking about him boiling down his act </v>
<v Speaker 7>and talking about how many cutting all </v>

1172
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.171
<v Speaker 7>the fat out of his act.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you go back and listen to his early </v>

1173
00:50:13.171 --> 00:50:15.750
<v Speaker 7>performances and you could see as more </v>
<v Speaker 7>meandering and then towards the more </v>

1174
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.631
<v Speaker 7>standup p and I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I realized that a few years ago and </v>

1175
00:50:19.631 --> 00:50:20.250
<v Speaker 7>you'll listen to the old ones and he </v>
<v Speaker 7>would like,</v>

1176
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:22.000
<v Speaker 7>in other words of Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>could be was still rodney,</v>

1177
00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:24.160
<v Speaker 7>but it would be like this is more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a joke.</v>

1178
00:50:24.161 --> 00:50:25.930
<v Speaker 7>A comedian will tell.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not really one line to be like,</v>

1179
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:26.770
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you know,</v>

1180
00:50:26.771 --> 00:50:27.860
<v Speaker 7>you're old when your</v>

1181
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.320
<v Speaker 4>family tells you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when your,</v>

1182
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.070
<v Speaker 4>when your family talks in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1183
00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:31.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1184
00:50:31.751 --> 00:50:33.770
<v Speaker 4>my pups in the garage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got people coming over,</v>

1185
00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pop just sits there and drools.</v>

1186
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.920
<v Speaker 4>But that was more like a piece and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>forgot about that.</v>

1187
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:42.230
<v Speaker 4>Rodney and then there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1188
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:44.750
<v Speaker 4>just a short little stories but they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

1189
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:49.751
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my board member,</v>

1190
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:56.561
<v Speaker 4>Bob Nelson Nelson opened for him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then I got to meet Rodney backstage </v>

1191
00:50:56.561 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 4>through Bob and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is when you think,</v>

1192
00:50:57.681 --> 00:50:59.870
<v Speaker 4>you know something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it plays with everything,</v>

1193
00:50:59.871 --> 00:51:01.340
<v Speaker 4>sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think you know what it is,</v>

1194
00:51:01.341 --> 00:51:03.170
<v Speaker 4>but you really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's still a lot more to learn.</v>

1195
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 4>Of course I knew what timing was before </v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw Rodney.</v>

1196
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:09.080
<v Speaker 4>I could tell you I was a comedian for 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>years at that point,</v>

1197
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.360
<v Speaker 4>but I know timing is.</v>

1198
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:12.950
<v Speaker 4>But then when he saw Rodney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>

1199
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.080
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's timing.</v>

1200
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:20.560
<v Speaker 4>It was so like I knew what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just got a doctor in and what it </v>

1201
00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.480
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just saw it delivered like the best of</v>

1202
00:51:22.481 --> 00:51:24.890
<v Speaker 4>the best of the best and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I go now that I like,</v>

1203
00:51:24.891 --> 00:51:27.370
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was just crazy with the,</v>

1204
00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:30.620
<v Speaker 4>at every turn and every and then just </v>
<v Speaker 4>just when you think,</v>

1205
00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:34.900
<v Speaker 4>how can he take you anywhere in the band</v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks in and then he's like,</v>

1206
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:40.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing bedding music and all this the </v>

1207
00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:40.210
<v Speaker 4>other day and my wife are shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the pump,</v>

1208
00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 4>they got bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he started singing this song </v>

1209
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.960
<v Speaker 4>because everybody's saying them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Rodney did it in his own way.</v>

1210
00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:46.040
<v Speaker 4>He starts going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1211
00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:51.041
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something about to dream that whatever </v>

1212
00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:51.041
<v Speaker 4>the song is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he,</v>

1213
00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:51.380
<v Speaker 4>he does about 10 seconds of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he goes,</v>

1214
00:51:51.381 --> 00:51:56.381
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I singing for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching him.</v>

1215
00:51:56.691 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1216
00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:00.560
<v Speaker 4>you ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a band.</v>

1217
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:01.700
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

1218
00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:03.380
<v Speaker 4>I know that this bad to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just a band.</v>

1219
00:52:03.381 --> 00:52:08.381
<v Speaker 4>But to me a bunch of fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the band has their taught </v>

1220
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.720
<v Speaker 4>because they're all musicians from that </v>
<v Speaker 4>city.</v>

1221
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Obviously they're taught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1222
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.790
<v Speaker 4>so he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1223
00:52:14.791 --> 00:52:16.500
<v Speaker 4>don't tell you what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not,</v>

1224
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.580
<v Speaker 4>and then they all stand up and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're fucking idiots.</v>

1225
00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:27.930
<v Speaker 5>I got to see Rodney when I was 19 when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was working as a security guard.</v>

1226
00:52:28.241 --> 00:52:33.241
<v Speaker 5>A great woods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great Woods is a concert place in </v>

1227
00:52:33.241 --> 00:52:33.430
<v Speaker 5>Mansfield,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts,</v>

1228
00:52:33.431 --> 00:52:35.650
<v Speaker 5>and Rodney was there in the bathrobe </v>
<v Speaker 5>era.</v>

1229
00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:38.020
<v Speaker 5>Did you see bathrobe?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ron Rodney.</v>

1230
00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:40.660
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went out on stage in a bathrobe naked</v>

1231
00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:46.260
<v Speaker 5>with a bathrobe on the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would show up and you're saying he </v>

1232
00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:51.061
<v Speaker 5>was doing arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This place is big break thousand people.</v>

1233
00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:55.840
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that great in a way that he was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking maniac.</v>

1234
00:52:55.841 --> 00:52:58.360
<v Speaker 5>He was a fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was amazing.</v>

1235
00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:03.390
<v Speaker 5>He was so free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was hanging backstage and apparently </v>

1236
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:07.501
<v Speaker 5>his cock is enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His cock and balls were just hanging </v>

1237
00:53:07.501 --> 00:53:07.501
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't give a fuck.</v>

1238
00:53:07.501 --> 00:53:10.600
<v Speaker 5>He just got this bathrobe on and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>got his legs crossed.</v>

1239
00:53:10.601 --> 00:53:14.680
<v Speaker 5>Is fucking sack is hanging down and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>security guards would be like,</v>

1240
00:53:14.681 --> 00:53:16.270
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude?</v>

1241
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.060
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only saw him.</v>

1242
00:53:19.061 --> 00:53:21.580
<v Speaker 5>It's like a bigfoot sighting and I met </v>
<v Speaker 5>him later in life,</v>

1243
00:53:21.581 --> 00:53:26.581
<v Speaker 5>but to me like in 1990,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hadn't even thought about doing stand </v>

1244
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:26.581
<v Speaker 5>up yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was such a huge fan</v>

1245
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:28.170
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He walked from,</v>

1246
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:28.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1247
00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 1>like you're looking down the hallway to </v>
<v Speaker 1>where his dressing room and he walked </v>

1248
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 1>from one room to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1249
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bigfoot sighting.</v>

1250
00:53:33.571 --> 00:53:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I always saw him for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw Rodney.</v>

1251
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1252
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said seeing Rodney was like,</v>

1253
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:44.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not like seeing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you saw Paul Mccartney or you.</v>

1254
00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd freak out.</v>

1255
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 1>But seeing Rodney was like getting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you sell Fred Flintstone.</v>

1256
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:53.020
<v Speaker 1>You can't see Fred Flintstone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a cartoon.</v>

1257
00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Rodney is so larger than life that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was overwhelming.</v>

1258
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:03.410
<v Speaker 1>You weren't just going taking in someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a celebrity and you see it on </v>

1259
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 1>tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there he is.</v>

1260
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.420
<v Speaker 1>There he is like three feet from you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

1261
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:08.100
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1263
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of getting covered by something.</v>

1264
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his boss.</v>

1266
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the sack or his dick or both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal.</v>

1267
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Bob would have bombed out someone of </v>
<v Speaker 1>great stories about like,</v>

1268
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:26.420
<v Speaker 1>and they were so specific and you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rodney said them and it was just so a </v>

1269
00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.800
<v Speaker 1>couple came up to him after their </v>
<v Speaker 1>wedding and they go,</v>

1270
00:54:28.801 --> 00:54:29.760

1271
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:31.200
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

1272
00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:31.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was trying to gamble.</v>

1274
00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:34.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rodney,</v>

1275
00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:36.720

<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

1276
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1277
00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:39.150
<v Speaker 1>you're both could have done better.</v>

1278
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:46.260
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a well disguised insult.</v>

1279
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful joe goes.</v>

1280
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:52.920
<v Speaker 1>People won't know that it was an insult </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they get in their car.</v>

1281
00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means he says we're both.</v>

1282
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:57.900
<v Speaker 1>We're both ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cancel now.</v>

1283
00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:01.740
<v Speaker 1>That's playing ping pong in their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ductile both good and said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That wife goes,</v>

1285
00:55:03.601 --> 00:55:06.810
<v Speaker 1>it's an insult to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's both of us.</v>

1286
00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:11.820
<v Speaker 1>You Moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you find out who the Boston </v>

1287
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:12.020
<v Speaker 1>relationship is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joke like that.</v>

1288
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who has to take it?</v>

1289
00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.570
<v Speaker 1>It's me who's taking the hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1290
00:55:15.571 --> 00:55:20.571
<v Speaker 1>Who feels bad about this one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you both be honest and just to </v>

1291
00:55:20.571 --> 00:55:25.011
<v Speaker 1>make or both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a great thing when someone feels </v>

1292
00:55:25.011 --> 00:55:28.791
<v Speaker 1>like they're too good looking for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person in the relationship and </v>

1293
00:55:28.791 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 1>that you could they be wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1294
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.240
<v Speaker 1>That could be wrong.</v>

1295
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people that like different </v>

1296
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.310
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1297
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:39.150
<v Speaker 1>there's people like different looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys like big girls,</v>

1298
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

1299
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:45.560
<v Speaker 1>people like different shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you think they don't like you as </v>

1300
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:50.900
<v Speaker 1>much as you'd like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I tell you what you do to prevent </v>

1301
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:50.900
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

1302
00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm answering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope,</v>

1303
00:55:52.801 --> 00:55:55.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like,</v>

1304
00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:01.040
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people tell stories will be like </v>

1305
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:01.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything was great.</v>

1306
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I think this is addressing what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

1307
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Everything was great and then it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he or he or she,</v>

1308
00:56:04.391 --> 00:56:05.760
<v Speaker 1>he or she or she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the relationship is,</v>

1309
00:56:05.761 --> 00:56:06.960
<v Speaker 1>somebody else goes and they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>end that.</v>

1310
00:56:06.961 --> 00:56:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Everything was great lip look because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want them to do?</v>

1311
00:56:10.411 --> 00:56:15.411
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's not rules and </v>

1312
00:56:15.411 --> 00:56:17.720
<v Speaker 1>feelings and how you present it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think most of the time everything </v>

1313
00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.540
<v Speaker 1>is great and then you realized one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up and I've had to me,</v>

1314
00:56:21.541 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I must've been on the other end of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just don't</v>

1315
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.050
<v Speaker 4>want to be in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they stay in it because that doesn't</v>

1316
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:29.440
<v Speaker 4>mean they don't not care about you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they stay in it and it gets bad.</v>

1317
00:56:29.441 --> 00:56:33.910
<v Speaker 4>You see it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so I always say I always let someone</v>

1318
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:38.911
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You let them know you're not crazy that </v>

1319
00:56:38.911 --> 00:56:40.050
<v Speaker 4>they learn that by what you tell about </v>
<v Speaker 4>past stories.</v>

1320
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.930
<v Speaker 4>And I once said this to someone that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>very early,</v>

1321
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:43.810
<v Speaker 4>early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early on,</v>

1322
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:48.811
<v Speaker 4>but I said I have a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I practice it in my head and I was glad </v>

1323
00:56:48.811 --> 00:56:49.780
<v Speaker 4>I did it and I was like 23 or four at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

1324
00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:56.010
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a feeling that I like you more </v>

1325
00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 4>than you liked me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1326
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:58.990
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>

1327
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:04.080
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me say this because I don't want </v>

1328
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:04.080
<v Speaker 4>this to be the day where I threw you </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

1329
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:04.360
<v Speaker 4>If I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really like you,</v>

1330
00:57:04.361 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 4>so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I just read it wrong,</v>

1331
00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:06.070
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>

1332
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:06.540
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1333
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:07.860
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the.</v>

1334
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1335
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.810
<v Speaker 4>I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course I'll be sad,</v>

1336
00:57:10.811 --> 00:57:12.610
<v Speaker 4>but I won't hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't be.</v>

1337
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.940
<v Speaker 4>I'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then,</v>

1338
00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:18.970
<v Speaker 4>and then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

1339
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 4>And because I set it in a way that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>

1340
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:24.700
<v Speaker 4>that he would be comfortable to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1341
00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:27.750
<v Speaker 4>if I put a little bit of choke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit of swell,</v>

1342
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.910
<v Speaker 4>but I was okay and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want to know that.</v>

1343
00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:33.970
<v Speaker 4>So that's my question to be delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be delusional.</v>

1344
00:57:33.971 --> 00:57:38.971
<v Speaker 4>I felt it and I asked and I asked the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pack that the fact that I put that </v>

1345
00:57:38.971 --> 00:57:38.971
<v Speaker 4>preface in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1346
00:57:38.971 --> 00:57:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I need to let you know this is not to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make you feel bad,</v>

1347
00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 4>but I do like you because I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to find out.</v>

1348
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Ten years later I thought you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>giving me walking papers.</v>

1349
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.910
<v Speaker 4>So I had to be clear with my feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mainly let that person know.</v>

1350
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:54.480
<v Speaker 4>And that way I didn't end up in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship for another year where I </v>

1351
00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 4>knew the other person might.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could that go bad what I did?</v>

1352
00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:56.350
<v Speaker 4>There's no way that could go bad.</v>

1353
00:57:56.390 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're hanging out with </v>

1354
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 5>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1355
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was a kid,</v>

1356
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:05.950
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the things it took me a </v>
<v Speaker 5>long time to get past was it was always </v>

1357
00:58:06.621 --> 00:58:09.260
<v Speaker 5>thought that if you talked about your </v>
<v Speaker 5>feelings and your emotions,</v>

1358
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.690
<v Speaker 5>that was weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a weakness.</v>

1359
00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 5>It's not something you did with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends and it's not something you </v>

1360
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 5>wanted to do with a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't,</v>

1361
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't want to talk about your </v>

1362
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:23.021
<v Speaker 5>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't want to talk about how you </v>

1363
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:23.360
<v Speaker 5>actually felt about things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wanted to play it stoic.</v>

1364
00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:25.460
<v Speaker 5>You want to Charles Bronson your way </v>
<v Speaker 5>through life.</v>

1365
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a lot of guys tried to do.</v>

1366
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:32.490
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that not understand like we don't the,</v>

1367
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:37.650
<v Speaker 5>one of the big problems with people </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you don't really know who you </v>

1368
00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:39.590
<v Speaker 5>like until you're around them for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>while.</v>

1369
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:41.660
<v Speaker 5>You really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then sometimes you're like,</v>

1370
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:43.820
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not into this person.</v>

1371
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.460
<v Speaker 5>This is the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so bored.</v>

1372
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:48.380
<v Speaker 5>I can't have any more of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations.</v>

1373
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.060
<v Speaker 5>I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do it.</v>

1374
00:58:50.061 --> 00:58:52.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to get out and then.</v>

1375
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:55.010
<v Speaker 5>But everything was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything was going amazing.</v>

1376
00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:55.340
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1377
00:58:55.341 --> 00:58:55.880
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1378
00:58:55.881 --> 00:58:57.560
<v Speaker 5>You thought everything was going </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

1379
00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:00.860
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean everything was going </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing means you didn't even check in.</v>

1380
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:03.590
<v Speaker 5>Right or the other way.</v>

1381
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:09.830
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes be bored as fuck with dudes </v>

1382
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:09.830
<v Speaker 4>where it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we say that like,</v>

1383
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:11.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm comfortable having the only reason I</v>

1384
00:59:11.791 --> 00:59:16.791
<v Speaker 4>get nervous having relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussions when somebody's going to </v>

1385
00:59:16.791 --> 00:59:18.270
<v Speaker 4>heavy on women are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1386
00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 4>that was any truth to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at same sex couples if,</v>

1387
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.480
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was traded by.</v>

1388
00:59:23.481 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think men are crazy.</v>

1389
00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 4>If that was true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's any truth to that.</v>

1390
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:32.141
<v Speaker 4>It's people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people that are evolved and </v>

1391
00:59:32.141 --> 00:59:32.141
<v Speaker 4>there's people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1392
00:59:32.141 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 4>have a deep level head on their </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders.</v>

1393
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.750
<v Speaker 4>Because if there was any truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one section was crazier.</v>

1394
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:39.890
<v Speaker 4>There's a science to disproving that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then in lesbian relationships that you'd</v>

1395
00:59:39.891 --> 00:59:40.190
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1396
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:41.570
<v Speaker 4>how's your relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'd go,</v>

1397
00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:46.660
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course we argue a teeny bit here and </v>

1398
00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:46.660
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1399
00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:46.660
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're both women.</v>

1400
00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:49.841
<v Speaker 4>So we're getting along great now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we got rid of the problem and in </v>

1401
00:59:49.841 --> 00:59:51.110
<v Speaker 4>Male male relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same problems.</v>

1402
00:59:51.111 --> 00:59:52.070
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1403
00:59:52.071 --> 00:59:57.071
<v Speaker 4>we don't have the crazy women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when it's two guys date and </v>

1404
00:59:57.071 --> 00:59:57.071
<v Speaker 4>everything is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No same exact problem.</v>

1405
00:59:57.071 --> 00:59:58.730
<v Speaker 4>So it's not the sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's people.</v>

1406
00:59:59.120 --> 00:59:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Does that make you,</v>

1407
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.960
<v Speaker 5>you're a hundred percent correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could not be more correct.</v>

1408
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:06.830
<v Speaker 5>And there's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got a really avoid this shit.</v>

1409
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.820
<v Speaker 5>There's people that'll say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1410
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:14.830
<v Speaker 5>women are all dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bitches are men are all p Shit and that </v>

1411
01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:15.260
<v Speaker 5>that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

1412
01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 5>these gender based generalizations are </v>
<v Speaker 5>so stupid.</v>

1413
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.980
<v Speaker 5>There's nice people that are women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nice people that are men.</v>

1414
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:24.260
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's plenty of them.</v>

1415
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:29.710
<v Speaker 5>You can't have a few bad relationships </v>
<v Speaker 5>and turn on other people and every </v>

1416
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:34.181
<v Speaker 5>person has the same gender and also like</v>
<v Speaker 5>take a good look at yourself because if </v>

<v Speaker 5>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1422
01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:49.361

<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows you're wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know what it is and someone makes a </v>
<v Speaker 5>generalization like you're not.</v>

1432
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not looking at it,</v>

1433
01:01:09.351 --> 01:01:14.351
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know nice people that are </v>

1434
01:01:14.351 --> 01:01:16.661
<v Speaker 5>black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know any nice people that are </v>

1435
01:01:16.661 --> 01:01:16.661
<v Speaker 5>black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

1436
01:01:16.661 --> 01:01:17.060
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck are you?</v>

1437
01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.670
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can you make this judgment when I've</v>

1438
01:01:19.671 --> 01:01:22.280
<v Speaker 5>met so many?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're not meeting enough people or</v>

1439
01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:23.450
<v Speaker 5>they meet you and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1440
01:01:23.451 --> 01:01:26.180
<v Speaker 5>this guy's a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they avoid you.</v>

1441
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.910
<v Speaker 5>So everybody's got this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're spreading about you.</v>

1442
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:32.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why younger people tend to,</v>

1443
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just by being around.</v>

1444
01:01:34.641 --> 01:01:39.641
<v Speaker 4>I wish there was a place you could go if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't afford college because I </v>

1445
01:01:39.641 --> 01:01:42.371
<v Speaker 4>don't think it's the education at </v>
<v Speaker 4>college that you probably learned the </v>

1446
01:01:42.371 --> 01:01:42.371
<v Speaker 4>most from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the being forced to be around other</v>

1447
01:01:42.371 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Go,</v>

1448
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.230
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather hang out with that group that</v>

1449
01:01:45.231 --> 01:01:47.870
<v Speaker 4>I hated because we have the same taste </v>
<v Speaker 4>in music and you learn it because you're</v>

1450
01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:52.871
<v Speaker 4>forced to live together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wish it wouldn't it be cool if </v>

1451
01:01:52.871 --> 01:01:52.871
<v Speaker 4>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where can you go if you're like,</v>

1452
01:01:52.871 --> 01:01:53.090
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want afford college,</v>

1453
01:01:53.091 --> 01:01:55.160
<v Speaker 4>but I want to put my kids around all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1454
01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:57.180
<v Speaker 4>some parents wouldn't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but kids could.</v>

1455
01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:59.580
<v Speaker 4>I just want to be around every type of </v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

1456
01:01:59.581 --> 01:02:04.581
<v Speaker 4>but you don't know to do that college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about college and I </v>

1457
01:02:04.581 --> 01:02:04.680
<v Speaker 4>didn't go to college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even graduate high school,</v>

1458
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:10.100
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't that true that that's where</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of growing does with young kids </v>

1459
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:10.100
<v Speaker 4>when they're fortunately or another.</v>

1460
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:14.470
<v Speaker 5>Some kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're living with really suppressive </v>

1461
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:16.751
<v Speaker 5>parents and the only way they even know </v>
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck they are is if they could </v>

1462
01:02:16.751 --> 01:02:19.571
<v Speaker 5>sleep in their own bed with open their </v>
<v Speaker 5>own door with their own key going into </v>

1463
01:02:19.571 --> 01:02:23.171
<v Speaker 5>their own room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lie and then just be alone and be away </v>

1464
01:02:23.171 --> 01:02:26.151
<v Speaker 5>from these other fucking people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly giving you these rules that </v>

<v Speaker 5>expectations for your success and like </v>

<v Speaker 5>and they want you to do something that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to pay a lot of money.</v>

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.400
<v Speaker 5>any human beings that have ever lived </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

1488
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.110
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have just said.</v>

1489
01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:34.730
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that I agree with when it</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to [inaudible],</v>

1490
01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:35.520
<v Speaker 4>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1491
01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:37.320
<v Speaker 4>of course there's things we should go </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and get,</v>

1492
01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:42.321
<v Speaker 4>but mostly tomorrow's a better day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it goes when there's something in </v>

1493
01:03:42.321 --> 01:03:42.321
<v Speaker 4>the past that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1494
01:03:42.321 --> 01:03:42.321
<v Speaker 4>that's struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1495
01:03:42.321 --> 01:03:43.260
<v Speaker 4>we should go back to that and learn </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1496
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:46.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm not just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but very rarely does someone get me.</v>

1497
01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:47.660
<v Speaker 4>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always go now and I,</v>

1498
01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:50.310
<v Speaker 4>I get it from another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that is something,</v>

1499
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:52.920
<v Speaker 4>but it explains everything that's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on right now,</v>

1500
01:03:52.921 --> 01:03:57.921
<v Speaker 4>that two kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while I always say kids are getting </v>

1501
01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 4>smarter than their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you smarter and the and um,</v>

1502
01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:01.040
<v Speaker 4>it makes me want to be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1503
01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a progressive bully.</v>

1504
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Like I try to say I called you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called her,</v>

1505
01:04:05.571 --> 01:04:07.050
<v Speaker 4>he said that about you on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So mark married,</v>

1506
01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:07.830
<v Speaker 4>not that word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I go,</v>

1507
01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:12.831
<v Speaker 4>I need people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I might've said a bully but on </v>

1508
01:04:12.831 --> 01:04:12.831
<v Speaker 4>the right side of history.</v>

1509
01:04:12.831 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 4>So it was a compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1510
01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:14.850
<v Speaker 4>And what I meant is a big God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1511
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>

1512
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 4>but that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1513
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:20.310
<v Speaker 4>but you still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you still,</v>

1514
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.200
<v Speaker 4>when I say it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as a character,</v>

1515
01:04:22.201 --> 01:04:23.410
<v Speaker 4>like you still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1516
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:24.840
<v Speaker 4>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you still,</v>

1517
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:28.290
<v Speaker 4>you have clean thoughts and you and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you've changed your views on things.</v>

1518
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.510
<v Speaker 4>But when I say it like I want to be so </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean.</v>

1519
01:04:30.511 --> 01:04:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Like I want to be so fucking mean the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other way.</v>

1520
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Like I know what you mean like dice </v>
<v Speaker 4>clay,</v>

1521
01:04:34.801 --> 01:04:37.320
<v Speaker 4>but with just anybody you don't want gay</v>
<v Speaker 4>marriage,</v>

1522
01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:41.640
<v Speaker 4>die already go home and die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't people live and you ain't even</v>

1523
01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:46.840
<v Speaker 4>drop dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope your baby just the most vicious </v>

1524
01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.490
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all about people that won't like the</v>

1525
01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.200
<v Speaker 4>you know all about does it mean.</v>

1526
01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1527
01:04:49.851 --> 01:04:54.851
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely some merit in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just people realize how fucking stupid </v>

1528
01:04:54.851 --> 01:04:58.871
<v Speaker 5>is because you're mocking it so </v>
<v Speaker 5>relentlessly and everybody's cheering </v>

1529
01:04:58.871 --> 01:05:01.541
<v Speaker 5>along and then someone who might be </v>
<v Speaker 5>entertaining those thoughts is going to </v>

1530
01:05:01.541 --> 01:05:05.260
<v Speaker 5>listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a guy on Sam Harris' podcast </v>

1531
01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.710
<v Speaker 5>this week waking up with Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His name is Christian ecoline and he </v>

1532
01:05:09.411 --> 01:05:14.411
<v Speaker 5>used to be a white male supremacist and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get recruited when he was 14 years </v>

1533
01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.550
<v Speaker 5>old and was in it for like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he said eight years or something</v>

1534
01:05:16.551 --> 01:05:21.551
<v Speaker 5>like that and just was talking to Sam </v>
<v Speaker 5>Harris about these horrific decisions </v>

1535
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:26.941
<v Speaker 5>that he had made and his group that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>had got connected to and they were </v>

1536
01:05:26.941 --> 01:05:30.000
<v Speaker 5>committing violent crimes against black </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and like all this crazy shit that</v>

1537
01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:35.821
<v Speaker 5>he was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you listen to him now as this </v>

1538
01:05:35.821 --> 01:05:38.701
<v Speaker 5>guy in his forties is like super </v>
<v Speaker 5>rational and very intelligent and well </v>

1539
01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:39.400
<v Speaker 5>read and it's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1540
01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:42.190
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just got caught up in this ideology.</v>

1541
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:47.190
<v Speaker 5>I went down this road and other people </v>
<v Speaker 5>were doing the thinking for me and we </v>

1542
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:51.451
<v Speaker 5>were all doing it for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It became this horrific group think that</v>

1543
01:05:51.671 --> 01:05:56.671
<v Speaker 5>he got swept up in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's happening with </v>

1544
01:05:56.671 --> 01:05:57.640
<v Speaker 5>progressive people too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a this,</v>

1545
01:05:57.850 --> 01:06:02.850
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this need to be right and to shout down </v>

1546
01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:06.580
<v Speaker 5>each other and and ruthlessly mock each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other like that has to be used.</v>

1547
01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 5>Like nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like only in,</v>

1548
01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:13.470
<v Speaker 5>in the case of severe issues were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got a country.</v>

1549
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.770
<v Speaker 5>Another country is about to develop a </v>
<v Speaker 5>nuclear weapon.</v>

1550
01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:20.780
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna go after you first or </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've already done it and you have to </v>

1551
01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.780
<v Speaker 5>disarm their nukes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got to be nicer to each other when it </v>

1552
01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 5>comes to talking about these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because every time someone from the left</v>

1553
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:30.190
<v Speaker 5>attacks relentlessly and ruthlessly and </v>
<v Speaker 5>viciously,</v>

1554
01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 5>someone from the right because of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>

1555
01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:35.730
<v Speaker 5>You just start a back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not,</v>

1556
01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:40.790
<v Speaker 5>you're not looking at it in a way like </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's gotta be some way to communicate</v>

1557
01:06:40.811 --> 01:06:43.030
<v Speaker 5>your ideas in a friendly way.</v>

1558
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:48.370
<v Speaker 4>You know what I do now and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm guilty of this and I when I even </v>

1559
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:52.180
<v Speaker 4>from when I did my netflix special to </v>
<v Speaker 4>now the way I do for jokes or like I </v>

1560
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:52.180
<v Speaker 4>changed it because that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1561
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.720
<v Speaker 4>todd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to take people with you?</v>

1562
01:06:53.721 --> 01:06:57.800
<v Speaker 4>Or because someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be Tucker Carlson to the</v>

1563
01:06:57.801 --> 01:06:59.600
<v Speaker 4>other side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so flip it in.</v>

1564
01:06:59.601 --> 01:07:01.970
<v Speaker 4>So fucking snarky that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go,</v>

1565
01:07:01.971 --> 01:07:03.230
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's maybe what I am.</v>

1566
01:07:03.231 --> 01:07:05.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't see it when I agree with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

1567
01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:07.370
<v Speaker 4>So if I see someone that's snarky but it</v>
<v Speaker 4>says everything,</v>

1568
01:07:07.371 --> 01:07:08.180
<v Speaker 4>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I go.</v>

1569
01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.930
<v Speaker 4>So I do want to sometimes bring people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So change the way you say go in a little</v>

1570
01:07:11.931 --> 01:07:16.931
<v Speaker 4>softer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you're trying to bring somebody </v>

1571
01:07:16.931 --> 01:07:18.701
<v Speaker 4>with you and bring them over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But sometimes I want to split the </v>

1572
01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.671
<v Speaker 4>difference and I could be wrong because </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I think when I'm screaming at </v>

1573
01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:23.360
<v Speaker 4>the top of my lungs and I literally have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take a break on the podcast,</v>

1574
01:07:23.361 --> 01:07:28.361
<v Speaker 4>you know about something maybe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>gives and it's about a transgender </v>

1575
01:07:28.361 --> 01:07:28.520
<v Speaker 4>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something I'm not going through,</v>

1576
01:07:28.521 --> 01:07:30.320
<v Speaker 4>but I'm able to scream it.</v>

1577
01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.660
<v Speaker 4>So someone that's going through it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn it house,</v>

1578
01:07:32.661 --> 01:07:37.661
<v Speaker 4>he's so close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or when I can yell about a women's </v>

1579
01:07:37.661 --> 01:07:38.420
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the Goddamn it screamed at the top of</v>

1580
01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.220
<v Speaker 4>my lungs because they say screaming </v>
<v Speaker 4>about what you're not.</v>

1581
01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:45.221
<v Speaker 4>Because you can get angrier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it gives someone their dignity </v>

1582
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:48.071
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe sometimes screaming into the </v>

1583
01:07:48.071 --> 01:07:50.081
<v Speaker 4>Canyon is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not to another person's face right </v>

1584
01:07:50.081 --> 01:07:51.330
<v Speaker 4>into the canyon of podcasting or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1585
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:51.860
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1586
01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.280
<v Speaker 4>But when it comes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

1587
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:56.000
<v Speaker 4>But then you have to decide because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast is always a canyon.</v>

1588
01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.630
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also you have</v>

1589
01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.700
<v Speaker 5>ability so someone is going to attack </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1590
01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:04.701
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the only way they have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>abilities to do it in a twitter post or </v>

1591
01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:05.430
<v Speaker 5>a blog post.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1592
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:08.310
<v Speaker 5>they're all people with their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinions too,</v>

1593
01:08:08.311 --> 01:08:09.180
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.150
<v Speaker 4>That's why you've got to look at things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1596
01:08:12.151 --> 01:08:13.560
<v Speaker 4>You always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1597
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.840
<v Speaker 4>That's why I said I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1598
01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 4>you then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

1599
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:21.110
<v Speaker 3>why I'm very aware that now trying just </v>
<v Speaker 3>way too much stupid fighting.</v>

1600
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:21.940
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1601
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:24.560
<v Speaker 3>there's debate over issues about real </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1602
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Like right now what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

1603
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.070
<v Speaker 3>What do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walk for our lives,</v>

1604
01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.120
<v Speaker 3>watch for our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I go ahead real quick?</v>

1605
01:08:32.121 --> 01:08:37.121
<v Speaker 3>Because I prefer I have a few times and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a belief in one post I want to </v>

1606
01:08:37.121 --> 01:08:41.801
<v Speaker 3>take down because it's a woman that </v>
<v Speaker 3>technically me and it turned into a </v>

1607
01:08:41.801 --> 01:08:43.370
<v Speaker 3>sexist words flying back and forth and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to take it down.</v>

1608
01:08:43.371 --> 01:08:47.960
<v Speaker 3>If I could post why I'm taking it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think when somebody,</v>

1609
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:51.320
<v Speaker 3>even when your fans are defending you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like when someone corrects their fans.</v>

1610
01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1611
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.570
<v Speaker 3>that don't offend me with those words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1612
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:55.080
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1613
01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:57.160
<v Speaker 3>so you're talking about before about </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the verbiage is,</v>

1614
01:08:57.161 --> 01:08:59.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so always try to go in.</v>

1615
01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:01.050
<v Speaker 3>I think you're responsible if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1616
01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:03.450
<v Speaker 3>if they're flying things back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're in a twitter war,</v>

1617
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:05.600
<v Speaker 3>if somebody's saying something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go in and say no,</v>

1618
01:09:05.601 --> 01:09:10.601
<v Speaker 3>you know the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to start throwing around </v>

1619
01:09:10.601 --> 01:09:10.601
<v Speaker 3>these words has nothing even to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the topic.</v>

1620
01:09:10.601 --> 01:09:11.470
<v Speaker 3>If they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way they express themselves.</v>

1621
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Like the way people disagree about </v>
<v Speaker 3>things can change.</v>

1622
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Like the way they communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their disagreement can change how it </v>

1623
01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:19.960
<v Speaker 3>gets resolved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1624
01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.711
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what always happens is if you go </v>

1625
01:09:23.711 --> 01:09:23.960
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go hard pack and I think we're,</v>

1626
01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:26.150
<v Speaker 3>we're dealing with that back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country.</v>

1627
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.240
<v Speaker 3>And what I was going to say is about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this walk far march for our lives,</v>

1628
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:34.690
<v Speaker 3>our lives is that what I'm seeing that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>very confusing to me is from people who </v>

1629
01:09:35.781 --> 01:09:40.781
<v Speaker 3>are gun supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the NRA supporters who and some of </v>

1630
01:09:40.781 --> 01:09:45.191
<v Speaker 3>them have even mocked these kids for </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting attention by going to these </v>

1631
01:09:45.501 --> 01:09:50.501
<v Speaker 3>marches and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're saying that nobody would </v>

1632
01:09:50.501 --> 01:09:50.501
<v Speaker 3>have heard of you or nobody know who you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1633
01:09:50.501 --> 01:09:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a ridiculous way to look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1634
01:09:52.971 --> 01:09:54.840
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very defensive because they're,</v>

1635
01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Speaker 3>if they're feeling like someone's coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>after their guns,</v>

1636
01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:58.590
<v Speaker 3>so they're</v>

1637
01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:03.870
<v Speaker 5>going on the attack in some ways that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>just really not recommended.</v>

1638
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.500
<v Speaker 5>Like the way they're doing their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bench mark.</v>

1639
01:10:07.650 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 5>They're mocking what the what the reason</v>
<v Speaker 5>would be for these kids to be on tv that</v>

1640
01:10:16.691 --> 01:10:21.691
<v Speaker 5>got shot at these kids that got shot at </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're fucking 16 years old and </v>

1641
01:10:23.951 --> 01:10:28.951
<v Speaker 5>they're going to be on TV and someone's </v>
<v Speaker 5>mock know would know who you were if it </v>

1642
01:10:29.321 --> 01:10:31.570
<v Speaker 5>wasn't for this thing or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1643
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.720
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they went through that fucking thing</v>

1644
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:37.750
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The few kids that have gone through this</v>

1645
01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:42.751
<v Speaker 5>thing and the country that are standing </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the public stage and saying,</v>

1646
01:10:43.721 --> 01:10:45.790
<v Speaker 5>look at us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to do something.</v>

1647
01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:48.700
<v Speaker 5>You can't have the same shit happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>over and over and over again,</v>

1648
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.780
<v Speaker 5>and maybe they don't have the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>complicated solution,</v>

1649
01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:54.850
<v Speaker 5>but there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1650
01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.200
<v Speaker 5>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1651
01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:01.380
<v Speaker 5>they're forcing people to talk and if </v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody should be forcing people to </v>

1652
01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:05.761
<v Speaker 5>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the kids that were around their </v>

1653
01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:08.431
<v Speaker 5>friends that got shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who realized there fucking parents are </v>

1654
01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:11.350
<v Speaker 5>working all day and they come home tired</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no one's going to fix nothing.</v>

1655
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:13.920
<v Speaker 5>No one has the time and the patients all</v>
<v Speaker 5>in bed</v>

1656
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:19.070
<v Speaker 3>with the NRA and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations is if they're on the left </v>

1657
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 3>and everybody's beholden to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>special interest groups,</v>

1658
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:23.760
<v Speaker 3>so these kids are seeing all this shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they know nothing's gonna happen.</v>

1659
01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More kids are going to get shot,</v>

1660
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 3>more kids are going to get shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then what are the NRA people do?</v>

1661
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:32.250
<v Speaker 3>They mock these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1662
01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.630
<v Speaker 3>At what point does someone pull you </v>
<v Speaker 3>aside and go,</v>

1663
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in violence,</v>

1664
01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:41.691
<v Speaker 3>obviously relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the old movies when somebody </v>

1665
01:11:41.691 --> 01:11:44.091
<v Speaker 3>would have to stop back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just stops full disdain for any </v>

1666
01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:49.701
<v Speaker 3>retaliation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not even trying to hit someone </v>

1667
01:11:49.701 --> 01:11:49.701
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best part is,</v>

1668
01:11:49.701 --> 01:11:49.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit some with the back of your hand.</v>

1669
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:52.410
<v Speaker 3>The back of your hand is generally more </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive.</v>

1670
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like it hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you hit someone in the back of</v>

1671
01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:55.920
<v Speaker 3>your hand.</v>

1672
01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.920
<v Speaker 3>You can hurt your hand like I know a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of guys have broken their hands in a </v>

1673
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.101
<v Speaker 3>fight because they hit someone with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spinning back fist with the back of </v>

1674
01:12:04.101 --> 01:12:04.110
<v Speaker 3>their hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not protected.</v>

1675
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.790
<v Speaker 3>So that's just letting somebody know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so excited.</v>

1676
01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just saying how to be more </v>

1677
01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:13.220
<v Speaker 3>peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1678
01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is when somebody doesn't</v>

1679
01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:17.430
<v Speaker 3>even mean we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying don't have a conversation</v>

1680
01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:18.980
<v Speaker 3>and don't disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I'm not.</v>

1681
01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.800
<v Speaker 3>We're saying the person that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shake you and stop you is once you start</v>

1682
01:12:22.801 --> 01:12:25.530
<v Speaker 3>making fun of these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone even that agrees with you,</v>

1683
01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:28.260
<v Speaker 3>that there shouldn't be any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there someone on that side,</v>

1684
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.510
<v Speaker 3>they can go stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess there are,</v>

1685
01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.820
<v Speaker 3>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they say,</v>

1686
01:12:32.821 --> 01:12:34.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should learn to see rick,</v>

1687
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1688
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1689
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.870
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

1690
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 3>Rick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy who said if they,</v>

1691
01:12:39.571 --> 01:12:44.571
<v Speaker 3>the kid should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of looking for someone else to </v>

1692
01:12:44.571 --> 01:12:44.940
<v Speaker 3>solve their problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should learn cpr.</v>

1693
01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:46.500
<v Speaker 3>Rick Santorum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:50.190
<v Speaker 3>That makes you not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't even make sense.</v>

1695
01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:52.470
<v Speaker 3>You actually said that doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

1696
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Doctors were tweeting it brilliantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

1697
01:12:55.111 --> 01:12:58.080
<v Speaker 3>like that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're saying John Lennon,</v>

1698
01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:00.900
<v Speaker 3>would that be alive if you'll go a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>cpr,</v>

1699
01:13:00.901 --> 01:13:02.000
<v Speaker 3>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1700
01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:07.020
<v Speaker 3>You just gotta use CPR to repair that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blown out liver and they explained that </v>

1701
01:13:07.411 --> 01:13:10.260
<v Speaker 3>to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then he talked about combating kids.</v>

1702
01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:15.300
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was a great way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just some really clean tweets from </v>

1703
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:15.480
<v Speaker 3>doctors breaking it down very cleanly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would not.</v>

1704
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't make any sense to them as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican.</v>

1705
01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.750
<v Speaker 3>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what if I could just stop?</v>

1706
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:24.990
<v Speaker 3>One thing I really feel like is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>important to this.</v>

1707
01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:30.380
<v Speaker 3>I think both the people on the right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people on the left have way more in </v>

1708
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.011
<v Speaker 3>common than they think they have a part </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that a lot of the battle </v>

1709
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:37.470
<v Speaker 3>that people in the left habits just </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've chosen to be on the left,</v>

1710
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:39.810
<v Speaker 3>the same people in the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've chosen to be on the right.</v>

1711
01:13:39.811 --> 01:13:43.080
<v Speaker 3>So anything that happens on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they completely disagree with.</v>

1712
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:45.000
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They immediately go,</v>

1713
01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:47.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a left wing liberal idea.</v>

1714
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:52.460
<v Speaker 3>And they just have these little back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth with each other that are </v>

1715
01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.140
<v Speaker 3>completely unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the majority of people just want</v>

1716
01:13:55.141 --> 01:13:57.690
<v Speaker 3>everybody to get along and not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime.</v>

1717
01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.700
<v Speaker 3>You think Bernie Sanders maybe could </v>
<v Speaker 3>have done that.</v>

1718
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Not good to have one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what would have happened if he got </v>

1719
01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.630
<v Speaker 3>the problem with Bernie is the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why he let those black lives.</v>

1720
01:14:06.631 --> 01:14:08.910
<v Speaker 3>People take his mic and start screaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the thing like,</v>

1721
01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>hey buddy can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're running for fucking</v>

1722
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.980
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're showing right here that people </v>

1723
01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.021
<v Speaker 5>could just storm the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take the microphone from you like you </v>

1724
01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:22.081
<v Speaker 5>should say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to have a dialogue with </v>

1725
01:14:22.081 --> 01:14:22.090
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's do it publicly.</v>

1726
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.490
<v Speaker 5>Let's schedule it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll come back.</v>

1727
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:29.020
<v Speaker 5>We'll get a large group of people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll speak with you on this stage if you</v>

1728
01:14:29.021 --> 01:14:31.810
<v Speaker 5>represent this very important political </v>
<v Speaker 5>movement,</v>

1729
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:36.930
<v Speaker 5>but here's what you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't disrespect this campaign </v>

1730
01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:39.841
<v Speaker 5>speech because you are literally </v>
<v Speaker 5>stopping people from ever voting for me </v>

1731
01:14:39.841 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 5>if I let you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's the fact.</v>

1732
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.220
<v Speaker 5>What if he watched him do that and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1733
01:14:42.221 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 5>you can't let kids just take over your </v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

1734
01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:50.220
<v Speaker 5>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're the guy who's supposed to be </v>

1735
01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:50.220
<v Speaker 5>running the country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't even run this fucking thing.</v>

1736
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:55.260
<v Speaker 5>You've got this one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're standing on a stage in front of </v>

1737
01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:55.260
<v Speaker 5>300 people.</v>

1738
01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.170
<v Speaker 5>Three of them just took your mic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Congratulations.</v>

1739
01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.890
<v Speaker 5>You don't have leadership ability,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what about other than that?</v>

1740
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.200
<v Speaker 5>That's a big part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's big.</v>

1741
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.420
<v Speaker 5>That's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not good,</v>

1742
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 5>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the moment he made an error.</v>

1743
01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:12.540
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean that's who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's part of the problem is when people </v>

1744
01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:13.900
<v Speaker 5>are judging you by these moments that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>

1745
01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:15.910
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it doesn't define him.</v>

1746
01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.350
<v Speaker 5>He might've done that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1747
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:18.550
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just trying to be nice.</v>

1748
01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:21.070
<v Speaker 5>I didn't expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought security was going to get them</v>

1749
01:15:21.071 --> 01:15:22.620
<v Speaker 5>out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they didn't get.</v>

1750
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't.</v>

1751
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:28.310
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wound up on the stage with them </v>

1752
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.310
<v Speaker 5>screaming.</v>

1753
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.930
<v Speaker 4>I thought maybe he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see him when he did those types</v>

1754
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:29.810
<v Speaker 4>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A few times.</v>

1755
01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:32.020
<v Speaker 4>See the video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to see it is kind of interesting.</v>

1756
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.940
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was his way of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1757
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.670
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it must feel like to not be able to</v>

1758
01:15:36.671 --> 01:15:39.850
<v Speaker 4>be heard and it's not my fault that no </v>
<v Speaker 4>one's ever listened to you so far,</v>

1759
01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:44.970
<v Speaker 4>but what do we have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe he feels they go up and </v>

1760
01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:46.900
<v Speaker 4>they just a sane person would lead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would leave the same person.</v>

1761
01:15:46.901 --> 01:15:49.270
<v Speaker 4>When you ignore that long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just grab a mic and maybe he goes,</v>

1762
01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:52.120
<v Speaker 4>I have to be a part of letting this </v>
<v Speaker 4>person spill out.</v>

1763
01:15:52.121 --> 01:15:52.450
<v Speaker 4>A little</v>

1764
01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:56.380
<v Speaker 5>problem is then who doesn't spill out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody can spill out.</v>

1765
01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.510
<v Speaker 5>Everybody can jump up for their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause,</v>

1766
01:15:58.511 --> 01:16:01.840
<v Speaker 5>whether it's white power or fucking Jews</v>
<v Speaker 5>lives matter,</v>

1767
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:07.080
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could just decide you have a group </v>

1768
01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:07.120
<v Speaker 5>now and your group may very well be </v>
<v Speaker 5>valid,</v>

1769
01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:12.330
<v Speaker 5>but you can just decide now you're just </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to yell out when whenever there's </v>

1770
01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:15.571
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a political speech and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll be your chance to talk and just </v>

1771
01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:15.571
<v Speaker 5>going to take the mic and make it all </v>
<v Speaker 5>about you.</v>

1772
01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's got to be.</v>

1773
01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.940
<v Speaker 5>There are a lot of things we need to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>concerned with.</v>

1774
01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:22.240
<v Speaker 5>We need to be concerned with war we need</v>
<v Speaker 5>do we need to be concerned with poverty,</v>

1775
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:24.250
<v Speaker 5>education,</v>
<v Speaker 5>healthcare,</v>

1776
01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:27.280
<v Speaker 5>all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't just represent each one of</v>

1777
01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:32.281
<v Speaker 5>these very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very important groups and jump on stage </v>

1778
01:16:32.281 --> 01:16:32.281
<v Speaker 5>everywhere and start yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I thought?</v>

1779
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:33.490
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1780
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:39.790
<v Speaker 5>I should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should be just done with you.</v>

1781
01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:40.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1782
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because this subject is.</v>

1783
01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.610
<v Speaker 4>It gets so exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1784
01:16:44.670 --> 01:16:48.100
<v Speaker 4>Let me add one more thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1785
01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.320
<v Speaker 4>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1786
01:16:49.321 --> 01:16:51.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have these theories in your head and</v>

1787
01:16:51.151 --> 01:16:55.170
<v Speaker 4>then sometimes somebody will respond and</v>
<v Speaker 4>and blow it out,</v>

1788
01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just on your omega.</v>

1789
01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.680
<v Speaker 4>I never thought about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I had this theory.</v>

1790
01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:00.450
<v Speaker 4>It was a weird way that I thought about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1791
01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Well two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One kids do.</v>

1792
01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:05.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm stealing from the act that teeny </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

1793
01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:08.580
<v Speaker 4>but just because it's a stat I use in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the kids do.</v>

1794
01:17:08.581 --> 01:17:12.050
<v Speaker 4>If there was yelp review,</v>
<v Speaker 4>young adults have an amazing yelp review</v>

1795
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:13.970
<v Speaker 4>for being on the right side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who they,</v>

1796
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:15.290
<v Speaker 4>who they root for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who they are.</v>

1797
01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:16.220
<v Speaker 4>I think music</v>

1798
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:20.980
<v Speaker 5>dealing with some left wing democratic </v>
<v Speaker 5>out here.</v>

1799
01:17:20.981 --> 01:17:25.981
<v Speaker 5>Kids like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever talked to some kids from </v>

1800
01:17:25.981 --> 01:17:25.981
<v Speaker 5>Alabama,</v>

1801
01:17:25.981 --> 01:17:26.690
<v Speaker 4>but I'm talking about on the masses of </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids that,</v>

1802
01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.040
<v Speaker 4>that March.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1803
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:30.440
<v Speaker 4>the ones that are ones that march the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ones that get involved.</v>

1804
01:17:30.441 --> 01:17:31.840
<v Speaker 4>If you go back and look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1805
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.320
<v Speaker 4>Kent State or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1806
01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure we could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can pull up 50.</v>

1807
01:17:36.561 --> 01:17:41.561
<v Speaker 4>But so with that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'm not saying we shouldn't doubt </v>

1808
01:17:41.561 --> 01:17:44.831
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I had a gun to my head and someone </v>

1809
01:17:44.831 --> 01:17:48.221
<v Speaker 4>said if we had a crystal ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they making the right choice about </v>

1810
01:17:48.221 --> 01:17:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Bernie Sanders?</v>
<v Speaker 4>These kids.</v>

1811
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.850
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1812
01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.520
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to talk about that for five.</v>

1813
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:53.240
<v Speaker 4>I got to watch a campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to watch a debate.</v>

1814
01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:55.520
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How's he going to handle public policy?</v>

1815
01:17:55.521 --> 01:17:57.020
<v Speaker 4>How's he going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't just ask.</v>

1816
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:58.540
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to shoot you in your head.</v>

1817
01:17:58.541 --> 01:18:00.970
<v Speaker 4>I go with kids overwhelmingly kids like </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

1818
01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got to do the right thing and I </v>

1819
01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:06.040
<v Speaker 4>think if there was a crystal ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's my theory,</v>

1820
01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.811
<v Speaker 4>but I've never said this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think out loud that maybe 50 years </v>

1821
01:18:11.241 --> 01:18:12.920
<v Speaker 4>from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like we're learning about history,</v>

1822
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:14.930
<v Speaker 4>they would talk about him in the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1823
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:16.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy came into office,</v>

1824
01:18:16.361 --> 01:18:19.960
<v Speaker 4>picks your kids and they're telling them</v>
<v Speaker 4>why maybe 2000,</v>

1825
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:24.970
<v Speaker 4>22 started to be these good times and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's talking about history and a guy </v>

1826
01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:27.430
<v Speaker 4>came in the office and he really didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know anything about the.</v>

1827
01:18:27.431 --> 01:18:29.930
<v Speaker 4>The he didn't really know about was he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was not.</v>

1828
01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.820
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know about war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know about.</v>

1829
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:33.090
<v Speaker 4>No and no one thought he could really do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1830
01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:38.100
<v Speaker 4>but he was one thing that you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think would answer our economical </v>

1831
01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:38.100
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can be a nice hearted person,</v>

1832
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 4>but that's not going to answer your </v>
<v Speaker 4>economical problems,</v>

1833
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:45.310
<v Speaker 4>but it ended up doing that because he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did truly treat everybody kind and it</v>

1834
01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:49.070
<v Speaker 4>ended up then when people started to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>treated fairly.</v>

1835
01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:52.310
<v Speaker 4>If the world worked better with less </v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed people,</v>

1836
01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:54.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people would torture people.</v>

1837
01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:59.710
<v Speaker 4>We had someone empowered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was overwhelmingly kind and people </v>

1838
01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:03.410
<v Speaker 4>felt the wrath that almost very quickly </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we go and then you know what?</v>

1839
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.680
<v Speaker 4>No one ever thought this than some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the economical problems worked out the </v>

1840
01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.930
<v Speaker 4>work themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that is based on no science.</v>

1841
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:14.330
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1842
01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm acknowledging that,</v>

1843
01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.270
<v Speaker 4>but that was in my head that</v>

1844
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:24.380
<v Speaker 5>the economy is apparently a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>complicated thing that can be </v>

1845
01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:28.750
<v Speaker 5>interpreted many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there are many people right now </v>

1846
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 5>that will tell you the economy has never</v>
<v Speaker 5>been better.</v>

1847
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:31.150
<v Speaker 5>Stock market's booming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1848
01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 5>black people are more employed today </v>
<v Speaker 5>than ever in history,</v>

1849
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.970
<v Speaker 5>and these are like the mega people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1850
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
<v Speaker 5>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll jump on that and other people </v>

1851
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:43.000
<v Speaker 5>will tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1852
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.291
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're sitting on a bunch of huge </v>

1853
01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:46.871
<v Speaker 5>bubbles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a commercial real estate bubble and </v>

1854
01:19:46.871 --> 01:19:47.870
<v Speaker 5>credit bubble and all this different </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit that could go down at any moment.</v>

1855
01:19:47.871 --> 01:19:51.130
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're getting automated cars soon.</v>

1856
01:19:51.131 --> 01:19:54.080
<v Speaker 5>It's going to put thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of jobs if not millions.</v>

1857
01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:59.520
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to figure out who the fuck's </v>

1858
01:19:59.520 --> 01:19:59.520
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>

1859
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:03.100
<v Speaker 5>It's when you talk about like a dummy </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you or myself and trying to </v>

1860
01:20:03.621 --> 01:20:08.621
<v Speaker 5>prognosticate like what would make </v>
<v Speaker 5>people successful and would make people </v>

1861
01:20:08.621 --> 01:20:08.621
<v Speaker 5>not what I.</v>

1862
01:20:08.621 --> 01:20:13.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about the economic part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what I do know is his long as you </v>

1863
01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:18.291
<v Speaker 5>have a person who's kind but also from </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a person who's kind,</v>

1864
01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 5>but you also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not worried about them.</v>

1865
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.120
<v Speaker 5>If something happens with China or </v>
<v Speaker 5>Russia,</v>

1866
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:29.300
<v Speaker 5>like we live in a crazy world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We live in a world where there's really </v>

1867
01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:33.471
<v Speaker 5>basically three superpowers but one </v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker of a superpower and that's </v>

1868
01:20:33.811 --> 01:20:38.811
<v Speaker 5>us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're run by a guy who used to host </v>

1869
01:20:38.811 --> 01:20:39.690
<v Speaker 5>celebrity apprentice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1870
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.960
<v Speaker 5>Like it's gotten super squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's super squirrely and there's all </v>

1871
01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.180
<v Speaker 5>these other people that are other </v>
<v Speaker 5>superpowers that are going,</v>

1872
01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:53.720
<v Speaker 5>what's going on over there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That place don't look so fucking </v>

1873
01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.601
<v Speaker 5>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That place looks a little fucked up </v>

1874
01:20:56.601 --> 01:20:57.480
<v Speaker 5>right now and this is like they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>expelling Russian diplomats and all this</v>

1875
01:20:57.481 --> 01:21:02.481
<v Speaker 5>crazy shit's going down and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and potent just one another election and</v>

1876
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:06.450
<v Speaker 5>we're watching this thing go down </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the top three superpowers in one</v>

1877
01:21:06.451 --> 01:21:09.810
<v Speaker 5>of them is one by a maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe two of them are,</v>

1878
01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:14.900
<v Speaker 5>but one of them is run by a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows a maniac and we put them in there </v>

1879
01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.320
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of people are still going </v>
<v Speaker 5>along with it and they like it.</v>

1880
01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:17.670
<v Speaker 4>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1881
01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.310
<v Speaker 4>I got a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1882
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.100
<v Speaker 4>With no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1883
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:24.220
<v Speaker 4>not like snarky or anything because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was trying to think like,</v>

1884
01:21:24.221 --> 01:21:29.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's more things you said we </v>

1885
01:21:29.221 --> 01:21:31.171
<v Speaker 4>have in common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then there's got to be some </v>

1886
01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:31.171
<v Speaker 4>commonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Freedom.</v>

1887
01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Freedom's number one would be one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could like.</v>

1888
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:34.600
<v Speaker 4>Because I always think like anything I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could get,</v>

1889
01:21:34.601 --> 01:21:36.580
<v Speaker 4>defend trombone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's stupid.</v>

1890
01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:39.040
<v Speaker 4>I go out of my way to defend it one </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1891
01:21:39.041 --> 01:21:40.960
<v Speaker 4>Someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter what it was.</v>

1892
01:21:40.961 --> 01:21:42.460
<v Speaker 4>There were two times and I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>

1893
01:21:42.461 --> 01:21:43.420
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the.</v>

1894
01:21:43.421 --> 01:21:48.421
<v Speaker 4>He didn't do anything or what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something positive about trump that you </v>

1895
01:21:48.490 --> 01:21:50.980
<v Speaker 4>or what they want to build,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to pass or something they want</v>

1896
01:21:50.981 --> 01:21:53.330
<v Speaker 4>to do that you think I'm okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

1897
01:21:53.331 --> 01:21:54.970
<v Speaker 4>What are some of those things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are there any.</v>

1898
01:21:55.570 --> 01:22:00.570
<v Speaker 4>As far as bills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like something you can be </v>

1899
01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:02.980
<v Speaker 4>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even meet in the middle and you said </v>

1900
01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:02.980
<v Speaker 4>that and</v>

1901
01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:02.980
<v Speaker 5>seen anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That made me very excited.</v>

1902
01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.100
<v Speaker 5>I've seen more things that made me very </v>
<v Speaker 5>nervous.</v>

1903
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:08.640
<v Speaker 5>The offshore drilling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes me very nervous.</v>

1904
01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:13.940
<v Speaker 5>Obviously those things break sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've had a few of them in our </v>

1905
01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:14.880
<v Speaker 5>lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Alaska one,</v>

1906
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.460
<v Speaker 5>that was a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember that it happened right when I</v>

1907
01:22:17.461 --> 01:22:22.461
<v Speaker 5>was in high school or no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was right when I was starting to do </v>

1908
01:22:22.461 --> 01:22:25.641
<v Speaker 5>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was like literally right </v>

1909
01:22:25.641 --> 01:22:27.831
<v Speaker 5>around then the valve ds had crashed and</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaked all that oil into and just </v>

1910
01:22:27.831 --> 01:22:32.211
<v Speaker 5>destroyed this delicate ecosystem with </v>
<v Speaker 5>millions of gallons of oil or whatever </v>

1911
01:22:32.431 --> 01:22:37.431
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many thousands gallons or whatever </v>

1912
01:22:37.431 --> 01:22:37.431
<v Speaker 5>the fuck it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that they're gonna,</v>

1913
01:22:37.431 --> 01:22:38.760
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna have more offshore </v>
<v Speaker 5>drilling.</v>

1914
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
<v Speaker 5>That scares the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They they're getting rid of certain </v>

1915
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.950
<v Speaker 5>public parks and shrinking them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>opening up these,</v>

1916
01:22:46.951 --> 01:22:51.951
<v Speaker 5>drilling these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these areas for drilling and natural </v>

1917
01:22:51.951 --> 01:22:55.530
<v Speaker 5>resources that make people very nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In doing this,</v>

1918
01:22:55.531 --> 01:23:00.531
<v Speaker 5>they could be damaging rivers and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>these delicate ecosystems where people </v>

1919
01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:03.240
<v Speaker 5>go and hike and camp through and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to close these down.</v>

1920
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 5>That's the real concern.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real is that gonna</v>

1921
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:11.010
<v Speaker 7>people are gonna somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 7>we're gonna suffer because so that some </v>

1922
01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 7>companies can profit incredibly off of </v>
<v Speaker 7>natural land,</v>

1923
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.530
<v Speaker 7>natural resources that are on public </v>
<v Speaker 7>land.</v>

1924
01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:22.890
<v Speaker 7>That's a big fear because that's some </v>
<v Speaker 7>shit that is really unusual about this </v>

1925
01:23:22.890 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 7>country and some some shit that Teddy </v>
<v Speaker 7>Roosevelt saw way,</v>

1926
01:23:25.091 --> 01:23:27.520
<v Speaker 7>way in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He saw the benefit of doing this,</v>

1927
01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:31.150
<v Speaker 7>of having these massive national parks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1928
01:23:31.151 --> 01:23:33.130
<v Speaker 7>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In in one.</v>

1929
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:38.490
<v Speaker 7>What about positive?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was asking because you're saying that </v>

1930
01:23:38.490 --> 01:23:39.850
<v Speaker 7>that's the number one negative,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all this social stuff.</v>

1931
01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:44.851
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like the most hilarious thing is </v>

1932
01:23:44.851 --> 01:23:47.110
<v Speaker 7>that Kim Jong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Owen actually wants to talk to him.</v>

1933
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.640
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy is so crazy.</v>

1934
01:23:48.641 --> 01:23:53.641
<v Speaker 7>Maybe maybe I'll just talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean like what he wants to tell </v>

1935
01:23:53.641 --> 01:23:54.880
<v Speaker 7>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nobody else wanted to have meetings with</v>

1936
01:23:54.881 --> 01:23:55.380
<v Speaker 7>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1937
01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:00.840
<v Speaker 7>He's wanted to talk to a president for </v>
<v Speaker 7>the longest time and they would talk to </v>

1938
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:00.840
<v Speaker 7>him.</v>

1939
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.020
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because they don't want to give them </v>

1940
01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:05.020
<v Speaker 7>that good photo opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At the very least.</v>

1941
01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:08.760
<v Speaker 7>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're worried about their facebook </v>

1942
01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:08.760
<v Speaker 7>page.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Would we witness that if they talked?</v>

1943
01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:13.770
<v Speaker 7>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We would witness it and trump would </v>

1944
01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:13.770
<v Speaker 7>tower over them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'd be so creepy.</v>

1945
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:18.800
<v Speaker 7>Trump's a big guy and you see what </v>
<v Speaker 7>happens when you ever seen pictures of </v>

1946
01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.381
<v Speaker 7>him with desert robin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you ever see pictures of Kim Johnson?</v>

1947
01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:25.780
<v Speaker 7>I'm good,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>

1948
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.410
<v Speaker 7>Kim Jong swoon is a huge basketball fan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>apparently.</v>

1949
01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:34.440
<v Speaker 7>And loves Dennis Rodman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dennis Rodman goes to North Korea </v>

1950
01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:34.440
<v Speaker 7>parties,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1951
01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dennis Rodman,</v>

1952
01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:37.820
<v Speaker 7>like if trump was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know trump hired Amarosa.</v>

1953
01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.170
<v Speaker 7>Trump's definitely hired Dennis Rodman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fucking 100 percent,</v>

1954
01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:43.210
<v Speaker 7>like 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Say Dennis Rodman.</v>

1955
01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:46.630
<v Speaker 7>Please would you be my emissary?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look at that.</v>

1956
01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:51.800
<v Speaker 7>Without big.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dennis Rodman is as large fellow and </v>

1957
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.230
<v Speaker 7>he's not even big compared to like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>really big guy.</v>

1958
01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:54.700
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like Lebron.</v>

1959
01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 7>What if he had big,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but what's his name?</v>

1960
01:24:56.890 --> 01:25:00.230
<v Speaker 7>King a King Jong what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kim Jong wound.</v>

1961
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.650
<v Speaker 7>They still can't get a picture of Kim </v>
<v Speaker 7>Jong,</v>

1962
01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:04.000
<v Speaker 7>Il.</v>
<v Speaker 7>John with Dennis Rodman.</v>

1963
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.940
<v Speaker 7>What if you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eh,</v>

1964
01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:07.690
<v Speaker 7>you think it'd be bad if you went like </v>
<v Speaker 7>foot high platforms?</v>

1965
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.040
<v Speaker 7>Deadly already.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But he denied it.</v>

1966
01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.180
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he probably would.</v>

1967
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:13.360
<v Speaker 7>And he had long pants trying to cover </v>
<v Speaker 7>them while he's Korean.</v>

1968
01:25:13.361 --> 01:25:14.500
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's North Korean.</v>

1969
01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:19.900
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's some Korean folks that are </v>

1970
01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:19.900
<v Speaker 7>pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1971
01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:20.010
<v Speaker 7>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1972
01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:24.550
<v Speaker 7>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the kid who won the heavyweight national</v>

1973
01:25:24.551 --> 01:25:27.490
<v Speaker 7>title is named Jimmy Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was a big Korean kid,</v>

1974
01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:32.200
<v Speaker 7>big heavyweight kid who was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Six foot five.</v>

1975
01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:37.230
<v Speaker 7>So I don't know how big Kim Jong Luna's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I bet he looks tiny compared to </v>

1976
01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:37.600
<v Speaker 7>Dennis Rodman.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Two foot three.</v>

1977
01:25:37.601 --> 01:25:39.430
<v Speaker 7>I just looked it up on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

1978
01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:41.790
<v Speaker 7>That was quick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

1979
01:25:41.791 --> 01:25:43.960
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it would be a weird meeting,</v>

1980
01:25:43.961 --> 01:25:46.480
<v Speaker 7>but it might actually be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It might be good.</v>

1981
01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:52.500
<v Speaker 7>This people gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 7>something's gotTa break over there like </v>

1982
01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:55.171
<v Speaker 7>what they're doing is just saying the </v>
<v Speaker 7>way they keep those people essentially </v>

1983
01:25:55.171 --> 01:25:55.171
<v Speaker 7>hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no food.</v>

1984
01:25:55.210 --> 01:25:58.840
<v Speaker 7>The people that have escaped had </v>
<v Speaker 7>horrible fucking parasites in their body</v>

1985
01:25:58.841 --> 01:25:59.970
<v Speaker 7>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>see,</v>

1986
01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.650
<v Speaker 7>I feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1987
01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 7>So guys escaped and got shot at</v>

1988
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:05.780
<v Speaker 5>on the border.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fascinating footage.</v>

1989
01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:07.790
<v Speaker 5>You're saying they keep them hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who are you talking about?</v>

1990
01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 5>The people of North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're essentially held hostage.</v>

1991
01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trapped by dear leader.</v>

1992
01:26:13.821 --> 01:26:16.520
<v Speaker 5>You know what they have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if when when the dad died,</v>

1993
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:21.970
<v Speaker 5>these people were all weeping in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>street and they had a weep like </v>

1994
01:26:21.970 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 5>outwardly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>loudly,</v>

1995
01:26:21.981 --> 01:26:25.280
<v Speaker 5>as long as they could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you stop weeping early,</v>

1996
01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 5>you'd be punished.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people who they felt weren't weeping</v>

1997
01:26:28.671 --> 01:26:33.671
<v Speaker 5>enough got six months in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a crazy place and everyone turns on</v>

<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

2100
01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:08.730
<v Speaker 1>You have to go camping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time?</v>

2101
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else to maybe.</v>

2102
01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:11.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2103
01:31:11.491 --> 01:31:11.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2104
01:31:11.751 --> 01:31:12.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2105
01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.680
<v Speaker 1>About a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A year ago.</v>

2106
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you guys go with two?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2107
01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I shot a pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds so cold camping with todd.</v>

2108
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we went,</v>

2109
01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:22.410
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shot it up.</v>

2110
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:25.740
<v Speaker 1>It was me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zach Galifianakis and John Doren.</v>

2111
01:31:25.741 --> 01:31:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Eddie pepitone and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds awesome.</v>

2112
01:31:28.170 --> 01:31:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Close to letting it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened,</v>

2113
01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:30.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

2114
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.690
<v Speaker 1>We didn't end up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shot the pilot even a bad pilot,</v>

2115
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.550
<v Speaker 1>but that's the premise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really did think,</v>

2116
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:39.000
<v Speaker 1>and I don't ever think this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once in awhile I do have it,</v>

2117
01:31:39.001 --> 01:31:40.440
<v Speaker 1>just be honest with my thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like,</v>

2118
01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I think this is going to sell because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just camping with todd.</v>

2119
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:45.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are comfortable.</v>

2120
01:31:45.211 --> 01:31:47.310
<v Speaker 1>They talked to you have a musical </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

2121
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Who was playing the guitar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

2122
01:31:49.741 --> 01:31:52.890
<v Speaker 1>that was John Door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was just being silly and um,</v>

2123
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:57.950
<v Speaker 1>as long as he's only being safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not tolerate some real live </v>

2124
01:31:57.950 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 1>singing by a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end we did.</v>

2125
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:03.070
<v Speaker 7>We had someone come out with like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>trumpet and guitar and they did a real.</v>

2126
01:32:03.071 --> 01:32:05.810
<v Speaker 7>So Kuumba,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yasser public domain and um,</v>

2127
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:11.430
<v Speaker 7>and then we.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then we tried to sell it and no one </v>

2128
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.430
<v Speaker 7>was really interested.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's okay,</v>

2129
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:15.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is that thing that people do where </v>

<v Speaker 7>even have this happen here.</v>

<v Speaker 7>It would interrupt conversation.</v>

2142
01:32:42.881 --> 01:32:44.170
<v Speaker 7>You'd be in the middle of a </v>

01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:46.330
<v Speaker 7>It's not even his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is this the job?</v>

2166
01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.250
<v Speaker 7>That's his job.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is he going to do?</v>

2167
01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:50.200
<v Speaker 7>Like that's what they hired him for.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

2168
01:33:50.201 --> 01:33:51.810
<v Speaker 7>you want to work for us?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sure,</v>

2169
01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:52.960
<v Speaker 7>I need a job.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

2170
01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:57.961
<v Speaker 7>you're going to be a magician.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're going to walk around the tables </v>

2171
01:33:57.961 --> 01:33:57.961
<v Speaker 7>and do magic in front of people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2172
01:33:57.961 --> 01:33:58.490
<v Speaker 7>It's not his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2173
01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:02.650
<v Speaker 7>That's why restaurants fault.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why I always err on,</v>

2174
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:05.100
<v Speaker 7>even though I was interrupting the </v>
<v Speaker 7>conversation,</v>

2175
01:34:05.150 --> 01:34:05.980
<v Speaker 7>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get it,</v>

2176
01:34:05.981 --> 01:34:10.981
<v Speaker 7>so I'm pretty polite and I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and try to enjoy it and it's usually </v>

2177
01:34:10.981 --> 01:34:10.990
<v Speaker 7>pretty short.</v>

2178
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:12.070
<v Speaker 7>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm always wishing,</v>

2179
01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:17.100
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're just into this intense </v>

2180
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:17.100
<v Speaker 7>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It depends on how high you are,</v>

2181
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:17.100
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're high,</v>

2182
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.380
<v Speaker 7>you let the guy talk,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if you had a cup of coffee,</v>

2183
01:34:19.381 --> 01:34:20.230
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey dude,</v>

2184
01:34:20.231 --> 01:34:23.560
<v Speaker 7>I can't live.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you give them $500 you need.</v>

2185
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:26.970
<v Speaker 7>If you own or manage a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you need a closeup magician.</v>

2186
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.720
<v Speaker 7>It's all capitals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Listen to this.</v>

2187
01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:36.740
<v Speaker 7>Only happened to me twice ever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it wasn't the worst thing in the </v>

2188
01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:36.740
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2189
01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:40.510
<v Speaker 7>I just feel like unless it's in the name</v>
<v Speaker 7>of your restaurant,</v>

2190
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:45.870
<v Speaker 7>you probably shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not like something that happens a </v>

2191
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:45.870
<v Speaker 7>lot.</v>

2192
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:50.680
<v Speaker 7>I like magicians.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love working with the comedy Magic </v>

2193
01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.370
<v Speaker 7>Club.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I used to back in the day before I used </v>

2194
01:34:53.370 --> 01:34:53.370
<v Speaker 7>to book my own show there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I would do a show,</v>

2195
01:34:53.530 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 7>I would work with a magician always.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's always like one comic,</v>

2196
01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.680
<v Speaker 7>a magician,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then maybe one other comic.</v>

2197
01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.960
<v Speaker 7>I think that's how they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They do it a bunch of different.</v>

2198
01:35:02.961 --> 01:35:04.550
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In the most of each.</v>

2199
01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:05.300
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That place.</v>

2200
01:35:05.301 --> 01:35:08.300
<v Speaker 7>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That place is amazing that that place is</v>

2201
01:35:08.301 --> 01:35:10.950
<v Speaker 7>also like a museum comedy inside.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well the,</v>

2202
01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 7>they have like Popeye's outfit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but Robin Williams more.</v>

2203
01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:16.700
<v Speaker 7>It's framed on the wall and those </v>
<v Speaker 7>signatures in that long.</v>

2204
01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 7>In the green room.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a breezy.</v>

2205
01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:24.420
<v Speaker 7>It is array of signatures on a wall from</v>
<v Speaker 7>the last 35 years or 40 minutes.</v>

2206
01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:25.870
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's crazy.</v>

2207
01:35:26.370 --> 01:35:29.930
<v Speaker 7>It's a long term to be similar and he's </v>
<v Speaker 7>such a nice guy too.</v>

2208
01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:35.740
<v Speaker 7>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's the second oldest comedy </v>

2209
01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:36.860
<v Speaker 7>club in the world right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think the ice house was number one and</v>

2210
01:35:36.861 --> 01:35:41.510
<v Speaker 7>comedy and magic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just slightly younger in terms of club.</v>

2211
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.950
<v Speaker 7>And then where'd you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where'd you go after that?</v>

2212
01:35:42.951 --> 01:35:45.950
<v Speaker 7>The comedy works in Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Pretty close for olders.</v>

2213
01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:50.970
<v Speaker 7>The how old is economy works in Denver </v>
<v Speaker 7>can only be like 23 years old or </v>

2214
01:35:50.970 --> 01:35:51.020
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well I thought it was a 30.</v>

2215
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.310
<v Speaker 7>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You might be right.</v>

2216
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:53.570
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you didn't.</v>

2217
01:35:53.571 --> 01:35:57.830
<v Speaker 7>Roseanne start there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe Roseanne started there in Detroit.</v>

2218
01:35:58.010 --> 01:35:58.720
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2219
01:35:58.730 --> 01:36:00.670
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the,</v>

2220
01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.290
<v Speaker 7>his name is in the title,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but still we're in the eighties,</v>

2221
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:05.480
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean they used to be some places.</v>

2222
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:09.090
<v Speaker 7>The ice houses from the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The icehouse started.</v>

2223
01:36:09.091 --> 01:36:09.350
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2224
01:36:09.351 --> 01:36:09.830
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry.</v>

2225
01:36:09.831 --> 01:36:12.200
<v Speaker 7>I didn't mean older.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just met with next on the list.</v>

2226
01:36:12.201 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 7>Where do you go to these places or not?</v>

2227
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:15.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I mean there's like a,</v>

2228
01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.630
<v Speaker 7>there's a few of the old,</v>
<v Speaker 7>old,</v>

2229
01:36:17.631 --> 01:36:21.500
<v Speaker 7>old places that are still around those,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like historical places,</v>

2230
01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:25.610
<v Speaker 7>like the comedy store is the most </v>
<v Speaker 7>historical,</v>

2231
01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:31.040
<v Speaker 7>but there's a lot of historical places </v>
<v Speaker 7>helium's historical now because how long</v>

2232
01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:33.590
<v Speaker 7>has helion been around for 13 years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2233
01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:38.240
<v Speaker 7>that's a spot where universally people </v>
<v Speaker 7>talk about that place.</v>

2234
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:43.720
<v Speaker 7>I feel like Acme Acme in Minneapolis,</v>
<v Speaker 7>laughing skull in Atlanta.</v>

2235
01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.240
<v Speaker 7>That place is off the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Intimate.</v>

2236
01:36:50.241 --> 01:36:52.220
<v Speaker 7>90 people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe if you've done it.</v>

2237
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.970
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2238
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.280
<v Speaker 7>Fuck a curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That goes amazing.</v>

2239
01:36:55.540 --> 01:37:00.540
<v Speaker 7>That's a good example of a room.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're going down a hallway to a </v>

2240
01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 7>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Picture everybody.</v>

2241
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 7>Everyone has to go to a club for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>first time you go.</v>

2242
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 7>It's in the back of a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You go down a hallway,</v>

2243
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:08.240
<v Speaker 7>then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even though it's a simple room,</v>

2244
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:10.430
<v Speaker 7>is there's a sound booth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's lights,</v>

2245
01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:12.830
<v Speaker 7>the curtain shuts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the lights go down,</v>

2246
01:37:13.190 --> 01:37:18.190
<v Speaker 7>and when I think every second year in a </v>
<v Speaker 7>club like that where they have </v>

2247
01:37:18.190 --> 01:37:18.190
<v Speaker 7>production,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

2248
01:37:18.190 --> 01:37:19.580
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is something you know,</v>

2249
01:37:19.581 --> 01:37:21.440
<v Speaker 7>like the audience that might not know </v>
<v Speaker 7>what to expect.</v>

2250
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.290
<v Speaker 7>Now they know it's going to be good </v>
<v Speaker 7>sometimes even before the show starts,</v>

2251
01:37:24.291 --> 01:37:27.380
<v Speaker 7>just the way the police conducted itself</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then the house lights go out.</v>

2252
01:37:27.650 --> 01:37:29.810
<v Speaker 7>It's like a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I love that.</v>

2253
01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:31.610
<v Speaker 7>That room is great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Spot.</v>

2254
01:37:31.611 --> 01:37:36.611
<v Speaker 7>A lot of fun in that room.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's another one of those really </v>

2255
01:37:36.611 --> 01:37:36.611
<v Speaker 7>intimate places.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even think that's 100 people.</v>

2256
01:37:36.611 --> 01:37:37.670
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>80 five 80 people.</v>

2257
01:37:37.730 --> 01:37:39.200
<v Speaker 7>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Amazing.</v>

2258
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:41.030
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those spots,</v>

2259
01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.840
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I counted.</v>

2260
01:37:41.841 --> 01:37:44.050
<v Speaker 7>I have a clicker because I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh No,</v>

2261
01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:45.370
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't know.</v>

2262
01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:47.480
<v Speaker 7>That happened.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When someone did that,</v>

2263
01:37:47.481 --> 01:37:51.200
<v Speaker 7>like onstage made everybody call out a </v>
<v Speaker 7>number at a club somewhere.</v>

2264
01:37:52.710 --> 01:37:57.710
<v Speaker 7>Hope because probably to see like if </v>
<v Speaker 7>there was more than they said </v>

2265
01:37:57.710 --> 01:38:00.621
<v Speaker 7>Jacqueline,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was working on some sort of a door </v>

2266
01:38:00.621 --> 01:38:00.621
<v Speaker 7>deal and he thought there was more </v>
<v Speaker 7>people in the room.</v>

2267
01:38:00.621 --> 01:38:05.570
<v Speaker 7>Then the club owner told him so he had </v>
<v Speaker 7>the audience individually count out a </v>

2268
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.790
<v Speaker 7>number.</v>

2269
01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like we're gonna start from this table </v>

2270
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 7>over here and when I moved to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your number one.</v>

2271
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:13.050
<v Speaker 7>Ready Sarah go number one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>two,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

2273

<v Speaker 7>three more number sitting there.</v>

2274
01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:22.860

<v Speaker 7>Some people want to yell out.</v>

2275
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:24.200
<v Speaker 7>That was fun for them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No one.</v>

2276

<v Speaker 7>How many people were going,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh right,</v>

2277
01:38:25.831 --> 01:38:30.240

<v Speaker 7>but I think it was like a 350 seat room.</v>

2278
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:32.220
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2279
01:38:32.250 --> 01:38:36.040
<v Speaker 7>so you didn't have the material.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it's totally,</v>

2280
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:38.310
<v Speaker 7>totally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>totally possible,</v>

2281
01:38:38.311 --> 01:38:41.070
<v Speaker 7>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's how we found out.</v>

2282
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:46.800
<v Speaker 7>Went through the whole room and he got </v>
<v Speaker 7>past the number that this guy said there</v>

2283
01:38:46.801 --> 01:38:49.860
<v Speaker 7>were and then there was still more </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking people.</v>

2284
01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:52.350
<v Speaker 7>I wonder if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>

2285
01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:54.360
<v Speaker 7>I think it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that it's the wait staff is what</v>

2286
01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:59.361
<v Speaker 7>told me about it and I think they were </v>
<v Speaker 7>very enthusiastic with their </v>

2287
01:38:59.361 --> 01:38:59.361
<v Speaker 7>descriptions.</v>

2288
01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:04.680
<v Speaker 7>So you think he caught them like a club </v>
<v Speaker 7>owner trying to hide how many could be </v>

2289
01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:05.460
<v Speaker 7>the good clubs that have been around </v>
<v Speaker 7>forever.</v>

2290
01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:09.350
<v Speaker 7>Overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've had almost perfect experiences like</v>

2291
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:14.390
<v Speaker 7>the clubs that they're all pretty decent</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I forget sometimes what some of the </v>

2292
01:39:14.491 --> 01:39:19.491
<v Speaker 7>sheisty are ones because you hear </v>
<v Speaker 7>stories about people in the road like </v>

2293
01:39:19.491 --> 01:39:23.210
<v Speaker 7>manipulating the money and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you do hear that that that can </v>

2294
01:39:23.210 --> 01:39:26.661
<v Speaker 7>happen with some clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think some club owners develop a very </v>

2295
01:39:26.661 --> 01:39:28.540
<v Speaker 7>animalistic animosity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

2296
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:30.120
<v Speaker 7>What is that word?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Animosity.</v>

2297
01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.280
<v Speaker 7>That's not even a word.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It isn't.</v>

2298
01:39:32.610 --> 01:39:34.130
<v Speaker 7>I know what you're going to say though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm writing.</v>

2299
01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:36.390
<v Speaker 7>When it came out of my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right as it was going out,</v>

2300
01:39:36.391 --> 01:39:37.530
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that a real word?</v>

2301
01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:42.300
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't exactly towards comedy,</v>

2302
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:45.060
<v Speaker 7>but they developed this animosity </v>
<v Speaker 7>between each other.</v>

2303
01:39:45.061 --> 01:39:46.770
<v Speaker 7>The club owners don't want to book you.</v>

2304
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:48.690
<v Speaker 7>You get mad at the club owners.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then when you make it like,</v>

2305
01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:50.160
<v Speaker 7>fuck that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want more money.</v>

2306
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.120
<v Speaker 7>Tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck him,</v>

2307
01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:52.030
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you,</v>

2308
01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:57.110
<v Speaker 7>there's this weird thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like they knew you when you sucked and </v>

2309
01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:57.900
<v Speaker 7>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like as you're coming up,</v>

2310
01:39:58.510 --> 01:39:59.390
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2311
01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:01.050
<v Speaker 7>they don't want to pay him more and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

2312
01:40:01.051 --> 01:40:06.051
<v Speaker 7>but I make more now my headliner and you</v>
<v Speaker 7>get into this weird sort of thing with </v>

2313
01:40:06.051 --> 01:40:06.930
<v Speaker 7>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2314
01:40:06.931 --> 01:40:07.670
<v Speaker 7>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

2315
01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:12.700
<v Speaker 7>that poisons the well for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>comedian club owner relationships,</v>

2316
01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:19.040
<v Speaker 7>but we need them so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you and I are not opening up a </v>

2317
01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:20.280
<v Speaker 7>comedy club is not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2318
01:40:20.281 --> 01:40:23.880
<v Speaker 7>We need the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We need these clubs.</v>

2319
01:40:23.881 --> 01:40:26.190
<v Speaker 7>You need the ha ha in north Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We need them.</v>

2320
01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:31.400
<v Speaker 7>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like we all have to work together like </v>

2321
01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.440
<v Speaker 7>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We all figure out a way to be nice to </v>

2322
01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:34.440
<v Speaker 7>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like we need each other.</v>

2323
01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.160
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're not going to do that.</v>

2324
01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:36.930
<v Speaker 7>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I try and I,</v>

2325
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:38.530
<v Speaker 7>I not only did I try,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do it too.</v>

2326
01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:40.740
<v Speaker 7>As much as I complain about when they do</v>
<v Speaker 7>it wrong.</v>

2327
01:40:40.741 --> 01:40:44.280
<v Speaker 7>I always spend twice as much time giving</v>
<v Speaker 7>clubs,</v>

2328
01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.040
<v Speaker 7>do it greatest shout outs and throw in </v>
<v Speaker 7>love their way.</v>

2329
01:40:47.130 --> 01:40:48.180
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot doall,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2330
01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:51.030
<v Speaker 7>So important that you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I go to him,</v>

2331
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 7>when I money was coming at</v>

2332
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.090
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go to a brace,</v>

2333
01:40:56.350 --> 01:41:01.350
<v Speaker 1>like spring starting to hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you when I go to a place like </v>

2334
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2335
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.580

<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia,</v>

2336
01:41:06.581 --> 01:41:09.940

<v Speaker 1>the place.</v>

2337
01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're stressed out,</v>

2338
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:12.380
<v Speaker 1>but they're good at hiding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2339
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2340
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:15.460
<v Speaker 1>They're professional always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I couldn't do that.</v>

2341
01:41:15.461 --> 01:41:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I'd be frantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're always like,</v>

2342
01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:19.150
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you [inaudible]?</v>

2343
01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so good.</v>

2349
01:41:28.571 --> 01:41:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy's like,</v>

2350
01:41:31.031 --> 01:41:33.050
<v Speaker 1>do you remember Tom Sawyer from San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco?</v>

2351
01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:34.300
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know of him yet.</v>

2352
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.010
<v Speaker 1>He never worked for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2353
01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never worked at the old cops know,</v>

2354
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:42.520
<v Speaker 1>a little comms I once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you work at big cobs?</v>

2355
01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had opened up for.</v>

2356
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I did some shows there like through a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2357
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:49.390
<v Speaker 1>like a festival but never through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

2358
01:41:49.690 --> 01:41:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I just want to beat on it too much.</v>

2359
01:41:52.451 --> 01:41:55.390
<v Speaker 1>We're just so fucking lucky that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>places to do it.</v>

2360
01:41:55.740 --> 01:42:00.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a weird relationship that </v>

2361
01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:01.990
<v Speaker 1>comics and when it gets wet it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>followed up just because both parties,</v>

2362
01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:04.720
<v Speaker 1>both parties have some work to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>

2363
01:42:04.721 --> 01:42:08.380
<v Speaker 1>If they were in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you both got some things you can fix and</v>

2364
01:42:08.650 --> 01:42:10.270
<v Speaker 1>as long as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it is true,</v>

2365
01:42:10.271 --> 01:42:15.271
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm not unaware of what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying because it's just comedians for </v>

2366
01:42:15.271 --> 01:42:17.200
<v Speaker 1>every club owner that may be ripped </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody off,</v>

2367
01:42:17.201 --> 01:42:22.201
<v Speaker 1>which of course they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also a comedian that thinks </v>

2368
01:42:22.201 --> 01:42:22.670
<v Speaker 1>everybody's ripping them off and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so,</v>

2369
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's just that when you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting booked,</v>

2370
01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it's real easy to develop that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animosity between you and a club.</v>

2371
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:32.200
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>

2372
01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:37.380
<v Speaker 1>you can't work and you think that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who are not as good as you and </v>

2373
01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:40.381
<v Speaker 1>they're getting work and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated and you're young and dumb </v>

2374
01:42:40.381 --> 01:42:41.350
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you can have that sort of weird</v>

2375
01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:45.070
<v Speaker 1>complicated relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those weird things.</v>

2376
01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Club owners and artists have always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always been disputes right?</v>

2377
01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Way Back into the day where they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped off the fucking roof of the hotel</v>

2378
01:42:52.931 --> 01:42:57.931
<v Speaker 1>next to the comedy store and that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was at a protest between the </v>

2379
01:42:57.931 --> 01:43:01.420
<v Speaker 1>comedians protesting at the club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walked out,</v>

2380
01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.120
<v Speaker 1>there was a strike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an la comedy strike because no</v>

2381
01:43:05.121 --> 01:43:10.121
<v Speaker 1>one was getting any money and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>clubs were smashing it and we weren't </v>

2382
01:43:10.121 --> 01:43:11.580
<v Speaker 1>getting any of the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's always been that.</v>

2383
01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And that still goes on today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the UCB.</v>

2384
01:43:14.291 --> 01:43:16.660
<v Speaker 1>UCB doesn't pay people who don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2385
01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:18.660
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just.</v>

2386
01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Some forces them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could keep doing whatever the fuck </v>

2387
01:43:23.670 --> 01:43:26.221
<v Speaker 1>they want to do through there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also the of good blood out there</v>

2388
01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:27.640
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2389
01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:31.900
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of good little communities</v>

2390
01:43:31.901 --> 01:43:34.360
<v Speaker 1>to or guys put together a comedy night </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

2391
01:43:34.610 --> 01:43:37.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some do a great job at that.</v>

2392
01:43:37.061 --> 01:43:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm always in always in all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When.</v>

2393
01:43:38.951 --> 01:43:41.080
<v Speaker 1>So when you go to a comedy night and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone did it,</v>

2394
01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:42.150
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2395
01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:44.530
<v Speaker 1>they took a one bar and made it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2396
01:43:44.710 --> 01:43:46.420
<v Speaker 1>every little thing is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2397
01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:49.150
<v Speaker 1>People get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people really know how to produce a</v>

2398
01:43:49.151 --> 01:43:50.070
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2399
01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.890
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always fun to walk into that</v>

2400
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:57.130
<v Speaker 7>and they just found a good spot to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was a good spot that I've worked </v>

2401
01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:58.630
<v Speaker 7>at only once and it was in it and see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2402
01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.340
<v Speaker 7>it was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was.</v>

2403
01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:04.880
<v Speaker 7>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it was a five minute walk from my</v>

2404
01:44:04.881 --> 01:44:06.460
<v Speaker 7>house.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's when I lived in.</v>

2405
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:11.710
<v Speaker 7>I lived off of white oak and I could </v>
<v Speaker 7>just walk down there and go to this </v>

2406
01:44:11.710 --> 01:44:15.251
<v Speaker 7>weird comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never worked there the entire time I </v>

2407
01:44:15.251 --> 01:44:15.410
<v Speaker 7>lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never worked there.</v>

2408
01:44:15.411 --> 01:44:19.010
<v Speaker 7>When I did one set there and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is this place?</v>

2409
01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 7>This place is what club?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember the name of it,</v>

2410
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:25.260
<v Speaker 7>but it was a bar in the front and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 7>go past the bar,</v>

2411
01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:30.320
<v Speaker 7>this back room,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it was like all people that I'd </v>

2412
01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.850
<v Speaker 7>never seen do standup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never seen him at the store and there </v>

2413
01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:33.860
<v Speaker 7>were some of the laugh factory knew of </v>
<v Speaker 7>some of the Improv.</v>

2414
01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:38.210
<v Speaker 7>It seemed like they had either just </v>
<v Speaker 7>started or they were crazy.</v>

2415
01:44:38.211 --> 01:44:40.220
<v Speaker 7>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it was the night that I was there,</v>

2416
01:44:40.221 --> 01:44:41.810
<v Speaker 7>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this place is nuts.</v>

2417
01:44:41.811 --> 01:44:45.800
<v Speaker 7>And how long ago was this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>More than 20 years.</v>

2418
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:49.880
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this was like 95 I think.</v>

2419
01:44:50.770 --> 01:44:53.060
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was weird.</v>

2420
01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:58.250
<v Speaker 7>So weird little comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like there's this whole another world </v>

2421
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:58.250
<v Speaker 7>worlds out there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2422
01:44:58.710 --> 01:45:01.910
<v Speaker 7>And if you go like into Orange County </v>
<v Speaker 7>and in San Diego,</v>

2423
01:45:01.911 --> 01:45:04.000
<v Speaker 7>San Diego's got its own fucking scene.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

2424
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:06.230
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know Santa Barbara,</v>

2425
01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:10.760
<v Speaker 7>a Santa Barbara?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

2426
01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:15.820
<v Speaker 7>All these different plates.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Santa Barbara I don't think has that </v>

2427
01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:15.920
<v Speaker 7>comedy club anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I heard that comment.</v>

2428
01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:18.650
<v Speaker 7>See if Santa Barbara as a common thing </v>
<v Speaker 7>once a month.</v>

2429
01:45:18.651 --> 01:45:22.190
<v Speaker 7>They do about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It might've been like six months ago.</v>

2430
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:27.430
<v Speaker 7>San Francisco has a scene.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They got to see in Seattle's got a </v>

2431
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.430
<v Speaker 7>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2432
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:28.580
<v Speaker 7>there are some scenes out there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's some comedy scenes.</v>

2433
01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:31.190
<v Speaker 7>It's just like how many of them are </v>
<v Speaker 7>really thriving.</v>

2434
01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:32.990
<v Speaker 7>It takes a lot of club owners,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2435
01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.320
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing is what I'm saying to </v>
<v Speaker 7>these people that don't get along so </v>

2436
01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.470
<v Speaker 7>good with club owners if they're not </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing it.</v>

2437
01:45:39.471 --> 01:45:44.471
<v Speaker 7>We're not gonna comedy hideaway in Santa</v>
<v Speaker 7>Barbara says closed right now.</v>

2438
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:49.670
<v Speaker 7>Ours is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It does it mean closed forever.</v>

2439
01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:55.280
<v Speaker 7>He'll do random shows like 1:00</v>
<v Speaker 7>PM in different.</v>

2440
01:45:55.281 --> 01:45:57.380
<v Speaker 7>He still does.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He still has shows.</v>

2441
01:45:57.381 --> 01:45:59.740
<v Speaker 7>It's just always under comedy hideaway </v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's where we found it.</v>

2442
01:45:59.741 --> 01:46:00.380
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's doing it.</v>

2443
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:01.490
<v Speaker 7>They're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're.</v>

2444
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:02.120
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

2445
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:02.990
<v Speaker 7>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2446
01:46:02.991 --> 01:46:04.580
<v Speaker 7>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's a hideaway.</v>

2447
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:06.800
<v Speaker 7>So it's like a Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like oh,</v>

2448
01:46:06.801 --> 01:46:08.330
<v Speaker 7>he goes to different spots.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2449
01:46:08.331 --> 01:46:13.331
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So sometimes you'll be in the same spot </v>

2450
01:46:13.331 --> 01:46:13.331
<v Speaker 7>for the weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes it bounces around.</v>

2451
01:46:13.331 --> 01:46:13.331
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

2452
01:46:13.331 --> 01:46:18.100
<v Speaker 7>I know I'm his manager that I'm telling </v>
<v Speaker 7>the kid he's got to be more specific </v>

2453
01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:20.480
<v Speaker 7>with the social media marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know man.</v>

2454
01:46:20.481 --> 01:46:25.481
<v Speaker 7>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what makes a scene is a club owner </v>

2455
01:46:25.481 --> 01:46:25.670
<v Speaker 7>like Wendy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wendy from the comedy works in Denver.</v>

2456
01:46:25.671 --> 01:46:27.860
<v Speaker 7>She makes the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the club owner.</v>

2457
01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:30.410
<v Speaker 7>She's the one who puts her finances at </v>
<v Speaker 7>risk.</v>

2458
01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:35.560
<v Speaker 7>She's the one who manages it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She runs two clubs and in those two </v>

2459
01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:36.470
<v Speaker 7>clubs she ran.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She runs currently.</v>

2460
01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:41.450
<v Speaker 7>She created the Denver scene.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mitzi created the La scene at the store,</v>

2461
01:46:41.730 --> 01:46:46.160
<v Speaker 7>mean Mitsis guidance her like her,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what she tolerated,</v>

2462
01:46:46.161 --> 01:46:50.960
<v Speaker 7>what she enforced and what she preferred</v>
<v Speaker 7>and who she gave enthusiasm too.</v>

2463
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:52.740
<v Speaker 7>She,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she like shaped,</v>

2464
01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:54.840
<v Speaker 7>shaped so many comics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Man.</v>

2465
01:46:55.590 --> 01:47:00.590
<v Speaker 7>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's a few of those club owners </v>

2466
01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:00.590
<v Speaker 7>that are like super,</v>
<v Speaker 7>super special,</v>

2467
01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:00.990
<v Speaker 7>like really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really important people.</v>

2468
01:47:01.010 --> 01:47:01.750
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just,</v>

2469
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:05.070
<v Speaker 7>they create an environment where shit </v>
<v Speaker 7>pops out of.</v>

2470
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:07.500
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say it's the closest thing,</v>

2471
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:10.230
<v Speaker 4>like presenting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing how to present something,</v>

2472
01:47:10.231 --> 01:47:13.260
<v Speaker 4>especially when it's comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm an off whenever somebody,</v>

2473
01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:15.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you think you would do that.</v>

2474
01:47:15.481 --> 01:47:20.481
<v Speaker 4>I mean you've designed them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever think that you would think </v>

2475
01:47:20.481 --> 01:47:21.570
<v Speaker 4>I'd want to own a club because I get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedian's can be</v>

2476
01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:24.340
<v Speaker 7>hard to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some of them are just crazy,</v>

2477
01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:26.170
<v Speaker 7>some of them you just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you just can't,</v>

2478
01:47:26.530 --> 01:47:28.030
<v Speaker 7>you just can't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can't do it.</v>

2479
01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:30.090
<v Speaker 4>I get it or I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2480
01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:33.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other reason I was close once maybe,</v>

2481
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:36.710
<v Speaker 4>but because let's say there's somebody I</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as a comedian,</v>

2482
01:47:36.711 --> 01:47:41.711
<v Speaker 4>but maybe the tragic hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to know that and then be </v>

2483
01:47:41.711 --> 01:47:41.711
<v Speaker 4>mad at them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2484
01:47:41.711 --> 01:47:42.350
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come you don't talk to blah,</v>

2485
01:47:42.351 --> 01:47:43.160
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah anymore?</v>

2486
01:47:43.610 --> 01:47:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Because I make my club in Philadelphia </v>
<v Speaker 4>Real Nice.</v>

2487
01:47:46.161 --> 01:47:49.330
<v Speaker 4>And then he went in and he know they </v>
<v Speaker 4>toured the curtain down in the.</v>

2488
01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:52.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to not like him for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let me not go to a club and deal with</v>

2489
01:47:52.461 --> 01:47:55.370
<v Speaker 4>anybody I know on a business level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point.</v>

2490
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:57.380
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People do it and it's hard,</v>

2491
01:47:57.381 --> 01:47:59.900
<v Speaker 4>but they'd empathize with what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying more than anything.</v>

2492
01:48:00.110 --> 01:48:05.110
<v Speaker 4>So it also says we're not delusional </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we complain about clubs because it </v>

2493
01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:05.110
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2494
01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:05.110
<v Speaker 4>we get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some,</v>

2495
01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:07.520
<v Speaker 4>there's some when they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they do it right,</v>

2496
01:48:07.521 --> 01:48:10.760
<v Speaker 4>there's some comedians that shit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ruin a condo that they're trying to</v>

2497
01:48:10.761 --> 01:48:13.010
<v Speaker 4>make sure I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but overwhelmingly</v>

2498
01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:17.950
<v Speaker 7>it's probably no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's trying to be fair.</v>

2499
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:18.670
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're.</v>

2500
01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:23.680
<v Speaker 7>You are trying to be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's just certain amount of people </v>

2501
01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:23.830
<v Speaker 7>that are nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're going to fuck places up.</v>

2502
01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:28.860
<v Speaker 7>You're gonna ruin things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't give a shit club or whatever </v>

2503
01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:29.590
<v Speaker 7>they do in the relationship that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>club has with some other business,</v>

2504

2514
01:48:59.411 --> 01:49:00.940
<v Speaker 7>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because that to me,</v>

2515
01:49:00.941 --> 01:49:03.920
<v Speaker 7>if you're saying the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it sounds like just,</v>

2516
01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:06.760
<v Speaker 7>just shitting diarrhea all over,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just the,</v>

2517
01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:09.970
<v Speaker 7>but any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not even your fault with a lot of</v>

2518
01:49:09.971 --> 01:49:10.240
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

2519
01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:15.040
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people it's like they don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>probably realize what they're doing.</v>

2520
01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:17.380
<v Speaker 7>They're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they think they're right,</v>

2521
01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:22.590
<v Speaker 7>but they're just looking at it from </v>
<v Speaker 7>their own personal selfish perspective </v>

2522
01:49:22.590 --> 01:49:26.371
<v Speaker 7>because they're excited about what </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're saying and because they're </v>

2523
01:49:26.371 --> 01:49:27.580
<v Speaker 7>engaged in a contest,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not just that they're talking about</v>

2524
01:49:27.581 --> 01:49:32.581
<v Speaker 7>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're engaged in a contest they're </v>

2525
01:49:32.581 --> 01:49:32.740
<v Speaker 7>trying to win and that's where the </v>
<v Speaker 7>diarrhea comes out there.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Just throwing it at you and get in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>face.</v>

2527
01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:36.660

<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2528
01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:40.840
<v Speaker 7>this is this a contest and they'll suck </v>
<v Speaker 7>you in.</v>

<v Speaker 7>things is wrong with people today and </v>

<v Speaker 7>It's stupid.</v>

2534
01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:59.050
<v Speaker 7>If you want to get in conflicts should </v>
<v Speaker 7>be doing difficult shit with your life.</v>

2535
01:49:59.050 --> 01:50:00.700
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of different difficult </v>
<v Speaker 7>things to do.</v>

2536
01:50:00.701 --> 01:50:02.590
<v Speaker 7>Don't like getting in arguments with </v>
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:05.020
<v Speaker 7>Have you done it in the past ever for </v>
<v Speaker 7>arguments?</v>

<v Speaker 7>Most of the time I'm pretty cool.</v>

2551
01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.520
<v Speaker 7>I just put,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a matter of always thinking about </v>

2552
01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:35.520
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a matter of always recognizing like</v>

2553
01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:40.050
<v Speaker 7>these are just stupid impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't just follow any childish impulse </v>

2554
01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:42.040
<v Speaker 7>like some 13 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's good as first boner.</v>

2555
01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:44.230
<v Speaker 7>Like use your fucking brain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't yell,</v>

2556
01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.400
<v Speaker 7>just use your brain.</v>

2557
01:50:46.610 --> 01:50:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I always thought I just more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything because it's usually not even </v>

2558
01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:51.950
<v Speaker 4>involving me when I still witnessed </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

2559
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:54.920
<v Speaker 4>The finger out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

2560
01:50:56.230 --> 01:50:59.930
<v Speaker 4>Who from a calm place?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who are you and you know what?</v>

2561
01:51:00.170 --> 01:51:05.170
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it a civil person that </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably is about to sit down at a </v>

2562
01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:05.750
<v Speaker 4>restaurant and then probably a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relatively nice guy,</v>

2563
01:51:05.751 --> 01:51:09.770
<v Speaker 4>but that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're 40 years old or 20 or whatever</v>

2564
01:51:09.771 --> 01:51:10.550
<v Speaker 4>age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The younger,</v>

2565
01:51:10.551 --> 01:51:12.860
<v Speaker 4>the more understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you see,</v>

2566
01:51:12.861 --> 01:51:16.340
<v Speaker 4>let's go with a 40 year old putting his </v>
<v Speaker 4>finger out the fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How can you be the most value to your </v>

2569
01:51:22.931 --> 01:51:24.110
<v Speaker 4>children's lives?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's the way you express yourself,</v>

2570
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:25.040
<v Speaker 4>don't tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2571
01:51:25.041 --> 01:51:30.041
<v Speaker 4>I'll do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know that's got a leak into </v>

2572
01:51:30.041 --> 01:51:30.041
<v Speaker 4>everything you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're putting your hand out the window.</v>

2573
01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:33.600
<v Speaker 4>40 fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2574
01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:34.790

2575
01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:39.860
<v Speaker 7>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You should treat everybody in the other </v>

2576
01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:43.320
<v Speaker 7>car as if they're a giant friendly </v>
<v Speaker 7>linebacker.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Like don't ever say I'll fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't ever say I'll kick your ass.</v>

2578
01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:51.450
<v Speaker 7>Treat them with like some.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have a little bit of fear of them.</v>

2579
01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:54.120
<v Speaker 7>Don't want to be mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lay back.</v>

2580
01:51:54.210 --> 01:51:56.580
<v Speaker 7>That's how you should treat everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If we all just did that,</v>

2581
01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:01.760
<v Speaker 7>we'd all get along great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know you don't look at some giant </v>

<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2619
01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:32.830
<v Speaker 4>At least I never go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will say this,</v>

2620
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:35.960
<v Speaker 4>go into traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zero out the window,</v>

2621
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:41.050

<v Speaker 4>but even in the contents of your own </v>

<v Speaker 4>car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be.</v>

2623
01:53:41.050 --> 01:53:44.090
<v Speaker 4>You should be proud of your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least I know well enough when I'm</v>

2624
01:53:44.091 --> 01:53:49.091
<v Speaker 4>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's got to be for me and I should </v>

2625
01:53:49.091 --> 01:53:49.091
<v Speaker 4>work on that too.</v>

2626
01:53:49.091 --> 01:53:52.340
<v Speaker 5>I had a dude scream at me and take his </v>
<v Speaker 5>shirt off to show me his tattoos and </v>

2627
01:53:54.691 --> 01:53:59.691
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he called me a rich piece of </v>

2628
01:53:59.691 --> 01:53:59.880
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was not rich at the time,</v>

2629
01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:05.100
<v Speaker 5>but I did have a white suburban and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>guess white suburban made you think?</v>

01:54:05.190 --> 01:54:07.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean I wasn't famous at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't know who the fuck I was,</v>

2631
01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:13.100
<v Speaker 5>but I don't remember what it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I remember this dude took his shirt </v>

2632
01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:13.350
<v Speaker 5>off to show me his tattoos and I started</v>
<v Speaker 5>pointing out,</v>

<v Speaker 5>driving this big ass truck.</v>

2646
01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:44.310
<v Speaker 5>If like he slammed into me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's gonna get fucked up.</v>

2647
01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:50.180
<v Speaker 5>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody thinks to is ever ready for like </v>

<v Speaker 5>she was so stupid.</v>

2649
01:54:51.841 --> 01:54:54.300
<v Speaker 5>He thought I'd be scared of him because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got tattoos everywhere.</v>

2650
01:54:55.290 --> 01:54:56.610
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as he took his shirt off,</v>

2651
01:54:56.611 --> 01:54:58.830
<v Speaker 5>I was convinced I could fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2652
01:54:58.831 --> 01:55:01.920
<v Speaker 5>this dude doesn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no way he knows anything.</v>

2653
01:55:02.370 --> 01:55:03.990
<v Speaker 5>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2654
01:55:03.991 --> 01:55:06.890
<v Speaker 5>he was just like a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2655
01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:09.900
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't like a scary guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he had tattoos everywhere,</v>

2656
01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:13.080
<v Speaker 5>like all over his neck and cit and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>weren't even good.</v>

2657
01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:17.700
<v Speaker 5>I like tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just such a stupid thing,</v>

2658
01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:22.940
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet if I knew that guy in real life </v>

2659
01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:25.460
<v Speaker 5>and we were just together in a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>office building and he worked in one </v>

2660
01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:26.580
<v Speaker 5>office and I worked in and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's up man?</v>

2661
01:55:26.610 --> 01:55:27.600
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything cool.</v>

2662
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:32.830
<v Speaker 5>We live in friendly shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just this weird thing when you're </v>

2663
01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:33.870
<v Speaker 5>on a highway and everybody's ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's nervous.</v>

2664
01:55:34.110 --> 01:55:37.140
<v Speaker 5>You don't even realize you're nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you're calm and you're good,</v>

2665
01:55:37.141 --> 01:55:38.910
<v Speaker 5>you're always ready to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You always ready.</v>

2666
01:55:38.911 --> 01:55:40.860
<v Speaker 5>Somebody locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's hit the brakes.</v>

2667
01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:42.180
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at that is the fucking thing in the</v>

2668
01:55:42.181 --> 01:55:42.830
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got Shit.</v>

2669
01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:44.080
<v Speaker 5>You're always ready for that.</v>

2670
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:49.270
<v Speaker 7>You're ready for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why when I go to my house to </v>

2671
01:55:49.771 --> 01:55:54.771
<v Speaker 7>Silver Lake,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some people want to get on the highway </v>

2672
01:55:54.771 --> 01:55:54.771
<v Speaker 7>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2673
01:55:54.771 --> 01:55:56.160
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to get on the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>

2674
01:55:56.161 --> 01:55:57.510
<v Speaker 7>it always ends up being about the same </v>
<v Speaker 7>time,</v>

2675
01:55:57.511 --> 01:56:01.260
<v Speaker 7>but even if it's five minutes longer on </v>
<v Speaker 7>surface streets on a highway,</v>

2676
01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:03.960
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like I'm getting too out there in</v>

2677
01:56:03.961 --> 01:56:08.961
<v Speaker 7>this highway world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just want to go somewhere where I'm </v>

2678
01:56:08.961 --> 01:56:08.961
<v Speaker 7>not on the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2679
01:56:08.961 --> 01:56:11.400
<v Speaker 7>On the side road I can handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but on the,</v>

2680
01:56:11.401 --> 01:56:13.680
<v Speaker 7>on the highway I just get stressed out a</v>
<v Speaker 7>little more.</v>

2681
01:56:13.710 --> 01:56:15.510
<v Speaker 7>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll say if it's 10 minutes longer,</v>

2682
01:56:15.511 --> 01:56:16.560
<v Speaker 7>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2683
01:56:16.561 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 7>there's not a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not a bad idea.</v>

2684
01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:20.580
<v Speaker 7>It's chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's more relaxed.</v>

2685
01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:21.600
<v Speaker 7>Chill.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll teach.</v>

2686
01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:22.980
<v Speaker 7>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Slow down.</v>

2687
01:56:22.981 --> 01:56:23.180
<v Speaker 7>Stop.</v>

2688
01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:27.150
<v Speaker 7>No one's driving that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Take Pico from center city to my house.</v>

2689
01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:33.040
<v Speaker 7>I liked going over Laurel Canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know when you go into Hollywood it's</v>

2690
01:56:33.041 --> 01:56:34.170
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's more chill.</v>

2691
01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:36.030
<v Speaker 7>It's Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Get that cool.</v>

2692
01:56:36.031 --> 01:56:39.840
<v Speaker 7>Drive down that winding road down and </v>
<v Speaker 7>winding road down is excellent,</v>

2693
01:56:39.841 --> 01:56:41.610
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It reminds you you're in La.</v>

2694
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:46.810
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I always think of like these bad </v>

2695
01:56:46.810 --> 01:56:46.810
<v Speaker 7>motherfuckers that live right there on </v>
<v Speaker 7>the road like,</v>

2696
01:56:46.810 --> 01:56:48.060
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who do you have to be to be so confident</v>

2697
01:56:48.061 --> 01:56:53.061
<v Speaker 7>and people that you buy a house right </v>
<v Speaker 7>there on Laurel Canyon around one of </v>

2698
01:56:53.061 --> 01:56:55.380
<v Speaker 7>those corners where someone could easily</v>
<v Speaker 7>miscalculate and slammed right into your</v>

2699
01:56:55.381 --> 01:57:00.381
<v Speaker 7>car and slamming your house.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know those streets like Laurel in </v>

2700
01:57:00.381 --> 01:57:03.921
<v Speaker 7>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like there's a lot of like </v>

2701
01:57:03.921 --> 01:57:06.270
<v Speaker 7>jockeying for position on Laurel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw a guy the other day take a chance,</v>

2702
01:57:06.271 --> 01:57:10.380
<v Speaker 7>move and dump into the left lane to </v>
<v Speaker 7>oncoming traffic to pass a guy on laurel</v>

2703
01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:11.850
<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whoa.</v>

2704
01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:17.240
<v Speaker 7>That is a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is a like you're committing to </v>

2705
01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:17.290
<v Speaker 7>being a cocksucker.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you're going down.</v>

2706
01:57:17.490 --> 01:57:19.320
<v Speaker 7>There's just no way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2707
01:57:19.321 --> 01:57:21.390
<v Speaker 7>if someone's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't have enough time.</v>

2708
01:57:21.570 --> 01:57:23.910
<v Speaker 7>And if they're coming up the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you're coming down the hill,</v>

2709
01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:26.970
<v Speaker 7>the same kind of assholishness we've got</v>
<v Speaker 7>a real problem here.</v>

2710
01:57:26.971 --> 01:57:31.971
<v Speaker 7>Like you're going into the left lane </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's put that right next to your </v>

2711
01:57:31.971 --> 01:57:33.160
<v Speaker 7>house.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What these people's,</v>

2712
01:57:33.170 --> 01:57:34.920
<v Speaker 7>their houses are right there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2713
01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:39.330
<v Speaker 7>Like you could reach out and smack their</v>
<v Speaker 7>mailman in the ass to drive by.</v>

2714
01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:44.840
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I always think that like on the highway </v>

2715
01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:47.631
<v Speaker 7>when there's an apartment building,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so close to the highway that you could </v>

2716
01:57:47.631 --> 01:57:48.180
<v Speaker 7>forget something and go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

2717
01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:53.210
<v Speaker 7>I'm pulling around in the overpass,</v>
<v Speaker 7>come over to the window and throw me my </v>

2718
01:57:53.210 --> 01:57:56.990
<v Speaker 7>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like an episode of the honeymooners or </v>

2719
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:56.990
<v Speaker 7>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2720
01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.740
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have a string.</v>

2721
01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:03.540
<v Speaker 7>Maybe they run from the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

2722
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:06.390
<v Speaker 7>whenever I look at a science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 7>movie about like the future,</v>

2723
01:58:06.391 --> 01:58:09.780
<v Speaker 7>like a district nine district nine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Great fucking movie man.</v>

2724
01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:15.500
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but one of the things about these like </v>

2725
01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:15.510
<v Speaker 7>Super Uber congested cities,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you look at them and you go,</v>

2726
01:58:15.511 --> 01:58:16.980
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that common?</v>

2727
01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:22.100
<v Speaker 7>Is that like going to be everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 7>we going to be really living in this </v>

2728
01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:24.981
<v Speaker 7>sort of weird dystopian future.</v>
<v Speaker 7>New York City is in the perfect spot,</v>

2729
01:58:25.650 --> 01:58:27.750
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because it's not quite dystopian,</v>

2730
01:58:27.751 --> 01:58:30.750
<v Speaker 7>but it's definitely exceptional.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like those views that you get.</v>

2731
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:36.000
<v Speaker 7>Like a buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he had an apartment in Brooklyn on the </v>

2732
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:36.720
<v Speaker 7>water facing the city,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I think is even.</v>

2733
01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:39.060
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's better than being </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the city,</v>

2734
01:58:39.061 --> 01:58:42.490
<v Speaker 7>but it's pretty fucking stunning and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>just was in his living room going,</v>

2735
01:58:42.491 --> 01:58:43.900
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2736
01:58:43.901 --> 01:58:47.040
<v Speaker 7>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like this view is crazy.</v>

2737
01:58:47.170 --> 01:58:49.270
<v Speaker 7>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's stunning.</v>

2738
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:55.830
<v Speaker 7>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if that keeps going right and then it </v>

2739
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:58.420
<v Speaker 7>becomes this monolithic huge favela </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2740
01:58:58.421 --> 01:59:03.421
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some crazy like completely stuffed with </v>

2741
01:59:03.421 --> 01:59:06.721
<v Speaker 7>people and chickens and dogs running </v>
<v Speaker 7>around and I mean like all these future </v>

2742
01:59:06.721 --> 01:59:07.180
<v Speaker 7>dystopia movies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're all.</v>

2743
01:59:07.181 --> 01:59:12.181
<v Speaker 7>Everything is all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not like everything's amazing in </v>

2744
01:59:12.181 --> 01:59:14.341
<v Speaker 7>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have these huge super populated </v>

2745
01:59:14.341 --> 01:59:14.800
<v Speaker 7>cities and everything's perfect now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's all like way more crime.</v>

2746
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:19.200
<v Speaker 7>Way more craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh God.</v>

2747
01:59:23.410 --> 01:59:28.410
<v Speaker 7>Well it's just thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think people are improving and you </v>

2748
01:59:28.410 --> 01:59:28.450
<v Speaker 7>think people are improving?</v>
<v Speaker 7>We both do.</v>

2749
01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:30.910
<v Speaker 7>We think life's improved.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're kidding.</v>

2750
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:31.840
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2751
01:59:31.841 --> 01:59:33.820
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm saying there,</v>

2752
01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:38.080
<v Speaker 7>there is a problem with the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the actual raw numbers of us.</v>

2753
01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:43.440
<v Speaker 7>Like if you go back just a few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the amount of people was like 5 billion </v>

2754
01:59:44.831 --> 01:59:47.660
<v Speaker 7>less and it's not that long.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2755
01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:50.290
<v Speaker 7>I think you go back to the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

2756
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:52.570
<v Speaker 7>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what we've done this before,</v>

2757
01:59:52.571 --> 01:59:57.571
<v Speaker 7>and I know I've,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I always forget and I probably should </v>

2758
01:59:57.571 --> 01:59:58.660
<v Speaker 7>remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but what was world population in 1985?</v>

2759
01:59:58.690 --> 02:00:00.690
<v Speaker 7>That's when I got out of high school.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2760
02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:05.170
<v Speaker 7>want to say it was less than 3 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I want to say.</v>

2761
02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:06.460
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm wrong.</v>

2762
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:09.440
<v Speaker 7>5 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Little less than $5.</v>

2763
02:00:09.441 --> 02:00:10.510
<v Speaker 7>Million.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2764
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:15.870
<v Speaker 7>I feel a little bit better anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>during that time from 1985 to 2018,</v>

2765
02:00:16.210 --> 02:00:18.900
<v Speaker 7>it's now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is it 7 billion or has it hit eight?</v>

2766
02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:22.780
<v Speaker 7>Because the world population was real </v>
<v Speaker 7>close to eight.</v>

2767
02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:25.180
<v Speaker 7>Seven.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck man.</v>

2768
02:00:25.690 --> 02:00:30.690
<v Speaker 7>That's a lot of people gaining more than</v>
<v Speaker 7>2 billion people in just a few decades.</v>

2769
02:00:32.471 --> 02:00:35.470
<v Speaker 7>So you keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You do that a few decades more.</v>

2770
02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:40.500
<v Speaker 7>Does it accelerate?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You must because there's 2 billion more </v>

2771
02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:41.320
<v Speaker 7>people having people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's got to accelerate it.</v>

2772
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:41.320
<v Speaker 7>Alright.</v>

2773
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Exponential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every problem you list.</v>

2774
02:00:43.641 --> 02:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I connected right back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>old people.</v>

2775
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Like the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just live in a society that have </v>

2776
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have kids.</v>

2777
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>No one goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2778
02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>we'll learn about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you really know what your </v>

2779
02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>patients are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then if you start,</v>

2780
02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>you'll see at a certain time you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be with.</v>

2781
02:00:56.410 --> 02:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one is just that type of.</v>

2782
02:00:57.861 --> 02:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2783
02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>That's older people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2784
02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>that put that thought out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The energy problem.</v>

2785
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:08.480
<v Speaker 1>If like kids were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were just letting kids lead,</v>

2786
02:01:08.481 --> 02:01:13.481
<v Speaker 1>we'd have electric cars already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they already had that information </v>

2787
02:01:13.481 --> 02:01:17.951
<v Speaker 1>back then and we just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with electric cars to </v>

2788
02:01:17.951 --> 02:01:18.380
<v Speaker 1>the batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean even still true.</v>

2789
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>What about just musk is pretty much at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of the heap when it comes to </v>

2790
02:01:24.370 --> 02:01:28.571
<v Speaker 1>figuring out electric car technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anybody that's </v>

2791
02:01:28.571 --> 02:01:31.961
<v Speaker 1>ever had it nailed down like him before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a few different car </v>

2792
02:01:31.961 --> 02:01:31.961
<v Speaker 1>companies that make really good electric</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

2793
02:01:31.961 --> 02:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Fiskar makes a really good one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's on those batteries.</v>

2794
02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Like this is like this is not something </v>
<v Speaker 1>we could have had years ago.</v>

2795
02:01:39.861 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

2796
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.550
<v Speaker 5>then what about solar power?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Solar power is absolutely viable.</v>

2797
02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:45.890
<v Speaker 5>And especially in California where it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>raining,</v>

2798
02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:48.040
<v Speaker 5>it's been raining out here for a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>days and there is like,</v>

2799
02:01:48.050 --> 02:01:50.150
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like we live in Seattle,</v>

2800
02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:51.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's all green and shit,</v>

2801
02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:57.100
<v Speaker 5>but it's sunny most of the time and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>could just be collecting energy for </v>

2802
02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:57.100
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

2803
02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:58.440
<v Speaker 5>there's political issues with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like,</v>

2804
02:01:58.490 --> 02:02:03.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to get the infrastructure </v>

2805
02:02:03.490 --> 02:02:03.490
<v Speaker 5>ready.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to,</v>

2806
02:02:03.490 --> 02:02:03.710
<v Speaker 5>you could sell back to the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's that.</v>

2807
02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:07.790
<v Speaker 5>People do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of like difficulty though.</v>

2808
02:02:07.791 --> 02:02:11.300
<v Speaker 5>Apparently Brian Kaylin went through </v>
<v Speaker 5>that when he got his house solar powered</v>

2809
02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:13.700
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it really a lot of red tape?</v>

2810
02:02:13.701 --> 02:02:18.701
<v Speaker 5>And he goes and it seems like they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to discourage you from doing it </v>

2811
02:02:18.701 --> 02:02:19.580
<v Speaker 5>and make it difficult for you to do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>for you to switch over to electric.</v>

2812
02:02:19.610 --> 02:02:24.610
<v Speaker 5>They because he had his installed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>hooked up for months before it got </v>

2813
02:02:24.610 --> 02:02:26.630
<v Speaker 5>switched on with the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like real issue.</v>

2814
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:31.580
<v Speaker 5>And then even more so I think if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to go off grid so you can use solar</v>

2815
02:02:31.581 --> 02:02:34.190
<v Speaker 5>power and have no connection to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>grid,</v>

2816
02:02:34.410 --> 02:02:36.830
<v Speaker 5>that's a slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in some places,</v>

2817
02:02:36.831 --> 02:02:41.831
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think some places might actually </v>

2818
02:02:41.831 --> 02:02:42.260
<v Speaker 5>prevent you from doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is really weird.</v>

2819
02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:45.100
<v Speaker 5>They can prevent you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You will only use all.</v>

2820
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:51.010
<v Speaker 5>No one else has a dog should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically that's what they're saying is </v>

2821
02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:56.020
<v Speaker 5>what they're saying because that's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>the tone.</v>

2822
02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:58.970
<v Speaker 5>They say your power anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But thanks.</v>

2823
02:02:58.990 --> 02:03:00.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't be on all great.</v>

2824
02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:03.290
<v Speaker 5>How do you think they would sell that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like just pull up.</v>

2825
02:03:03.291 --> 02:03:05.720
<v Speaker 5>Just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how do they make that make sense?</v>

2826
02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:10.780
<v Speaker 5>They would have to have some regulations</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we don't know shit about your </v>

2827
02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:10.780
<v Speaker 5>solar.</v>

2828
02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 5>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know if it's dangerous.</v>

2829
02:03:12.381 --> 02:03:17.381
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean they could sell it in any way </v>

2830
02:03:17.381 --> 02:03:21.701
<v Speaker 5>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they're doing it in order to save </v>

2831
02:03:21.701 --> 02:03:24.280
<v Speaker 5>their constituents money or in to do the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bidding of whatever special interest </v>

2832
02:03:25.671 --> 02:03:28.400
<v Speaker 5>group is lobbying for them to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2833
02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:33.680
<v Speaker 5>that's why they do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't do those things because they </v>

2834
02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:33.680
<v Speaker 5>make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2835
02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:33.890
<v Speaker 5>they don't do it through those things </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're logical.</v>

2836
02:03:33.891 --> 02:03:35.900
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't don't get that free power.</v>

2837
02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:40.520
<v Speaker 5>Let me make it confusing to get that </v>
<v Speaker 5>free power.</v>

2838
02:03:40.521 --> 02:03:41.930
<v Speaker 5>Make it real hard for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Turn on,</v>

2839
02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:43.520
<v Speaker 5>I just got to stretch it out a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>

2840
02:03:43.521 --> 02:03:44.930
<v Speaker 5>You've got to keep paying me for a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>

2841
02:03:45.110 --> 02:03:47.540
<v Speaker 5>If they can just do that with a million </v>
<v Speaker 5>customers,</v>

2842
02:03:47.890 --> 02:03:51.260
<v Speaker 5>you have 3 million more months of </v>
<v Speaker 5>billable hours.</v>

2843
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:56.410
<v Speaker 5>If they wanted to do it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they just made it a policy to act </v>

2844
02:03:56.410 --> 02:03:56.410
<v Speaker 5>slower.</v>

2845
02:03:56.410 --> 02:03:57.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man it,</v>

2846
02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:02.280
<v Speaker 5>but I know how money works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet there's truth to what you're </v>

2847
02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:05.531
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so much money involved and they </v>

2848
02:04:05.531 --> 02:04:06.830
<v Speaker 5>don't make power companies because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're altruistic.</v>

2849
02:04:06.831 --> 02:04:08.990
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People want everybody to watch TV.</v>

2850
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:11.840
<v Speaker 5>They do because they want that cash </v>
<v Speaker 5>baby.</v>

2851
02:04:12.150 --> 02:04:17.150
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they're going to drill holes </v>

2852
02:04:17.150 --> 02:04:17.290
<v Speaker 5>right next to the river.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While the good stuff is flopped.</v>

2853
02:04:17.370 --> 02:04:19.640
<v Speaker 5>A salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just get to get in there.</v>

2854
02:04:19.641 --> 02:04:21.620
<v Speaker 5>It's just start drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't give a fuck,</v>

2855
02:04:21.621 --> 02:04:24.170
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were just who just want money.</v>

2856
02:04:24.171 --> 02:04:29.171
<v Speaker 5>Don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what's the problem with guys </v>

2857
02:04:29.171 --> 02:04:32.561
<v Speaker 5>like trump?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what the problem with the guys </v>

2858
02:04:32.561 --> 02:04:32.561
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He brings in.</v>

2859
02:04:32.561 --> 02:04:33.800
<v Speaker 5>There's so many that the number one </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing is not making money.</v>

2860
02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:36.650
<v Speaker 5>The number one thing is sustainability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the number one thing,</v>

2861
02:04:36.651 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 5>living the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the</v>

2862
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.560
<v Speaker 7>number one thing is can we live off this</v>
<v Speaker 7>earth?</v>

2863
02:04:40.590 --> 02:04:41.610
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>good.</v>

2864
02:04:41.970 --> 02:04:43.560
<v Speaker 7>Number two things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've got to be safe.</v>

2865
02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how can we be safe?</v>

2866
02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:45.360
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>

2867
02:04:45.361 --> 02:04:50.361
<v Speaker 7>we need to be able to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So freedom of speech is hugely fucking </v>

2868
02:04:50.361 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 7>important.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When it comes to being safe.</v>

2869
02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.790
<v Speaker 7>You need to be able to say things </v>
<v Speaker 7>without fear of repercussion.</v>

2870
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:59.030
<v Speaker 7>You need to be able to communicate 100 </v>
<v Speaker 7>percent honestly amongst each other so </v>

2871
02:04:59.030 --> 02:05:00.990
<v Speaker 7>we could figure out how you really feel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tell me how you really feel about this.</v>

2872
02:05:00.991 --> 02:05:05.991
<v Speaker 7>Then I can understand you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't really understand you yet </v>

2873
02:05:05.991 --> 02:05:06.290
<v Speaker 7>because you're hiding how you really </v>
<v Speaker 7>feel about partial,</v>

2874
02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:07.980
<v Speaker 7>about life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>parts of life.</v>

2875
02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:10.530
<v Speaker 7>That's where freedom of speech is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so God damn important.</v>

2876
02:05:10.531 --> 02:05:13.800
<v Speaker 7>Just one aspect of it being important,</v>
<v Speaker 7>being able to protest about stuff,</v>

2877
02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:16.170
<v Speaker 7>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to pee.</v>

2878
02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:17.030
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2879
02:05:17.070 --> 02:05:20.040
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we just did that.</v>

2880
02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:23.170
<v Speaker 7>So they just did that the other day and </v>
<v Speaker 7>handed me a note to.</v>

2881
02:05:23.550 --> 02:05:25.430
<v Speaker 7>How long have we gone?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2882
02:05:25.530 --> 02:05:27.300
<v Speaker 7>it was pat miletich.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2883
02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:28.980
<v Speaker 7>it's 1:30.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What did we start at?</v>

2884
02:05:28.981 --> 02:05:31.830
<v Speaker 7>Like 1115.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you do the math.</v>

2885
02:05:31.831 --> 02:05:33.690
<v Speaker 7>I'm too stupid for that already.</v>

2886
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:39.420
<v Speaker 7>That's why we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why you eat the food.</v>

2887
02:05:39.421 --> 02:05:42.300
<v Speaker 7>That you shouldn't be the same reason </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you got that.</v>

2888
02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:45.080
<v Speaker 7>Fuck it gene.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck it.</v>

2889
02:05:45.210 --> 02:05:47.100
<v Speaker 7>I have to midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is Jazz hard?</v>

2890
02:05:47.610 --> 02:05:48.630
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do it sometimes.</v>

2891
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:51.960
<v Speaker 7>I came home the other day from the ice </v>
<v Speaker 7>house Saturday night.</v>

2892
02:05:51.961 --> 02:05:56.961
<v Speaker 7>I cooked a steak at one in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got the cast iron skillet out and I </v>

2893
02:05:56.961 --> 02:06:01.460
<v Speaker 7>put some butter down and I had steak and</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kimchi while I watch TV at 1:00</v>

2894
02:06:04.171 --> 02:06:05.160
<v Speaker 7>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whatever the fuck.</v>

2895
02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:05.940
<v Speaker 7>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Delicious.</v>

2896
02:06:06.150 --> 02:06:07.800
<v Speaker 7>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was amazing.</v>

2897
02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:10.830
<v Speaker 7>I'm lucky that I.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The reason I want to stop,</v>

2898
02:06:10.831 --> 02:06:14.820
<v Speaker 7>it's not because I get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really have an iron stomach if there's</v>

2899
02:06:14.821 --> 02:06:16.800
<v Speaker 7>such as good,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's just,</v>

2900
02:06:16.801 --> 02:06:17.420
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2901
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:20.130
<v Speaker 7>it still makes me feel a little bit like</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't get sick,</v>

2902
02:06:20.131 --> 02:06:21.810
<v Speaker 7>but I feel a little heavy in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>morning.</v>

2903
02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:26.840
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I took two whole days yesterday and the </v>

2904
02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 7>day before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or a bullshit yesterday I egg rolls.</v>

2905
02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:34.650
<v Speaker 7>The day before I had a big bowl of pasta</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I had a cupcake.</v>

2906
02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:36.480
<v Speaker 7>I just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck it.</v>

2907
02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:39.480
<v Speaker 7>It Sunday or Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever it was,</v>

2908
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:41.460
<v Speaker 7>Sunday and Monday let's just have some </v>
<v Speaker 7>fun.</v>

2909
02:06:41.461 --> 02:06:43.860
<v Speaker 7>So for two days I was eight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whatever the fuck I want.</v>

2910
02:06:43.861 --> 02:06:48.861
<v Speaker 7>I just decided I want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had the worst parts of my career.</v>

2911
02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:53.100
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of my career of farting.</v>

2912
02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:57.120
<v Speaker 7>These were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these were the bombs to end all bombs.</v>

2913
02:06:57.240 --> 02:07:00.150
<v Speaker 7>My Body's just not designed to do that </v>
<v Speaker 7>anymore.</v>

2914
02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:05.330
<v Speaker 7>It just doesn't want to do that anymore </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I've been eating so clean so </v>

2915
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:08.541
<v Speaker 7>regularly that just a couple of days of </v>
<v Speaker 7>pasta and bullshit and egg rolls and my </v>

2916
02:07:10.141 --> 02:07:12.090
<v Speaker 7>body was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck you.</v>

2917
02:07:12.210 --> 02:07:15.000
<v Speaker 7>I felt lethargic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

2918
02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:18.810
<v Speaker 7>I just want to sit down all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My workout sucked.</v>

2919
02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:20.520
<v Speaker 7>It was hard to push myself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

2920
02:07:20.521 --> 02:07:23.130
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like this is not good.</v>

2921
02:07:23.131 --> 02:07:26.340
<v Speaker 7>Like eating bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just this is what most people are doing.</v>

2922
02:07:26.341 --> 02:07:31.341
<v Speaker 7>Most people are doing all day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're eating candy bars and bullshit </v>

2923
02:07:31.341 --> 02:07:34.350
<v Speaker 7>and not getting any nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You mean candy bars?</v>

2924
02:07:34.810 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's what</v>

2925
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:36.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

2926
02:07:36.441 --> 02:07:37.060
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2927
02:07:37.570 --> 02:07:40.450
<v Speaker 4>eight very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why you should eat good.</v>

2928
02:07:42.690 --> 02:07:43.850
<v Speaker 5>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you,</v>

2929
02:07:43.851 --> 02:07:48.851
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why don't you approach it like you're </v>

2930
02:07:48.851 --> 02:07:51.200
<v Speaker 5>taking in the artwork of these people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who cook food for you or learn how to </v>

2931
02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:51.200
<v Speaker 5>cook yourself.</v>

2932
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:52.410
<v Speaker 4>I cares.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem.</v>

2933
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:57.470
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that I had during the day I eat </v>

2934
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:59.280
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I juice every day like Kale,</v>

2935
02:07:59.281 --> 02:08:00.210
<v Speaker 4>carrots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>celery,</v>

2936
02:08:00.211 --> 02:08:03.180
<v Speaker 4>ginger beets every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you don't eat healthy?</v>

2937
02:08:03.210 --> 02:08:03.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2938
02:08:03.541 --> 02:08:05.670
<v Speaker 4>that's just because my only thing I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could do to say,</v>

2939
02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:07.890
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I have the shitty diet.</v>

2940
02:08:07.891 --> 02:08:12.891
<v Speaker 4>I can at least say to my body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to think of myself as my body </v>

2941
02:08:12.891 --> 02:08:13.140
<v Speaker 4>going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for giving us some good stuff.</v>

2942
02:08:13.290 --> 02:08:14.760
<v Speaker 4>We wish you wouldn't eat that other </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

2943
02:08:14.970 --> 02:08:17.100
<v Speaker 4>but thanks for something that's everyday</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd use,</v>

2944
02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:20.550
<v Speaker 4>but then it gets bad late at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if it's.</v>

2945
02:08:20.910 --> 02:08:21.900
<v Speaker 4>But that's good though.</v>

2946
02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:24.800
<v Speaker 5>So you're not all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a lot of good habits.</v>

2947
02:08:24.801 --> 02:08:29.801
<v Speaker 5>Like you're very aware that you need </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrients when you do do that stuff and </v>

2948
02:08:29.801 --> 02:08:33.671
<v Speaker 5>juice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that they say we </v>

2949
02:08:33.671 --> 02:08:36.251
<v Speaker 5>should probably look this up right now </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I'm obviously not a nutrition </v>

2950
02:08:36.251 --> 02:08:38.621
<v Speaker 5>expert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm pretty sure they say that </v>

2951
02:08:38.621 --> 02:08:39.460
<v Speaker 5>vitamins are absorbed better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2952
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:41.330
<v Speaker 5>when you have them with some healthy </v>
<v Speaker 5>fat.</v>

2953
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:46.750
<v Speaker 5>So I think they recommend coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you have some coconut oil with </v>

2954
02:08:47.090 --> 02:08:49.040
<v Speaker 5>vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you drink vegetable juice,</v>

2955
02:08:49.050 --> 02:08:51.840
<v Speaker 5>it actually can enhance the absorption </v>
<v Speaker 5>of some of the vitamins.</v>

2956
02:08:51.841 --> 02:08:52.570
<v Speaker 5>It's good to know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>made this exact dessert the way you're </v>

3051
02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:53.250
<v Speaker 1>describing it in a glass exact same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that.</v>

3052
02:12:53.290 --> 02:12:58.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying it's that they have all </v>

3053
02:12:58.290 --> 02:12:59.951
<v Speaker 1>the ingredients to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have those glasses they have apple </v>

<v Speaker 1>pie with.</v>

3055
02:12:59.951 --> 02:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>They should just serve it because I bet </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a big seller because it </v>

3056
02:13:03.370 --> 02:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple pies are not bad either.</v>

3057
02:13:03.370 --> 02:13:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Those Mcdonald's advertise when you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3058
02:13:05.370 --> 02:13:07.640

<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

3059
02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:08.840

<v Speaker 1>Here's my bed.</v>

3062
02:13:11.630 --> 02:13:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I called junk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's junk.</v>

3063
02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:15.530

<v Speaker 1>junk food,</v>

3064
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:21.310

<v Speaker 1>hamburger there is like whatever it is </v>

3065
02:13:21.310 --> 02:13:21.380
<v Speaker 1>that I can get into menu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look okay.</v>

3066
02:13:21.381 --> 02:13:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Can I get that with nothing on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a plain burger.</v>

3067
02:13:23.751 --> 02:13:24.560

<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can either do two things.</v>

3069
02:13:28.131 --> 02:13:33.131
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take all the ingredients off </v>

3070
02:13:33.131 --> 02:13:35.350
<v Speaker 1>the egg mcmuffin and put it in the </v>

3085
02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:18.520
<v Speaker 1>How much I agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3086
02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:19.980
<v Speaker 1>we're not saying the ingredients or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

3087
02:14:20.130 --> 02:14:23.250
<v Speaker 1>If you took that mcgriddle yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say this with a lot of foods.</v>

3088
02:14:23.250 --> 02:14:25.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm just using this as an example </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just said this,</v>

3089
02:14:25.871 --> 02:14:28.590
<v Speaker 1>that actual item,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I say this with a lot of things.</v>

3090
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Put It on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take that mcgriddle,</v>

3091
02:14:30.661 --> 02:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>put it on a chopping block at a French </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant in whatever,</v>

3092
02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and then all you do is put that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgriddle on the chopping block and then</v>

3093
02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:39.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe put some syrup all over it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered to a table there.</v>

3094
02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:41.970
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good,</v>

3095
02:14:41.971 --> 02:14:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like it's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

3096
02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I say that about Papa </v>

<v Speaker 1>You know where they take the bread they </v>

3098
02:14:54.070 --> 02:14:54.070
<v Speaker 1>put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only they put butter on it,</v>

3099
02:14:54.070 --> 02:14:56.400
<v Speaker 1>but then the vanilla glaze all over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put it in the oven.</v>

3100
02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:59.820
<v Speaker 1>If you were anywhere they go hold about </v>
<v Speaker 1>six in the morning.</v>

3101
02:15:00.550 --> 02:15:03.240
<v Speaker 1>It that they put the fresh cinnamon </v>
<v Speaker 1>tarts out,</v>

3102
02:15:03.330 --> 02:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you took a papa John's put it </v>

3103
02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3104
02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:08.400
<v Speaker 1>No one would eat it and go though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

3105
02:15:08.401 --> 02:15:09.750
<v Speaker 1>It's sugary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's doing the job there.</v>

3106
02:15:09.751 --> 02:15:10.560
<v Speaker 1>They'd go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3107
02:15:10.830 --> 02:15:13.830
<v Speaker 1>What if you had a mcgriddle with ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>cream on it?</v>

3108
02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ice Cream in between.</v>

3109
02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Like in between the layers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put the mcgriddle down with the </v>

3110
02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:24.110
<v Speaker 1>sausage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be absurd to be fucking sausage.</v>

3111
02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think of the sausage,</v>

3112
02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:29.730
<v Speaker 1>so I just thought the bread and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syrup and style,</v>

3113
02:15:29.731 --> 02:15:33.380
<v Speaker 1>the whole sausage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

3114
02:15:34.530 --> 02:15:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely do it.</v>

3115
02:15:37.250 --> 02:15:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always loved Hawaiian Pizza,</v>

3116
02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:42.120
<v Speaker 1>the pineapple and ham together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me To people.</v>

3117
02:15:42.121 --> 02:15:47.121
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'll argue social issues </v>

3118
02:15:47.121 --> 02:15:47.970
<v Speaker 1>into d for free because I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a good side of it,</v>

3119
02:15:48.150 --> 02:15:50.130
<v Speaker 1>but some people I'm okay to let go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

3120
02:15:50.370 --> 02:15:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe someone would like </v>
<v Speaker 1>pineapple on pizza.</v>

3121
02:15:52.690 --> 02:15:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3122
02:15:54.170 --> 02:15:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you like to pick sees.</v>

3123
02:15:57.090 --> 02:16:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Jesus says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3124
02:16:01.650 --> 02:16:04.050
<v Speaker 1>you know what I really love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pineapple.</v>

3125
02:16:04.110 --> 02:16:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Pineapple and anchovy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds disgusting.</v>

3126
02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:12.840
<v Speaker 1>It tastes amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my all time favorite pizzas.</v>

3127
02:16:12.841 --> 02:16:16.980
<v Speaker 1>It might be my all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mine's pineapple and slice sausage.</v>

3128
02:16:17.010 --> 02:16:18.930
<v Speaker 1>What are you watching this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

3129
02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:23.070
<v Speaker 1>a mcgriddle being rolled into rolled ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>cream.</v>

3130
02:16:23.071 --> 02:16:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Things that's popular right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3131
02:16:24.901 --> 02:16:29.901
<v Speaker 1>it's almost what you just described but </v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite and it looks actually Kinda </v>

3132
02:16:29.901 --> 02:16:30.090
<v Speaker 1>froze it and</v>

3133
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:31.800
<v Speaker 7>then turned it into those things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3134
02:16:31.810 --> 02:16:34.960
<v Speaker 7>You're seeing those.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The chopped it up and flattened it out.</v>

3135
02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:38.500
<v Speaker 7>It's like barely food.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's barely food.</v>

3136
02:16:38.501 --> 02:16:41.070
<v Speaker 7>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is the top?</v>

3137
02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:44.950
<v Speaker 7>So it's the not the inside of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>mcgriddle.</v>

3138
02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:50.200
<v Speaker 7>It's just the analysis starts over here </v>
<v Speaker 7>again and they turned it into this </v>

3139
02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:50.200
<v Speaker 7>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Donald's do it.</v>

3140
02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:50.230
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3141
02:16:50.231 --> 02:16:53.440
<v Speaker 7>that makes sense if it's the inside of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the mcgriddle because it's all,</v>

3142
02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:55.840
<v Speaker 7>I mean the outside rather because it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>all just that doe he shit.</v>

3143
02:16:55.841 --> 02:16:56.830
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was.</v>

3144
02:16:56.831 --> 02:16:58.240
<v Speaker 7>They poured the batter on it and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>show.</v>

3145
02:16:58.270 --> 02:16:59.230
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it is everything.</v>

3146
02:16:59.650 --> 02:17:00.760
<v Speaker 7>It's the meat to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3147
02:17:00.761 --> 02:17:04.570
<v Speaker 7>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How weird might be good,</v>

3148
02:17:04.571 --> 02:17:06.130
<v Speaker 7>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It might be good.</v>

3149
02:17:06.170 --> 02:17:07.330
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

3150
02:17:07.340 --> 02:17:09.640
<v Speaker 7>it's probably an interesting way to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3151
02:17:09.641 --> 02:17:12.160
<v Speaker 7>it's no different than what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you're masticating it.</v>

3152
02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:16.510
<v Speaker 7>It's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're making that out of it.</v>

3153
02:17:16.511 --> 02:17:18.350
<v Speaker 7>It's just making that already.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just.</v>

3154
02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:23.520
<v Speaker 7>Maybe you don't want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I found out this past week that ground </v>

3155
02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:25.981
<v Speaker 7>beef was invented by the Mongols ground </v>
<v Speaker 7>meat and went to see the con exhibit at </v>

3156
02:17:26.111 --> 02:17:30.490
<v Speaker 7>the Reagan Library.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck living back then.</v>

3157
02:17:30.491 --> 02:17:35.491
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You think it'd be hard to start over as </v>

3158
02:17:35.491 --> 02:17:36.520
<v Speaker 7>an open mic comic mentioned starting off</v>
<v Speaker 7>in a Mongo camp.</v>

3159
02:17:36.550 --> 02:17:38.110
<v Speaker 7>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why was ground beef invented?</v>

3160
02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:43.140
<v Speaker 7>They invented ground beef.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Apparently Mongols invented the Mongol </v>

3161
02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:44.200
<v Speaker 7>Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is either indirectly responsible,</v>

3162
02:17:44.201 --> 02:17:49.201
<v Speaker 7>directly responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or they invented like a shitload of </v>

3163
02:17:49.201 --> 02:17:49.201
<v Speaker 7>things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Would that be.</v>

3164
02:17:49.201 --> 02:17:52.040
<v Speaker 7>What year would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was like the 12 hundreds that they,</v>

3165
02:17:52.450 --> 02:17:55.210
<v Speaker 7>that they existed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that they first came to be.</v>

3166
02:17:55.310 --> 02:17:57.430
<v Speaker 7>What were they before that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just ate steak.</v>

3167
02:17:57.630 --> 02:17:58.390
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I mean,</v>

3168
02:17:58.391 --> 02:17:59.290
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they all,</v>

3169
02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.240
<v Speaker 7>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think they probably just,</v>

3170
02:18:01.241 --> 02:18:06.241
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just probably looked cooked meat </v>

3171
02:18:06.241 --> 02:18:08.010
<v Speaker 7>and just ate the meat and then someone </v>
<v Speaker 7>figured out where you can take tough </v>

3172
02:18:08.010 --> 02:18:09.910
<v Speaker 7>cuts because they would eat whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck they could take.</v>

3173
02:18:10.050 --> 02:18:12.490
<v Speaker 7>Tough cut and grind it up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can cook it and eat it.</v>

3174
02:18:12.491 --> 02:18:14.790
<v Speaker 7>Easier to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't eat meat?</v>

3175
02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:16.240
<v Speaker 7>I eat a lot of me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3176
02:18:16.241 --> 02:18:17.010
<v Speaker 7>you do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3177
02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:18.610
<v Speaker 7>Why I you think I wouldn't eat meat?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

3178
02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.270
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it may be for you.</v>

3179
02:18:22.450 --> 02:18:23.060
<v Speaker 7>One of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3180
02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:23.380
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3181
02:18:23.381 --> 02:18:23.790
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3182
02:18:23.791 --> 02:18:26.810
<v Speaker 7>I would say a free.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would just say I,</v>

3183
02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:31.210
<v Speaker 7>I listened to all always open to listen </v>
<v Speaker 7>to new things to sway my opinion,</v>

3184
02:18:31.211 --> 02:18:35.680
<v Speaker 7>but I like the stance of I heard someone</v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about at least free,</v>

3185
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:40.990
<v Speaker 7>free free range.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now I know the opposing view on that </v>

3186
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:40.990
<v Speaker 7>too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

3187
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:40.990
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just thought,</v>

3188
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:40.990
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're,</v>

3189
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:43.510
<v Speaker 7>if you're thinking I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that there is a food chain,</v>

3190
02:18:43.570 --> 02:18:45.070
<v Speaker 7>this is what I heard this person </v>
<v Speaker 7>speaking.</v>

3191
02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:46.820
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I made.</v>

3192
02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:47.980
<v Speaker 7>It's made sense to me.</v>

3193
02:18:48.180 --> 02:18:53.180
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there is a food chain and we don't have </v>

3194
02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:53.180
<v Speaker 7>to torture animals of course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there is this,</v>

3195
02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:57.390
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and tortured animals that then I would </v>

3196
02:18:57.390 --> 02:18:57.390
<v Speaker 7>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I was going to,</v>

3197
02:18:57.390 --> 02:18:58.240
<v Speaker 7>I wish I could,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I was going to eat meat,</v>

3198
02:18:58.270 --> 02:19:00.760
<v Speaker 7>I do eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I wish I did it that way.</v>

3199
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:03.760
<v Speaker 7>I'd be proud of myself if I committed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I hear someone that does that,</v>

3200
02:19:04.210 --> 02:19:05.200
<v Speaker 7>that will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

3201
02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:07.780
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have admiration for that.</v>

3202
02:19:08.170 --> 02:19:11.380
<v Speaker 7>Would you ever consider killing an </v>
<v Speaker 7>animal that you were going to eat?</v>

3203
02:19:12.130 --> 02:19:15.070
<v Speaker 7>Would you ever consider like raising a </v>
<v Speaker 7>cow killing it?</v>

3204
02:19:15.170 --> 02:19:17.050
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't.</v>

3205
02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:19.120
<v Speaker 7>What about hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you think you could hunt?</v>

3206
02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:20.410
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No?</v>

3207
02:19:21.550 --> 02:19:23.170
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Could you?</v>

3208
02:19:23.220 --> 02:19:24.220
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you do?</v>

3209
02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.090
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3210
02:19:25.091 --> 02:19:25.930
<v Speaker 7>But I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not,</v>

3211
02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:28.160
<v Speaker 7>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just</v>

3212
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:30.020
<v Speaker 1>couldn't hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not proper.</v>

3213
02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you're interested in.</v>

3214
02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

3215
02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:37.040
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3216
02:19:37.630 --> 02:19:41.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like I shot a guy in the face once </v>
<v Speaker 1>at camp who shot a man in Reno.</v>

3217
02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he's singing that song?</v>

3218
02:19:45.381 --> 02:19:50.381
<v Speaker 1>He was in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've liked that he went back and </v>

3219
02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:50.381
<v Speaker 1>perform there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can,</v>

3220
02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:50.730
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be lost.</v>

3221
02:19:52.110 --> 02:19:53.040
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3222
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:58.270
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot a man in Reno just to watch him </v>

3223
02:19:58.270 --> 02:19:58.270
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll go,</v>

3224
02:19:58.270 --> 02:19:58.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not glorify.</v>

3225
02:19:58.581 --> 02:20:01.700
<v Speaker 1>The guys said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>

3226
02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:04.140
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to.</v>

3227
02:20:04.280 --> 02:20:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I did doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3228
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm bummed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm singing it.</v>

3229
02:20:08.241 --> 02:20:13.241
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't someone just do a standup special </v>

3230
02:20:13.241 --> 02:20:13.241
<v Speaker 1>inside of prison?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Ross.</v>

3231
02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Ross was another comic to a black </v>
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>

3232
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:21.180
<v Speaker 1>You know the Alley Siddique John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very worried.</v>

3233
02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3234
02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:24.020
<v Speaker 1>How do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you say his name?</v>

3235
02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3236
02:20:27.650 --> 02:20:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I like the background you have behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>you more than the background,</v>

3237
02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:35.240
<v Speaker 1>but I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>

3238
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bigger than these bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3239
02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:43.470
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta use the bathroom.</v>

3240
02:20:43.490 --> 02:20:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

3241
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:46.080
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to say anything right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3242
02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:47.580
<v Speaker 1>We could wrap this up too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3243
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:52.590
<v Speaker 1>we've already asked you about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you go to the bathroom if that's </v>

3244
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:53.240
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just Mongol eating meat thing.</v>

3245
02:20:53.241 --> 02:20:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I just pull up this article from the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York Times.</v>

3246
02:20:55.101 --> 02:21:00.101
<v Speaker 1>It said that horse meat being tenderized</v>
<v Speaker 1>under their saddle is a myth.</v>

3247
02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3248
02:21:02.610 --> 02:21:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3249
02:21:04.270 --> 02:21:09.270
<v Speaker 5>Tenderize under their saddle steak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tar Tar was horse meat dish that </v>

3250
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:13.411
<v Speaker 5>originated from the horse eat Mongols,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the central Asia who swept across the </v>

3251
02:21:13.411 --> 02:21:17.011
<v Speaker 5>eastern Central Europe 800 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most common tales that the tartar </v>

3252
02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:18.720
<v Speaker 5>that tater.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you.</v>

3253
02:21:18.730 --> 02:21:23.730
<v Speaker 5>What would you say that tater tot her </v>
<v Speaker 5>ear horseman would put a slice of </v>

3254
02:21:23.730 --> 02:21:28.531
<v Speaker 5>horsemeat beneath their saddle in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>morning and retrieve it tenderized by </v>

3255
02:21:28.531 --> 02:21:29.140
<v Speaker 5>the pounding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Teat Ra for dinner.</v>

3256
02:21:29.290 --> 02:21:33.280
<v Speaker 5>They supposedly left their raw meat </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating habit behind and according to one</v>

3257
02:21:33.281 --> 02:21:38.281
<v Speaker 5>version of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was carried by the German sailors to </v>

3258
02:21:38.281 --> 02:21:41.491
<v Speaker 5>Homburg or the taste for ground beef </v>
<v Speaker 5>began begat both hamburgers and steak </v>

3259
02:21:41.831 --> 02:21:44.080
<v Speaker 5>tartare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

3260
02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that where Neil hamburger is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>where a hamburger came from.</v>

3261
02:21:48.450 --> 02:21:51.980
<v Speaker 1>The guy that goes hamburger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just to use the bathroom.</v>

3262
02:21:51.981 --> 02:21:53.240
<v Speaker 1>What's cool is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3263
02:21:53.570 --> 02:21:58.570
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to ask about that because </v>

3264
02:21:58.570 --> 02:22:00.371
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if the Reagan Library has old </v>

3265
02:22:00.371 --> 02:22:03.701
<v Speaker 1>information in their exhibit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says it's been passed around as a </v>

3266
02:22:03.701 --> 02:22:07.590
<v Speaker 1>like to say that if you're running a </v>
<v Speaker 1>museum you should probably know that </v>

3267
02:22:08.061 --> 02:22:13.061
<v Speaker 1>that's not true unless they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out chopped meat and this </v>

3268
02:22:13.061 --> 02:22:13.690
<v Speaker 1>is not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not.</v>

3269
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe originally it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would feel like if someone wanted </v>

3270
02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:23.021
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a way to tenderize meat </v>

3271
02:22:23.021 --> 02:22:26.390
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I went to the same restaurant I </v>

3272
02:22:26.390 --> 02:22:26.390
<v Speaker 1>was describing that I worked at before </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a Mongolian</v>

3273
02:22:26.390 --> 02:22:28.440
<v Speaker 8>barbecue grill where we'd cook with </v>
<v Speaker 8>swords,</v>

3274
02:22:28.441 --> 02:22:30.670
<v Speaker 8>literal metal swords on a flat top,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but no,</v>

3275
02:22:30.671 --> 02:22:35.671
<v Speaker 8>it was supposed to be representing the </v>
<v Speaker 8>shields that the Mongols would cook on </v>

3276
02:22:35.671 --> 02:22:35.940
<v Speaker 8>back in the 800,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever,</v>

3277
02:22:35.941 --> 02:22:38.250
<v Speaker 8>and they were just shredding meat.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's the only way you could do it.</v>

3278
02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:40.800
<v Speaker 8>So they were shredding beef.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if it's ground,</v>

3279
02:22:40.801 --> 02:22:43.250
<v Speaker 8>but like definitely shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's always something</v>

3280
02:22:43.410 --> 02:22:47.640
<v Speaker 7>when we cooked in the field with Rinella</v>
<v Speaker 7>for the first time,</v>

3281
02:22:47.641 --> 02:22:52.641
<v Speaker 7>when we shot a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he pounded it flat like he took like a </v>

3282
02:22:52.641 --> 02:22:55.020
<v Speaker 7>chunk of the backstrap and then put it </v>
<v Speaker 7>in between.</v>

3283
02:22:55.050 --> 02:22:59.190
<v Speaker 7>I forget what he put it in between,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but pounded it flat before it cooked it,</v>

3284
02:22:59.191 --> 02:23:01.500
<v Speaker 7>like to tenderize it and break it down a</v>
<v Speaker 7>little bit.</v>

3285
02:23:02.250 --> 02:23:07.250
<v Speaker 8>I just watched a video of a guy pounding</v>
<v Speaker 8>and aluminum foil role and making a </v>

3286
02:23:07.250 --> 02:23:08.610
<v Speaker 8>knife out of it is fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like a knife,</v>

3287
02:23:08.611 --> 02:23:11.870
<v Speaker 8>like a Shiv or a shank.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Watching it go watch the.</v>

3288
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:13.530
<v Speaker 8>I know you like to watch knife making </v>
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>

3289
02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:18.780
<v Speaker 8>It's just like it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's 10 minute video of him literally </v>

3290
02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:18.780
<v Speaker 8>taking the whole role.</v>

3291
02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:19.120
<v Speaker 7>Pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to see that.</v>

3292
02:23:19.250 --> 02:23:24.250
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some dude made a knife out of an </v>

3293
02:23:24.250 --> 02:23:27.190
<v Speaker 7>aluminum foil role.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's when you really want to fuck </v>

3294
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:29.180
<v Speaker 7>somebody up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're trapped in a restaurant.</v>

3295
02:23:29.210 --> 02:23:30.080
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have a question.</v>

3296
02:23:30.110 --> 02:23:31.910
<v Speaker 7>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We probably.</v>

3297
02:23:31.911 --> 02:23:35.450
<v Speaker 7>Should we go for the close?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look at this.</v>

3298
02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:37.490
<v Speaker 7>Look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's gonna.</v>

3299
02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:40.240
<v Speaker 7>Hammer down this aluminum foil until </v>
<v Speaker 7>they could turn it.</v>

3300
02:23:40.310 --> 02:23:42.580
<v Speaker 8>Got It all I can to kitchen too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He just uses the.</v>

3301
02:23:42.581 --> 02:23:45.590
<v Speaker 8>A regular old stove gas stove.</v>

3302
02:23:45.970 --> 02:23:48.040
<v Speaker 7>So did you just hammer it down and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>fold it?</v>

3303
02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:49.570
<v Speaker 7>Is that what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He leaves it here.</v>

3304
02:23:49.571 --> 02:23:54.571
<v Speaker 7>I was just kind of skip ahead so you can</v>
<v Speaker 7>just get a good idea for bad unless you </v>

3305
02:23:54.571 --> 02:23:55.510
<v Speaker 7>were trying to use that to build your </v>
<v Speaker 7>kids afford.</v>

3306
02:23:55.511 --> 02:23:57.850
<v Speaker 7>Then you're a nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You bake a hammer.</v>

3307
02:23:57.960 --> 02:24:02.960
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we turned it into metal that you could </v>

3308
02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:02.960
<v Speaker 7>saw.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is crazy.</v>

3309
02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:06.640
<v Speaker 7>Been a lot of time sharpening it down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is crazy.</v>

3310
02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:08.540
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is not.</v>

3311
02:24:08.541 --> 02:24:10.910
<v Speaker 7>So he turned it into a real piece of </v>
<v Speaker 7>aluminum.</v>

3312
02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:15.700
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is fucking bananas.</v>

3313
02:24:15.701 --> 02:24:18.520
<v Speaker 7>And he's sharpened.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is crazy.</v>

3314
02:24:19.290 --> 02:24:22.810
<v Speaker 7>But I gave it a handle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

3315
02:24:22.990 --> 02:24:27.990
<v Speaker 7>And then put it in at the end and puts </v>
<v Speaker 7>it in a package and shows like chopping </v>

3316
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:27.990
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But domain.</v>

3317
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:30.430
<v Speaker 7>You must be so weak though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's aluminum.</v>

3318
02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:31.510
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he sells it.</v>

3319
02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:33.520
<v Speaker 7>It probably might.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Would you want to buy?</v>

3320
02:24:33.530 --> 02:24:35.920
<v Speaker 7>Why would you want it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just because I'm an asshole.</v>

3321
02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:39.100
<v Speaker 7>I want to buy an aluminum foil knife.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I need it.</v>

3322
02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:43.540

<v Speaker 7>about the guy who made a knife out of </v>
<v Speaker 7>shit and it was frozen or frozen shit </v>

<v Speaker 7>I only have.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Can I plug some things for sure.</v>

3335
02:25:21.610 --> 02:25:22.510
<v Speaker 7>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

3336
02:25:22.511 --> 02:25:23.970
<v Speaker 7>so I'll get this real quick about your</v>

3337
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:25.730
<v Speaker 1>special first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is that?</v>

3338
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Our special netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called an act happy.</v>

3339
02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to call it sucked by pigeon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick,</v>

3340
02:25:31.151 --> 02:25:33.250
<v Speaker 1>but I was the only one that was raising </v>
<v Speaker 1>my hand.</v>

3341
02:25:33.251 --> 02:25:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have backed you up.</v>

3342
02:25:35.050 --> 02:25:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Was was a juggling act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3343
02:25:36.971 --> 02:25:38.790
<v Speaker 1>and who the hell would it not forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3344
02:25:39.180 --> 02:25:41.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suck my page and deck.</v>

3345
02:25:41.021 --> 02:25:42.580
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you something?</v>

3346
02:25:42.581 --> 02:25:45.790
<v Speaker 1>The last time I went to two times and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know tell any stories like you know,</v>

3347
02:25:45.791 --> 02:25:46.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person.</v>

3348
02:25:46.661 --> 02:25:46.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3349
02:25:46.991 --> 02:25:51.991
<v Speaker 1>This is two things I think and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have learned my lesson because my </v>

3350
02:25:51.991 --> 02:25:55.690
<v Speaker 1>book I wanted to call the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to call my book.</v>

3351
02:25:56.350 --> 02:26:01.350
<v Speaker 1>All I ever wanted to do was meet a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl with a terminal disease and then </v>

3352
02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:05.260
<v Speaker 1>then other stupid things I said to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the closet door shut.</v>

3353
02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I would add that as a subtitle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I hated the word closet.</v>

3354
02:26:07.991 --> 02:26:12.991
<v Speaker 1>That's how he tried to sell it to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they closet and anything to do </v>

3355
02:26:12.991 --> 02:26:15.961
<v Speaker 1>with any words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that of Clyde this and out and </v>

3356
02:26:15.961 --> 02:26:16.480
<v Speaker 1>so I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3357
02:26:16.481 --> 02:26:21.481
<v Speaker 1>if I can call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I ever wanted to do was meet a nice </v>

3358
02:26:21.481 --> 02:26:21.481
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first title was with cancer.</v>

3359
02:26:21.481 --> 02:26:25.810
<v Speaker 1>All I ever wanted to do was meet a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl with cancer and other.</v>

3360
02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:30.860
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other stupid things I said to keep the </v>

3361
02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:33.061
<v Speaker 1>closet door shut because there's a story</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there about me literally me and my </v>

3362
02:26:33.061 --> 02:26:33.061
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3363
02:26:33.061 --> 02:26:36.100
<v Speaker 1>so it does make sense and it's not mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not insulting cancer.</v>

3364
02:26:36.101 --> 02:26:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's still should have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>the title of the book.</v>

3365
02:26:38.830 --> 02:26:40.810
<v Speaker 1>The problem is people are going to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and go,</v>

3366
02:26:40.811 --> 02:26:43.600
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just a mean guy that wants girls to</v>

3367
02:26:43.601 --> 02:26:48.601
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the boil down dumb version of </v>

3368
02:26:48.601 --> 02:26:51.210
<v Speaker 1>fully look into it in that funny you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even consider that and consider </v>

3369
02:26:51.210 --> 02:26:53.460
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3370
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you're wishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about terminal disease?</v>

3371
02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Now you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It brings up a guy,</v>

3372
02:26:57.880 --> 02:26:59.830
<v Speaker 1>a dumb guy writing a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3373
02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:02.020
<v Speaker 1>suck my dick and the Diet.</v>

3374
02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:07.870
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you know what?</v>

3375
02:27:07.871 --> 02:27:12.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm stubborn in certain ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in other ways all you gotta do it </v>

3376
02:27:12.871 --> 02:27:14.500
<v Speaker 1>cleanly explained something to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3377
02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:16.090
<v Speaker 1>they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to call it that.</v>

3378
02:27:16.210 --> 02:27:19.420
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about that to go for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong audience,</v>

3379
02:27:19.421 --> 02:27:24.421
<v Speaker 1>to see it on a shelf somewhere and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should all be able to change </v>

3380
02:27:24.421 --> 02:27:26.200
<v Speaker 1>our opinions about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try hard to work on that.</v>

3381
02:27:26.201 --> 02:27:31.201
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a big thing about being a </v>

3382
02:27:31.201 --> 02:27:33.211
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to look at things and not think </v>

3383
02:27:33.211 --> 02:27:33.280
<v Speaker 1>that you are those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a person.</v>

3384
02:27:33.490 --> 02:27:35.740
<v Speaker 1>You're not those ideas like you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

3385
02:27:35.741 --> 02:27:40.741
<v Speaker 1>Just because you thought of it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribe to it and you believed at one </v>

3386
02:27:40.741 --> 02:27:41.170
<v Speaker 1>point in time it don't let it define </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3387
02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:45.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just an idea and if it's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond just about it and say,</v>

3388
02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:49.390
<v Speaker 1>this is why I thought it was real and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people respect that because they'll know</v>

3389
02:27:49.450 --> 02:27:52.810
<v Speaker 1>that when you're talking you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really on your mind.</v>

3390
02:27:52.810 --> 02:27:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're wrong,</v>

3391
02:27:54.310 --> 02:27:56.260
<v Speaker 1>you might be incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are incorrect,</v>

3392
02:27:56.261 --> 02:27:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you going to let them know you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect and you know what?</v>

3393
02:27:58.570 --> 02:28:00.160
<v Speaker 1>The way to look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3394
02:28:00.250 --> 02:28:05.250
<v Speaker 1>and I remind myself every time I talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this stuff to say how many of the </v>

3395
02:28:05.250 --> 02:28:09.991
<v Speaker 1>things are you doing because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>right where you just think time equals </v>

3396
02:28:09.991 --> 02:28:14.401
<v Speaker 1>validity because there probably are some</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that should you should have been </v>

3397
02:28:14.401 --> 02:28:15.940
<v Speaker 1>doing for the last 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so let's not go issue by issue.</v>

3398
02:28:15.941 --> 02:28:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Here's a wider scope for someone to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves under fair judgement.</v>

3399
02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:21.740
<v Speaker 1>If you're 45 years old and you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

3400
02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm just throwing out numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with up or down the number,</v>

3401
02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:25.760
<v Speaker 1>but you'll get the gist of what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3402
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.920
<v Speaker 1>If you're 45 years old and what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we talking about?</v>

3403
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I got high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you remind me I'll.</v>

3404
02:28:32.690 --> 02:28:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll go right back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure where you're going </v>

3405
02:28:37.690 --> 02:28:38.700
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3406
02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana is that God damn marijuana.</v>

3407
02:28:41.521 --> 02:28:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't even fuck her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

3408
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was he talking about?</v>

3409
02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3410
02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:51.090
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>

3411
02:28:51.091 --> 02:28:56.091
<v Speaker 1>I want to do so and then I have to plug </v>
<v Speaker 1>these dates and I remember that we were </v>

3412
02:28:56.091 --> 02:28:57.690
<v Speaker 1>talking about people being nicer to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

3413
02:28:58.530 --> 02:29:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about</v>

3414
02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:03.370
<v Speaker 1>being able to change your comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>special,</v>

3415
02:29:03.371 --> 02:29:08.371
<v Speaker 1>being able to change your opinions on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and I think it's very important </v>

3416
02:29:08.371 --> 02:29:11.581
<v Speaker 1>to be able to just change your opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you are not your ideas because </v>

3417
02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:16.120
<v Speaker 1>you believe something doesn't mean you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be locked into it because.</v>

3418
02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remembered.</v>

3419
02:29:17.450 --> 02:29:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good way to judge yourself is to go,</v>

3420
02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:24.960
<v Speaker 1>if you're 45 years old and you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the last so many years changed </v>

3421
02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:26.200
<v Speaker 1>your view on something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about we start with that?</v>

3422
02:29:26.370 --> 02:29:28.900
<v Speaker 1>We won't even take issue at hand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3423
02:29:28.901 --> 02:29:33.901
<v Speaker 1>what does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way that you shouldn't be </v>

3424
02:29:33.901 --> 02:29:33.901
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simply should,</v>

3425
02:29:33.901 --> 02:29:33.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it's not,</v>

3426
02:29:33.901 --> 02:29:38.820
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'd say in a 10 year period where </v>

3427
02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:39.400
<v Speaker 1>there are two things that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>adamant about,</v>

3428
02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:41.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe in two areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everything.</v>

3429
02:29:41.441 --> 02:29:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

3430
02:29:43.330 --> 02:29:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But if you can honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just outwardly to be writing an </v>

3431
02:29:48.330 --> 02:29:48.330
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

3432
02:29:48.330 --> 02:29:48.520
<v Speaker 1>y'all changed my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but go inward.</v>

3433
02:29:48.521 --> 02:29:53.521
<v Speaker 1>No one's around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be honest with yourself and then you </v>

3434
02:29:53.521 --> 02:29:53.530
<v Speaker 1>might be able to go in the dark of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own asking yourself,</v>

3435
02:29:53.531 --> 02:29:54.730
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

3436
02:29:54.731 --> 02:29:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess I really have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3437
02:29:57.310 --> 02:30:02.310
<v Speaker 1>And then be aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there starts your change and </v>

3438
02:30:02.310 --> 02:30:04.731
<v Speaker 1>we'll be back right after this.</v>
