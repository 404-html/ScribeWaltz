00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:01.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad over all the years though,</v>

4
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>although all the stupid ideas that have had about arguments in my head,</v>

5
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>I've avoided all physical altercations.</v>

6
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a physical altercation.</v>

7
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I've kid,</v>

8
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I've had situations where,</v>

9
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:14.821
<v Speaker 1>a long time ago,</v>

11
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I wish I told this guy that or I wish I told them this,</v>

12
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is it's way better than I didn't cause then what if he went,</v>

13
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>well fuck you.</v>

14
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>And then he fucking throws a rock at me and then all of a sudden were two men</v>

15
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.153
<v Speaker 1>biting each other.</v>

16
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.571
<v Speaker 1>You want to get on it?</v>

17
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Go that route.</v>

18
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Wrestling in the street like fucking children.</v>

19
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>You know what the fuck is that?</v>

20
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.601
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

21
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>my dad came home from work once with a fucking black eye.</v>

22
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>My stepdad's business was going,</v>

23
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>it was falling apart and at one point she got squirrelly in him and his partner</v>

24
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>fucking duked it out.</v>

25
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

26
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:47.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>he been,</v>

28
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>youtube wasn't around then.</v>

29
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:49.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>there'd be some sort of security.</v>

31
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

32
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.901
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

33
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>aren't you like in your fucking forties?</v>

34
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like what is happening here?</v>

35
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

36
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it was disappointing.</v>

37
00:00:58.171 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Embarrassing.</v>

38
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.031
<v Speaker 1>It was sad.</v>

39
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a bunch of different things all at once.</v>

40
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't think it was bad ass on any level that your stepdad could still throw</v>

41
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

42
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

43
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.701
<v Speaker 1>he could.</v>

44
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I think he got his ass kicked.</v>

45
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that's embarrassing.</v>

46
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

47
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he got sucker punched and then uh,</v>

48
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>he hit the guy back.</v>

49
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>He punched the guy in the stomach,</v>

50
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>but I dunno who punched who first,</v>

51
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's just fucking pathetic.</v>

52
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>This guy was his friend and this guy used to come over to the house and we used</v>

53
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

54
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>we all still have family dinners together.</v>

56
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.331
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

57
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>him and his wife would come over the house and was,</v>

58
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>this is my dad's partner.</v>

59
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden they're fucking duking it out at work.</v>

60
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Cause the,</v>

61
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>the business fell apart.</v>

62
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>

63
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 1>very straight and come over for dinner again or no,</v>

64
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

65
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>they became friends again.</v>

66
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:35.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

67
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:35.901
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

68
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:36.391
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

69
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>they stayed friends,</v>

70
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

72
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>they've duked it out as friends and then they stayed friends,</v>

73
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>but it was just embarrassing and he was embarrassed to,</v>

74
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>he felt like such a fucking idiot.</v>

75
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>He came home with a black eye,</v>

76
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:46.531
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

78
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:47.364
<v Speaker 1>what am I dealt with?</v>

79
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Hi Roni man to read,</v>

80
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>pick up the friendship.</v>

81
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>It'd be easier if I won the fight,</v>

82
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>if I lost the fight.</v>

83
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:54.910
<v Speaker 1>That would be in the back of my,</v>

84
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>he went the rematch point.</v>

85
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>And you get used to,</v>

86
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>when you do Jujitsu a lot,</v>

87
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>you get used to getting beat can get,</v>

88
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>that's a different thing.</v>

89
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>There's someone wanting to fight and then like,</v>

90
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:05.911
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

91
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:06.151
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

92
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>let's try these techniques.</v>

93
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

94
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>if like what if we had some big argument about we were going to combine our</v>

96
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>podcasts and then it just didn't go well and I didn't give you the money for the</v>

97
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>microphones and then we duked it out and you somehow lost.</v>

98
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I somehow surprise you and had always feel like one in a million chance.</v>

99
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I somehow caught you.</v>

100
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I would feel way stupid or that we're fighting.</v>

101
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I would feel way stupider than that.</v>

102
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.121
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

103
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>but you're a martial artist.</v>

104
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

105
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>But just right now</v>

106
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.371
<v Speaker 1>go in peace.</v>

107
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.204
<v Speaker 1>He got Doug's.</v>

108
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>It's always worth it.</v>

109
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't see me in there and like I got my back turned to get down the</v>

110
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>amperage shaking my head.</v>

111
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

112
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.381
<v Speaker 1>what bill?</v>

113
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>How can they punched me in the face?</v>

114
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>And that Ron Howard look at jackass.</v>

115
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't bug you.</v>

116
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Depends on if you really just tooled me up.</v>

117
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Like all of a sudden you just fucking unload like a one to leg kick combination</v>

118
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:55.194
<v Speaker 1>on me and</v>

119
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>hit me with a liver shot and dropped me and uh,</v>

120
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>and then I had tap out.</v>

121
00:02:59.591 --> 00:02:59.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Then I'd</v>

123
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>probably want some sort of a rematch.</v>

124
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this,</v>

125
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 2>which really upset would you lose a belt class?</v>

126
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Would you have to go back down to Brown belt and you'll lose?</v>

127
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

128
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 2>the only way you get to the ideas that you're a certain level of proficiency,</v>

129
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean that someone can't get you.</v>

130
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.650
<v Speaker 2>What if I started Fluxx helps get tapped all the time.</v>

131
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 2>If my face to your Dojo,</v>

132
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to lose just when a UTI bill</v>

133
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>who's next and I'm just sitting there with a stupid look on my face.</v>

134
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh van.</v>

135
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.943
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

136
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 2>competition is healthy.</v>

137
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fun and everything,</v>

138
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 2>but when it gets in the real world,</v>

139
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 2>like as far as like fighting people and shit like that,</v>

140
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.290
<v Speaker 2>it's too spoiled because you don't just fight someone.</v>

141
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 2>They'd get mad and then they come back and they want to bring a baseball bat or</v>

142
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 2>fucking stab you or shoot you.</v>

143
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I never fought outside my family past June,</v>

144
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 2>outside flashy when junior high started getting to be like,</v>

145
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:51.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

204
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:18.701
<v Speaker 2>older,</v>

205
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 2>which is basic when you're in seventh grade,</v>

206
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>like that two years is a huge jump physically.</v>

207
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 2>And it's like you're sitting there,</v>

208
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:27.154
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

209
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.401
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

210
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:27.641
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

211
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find you and the other guys,</v>

212
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.330
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

213
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 2>we've got like a beard,</v>

214
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 2>smashing you over the head.</v>

216
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:34.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

217
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

218
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.861
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

219
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 2>so all my fights were basically within my family and I had four brothers,</v>

220
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 2>so I used to practice on my three younger ones and then try to take my older</v>

221
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 2>brother who had the psychological advantage over me.</v>

222
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 2>So older brothers always have an advantage.</v>

223
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who's a older brother,</v>

224
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:54.061
<v Speaker 2>used to beat the fuck out of them and it tortured him late into adulthood.</v>

225
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>He was in his late thirties and it was fucked.</v>

226
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>It fucked his head</v>

227
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

228
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>He always wanted to get back at his brother.</v>

229
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 1>He used to go over his brother's house and his brother wasn't home and steal</v>

230
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:03.584
<v Speaker 1>shit from them.</v>

231
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Like he would go like his wife,</v>

232
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>his brother's wife was there.</v>

233
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.043
<v Speaker 1>He'd say hi.</v>

234
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And again I got,</v>

235
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>John told me to go pick something up and he'd go in and just steal from his</v>

236
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

237
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>What's still kinds of shit?</v>

238
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Beat the fuck out of him.</v>

239
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>His brother beat the fuck out of him and his brother was like two years older</v>

240
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>and just use to just box him up.</v>

241
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.060
<v Speaker 1>He's to fucking really hurt them and intimidate the shit out of.</v>

242
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I got one for,</v>

243
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I went last time I fought my youngest brother,</v>

244
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.531
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

245
00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I forget when we went out and about my dad came in to break it up and like a</v>

246
00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:31.030
<v Speaker 2>piece of shit.</v>

247
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I did one more over my dad's shoulder caught him and it made that classic like</v>

248
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood should have rec recorded the sound for like the punch in the face is</v>

249
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:42.940
<v Speaker 2>that classic but like with a little bit of lip sound kind of right in the mouth.</v>

250
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.440
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

251
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.610
<v Speaker 2>I knew what bugged them and then what would hit for like 15 years we would be</v>

252
00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:49.270
<v Speaker 2>out drinking.</v>

253
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.070
<v Speaker 2>And like when he got on his third drink,</v>

254
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.990
<v Speaker 2>I would feel him sizing me up.</v>

255
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.213
<v Speaker 2>I felt it,</v>

256
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.331
<v Speaker 2>I felt it.</v>

257
00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:55.781
<v Speaker 2>I was just going,</v>

258
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:57.700
<v Speaker 2>is this in my head or is this dude sizing me up?</v>

259
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.880
<v Speaker 2>And then like years later I'm drink with my other brother and we were talking</v>

260
00:07:00.881 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

00:07:01.961 --> 00:07:02.950

264
00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:04.120
<v Speaker 2>but I feel him size and up.</v>

265
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.540

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:06.250
<v Speaker 2>every time I drink with them,</v>

269
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:11.251
<v Speaker 2>he brings that and like by then he was a little bit taller than me and he had</v>

270
00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:11.681
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

271

276
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I got to a point where I just,</v>

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.060
<v Speaker 2>but I had the advantage where he has a real job,</v>

291
00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:41.020
<v Speaker 2>so he has to work.</v>

292
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I can sit here going on hikes and going to the gym and stuff.</v>

293
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:44.470
<v Speaker 2>So I was in,</v>

294
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.161
<v Speaker 2>I've cardio,</v>

295
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:45.971
<v Speaker 2>I was in better shape,</v>

296
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:46.750
<v Speaker 2>so I just,</v>

297
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I just tied them up.</v>

298
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Hello Jeff.</v>

299
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.810
<v Speaker 2>The time up for not,</v>

300
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 2>not long ago and he was like one of these past 15 seconds.</v>

301
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:54.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like in cubicle shape.</v>

302
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Like that initial I'm going to,</v>

303
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.211
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill you.</v>

304
00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.260
<v Speaker 2>But this is the thing though,</v>

305
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:00.310
<v Speaker 2>if he would have,</v>

306
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.391
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't,</v>

307
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:01.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

308
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 2>tie him up.</v>

309
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

310
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:02.771
<v Speaker 2>that's all.</v>

311
00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

312
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.221
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

313
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:04.200
<v Speaker 2>it's like in hockey when,</v>

314
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.260
<v Speaker 2>when someone does not have a fight,</v>

315
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 2>they just grabbed the guy and like bear hug them.</v>

316
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it did that and I was uh,</v>

317
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:10.301
<v Speaker 2>how was it?</v>

318
00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:11.230
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of on top of me,</v>

319
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:11.561
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

320
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:12.031
<v Speaker 2>I just sat,</v>

321
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorta smothered in there.</v>

322
00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:13.361
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

323
00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:13.541
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

324
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to fight.</v>

325
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I can fight.</v>

326
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.310
<v Speaker 2>He didn't talk to me for a year.</v>

327
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

328
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.170
<v Speaker 2>You didn't talk to me for a year.</v>

329
00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 2>And what was he mad about?</v>

330
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

331
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.780
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

332
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.080
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

333
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.970
<v Speaker 2>it's that family shit.</v>

334
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

335
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Something from 1974.</v>

336
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:24.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad.</v>

337
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

338
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I would not want to grow up with someone like me if I was a brother,</v>

339
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.993
<v Speaker 1>if I had be like it,</v>

340
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.580
<v Speaker 2>one or two things would have happened would have been either we would join an</v>

341
00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:38.581
<v Speaker 2>alliance and fucking start a team take on the world and tag team checks or we</v>

342
00:08:39.581 --> 00:08:40.420
<v Speaker 2>would fight to the death.</v>

343
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.410
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be one or the other.</v>

344
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't really see any,</v>

345
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.301
<v Speaker 2>the other options.</v>

346
00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

347
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.930
<v Speaker 2>so which one's going to be fucking,</v>

348
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

349
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.890
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a reason why you didn't have a brother.</v>

350
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.521
<v Speaker 2>Cause I,</v>

351
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:49.420
<v Speaker 2>whenever I talked to him,</v>

352
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:49.870
<v Speaker 2>he has like,</v>

353
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.080
<v Speaker 2>you'll have a couple of parakeets and they somehow have a fight to the death.</v>

354
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:53.591
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

355
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:54.250

357
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.090
