1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
Look at you.
Um,
I'm enjoying this gem.
I wish we had a speed bag.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.800
That's my favorite thing to one a test.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.420
Steve Sweeney,
ladies and gentlemen,
how are you?
Hey,
I'm great.
I can't sell it.

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.860
You know what?
I've done so many things in my life.
You know,
movies,

5
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.300
TV,
all this stuff.
Stand up.
But Joe Falcon,

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.770
oh my God.
Jack and blast and Jesus have Rancho Rankin.

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.530
Yeah,
I get you got fans,
you know that.
Oh,

8
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.470
like all these different ages and all different kinds of people and I'm very

9
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:41.100
proud of you.
Thank you.
One of the things that happened,
you don't remember this,

10
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:44.790
but you opened for me many times.
Louis C K opened for me.

11
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.470
Nick Dipaolo open for me.

12
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.480
So people that want a little show business advice open for me.

13
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.260
It helps that.
Then you get to go by me and uh,
you know,

14
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.210
I get to watch you guys become stars.

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.590
I've said I'm playing fucking Chinese for us in Saugus,

16
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.270
some of the best standup comedy in the world is at Chinese restaurants and
Sagas.

17
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:09.030
And that's a fact still to this day.
All those people that live there,

18
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:12.570
they don't know how good they have it.
Well,
you know what it is,
you know,

19
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.380
you work with these guys.
You and I have worked with guys that are like genius,

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.130
you know,
a transcendent,
whatever word you want to use.
But

21
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.620
doing stand up is not about being funny.

22
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.720
It's about going into these shit holes and like developing this extra skin.

23
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.910
You know,
you,
you're a martial artist and sort of,

24
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:36.420
you have kind of that mentality.
But you know,

25
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.540
when I started it was like,
I came from,
you know,
I was an actor,

26
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:42.610
I was very serious person.
I was like an actor,
you know,
and I,

27
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.260
I do like these obscure impressions.
I,

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.630
Paul Scofield and Lawrence,
Lawrence,
Olivia,
you know,
all right,

29
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.110
it's on ads and all this bullshit.

30
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.880
And I'd be playing at places like the sugar shack.
So you remember this shit.

31
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.440
It was a black,
uh,

32
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.320
R and B joint and I opened for BB King.
Wow.
Yeah.

33
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:05.910
And I'm dealing like John Lennon.

34
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:10.500
It was very important when we started them and the black do some dirty shit,
man.

35
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:15.210
What the fuck you don't,
you know,
any jokes.
So in the back,

36
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.680
I get heckled,
my first heckler,
Yo suck.
And I said,
yeah,

37
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.690
fuck you.
Who are you?
He says,
I'm BB King.
I hired you motherfucker.
Oh No.

38
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:29.550
And then I was doing,
I will never forget this.
Do you remember the channel?

39
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.930
The channel?
Yeah.
Channel a little rock,
rock and roll place.

40
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.500
So I'm opening for like these bands,
you know,

41
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:40.850
it was like that blues brothers scenes where the thrown shit at the cage.
Yeah.

42
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.820
So,
um,
barter,
he says,
you know,

43
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.050
point to people and we'll throw him out.
So I point to them,

44
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:52.950
but then they bring them out in the alley and beat the shit out of him,
you know,

45
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.830
but I,
I'm thinking because you're a martial artist.

46
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.370
So I kinda got this thing about people fighting and grown up in Charlestown.
And,

47
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.660
um,

48
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.660
I think back on certain incidents when I was starting doing standup and I was at

49
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:10.780
this place and calm AV and this guy stole one of my lines.

50
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.740
I know that you're bringing it to that,
right?
So he goes off stage.

51
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.620
I hit him with a right cross fucking cause over the tables.

52
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:19.550
And I'm thinking to myself,
my friend says,

53
00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:22.000
I thought you wanted to be Jonathan Winters and reds.

54
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.860
They don't do shit like that.

55
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.460
And then another time we were at the ground round in Brighton,

56
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.520
I'll never forget round round.
Yeah.
I'll never forget this Joe.

57
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.850
So I'm on the guy on before me.

58
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.530
The guy in the audience is throwing little ice things that I'm right.
So I said,

59
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.060
uh,
my opening line,
usually it's trying to get the audience to light cue,

60
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.900
you know,
or make them laugh or whatever.

61
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.070
So my opening line was like the first motherfucker that throws something at me,

62
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:52.450
I'm going to knock them out.
You know,

63
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:57.210
you're not exactly setting the stage for a hilarious comedy,
but uh,

64
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.570
you know,
what's that?
How'd that work out?
Terrible.
I bombed.
You know,

65
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.400
people think,
you know,
when you do this for a while,
you'd never bombed.
I mean,

66
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.820
there's no experience in life like bombing in Louisville,

67
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:13.990
Kentucky.
I'll never forget that.

68
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.140
And a guy comes up to me afterwards and he says,

69
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.490
and he was trying to make me feel good.
He says,
well,
I could tell by your tone,

70
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:23.990
your funny.
Ah,
you know,

71
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.710
but I'm doing shit like about subways and stuff.

72
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:30.340
They don't even know what they are.
Right.
So those early years,

73
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.890
there was like one,
um,
there wasn't even a comedy clubs.

74
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:39.690
So you just kinda did it.
I fell into it.
What year did you start?
Oh my God.

75
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.060
People,
you know,
people I am now at that point,
Joe,

76
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:47.290
what people come up to me and you know,
they say,
I'm so glad to see you.

77
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.910
I keep telling my husband,
I'm telling you he's not dead.
He is not tied.

78
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.430
So it's been like 30 or 40 years.
Um,

79
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.670
I don't remember the year,
but uh,
I remember those over the year.
You started?

80
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.110
No,
I don't remember.

81
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.730
<v 1>I started in [inaudible] 88.
And you were a legend.
I was allergic.</v>

82
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.690
But you were for sure.
Dude,

83
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:13.430
I watched you one night at Nick's comedy.
Stop kill so hard.
I start,

84
00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:16.730
I thought about quitting because I'd only been doing comedy like a year and I

85
00:05:16.731 --> 00:05:19.760
was like,
fuck this.
I could,
I gotta get the fuck out of,

86
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.300
you know what I had that feeling Richard Pryor's first performance film.

87
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.450
Do you remember that?
Yeah,
yeah.
Richard Pryor live.
We filled it in Long Beach.

88
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.530
I was,
I went to see that with Steven Wright and both of us walked out.
We said,

89
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:37.670
we don't even want to do this.
You know,
it was so intimidating.

90
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.250
I know that feeling.
Well,
you know,
we got that feeling a lot in Boston and uh,

91
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.380
as,
as a kid starting out there,
it was,
I tell everybody that I,

92
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.550
I stumbled into the,

93
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.410
the greatest comedy scene in the history of the known universe in 1988 when I

94
00:05:54.411 --> 00:05:58.910
started.
It was insane.
It was insane.
Dawn Gavin was in his prime.

95
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:02.630
You were in your prime.
Roger Sin.
I would watch these guys go up.

96
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.220
Um,
there was so many guys that were so fucking good.

97
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:08.720
Knox was killing back then.

98
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.950
There was so many guys that you would go any night you would go and watch some

99
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:17.630
of the best standup comedy on the planet.
It was,
it was amazing.
Mike Donovan,

100
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.520
Mike Donovan,
to this day,
people don't know who Mike Donovan is.

101
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.430
He was a fucking Johnny most,
you know who Johnny Mo.
Most people don't know.

102
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.040
10 by Rad side.

103
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.640
<v 0>Yeah,
he would do this long.
But you know what Johnny,</v>

104
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.490
but it's funny you say in your prime because,

105
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.000
and I've talked to people who've been at it longer than me.

106
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.620
This is one job where you can get better.
Yes,
you can get better,

107
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.690
more skillful,
you know?
But it's something that you,
you know,

108
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:49.901
you,

109
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:53.800
you just have to give the finger to the business because they're looking for the

110
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:56.790
fat guy,
the small guy,
the black guy that you know,
they're,

111
00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.980
they're always looking for something other than what you are.

112
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.070
So you do what you do.
Like you've done what you did

113
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.920
<v 1>business in terms of like movies and television shows.
Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.410
They will try to lure you away and they lure you away with money.

115
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.480
But the business has standup comedy is,

116
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.420
it's really about what you do in front of that microphone.
You know,

117
00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:16.640
how the audience responds on

118
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.910
<v 0>stage.
I followed a woman and uh,</v>

119
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.880
she had a lot of TV credits,
but she had no material and it was unbelievable.

120
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.060
You know,
you forget when you do something,
you forget.

121
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:30.760
It's like you're a trained fighter,
you're trank radio person.

122
00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:35.450
You forget that in order to do it,
you've developed a certain set of skills.
Yeah.

123
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.560
And like in Boston they have a St Patrick's day breakfast where the politicians

124
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:45.400
try to be funny and it's excruciating.
You know what I mean?

125
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.760
And you forget,
Oh yeah,
I do this all the time.

126
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:52.660
It'd be like me trying to give a speech before I came on the show,

127
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.700
I talked to Nick Depalo,
you know your buddy.
Sure.
And he says,
well,

128
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.590
Joe and I always talk about politics.
And I said,
well,
no,

129
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.960
nobody would help himself.
Nobody.

130
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.000
Nobody talks to me about Paula.
I'm just not that smart.
Good.

131
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:14.550
I'm done with politics.
I'm going to quit.
Yeah.
I want to talk about it.
You know,

132
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.010
where we are in this country now is like,
um,

133
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.100
well I,
I,
I kind of,
uh,

134
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.330
I don't like to not like someone because of what they believe.

135
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.230
So I just kinda do silly shit.
I was thinking the other day with the Democrats,

136
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.000
you know,
I'm gonna run,
I'm gonna run that,
but they got the moderate lane,

137
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:40.840
the Progressive Lane,
so I'm going to run in the breakdown lane.
You know,

138
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.410
it's just a silly little shit,
you know?
Uh,

139
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.640
I try to keep it upbeat,
whatever,
but I got into this,

140
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.920
I fell into this because I kept thinking I'm going to get an acting job and I

141
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:58.140
won't do stand up up.
This is gonna fuck an end at some point.

142
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.560
You know what I mean?
And I,
I have,
you know,

143
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.530
like people,
kids would,
will actually ask me for advice and I say,
advice,

144
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.700
are you shitting me?
I fell into this shit.
I expected it to end,
but he,
I say,

145
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:13.110
all right,
you want some advice?

146
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.180
Don't ever work at a place that's named after the guy.

147
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.240
Like if it's Vinnie's fucking pizza parlor,

148
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.260
a Joey shared whole Bobby's moneymaking piece of shit.

149
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.760
When it's named after the guide,
it's never enough.
You know Nick's comedy.
Stop.

150
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.570
Nick's.
Now I'm going to do something.
Feel okay.

151
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.020
We're going to play a little scene.
Okay.
Now you ask me.

152
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:41.610
Say is Nixa mafia joint is Nixa mafia joint.

153
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.380
Yeah.
Is this this next till around a hundred percent yeah.
Nick's is around.

154
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:53.880
Was it the same ownership and do you know that there isn't one inch of that

155
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:57.570
building that I didn't do coke,
cocaine.
I believe that it was.

156
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:02.430
It was really something.
I mean it was like,
I know that,
you know,

157
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:06.840
I lived in La many years ago and it's like I'm driving around and say,
oh,

158
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:11.130
I know that spot.
So with Nick's,
I know every spot in the building.
By the way,

159
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.320
I didn't know that this was a camp area.
Oh,
see all the campers?
Yeah.

160
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:18.420
Right out in front of you of the place.
They're everywhere.

161
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.850
They finally side streets where the cops won't kick them out.
Yeah.

162
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.920
And semi homeless people.
They're not homeless,
they just have mobile homes.

163
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.900
You know what it is that the homeless people here are so peaceful there like,
uh,

164
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.500
like the caravan,
you know,
they're just,
they don't bump change,

165
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:36.590
they don't do anything.
They just kind of walk around.
I'm,

166
00:10:36.591 --> 00:10:38.280
I'm sitting in front of your building here.

167
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:40.890
It was like a fashion show for the homeless.

168
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:45.120
One guy comes by with a buffalo bills jacket and the other guys then,
you know,

169
00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:49.710
and they just quietly talking to themselves,
some welcome gung back and you know,

170
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:52.590
it's freaking me out.
I've only been here 12 hours,
but

171
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:59.450
everybody is either really soft spoken or I'm losing my fucking hearing because

172
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.120
like,
even though I'm renting the car and the woman says,

173
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.950
teaching a Honda,
do you want us,
I said,
why?

174
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.940
What did you want a son?
That's what you know,
in Boston it'd be like,

175
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:14.670
what do you want for a cat?
You want to be out of graded.

176
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.910
It's like the noise pollution.
Well,

177
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:20.640
it's louder there and colder and people are angrier.

178
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.730
It's a different place out here.
It's just,
even the homeless people,

179
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:26.190
they don't have it so rough.
If you're going to be a homeless person,

180
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.780
this is the place to go.
People are very open minded.
It's relaxed,

181
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.600
it's warm.
I mean the cold as it gets,
it's like 40.

182
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.110
That's as cold as it ever gets.
Yeah.
But you know,

183
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.910
if you're giving advice to homeless people,
it's like,
like I was,

184
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.380
I was sitting in Westwood and a Starbucks.
Right.
And it's,

185
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.840
the guy was just sitting there,
you know,

186
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:52.310
and all these people are having their lattes and shit and he's just,
you know,

187
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.480
<v 2>you</v>

188
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.910
<v 0>know one of those crazy laughs,</v>

189
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.290
everybody's just gone along with their conversation,
you know,
the,
uh,

190
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.940
I don't know what to say about the,
about the homeless thing.

191
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.890
Have you ever been downtown?
Do you ever seen I might get,
Oh,

192
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.480
I myself was homeless when I was like 16.

193
00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:16.920
I was a hippie and his father passed away when I was 15 and it was a different

194
00:12:16.921 --> 00:12:20.820
time,
you know?
No,
I haven't been down.
So you were almost for like how long?

195
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.110
I was a hippy and it's different than being homeless,
but a couple of years.

196
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.980
Really.
Yeah.
I,
uh,
you know,

197
00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:31.440
the worst moment I was lying,

198
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:36.470
I was downstairs in this guy's house and I overheard his girlfriends saying no.

199
00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:43.590
He was saying it was girlfriend.
I don't know.
I keep asking the guy to leave,

200
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.870
but you know,
I was,
you know,
here's what happened to me,
Joe.

201
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.050
I've read Jack Kerouac on the road.
Okay.

202
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.350
So I wanted to beat Jack Carol whack and I wanted to be a writer.

203
00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.510
So I did everything that Carol.
I did except right.

204
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.320
You know,
it was living in YMCAs and drinking the wine and the whole thing,

205
00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:05.850
but it was a whole different country then.

206
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.450
Why didn't you start writing was one of those things like eventually you'll

207
00:13:09.451 --> 00:13:13.320
start writing or writing.
I wanted to be a writer.
I didn't want to fucking right.

208
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.120
You know what I mean?
Right.
Like you might need the hardest,

209
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.280
you don't want to paint and write.
Writing's the hardest job in the world.

210
00:13:20.281 --> 00:13:23.340
I don't know how people do it,
but we did this movie,

211
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.130
which I'd like to mention a bill Broaddus wrote this movie.

212
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.410
It's called Sweeney killing Sweeney and a,
you can get it on iTunes.

213
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.470
It's out right now,
preorder it,
when's it out?

214
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:38.290
It's going to be the middle of March,
but they can preorder it.
Okay.
But,
um,

215
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.200
this guy,
bill Broaddus wrote this script and I'd split my twentysomething movie.

216
00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:46.380
I've been in a lot,
done a lot of acting,
and I said,

217
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:51.410
this thing is so good and I want it to be able to get guys who I knew were

218
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:57.110
tremendously talented
to,
uh,

219
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.540
not be in these clubs.
You know?
Um,

220
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.730
it's very like demeaning sometimes,
you know,

221
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.410
for a guy who's really good at what he does and somebody like texting and you

222
00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:15.060
know,
all this bullshit.
Like I had a woman,
uh,
you know,

223
00:14:15.061 --> 00:14:18.630
usually I'm like okay about it,
you know,
I say,
okay,
listen,

224
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:23.070
you putting us out of work,
like in the future I'll text you a joke.

225
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.670
Then you text back,
lol,
you know,
silly little shit.

226
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.710
But I had one woman and she's the arrogance,
you know,
and it was a benefit to,

227
00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:32.970
and she's doing this and

228
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.820
she said [inaudible] and multitask.
So I said,
okay,

229
00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:40.290
so when I stick it up your ass,

230
00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:42.290
he's still going to be able to talk and everything.
You know what I mean?

231
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.040
So I see guys like Steven Wright,
who's in the movie,

232
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.310
Nick Depalo,
Bobby Slayton,
uh,
Jonathan Katz,

233
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:52.581
you know,

234
00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:57.140
all different styles of comedy to Lenny Clarke and Tony Vee and Frank Santa's

235
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:58.330
Raleigh.
I wanted to,

236
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.020
I wanted to see them get in something where we could really work,
you know,

237
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.430
and they all did it.

238
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:08.600
They were all in the movie and it was a fantastic experience.
Woman director,

239
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:13.280
Lisa Amala,
and it was just,
it was great.
It's the first time I produced a movie,

240
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:17.600
which is really hard.
What is it?
Uh,
like a dramatic movie?
Like what is it?

241
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.430
I'll tell you the plot briefly.
No,
I guess it's a comedy,
but it has its moments.

242
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:27.431
Is the HBO maybe or showtime or some company comes to town

243
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.030
and they want me,
but they say the characters,
the two local,

244
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.350
you've got to get rid of the character.
So then my character's try to kill me.

245
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.360
So I played five different parts.

246
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.200
Six like a Peter Sellers kind of thing from Dr. Strange,

247
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.830
like you're losing your mind,
like your characters are trying to figure that out.

248
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.890
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
You don't know whether I'm losing my mind.
Um,

249
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.080
but I had just come off the equalizer with Denzel Washington.

250
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.020
I was in that and uh,

251
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.230
that was an interesting experience because like,

252
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.270
I got this beard,
you know,
and I'm the director we did training day.

253
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:12.320
He said to me,
you know,
you got to save your beard.
And I said,

254
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.360
listen man,
I saw my face 25 years ago.
It scared the shit out of me.

255
00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:19.040
This beard is here for a reason.

256
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.550
I'm the most ugly motherfucker up of saying I can't do it.

257
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.400
Then he told me how much money I was going to make.
I said,

258
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:29.540
would you like me to shave my balls to similar experience?

259
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:32.600
Something about Mary.
So my scene,
if you haven't seen it,

260
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:36.440
Ben Stiller's things caught in the zipper.
So I,
uh,

261
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.910
I'm a cop.
I come in the window and Peter Directed,
I said,

262
00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:43.880
do you know I don't have to grab his Crotch,
right?
He says,
yeah,
you're an actor.

263
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:47.840
You got to grab it.
I said,
I don't have anything against it,
but I just,

264
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:51.980
I just can't do it.
Then he told me how was money I was going to make.
I said,

265
00:16:51.981 --> 00:16:54.240
you want me to just grab it cause I'll give him anyway.
Uh,

266
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.090
that was my experience with that.
Do you really feel

267
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.330
<v 1>demeaning work in clubs is,
I still enjoy working clubs.
I love it.</v>

268
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:07.130
I mean out here,
of course we do the comedy store all the time.
I do the Improv,

269
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:08.120
but I do clubs on the road

270
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.590
<v 0>are easy.
They're great.
They're there in the laugh.
You mean like shitty clubs?</v>

271
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.380
You mean like a bar gigs,
you know,
hit.

272
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.480
Here's the thing is when I'm on stage I'm okay,
you know,

273
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.220
but when I'm driving to fucking East Methuen elk club,

274
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.600
it bothers you that I get a fucking depression.
You wouldn't believe it.

275
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:36.030
You start to feel old in the day.
Like driving to those gigs was awesome.

276
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.210
Yeah.
Right.
Like something shifts.
Like what is it that shifts?
Is it,

277
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.460
is it in your own head?
Is it,

278
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:44.760
is it just that you've done too many of them know and I think shifts is you

279
00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:45.600
stopped drinking.

280
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.330
<v 1>Ah,</v>

281
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.540
<v 0>I've been sober 26 years.
That's the problem.
That's the problem.</v>

282
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.900
Yeah.
I'd say to my kept drinking my career would be through the roof,
you know.

283
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.070
Um,
no,
there are great clubs.
Giggles is a great club.

284
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.870
Greg Club route one on so good pizza too.
And good pizza.
And I'll do a theater.

285
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:08.410
I love that.
Uh,

286
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.080
I'm just giving you the other side of the story because you know,

287
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:17.010
people do get into this and they don't have an idea of what the life is like.

288
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.971
You know what I mean?

289
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:22.530
To be on the road and like a lot of my friends and now doing cruise ships,

290
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:27.090
those are depressing.
You're trapped and if you eat shit on a cruise ship,
yeah,

291
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.970
you,
you're stuck with those people for seven days.
Well that's,

292
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:30.930
that's the problem.

293
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:35.760
And they keep coming up to your URL for you personally ruined our whole

294
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.470
vacation.
We're from Ohio.
We had never even seen the ocean.
You'll ruin debt.

295
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.780
And then they'll say,
here,
this is true.
You,
they'll say,
oh,

296
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:50.340
you stay on the ship.
No,
actually I swim next to the ship.

297
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.490
Then when we're 150 miles out in the shark infested water,

298
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:57.360
they scooped me up until a few stupid jokes.
Then they throw me overboard.

299
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.380
You know,
I got fired from a cruise ship

300
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.680
for the weirdest per religious joke.
And uh,
you know,
I said this,

301
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.160
this dumb joke about Mitt.
I like Mitt Romney because it's hard.

302
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:14.670
Being a Mormon in Massachusetts is always just me and met.

303
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.570
I thought I was Mormon.
My father kept saying,
you're a moron.

304
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.220
So silly little joke.
And they,

305
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.950
that's what they complained about you for that.
They complained about,

306
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.940
I never fit in any way with those cruise ships.
You know,
it's,

307
00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:34.210
it's really good if you,
if you are an active alcoholic,
you'll knock.

308
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.040
It's wonderful.
Or if you're addicted to food.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

309
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.340
The lunch buffet,
the breakfast buffet,
the midnight buffet.
I know.

310
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:48.520
It's like you,
you go on,
you look like a normal human being.

311
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.790
You get off the ship,
you'll like waddling.
Yeah.
There's a lot buddy.

312
00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:55.170
And they manufactured so fun.
It's like,

313
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.080
I love your warehouse here and everything,

314
00:19:58.081 --> 00:20:01.110
and you know what I like about it's quiet.
You know,
there's a lot of these gyms,

315
00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:03.460
sound,
sound and these cruise ships,

316
00:20:03.461 --> 00:20:07.260
you can't even go to the pool without hearing eighties disco.
You know,

317
00:20:07.261 --> 00:20:10.140
it's like this thing.
Have a good time.
If you're not having a good time,

318
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.070
there's something fucked up about you,
you know,
have a good time.
Well,

319
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:16.980
I think what they're trying to do,
activity,
activity,
activity,

320
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.490
give people something to fill their time with when they're stuck on a floating

321
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.410
vessel.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm not interested.
I mean,
I still love clubs.

322
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.800
I still enjoy going to clean.
You know,
what's great in a club.

323
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.860
I probably overstated the other one,

324
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:35.520
but I'll tell you what does shift this when people are there to see you,

325
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.310
that's good.
Yeah.

326
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:43.080
That's a nice thing because then you're actually able to make people feel good

327
00:20:43.081 --> 00:20:46.770
and in service.
But I've always had the same problem,
Joe,

328
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.573
is

329
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.620
when people try to help you by heckling or whatever and they think,
you know,

330
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:58.030
this is the help or whatever.
I,
it's,
it's like,
uh,
you know,

331
00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:02.410
you're a fighter.
You,
you feel that temporary come up,
you know,

332
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.800
when it comes up quick and you've got to,
you got to contain it and yakked and,

333
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.110
but like in real life,
I wouldn't want to know those people.
They,
yeah.

334
00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:16.030
So every job has the timing.
Yeah.
And I just feel like,
you know,

335
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:19.570
you prepare this material and you've,
you've,
uh,
worked on it.

336
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:23.140
You want to give it to people.
Yeah.
But I'm not complaining.

337
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:27.760
I made my living out of this,
you know,
so I mean,
it's just,

338
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.420
you want to be realistic.
Like on somebody's kid asked you,

339
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.940
you know,
what is it like,
you know,
you know what,
you know,

340
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.560
an audience I hate is an open mic audience.
Why?
Cause the other comedians,

341
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.620
they're really tense.
You know what I mean?

342
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.670
The really fucking tense because they're thinking that it's like an audition,

343
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.660
right?
The nervous.
Yeah.
So you feel it in here,
you'd feel in the air man.

344
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.490
<v 1>Yeah.
But if you can go up and be smooth,</v>

345
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:57.340
I remember teddy bears are on going up at an open mic night.
There's another one.

346
00:21:57.341 --> 00:22:01.370
I wonder,
stop too.
In comedy,
when Teddy was in his prime,

347
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.570
when I first started in 1988 the first night I ever went on,

348
00:22:04.571 --> 00:22:06.160
Jonathan Katz was hosting it,

349
00:22:06.161 --> 00:22:10.660
stitches and a teddy went on and did a set and I was like,
good Lord.

350
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.520
His fucking timing is material.
Everything was so sharp and so good.

351
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:19.170
It just seems so unattainable.
It seems so out of reach,
you know?

352
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.660
So that was the thing about open mic nights in Boston,

353
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:26.060
like pros would stop in it,
stop it and let you know how it really should

354
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.943
<v 0>be gone.</v>

355
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.140
While I was at the comedy store when Richard Pryor was working shit out and he'd

356
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:36.280
start on a Monday and he'd go up,
he'd bomb.
Didn't matter.

357
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:40.300
He's working the material.
A week later he had this unbelievable set.
Yeah,

358
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:43.150
I worked with George,
Carl and I worked with Rodney Dangerfield.

359
00:22:43.151 --> 00:22:48.151
I work best part about being in this business for me is the people that I've

360
00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:52.780
worked with.
Just meeting them and seeing them and seeing them,

361
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.480
seeing people great at what they do.
You know?

362
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:59.280
I'm sure you feel that way with the MMA,
whatever,
you know?
Sure.
Yeah,
we'll

363
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.560
<v 1>comedy as well.
You know what I mean?
It's,
um,</v>

364
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:06.060
it's been amazing watching people develop their acts and know and just to know

365
00:23:06.061 --> 00:23:10.740
that that's,
that's a process that we all have to go through.
You know,
the,
the,

366
00:23:10.741 --> 00:23:14.490
the,
the process of creating material,
it's never gets any easier.

367
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.610
It's always hard.
I mean,
to this day,
when you're working out new material,

368
00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:18.570
it's probably weird.
Right.

369
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.940
<v 0>It's funny that material seems to come to me and now it's,</v>

370
00:23:22.941 --> 00:23:27.470
I'm at that point where it just sort of events,
right?
It,
you know,

371
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.600
Bob Kraft and the whole thing and,
you know,
but here's what I don't like about,

372
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.500
this is sounding like a bitch session right now.
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah.

373
00:23:36.501 --> 00:23:38.990
We're just talking shop.
Okay.
Uh,

374
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.490
what I don't like is it's Trump all day and then all the late nights shows it's

375
00:23:43.491 --> 00:23:47.510
more Trump.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
There's no escape from this.
Well,

376
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.390
that's what they think people want to hear.
Yeah.

377
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.310
I don't think it's that creative though.

378
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.640
<v 1>It gets a little tiresome.
Yeah.
I think especially after two years,</v>

379
00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.300
you got something really funny.
You say,
I always keep the door open.

380
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.440
Sometimes you got something really fun.
You say,
you never know.
You know the,

381
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.910
the INA here,
stormy Daniels is doing stand up now.
You know,

382
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:12.590
that's another thing.
People fucking,

383
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.790
you know what I mean?
It's probably a good five minutes of material if that.

384
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.773
And she's at,

385
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.450
<v 0>you know,
they were guys,
um,</v>

386
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:27.230
I think it was Richard Lewis and Dennis Miller and the couple of other guys came

387
00:24:27.241 --> 00:24:31.590
through next and they didn't want to close.
You know,
they follow me.

388
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.600
Of course.
I've watched some of those sets.
And then I said,
uh,
one of them said,

389
00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:39.600
you know,
I'm gonna can I middle?
I said,

390
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:44.100
sure that I'm going to get your money though,
right?
It's an all no.
I said,
well,

391
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:48.890
what the fuck?
Good headline.
Or you know,
well done.
I mean,
I followed,
uh,

392
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.430
Jay Leno at the,
uh,
at the Improv.
You know,
you kind of follow people.

393
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.130
<v 1>Yeah,
you got to follow people.
But in all fairness,
uh,</v>

394
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.580
what I used to see,
and I saw this many times at Nick's,

395
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.870
was some poor fuck who had like a couple of TV credits who thought he was hot

396
00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:10.871
shit and they would go on and they would headline at Nick's and they would stack

397
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.780
the deck and it would be horrendous.

398
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:20.110
It was you and Lenny and fucking Knox and all these savages would go up and

399
00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:26.630
Boston style comedy where there's no breaks.
It's just fucking Bang,
Bang.
Yeah,

400
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:30.710
right.
Yeah.
There's a style of comedy,
like a,
Hey,
I know you worked all day.

401
00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:32.290
You don't want to hear anybody bullshit and up here.

402
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.550
But he talks fast and they're fucking funny.

403
00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:38.570
And Gavin would go up and murder and then these poor bastards would go up after

404
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:41.570
them and just these people with their TV credits,

405
00:25:41.571 --> 00:25:45.080
you would see them just be within five minutes,
they'd be lost.

406
00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:46.730
It'd be very observational.

407
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.290
Have you ever gone to an airport or they just don't expect that they would see

408
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:55.280
three worldclass headliners do 15 minutes.

409
00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:00.380
<v 0>I'll tell you a funny story about next.
Sam Kennison,</v>

410
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:05.450
right?
He,
you know,
he had been up for a few days obviously,

411
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.930
but anyway,
you know what I mean?
You know the era.

412
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.510
So I said [inaudible] and Sam was a good friend of mine.

413
00:26:14.511 --> 00:26:19.460
He's a nice guy.
When he was straight,
he had a dark side,
you know,
like we all do.

414
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:24.800
But I said,
Sam,
this isn't,
this isn't la.
You know,
these guys,

415
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:29.180
you know Joey the job and bully the frond and fault can,
you know what I mean?

416
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.800
This sitting up front and he's,
you know how Sam was?
And I said,

417
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.010
Sam,
I'm telling you these are the wrong guys to piss off.

418
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:42.140
They had to fire him because you know those guys,
they'll kill it.

419
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:46.840
They don't,
they don't have any sense of humor.
No.
No.
Well,
not only that,

420
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.640
you don't want to be fucked with.
Yeah.
Boston's.
So one of the weird,

421
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.110
some of the weirdest people in terms of like the way the rest of the world
works,

422
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.180
that they're ready to fight.

423
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.420
There's a lot of people that are ready to fight though,
ready to fight you.

424
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.800
They're not going to shoot you or stab you.

425
00:27:01.801 --> 00:27:03.410
They're going to beat the fuck out of you,
right?

426
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.080
They're got to do it right then and there and it'll,
it'll happen anywhere.

427
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:10.770
And it'll happen at a restaurant or happen at a bar is one of the last places

428
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.371
that we,

429
00:27:11.371 --> 00:27:14.810
when we used to towards him ready to break out what you would see real fist

430
00:27:14.811 --> 00:27:18.100
fights like all the time.
Like Ari Shaffir used to say that like,
um,

431
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.700
me and him while we were leaving Faneuil hall once and there was a fucking bra

432
00:27:21.701 --> 00:27:24.240
breaking out in front of this Mcdonald's and he's like,

433
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.120
you fucking people are savages here.
I'm like,
I'm telling you,

434
00:27:27.121 --> 00:27:31.920
it's a different kind of human.
It's cold for too much.
The women are assholes.

435
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.750
Like it's the men are assholes.

436
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:38.280
Everybody's ready to fight and everyone's drunk to different kind of place.
Well,

437
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.640
you know the,
I grew up in Charleston,
right?

438
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:45.900
They did a movie about the town and all that bullshit.
It's a bullshit movie.

439
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:50.820
But anyway,
I grew up over there and you didn't have to win,

440
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.170
but you had a fight.

441
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.630
And my record was probably like two wins and 30 losses.

442
00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:01.890
And then to,
you know,
there's a lot of draws because they break it up right away,

443
00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:06.540
you know.
But there were actual fist fights.
Yeah.
No.

444
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.810
One time I'm in the projects is kid Davey ladder.

445
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.900
He did the one thing you're not supposed to do.

446
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:17.790
He kicked me in the balls and then everybody jumped and beat the shit out of

447
00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:18.624
him.

448
00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:24.000
One thing about kicking people in the balls to don't have a mess.
Yeah.

449
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.800
Cause then the other guy gets very mad.

450
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.360
It doesn't work as good as people think it does.
Really.
It hurts.
Now.

451
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:35.010
Were you in street fights?
I started fighting to avoid street fights.

452
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.090
I know I wanted to fight like as a,

453
00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:41.220
as an amateur like in martial arts tournaments because I was scared of street

454
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:45.380
fights
seem to me,
it seemed to me to,

455
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.690
I'm frightened and he fucking terrifying.
You never know what's going to happen.

456
00:28:48.691 --> 00:28:51.160
People follow you around.
You never know when it's going to.

457
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.480
I was scared of fighting.
That's why I got into it.
I was,
I just,
I did not like,

458
00:28:55.481 --> 00:28:59.250
do you remember that day when you were in grammar school?

459
00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.550
And a kid offers you out?
Yeah.

460
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.450
At eight 30 in the morning and still thinking about it all day early in the

461
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:09.210
morning till three in the afternoon.
What's that running down your pants.

462
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:12.480
Did you just shit yourself here and then you're in the school yard and they're

463
00:29:12.481 --> 00:29:14.940
all circling around you,
you know,
and it's this whole thing.

464
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:17.730
But my father is to train fighters,

465
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.410
boxers over at the new guard and Jim and me and my brother,

466
00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:27.411
we would get into terrible fights and my father never taught us how to throw a

467
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.030
shot or anything.
It just gives us these big,

468
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:34.560
enormous fricking gloves and they just let you go to war on each other.
Yeah,

469
00:29:34.561 --> 00:29:39.480
it was weird.
Why did he teach you?
Probably tired from teaching people all day.

470
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.770
Yeah,
maybe.
Yeah,
it probably will.

471
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:46.090
Maybe he wanted us to beat the shit out of each other.
You know,
it,
I don't know.

472
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:51.250
That's a good question.
I'm not going to figure it out on your own.
Yeah.
Or it's,

473
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:54.700
you know,
I remember coming back and,
um,

474
00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:00.100
this kid beat the shit out of me.
Bobby Buckley and my father said,

475
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:02.320
what are you doing at home?
You got to go back out there.
What?

476
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.820
I'm going to go back out and fight him against fucking all right.
Yeah.
But I,

477
00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:07.654
you know,

478
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.090
there's a lot of different ways to be like in Charlestown grown up.
I mean,
I was,

479
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.770
I grew up with some guys that were like unbelievable.
Like,
you know,
there's a,

480
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:22.600
there's a whole moral thing maybe,
or a social thing about say robbing a bank.

481
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.870
I mean,
would that ever fricking cross your mind?
No,

482
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.230
but that's a Charlestown thing.
That's one thing that is true about that movie,

483
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:33.010
that town,
but,
but what I was in awe of people that would do it.
It's like,

484
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.440
where do you get the boss that you know?

485
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.830
And I'll never forget this friend of mine,

486
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.980
Joey Rocco's no longer with us.
So I see him up at government.

487
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.770
Sunbury remember government center?
Yeah.

488
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:50.080
So I see him up there and he's got like his lunch and um,
I said,
Joe,

489
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:54.640
how you doing?
And he's kind of blew me off.
Then I see him a week later.
He says,

490
00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:58.870
Hey,
swings,
what's up?
I said,
what's up?
You blew me off a week ago.

491
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.030
He said,
I'm so sorry.

492
00:31:01.031 --> 00:31:05.930
I was waiting to Rob Crimson travel and I had my gun there and I was into cars

493
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.150
interrupting his work.

494
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.500
So he came into Nick's comedy stop to 400 people.

495
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.400
I did fantastic.
I was like practically a standing ovation,
whatever.

496
00:31:15.401 --> 00:31:20.110
So Joe's in the audience,
right.
And I,
I,
so I talked to him afterwards.

497
00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:24.520
So there's a number of things he could say like,
Jeez,
I liked his show.

498
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.310
I didn't like your show.
Good for you getting out of Charlestown.

499
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:32.560
He came at this look.
I was like,
wow,
it's got to be a lot of money in here.

500
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:36.190
I said,
you think I'm here to case the joint?

501
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:39.280
It was unbelievable.

502
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:43.150
We used to a part of the thing that bugged shots down growing up with see how to

503
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:45.760
shoplift that was,
did you do that when you were a kid?

504
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.420
Like I got caught shoplifting candy.
Yeah,
you were bad.

505
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:54.190
You probably was terrified.
Right?
Again,
I got brought into a manager's office,

506
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:58.870
I think it was 12 oh yeah,
I got in trouble.
I was terrible too.
I was so paranoid.

507
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:00.700
But anyway,

508
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.700
there was a department store called Jordan Marsh and my job was to catch a

509
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:12.580
football.
They'd throw me the football,
I'd catch it and run down Tremont street.

510
00:32:12.581 --> 00:32:17.380
So we've just,
you know,
stolen a football.
Right.
So that's,
that was the Gig.

511
00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.930
So one time I'm up there and

512
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:26.170
saw the kid says to me,
pick up the end of this [inaudible] I said,
what?
He said,

513
00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:29.770
grab the end of the Cannula,
still in a fucking canoes.

514
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:34.660
What's all walking down?
Washington student Boston with a canoe right now.

515
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.560
I don't know where you're from,
but it's not a big item.

516
00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:40.070
And Charlestown canoes and

517
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.280
<v 1>the projects,
you know what I mean?
It's like not something you can,</v>

518
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.480
you couldn't fence it.
Did you take it to the Charles River?

519
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.350
I don't know what we did with it.
Like you do try to,

520
00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.570
you end up either giving it away or selling it for like three bucks.

521
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.780
And that was back then,
that the river was very,
very dirty.

522
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.810
Like I used to swim in that.
Oh,
that was the,
uh,

523
00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:04.280
what we used to call the oilies because there was so much oil in it.
Yeah.

524
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:07.070
And better now though,
right?
Didn't they cleaned it up a little bit.

525
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:11.810
That's what they say.
You know,
they made,
they've cleaned up the whole of Boston.

526
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:16.460
I don't recognize boss anymore.
They got this pot of Boston called the sea port.

527
00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:20.540
It's all these big buildings.
It's like fricking Dubai,
you know,
there's no kids,

528
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:22.640
there's no neighborhoods,
there's no characters.

529
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.050
It's all just gentrified and a very rich people now.
Right.
Yeah.

530
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.920
I apparently,
yeah.
What does it like bankers like who's got all that money?
I,

531
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:35.210
that's what I keep asking myself.
Who does have all this money?
Yeah.

532
00:33:35.211 --> 00:33:39.080
Boston is definitely,
but la is the same way,
you know?
Yeah.
All,

533
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:43.940
it's all money.
Yeah.
But there's normal neighborhoods in la.
Look around here.

534
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:48.590
Like you could like woodland hills,
like wander round West hills,
like,

535
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.520
yeah,
studio city.
There's normal neighborhoods as regular houses.

536
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.190
There's plenty of what,
you know,
normal spots.

537
00:33:55.191 --> 00:33:58.580
What I've noticed though is I was in Portland,

538
00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:02.090
Oregon and there was a whole like city of homeless people.
Yeah.

539
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.640
In La there's just sparklies like Jimmy's on top of an ice cream,

540
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:11.870
you know,
you got to go to skid row skid,
you'd never seen anything like it.

541
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.840
Skim Rosa homeless city.
It's insane.

542
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:17.190
There's thousands of homeless people wandering through the streets.
They,

543
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.530
they've taken over entire neighborhoods.
Like it is,
it is bizarre.

544
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.110
It's bizarre.
We used to film fear factor downtown.

545
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.380
We would a film it at these abandoned warehouses.

546
00:34:27.381 --> 00:34:31.340
They would rent them out and we'd,
you know,
throw people off the roof and shit.

547
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.870
And uh,
we,

548
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.100
there was this one area where you would go where,

549
00:34:37.101 --> 00:34:41.150
and I'm not exaggerating,
there might be a thousand people on this block,

550
00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:42.560
like a concert just let out.

551
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.160
Like they were having a homeless concert and they're all just wandering around.

552
00:34:46.161 --> 00:34:49.750
There's needles everywhere and tents and garbage in the streets and,

553
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.390
and people just shuffling around,
walking back and forth.
So there's,

554
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.420
I guess there's some homeless centers,
you know,

555
00:34:56.421 --> 00:35:00.290
where people can go and get food and things and shelter.
You know,

556
00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.580
I'm starting to wonder like what's wrong with me with you because I seem to

557
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:12.740
focus on that.
You know,
every city I go to I say,
wow.

558
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.850
It seems like there's more and more homeless people and other people are saying,

559
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:18.440
oh,
let's go to the freedom trail.
Let's,

560
00:35:18.441 --> 00:35:22.280
let's look at the beauty of San Francisco.
Look,
I shitting on the street.

561
00:35:22.281 --> 00:35:24.320
To me that's like unusual.

562
00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:28.190
San Francisco has a app where you could find where the people are shitting.

563
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.660
They have not jokes.
Right.
Hold it up before.
Yeah.

564
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.840
There's so many people shitting in San Francisco on the street San,

565
00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:40.530
I'm my friend Jake shields got a photo of this guy taking his shit right in

566
00:35:40.531 --> 00:35:42.990
front of them.
Just shit spraying out of his ass.

567
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:46.350
Went under the street from the sidewalk into the street.
No,

568
00:35:46.351 --> 00:35:49.110
I don't know what I mean.
They just do it in front of everybody.

569
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.910
I don't know why people,

570
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.250
you know who's sick or the person with the APP with a guy taking a dump.
Well,

571
00:35:56.251 --> 00:36:00.030
I think there's a certain open mindedness that San Francisco has a lot of very

572
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:02.550
progressive open minded people.
Which is good,

573
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:07.710
but the problem is it opens the door for some ridiculous stuff like people

574
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:10.730
shitting on the street.
There's too many homeless people too.

575
00:36:10.731 --> 00:36:14.550
They're too open minded and to liberal.
Look at that.
That's the,

576
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.260
that's the shit map.
That's where all the people are shooting.

577
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:23.540
That's a dark puddle of shed where so many people were shitting on the street in

578
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:27.690
that area and I don't even know how they cleaned that up.
I mean,
what do they do?

579
00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:31.020
They scrape it hose a street down.
Is that an extra,
is that,

580
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.140
are they creating jobs?
Let's look at it on the positive side.
God,

581
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.850
maybe those homeless people reminds me of the parades when they,
to the horses.

582
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.770
There's nothing you could do either.
I mean,
what are you going to do?

583
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.480
Are you going to give these people a place to live?

584
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:45.520
You got to give these people food.
You going to give these people money.
There's,

585
00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.460
it's not going to fix their mental illness.

586
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.460
That's what people don't understand about a lot of these folks.

587
00:36:50.461 --> 00:36:53.700
It's not that they run on bad luck,
that's they're not on bad luck.

588
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:54.990
They're mentally ill,
they have,

589
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.710
their brain's not working correctly and if they don't want to be on medication

590
00:36:58.711 --> 00:37:01.140
and they don't have any way to turn,
they don't have anywhere to go,

591
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.740
they're going to stay there and they don't have anywhere to shit.
And you know,

592
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.840
they just want to use this tree.

593
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:09.870
And I don't know if they could put up Porta potties and say for homeless folks

594
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.620
only and what can they do?
We're not going to solve that on the Joe Rogan show.

595
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.510
I'm an optimistic person,
stays with the,
you never know.

596
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.540
I was thinking of myself,
he just,
you know,
just shitting your pants.
Um,

597
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.920
so anyway,
we've covered that.

598
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:29.450
What else is the problem that we have in this country?
This is one,

599
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.780
a lot of the Pr,
I always look at it,

600
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.730
everybody's so pissed off in this country because everything's going well,

601
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:41.370
so much going well in terms of the economy,
in terms of safety,

602
00:37:41.371 --> 00:37:42.200
in terms of that cause.

603
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.950
So people are focusing on other things to be mad at when you away from war to,

604
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:49.220
you know,
like you know when,

605
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.350
when when you don't have to worry about as much violence.

606
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.790
People concentrate on microaggressions.
That's one of the things.
It does happen.

607
00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.920
There's definitely problems in this country for sure,

608
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:03.750
but I think that part of the outrage is that people are,
it's recreational.

609
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.410
They're looking to be outraged about things because there's no real problems.

610
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:12.060
Wow.
When there's real problems,
people focus on,
you know,
when there's,
you know,

611
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.960
you have to really worry about violence or you have to really worry about
health.

612
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:19.350
People focus on,
on,
you know,
the good things in life.

613
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.890
People are only happy if they have a certain amount of adversity that they have

614
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.740
to deal with when there's less and less adversity,
I find,

615
00:38:25.741 --> 00:38:29.550
I find that people become more and more outraged and easier.
They're outraged.

616
00:38:29.551 --> 00:38:34.380
It's small minor details or the denying that people should be allowed to just

617
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:36.100
fuck up and make some mistakes here

618
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.590
<v 0>and there.
They,
they concentrate on those mistakes.</v>

619
00:38:38.591 --> 00:38:39.550
Like it's the end of the world.

620
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:42.460
This person should be ostracized from society and kicked out.

621
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:45.820
And this is the end.
Well,
going back to politics,

622
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:50.160
if you get into discussion with somebody you agree with [inaudible],

623
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.800
you still end up being pissed off because you're pissed off at the other side.

624
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:58.930
Or the other political thing is you're angry at each other for different points

625
00:38:58.931 --> 00:39:02.050
of view.
Yup.
But I always think to myself

626
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:08.290
as I'm sure you do,
it's an amazing place to be.

627
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:11.890
We have enough food.
We have enough water.
I myself,

628
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:15.880
I think life is two things.
Life is a gift and life is short,

629
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:18.640
you know,
and the purpose of life,

630
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.080
my opinion is to develop whatever talents you have and then share it.

631
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:28.560
So I couldn't agree more.
What,
what a,
what a place to do it.
[inaudible]

632
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:32.440
place in the world to do it.
You'll have the opportunity,
you know,
and uh,

633
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.240
but you know,
it's like we,
I think we do tend to complicate things.

634
00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:41.410
What I don't like is when we let other things get between us as human beings,

635
00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:45.580
because it's,
it's a whole,
that's why I like Buddhism,
for example,

636
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.930
because you're never going to see outside of rare exceptions,

637
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:54.190
a Buddhist country is never going to win bait and other country because the

638
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:57.670
whole principle is mindfulness.
In other words,
it's all within you,

639
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.360
so you don't have to push your beliefs on other people.

640
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:06.400
Like I have a lot of friends who become Christians,
which is great for them,

641
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:10.970
but they always put you on a,
I always feel like I've put in a box.
Yeah.

642
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.960
Like have you accepted Jesus?

643
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.500
You know how the fuck you gonna answer that.
You know what I mean?

644
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:22.150
I'm not yet see,
not yet.
Keep,
keep conveys it's on the way.
Yeah,

645
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.470
that's right.
It's like one of those unanswerable things,
you know?
Well,

646
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.880
it's also a thing where people can hold Muslims,
Christians,
it seems like they,

647
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.610
they believe that,
you know,

648
00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:37.210
people have to hear this great message and if they don't hear it,

649
00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.090
shove it down your fucking throat.

650
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.370
I think half of them don't even think you have to hear it.

651
00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:44.620
They just want to have it over you,
that Dave,

652
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.950
they've accepted Jesus into their life and you haven't,
so they win.

653
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.160
There's a lot of that.
There's a lot of that.
I mean,

654
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:55.750
you see so many hypocritical Christians that don't really follow,

655
00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.070
turn the other cheek.
They don't really treat everyone as if it's their brother.

656
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:04.270
They don't really do that.
They don't really,
they don't really feel that way.

657
00:41:04.271 --> 00:41:07.560
They're not,
they're not out there.
Well that's cause that's,

658
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:12.040
that that standard is like,
you're going to be Jesus.
Right.
You know,
I mean,

659
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:15.550
Jesus Christ.
I mean,
you know what I mean?
No Pun intended,

660
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:20.190
but who's cooking live up to that?
So if someone can,
but so there's people,

661
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.900
there aren't,
no,

662
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.770
I got people that processize anything.
It's like,
it's very,
uh,

663
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.570
you know,
it's like,
why doesn't get away from me?
Yeah.
Well,
it's a,

664
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:35.550
it's a shitty psychological tactic.
Doesn't work.
Yeah.

665
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:38.420
It's just makes people,
it's,
we talk about,

666
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.940
it's like when you try to get people to do things,

667
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:44.630
they're less likely to do those things as soon as you are angry at them,

668
00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:46.850
but they're not doing it,
they're going to go the other way.

669
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.500
People don't like being told what to do.
Well,

670
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:51.950
it's just like if somebody wants to get sober,
right.
Right.

671
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:58.520
If you,
if they are ready.
I work in jail.
That's one of my part time jobs.

672
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.930
So what are you doing?
Jails.
I do substance abuse stuff in jails.

673
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.850
So if you,
um,
if they're ready,

674
00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:13.040
everything you say you're like a guru.
If they're not ready,

675
00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.380
it doesn't matter what you say.
Right.
So I do groups in jail.
I teach meditation.

676
00:42:18.381 --> 00:42:22.100
I also teach a goal setting.
I've been doing it about six years.

677
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:25.880
I've been in the field of substance abuse for awhile.
And um,

678
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:30.050
it's very rewarding.
It's not,
you know,
you don't make any money,

679
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:33.430
but it balances the life.
Yeah.
You know,

680
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.970
I don't want to sit around all day.
Most comedians,
that's what they have to do.

681
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.260
You know,
they work at night.
So yeah.
I work at Plymouth jail.

682
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:46.760
How often you do it?
Uh,
two or three days a week.
Yeah.

683
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:50.120
That's good.
So it's not,
not every day now.

684
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.900
And I take the summers off too because it's intense.
Yeah.
I mean,
I,

685
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:57.650
I've had groups,
you know,
I had one guy,

686
00:42:57.651 --> 00:43:01.940
he came in and you'd do it.
You'd do divide people,

687
00:43:01.941 --> 00:43:05.850
ethnically white guy,
but six,
six big fucking,
you know,

688
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:10.430
did state time.
It was all jacked and he's wired.

689
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:16.550
And uh,
he started complaining about the place and uh,
I said,
hey,
this isn't,

690
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.850
I teach them to breathe,
you know,
like that guy hops you had on your show.

691
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:24.110
But I teach them a different method.
It's just you breathe in for,
you,

692
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:26.810
hold it for you,
let it out.
It's just a calming breath.

693
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:33.560
So anyway,
this guy,
I said,
hey,
it's places in a hotel.
He stands over.
He says,

694
00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:37.580
yeah,
I know.
It's not how I said,
let's do our breathing.

695
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:42.170
Let's relax.
But a lot of guys,

696
00:43:42.171 --> 00:43:43.340
they can't see,

697
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.300
they can't see themselves.
They can't see contradictions.

698
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.600
I,
one guy,
he was,
it was a Muslim,
right?
So I said,

699
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:57.200
so you guys pray like five times a day.

700
00:43:57.201 --> 00:44:01.110
How do you know when to pray and listen to this Joe?
He says,
uh,

701
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.090
the guys said,
well,
if I'm doing a heist in the afternoon,

702
00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.010
you know I'm gonna miss that prayer.

703
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:12.370
You don't see any contract can amazing the guy,

704
00:44:12.531 --> 00:44:16.460
the big giant guy that was angry or did he have a certain amount of time before

705
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:20.270
he got out or was he in it for life?
No,
no,
he was,

706
00:44:20.271 --> 00:44:25.250
he was on his way out.
He was coming close.
That's when guys get the most anxious.

707
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.280
How long have you been in four.
He was in for about 17 years.

708
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.410
It's a very polite society.
Really?
Prison society.

709
00:44:32.411 --> 00:44:37.020
Society's very polite because every little thing,
just picture your,

710
00:44:37.021 --> 00:44:40.890
you're trapped with all these other guys and a lot of mental health.

711
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:45.660
She had a lot of stuff,
but every little thing has picked up on and reacted to,

712
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:46.471
you know,

713
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:50.730
it's like that scene in heat between Dinero Pachino where they're just reacting

714
00:44:50.731 --> 00:44:54.540
to each other.
So you said,
can you please pass the salt?

715
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.380
Pass it because at any minute,
that's what I tried to teach us.

716
00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:02.390
It's about impulse control.
Any minute.
And I think it happened.
Yeah.
You know.

717
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:03.570
Well,
you know,

718
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.680
you're dealing with a bunch of very impulsive people that also have a very short

719
00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:12.030
fuse there.
There used to violence.
Wow.
This is one way of acting out.

720
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:16.320
So what I say to them is,
I have the same thing,
but it's not through violence.

721
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.640
For me,
it's like texting or something,
you know,
I react or I drank,

722
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:25.240
you know,
so it's,
it's about stepping back.
Dang Gum.
Yeah.

723
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:29.760
It's hard when you get tripped up,
but the mind listens to the breath.

724
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.450
That's the key.
Rather than going up in your mind,

725
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.420
take that breath and you know,
like when something's happening,

726
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:44.190
like a car crash or something.
First impulses,
hold your breath.

727
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.420
Don't hold your breath,
let your breath out.
I mean,
a lot of traditions have this,

728
00:45:48.421 --> 00:45:52.710
you know,
Tai Chi,
you know,
[inaudible] Yoga.

729
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.520
So yeah,
breathing is critical.
It's everything.
When Wim Hoff teaches it,
you know,

730
00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.880
if you follow those methods,
you can,

731
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:03.420
you can really change your physiological state.
You can,

732
00:46:03.421 --> 00:46:07.230
you can get out of a lot of things.
It can get you through a lot of things.

733
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.100
You know the thing that I don't buy those,
that fucking cold water.

734
00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:14.280
I don't want to go onto the Arctic like him.
Holy Shit.

735
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:18.200
It's because you live in Boston.
You get God algae to call it.

736
00:46:18.201 --> 00:46:23.010
My friend Mark Grata.
He's ready to go.
He's done.
He's been there for too long.

737
00:46:23.011 --> 00:46:26.610
I know a lot about this weekend.
A lot of people they get like that,

738
00:46:26.611 --> 00:46:29.800
but it hit the wall,
you know the,

739
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:35.210
I think two of the most boring subjects on earth or like how cold it is and how

740
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.010
wonderful the weather is out here.

741
00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:42.630
And then the other one is how someone lost weight.
You know,
I look at them like,

742
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.510
what makes you think I give a fuck how you lost this weight?

743
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:48.180
And then the last me how somebody else lost weight.

744
00:46:48.181 --> 00:46:52.710
Like frank sent Raleigh lost weight and he wanted to tell him it's,
yeah frank,

745
00:46:52.711 --> 00:46:56.610
this isn't,
this is a car.
We'd have to talk about something with more substance.

746
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.530
And then people will say to me,
how did Lenny Clarke lose weight?
It's like,

747
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:03.990
I don't give a shit how he lost weight.
You know,

748
00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:06.930
I'm a self centered fucking comedian anyway.
You know

749
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:11.610
the good thing about cold weather though is it teaches people character.

750
00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:15.780
The people out here that have never had to deal with an earthquake,

751
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:19.770
they don't know any weather related nature related hazards.

752
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:21.210
If you stay here,

753
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:25.020
it just stays warm and then it gets a little cool and it stays warm.

754
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.860
I spent one winter out here that I was,
it was horrible.

755
00:47:28.861 --> 00:47:33.610
I was trying to get sitcoms and never getting anything and it rained every day

756
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.230
and it was,
it was horrible.

757
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.160
And I was staying in one of these corporate apartments that you woulds garden.

758
00:47:39.161 --> 00:47:39.850
Yeah.
Yeah,
but,

759
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.800
but it was initially the cheaper version and the guy next door was from Jamaica

760
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:47.110
and it was on the phone all fucking night.
He said,

761
00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:50.140
this is the only time I can talk to her.
It's got to be this time of night.

762
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.160
I'm telling you,
man,
it's real important.
I remind them,
Bang,
now it's gone.

763
00:47:55.330 --> 00:48:00.220
Yeah.
How long you been out here?
Since 94 Oh,
you've been out here a while.

764
00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:03.010
Forever.
I've been here more than anywhere else in my life,

765
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.610
but that's my observation.
Grew up in Newton,
didn't you?

766
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:06.980
<v 1>Well,
I lived there from,</v>

767
00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:12.310
I lived in Jamaica plain from I guess 13 to,

768
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.650
yeah,
13 to 14.

769
00:48:15.651 --> 00:48:20.210
I lived there for a year and then I lived in Newton from 14 to 20.

770
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:25.710
And then,
uh,
then I lived in revere and I lived in Saugus for awhile.

771
00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:30.310
<v 0>No,
you got to,
you got a reputation for what?
It's a good reputation.
Oh,</v>

772
00:48:30.311 --> 00:48:34.600
that's good.
Yeah.
What did I do?
Well,

773
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:37.330
it's just what we were just talking about.

774
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.710
You have a reputation as a bad ass.
Oh,
that reputation.
Yeah.

775
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.660
That's a good thing.
It's mostly bullshit it,
well,

776
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.510
you had Tyson on.
Yeah.

777
00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.870
And it was interesting that he didn't want to go back to it.

778
00:48:50.871 --> 00:48:53.710
Do you know Marvin Hagler has the same problem?
Oh yeah.
Well,

779
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:56.590
he was the only guy that ever just quit at the top.
But he won't,

780
00:48:56.591 --> 00:49:00.670
he won't punch a bag or anything because that thing comes up in him where he,

781
00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:05.110
he wants to do it again.
It's like an addiction and he's gotta be 60 now.

782
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.050
It's still wow.
The welling

783
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.180
<v 1>up inside of him.
I respect him so much.
You know,</v>

784
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.650
I always looked up to him when I was fighting cause uh,

785
00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.390
I remember the discipline that that guy had.

786
00:49:15.391 --> 00:49:19.530
Like I remember watching videos of him and he was a living on the cape.

787
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.940
He would treat you as Trump camp in the cape and he would run and he's running

788
00:49:23.941 --> 00:49:28.170
from Sam boots.
Yeah.
Combat boots on.
And he was,
it was yelling war.

789
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:31.440
He was like getting ready to fight Mustapha Hamshaw show and he's running and

790
00:49:31.441 --> 00:49:33.810
shadow boxing is yelling war.
And I'm like,
I'm just thinking,

791
00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.200
could you imagine if you had a fight that fucking guy,

792
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:39.780
when he was the middle weight champion of the world,
first of all,

793
00:49:39.781 --> 00:49:44.270
he was chiseled.
Like it was sculpted out of bronze.
They didn't even look like a,

794
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:48.000
I mean he was,
he was so jacked for a boxer.

795
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.350
When you think about like most boxers,
they didn't have that kind of physique.

796
00:49:52.351 --> 00:49:55.650
His physique was like almost like a gymnast,
you know,

797
00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:00.600
when he was in his prime and he just was so disciplined and forth and then beat

798
00:50:00.601 --> 00:50:03.090
the fuck out of everybody and then lost that one.

799
00:50:03.091 --> 00:50:07.380
Very controversial fight to sugar that I was at the fight and then he was like,

800
00:50:07.381 --> 00:50:10.770
that's it.
See Ya.
I've had enough.
Went to Italy.

801
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.490
He came a fucking movie star,
which is crazy.
He said,
apparently,

802
00:50:14.491 --> 00:50:18.000
I mean I've never seen an Italian movie with Ma Marvelous Marvin Hagler in it.

803
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.660
Nobody has,
I think they,
I think Natalie,

804
00:50:21.661 --> 00:50:24.730
I think it's a myth is it might be a myth or true or no.

805
00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.320
Can you see [inaudible] what's

806
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:33.200
<v 0>the rumor was always that he threw the fight with Leonard that he could Kale</v>

807
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.260
Leonard,
but he did.
All he had to do is let Len and go to a decision.

808
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:37.340
He would lose that decision.

809
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.280
They pay him a boatload of cash and he goes to Italy.

810
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.880
What does it you Marvin Hagler and a movie.

811
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:50.750
I remember seeing that Jesus Christ,
oh,

812
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:55.060
that's a long time ago because he looks really young back.
Oh my God,
he is Nyo.

813
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:59.870
No one's ever seen those movies.
Wow.
So this is an Italian,
but well,

814
00:50:59.871 --> 00:51:03.470
you know they made all those Spaghetti Westerns when they did all those movies

815
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:06.710
in Italy.
Oh my God.
Isn't that something?
Those movies,

816
00:51:06.711 --> 00:51:10.730
those job look at you look at,
he's shooting everybody.
Oh yeah.

817
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.400
This is an action star.

818
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.660
I wonder while he's still jacked in that movie.

819
00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:20.800
So it must have been doing some kind of exercising.
Look good.
I'm all good.

820
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:25.730
Oh God.
He's fuck Jesus Christ through the air.

821
00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:29.780
So India,
it looks like,
oh,
this is so hilarious.

822
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:33.320
This is so hilarious.
So now get to know,

823
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.470
you know me know when you do a movie and the guy hits you,

824
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:40.190
you're supposed to move your head so that he's not actually hitting you.

825
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:45.390
And I hope Marvin knew that.
I'm sure he had because he,
yeah,

826
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.450
thank God I pulled the punch.

827
00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:52.451
I did a movie in Boston called southy with a guy throws me in a dumpster and

828
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:54.141
kills me.
Right.

829
00:51:54.141 --> 00:51:57.620
And they had to do it over and over and the guy just got out of Walpole to state

830
00:51:57.621 --> 00:52:01.700
penitentiary.
I'm not gonna mention his name,
but he's,

831
00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:04.400
he's the director now out here as a matter of fact.
And I said,
Hey,

832
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:08.720
do you know this is a fucking movie?
He'd fire in the fight.

833
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:12.500
You know the shot that the starter's pistol and he kept throwing me over.

834
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:14.390
That guy is in everything.

835
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:20.020
Brian Dennehy was 1989 90 oh one so 89 was probably just a few years after he

836
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:22.034
retired.

837
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:27.520
He retired somewhere around 86 87 when did he fight Leonard?

838
00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.970
What an error that was.
Oh,
it was amazing.
We used to watch,

839
00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:35.000
maybe you must've closed circuit fights.

840
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.340
We'd go to a theater and you'd watch it on a big screen.

841
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:39.260
Closer to tell you how many,

842
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:43.580
I got so ripped off because you had Tyson on.
I remember driving,

843
00:52:43.581 --> 00:52:47.300
I was out here to go to this big fight,
50 bucks,

844
00:52:47.301 --> 00:52:49.760
and I walked in and Tyson knock them out in the first round.

845
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:51.200
That was all that ever happened.

846
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:55.670
People were trying to figure out what he was amazing.
Yeah,
yeah.
But it was a,

847
00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:00.560
it's what it was seven e seven interesting,
Huh?
Yeah.
And that was it.
He's like,

848
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:03.530
I'm done.
So that was only two years after he retired.
He was doing movies,

849
00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.720
but the best John the beast Mugabi but Marvin Hagler versus John the beast.

850
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:13.130
Ivan have hair from a Gabi.
No,
I remember seeing Martin with Harris.

851
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.480
The gardens wives.
Yeah.
Did he grow it out for a goof?
No,
he had a,

852
00:53:17.481 --> 00:53:19.400
Harley has created a really fucking hard,

853
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.790
he had an extra inch of scholar or something.
They were saying no,

854
00:53:22.791 --> 00:53:26.430
it was the side temples,
giant temple muscles.

855
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.410
<v 1>They said he was almost like bill with that Mugabe and Mugabe was a murderous,</v>

856
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:36.450
that's Thomas Hearns boy Thomas Thomas.
That's Mugabi for sure.
Mugabi.

857
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.780
He hit Marvin Hagler with an uppercut and snapped his head back and this is an

858
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:41.760
uppercut that he was knocking everybody out.

859
00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:45.420
But Non Marvin Marvin took a punch better than anybody.

860
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:49.570
He said the fight only started when I started the band.
I think one role,

861
00:53:49.571 --> 00:53:52.200
Dan was the only guy that ever knocked Marvin down,

862
00:53:52.201 --> 00:53:53.500
but it wasn't a real knockdown.

863
00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:56.910
It was a trip and they counted that as a knocked down.
Oh,

864
00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.970
he was a tremendous fighter.
But I know inside,

865
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:03.070
look at how it gets into the PSOAS.
Mugabe.
Mugabe was a murderer.

866
00:54:03.071 --> 00:54:07.320
It's punching until he was knocking everybody out.
He knocked out Terry Norris.

867
00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:07.681
He knocked,

868
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:10.950
he knocked people out dead like you would hit them and they would go flying,

869
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.780
but not Marvin.
Marvin stood right in front of them and eventually k Odom,

870
00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:17.520
and then Mugabi was never the same again.

871
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:20.300
Once you realize that this mother fucker could stand right in front of them to

872
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:23.010
shut up,
what does this referee stop?
What is he doing?

873
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.190
I don't know what's going on there.
That's mills lane.
Hey,

874
00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:30.420
now that we have a break in the action,
I'd like to,
I'd like to plug my movies.

875
00:54:30.421 --> 00:54:33.810
Sweeney killing Sweeney.
Yeah,
middle of the march.
We talked about it.

876
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:37.620
It's coming out.
I want to plug it again.
Well tool cause it's login.

877
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:39.480
We'll plug the shit out of it.
All right.
When it comes out,

878
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:43.290
we'll put it on Twitter.
Right Buddy.
But appreciate that.
But he was that guy.

879
00:54:43.291 --> 00:54:46.740
Marvin Hagler was to me like he was the epitome of discipline,
you know,

880
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:50.580
and I thought about like a discipline fighter who was him always in shape,

881
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:53.940
always ready to go.
And then the discipline to never come back.

882
00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.230
That was amazing too.
To me.

883
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:58.680
I've respected the fuck out of that because fighters never know when to when to

884
00:54:58.681 --> 00:55:02.550
leave.
He knew when to leave.
And to this day I saw him in an interview recently.

885
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:05.370
He's fine.
Talk completely normal.

886
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:09.630
I had some chowder with him at the Prudential Center.
How long?
How often,

887
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:14.510
how long ago rather than maybe a year ago.
He's a regular,
very regular guy.
Yeah.

888
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.810
Like no,
no brain damage.
No,
no slurring her words.
Yeah,
that's,

889
00:55:18.811 --> 00:55:20.660
that's amazing.
When a fight,

890
00:55:20.661 --> 00:55:23.280
it can figure out how to get out before all that stuff hits.

891
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.260
But you know how they feel.

892
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:30.210
They feel like no one else should tell him when to quit.
Oh,
of course.

893
00:55:30.211 --> 00:55:33.420
Have you had Mickey Rourke on this show?
No,
I haven't.
Yeah,

894
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:38.630
I would though because I think that I read he was fighting at 57 in Russia or

895
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.780
older than that.
Really?
He was 62,

896
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.260
I think he was 62 and he had his last fight and he might've been a fake fight.

897
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:50.820
Oh really?
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It looks like maybe Mickey tone.
It was real.

898
00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:54.260
And the gentleman,
he was fighting with the six 66,

899
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:57.900
he was 66 and he was in a box in [inaudible] 66 now,

900
00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:03.410
I believe he was 62 or 63 when he hit his last altercation inside the rail,

901
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.500
fighting boxing gyms.
The old ones were fun to hang around.

902
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.960
I remember I was sitting there with these five guys and uh,

903
00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:16.960
we were talking about some election and they weren't saying anything and that

904
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.700
the guy said,
do you realize that we're all convicted felons?

905
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:24.220
Like why you talking to us about who to vote for?

906
00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:29.260
You know what I mean?
Is that him now?
That's Micky.
Wow.
Look at him.

907
00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:33.020
That's the last year looking good for 65.

908
00:56:33.021 --> 00:56:35.590
It looks like he's at some sort of a homeless shelter or something.

909
00:56:35.591 --> 00:56:39.220
Where's he getting his clothes there?
He's got no shirt on in Rome,

910
00:56:39.221 --> 00:56:43.930
I think somewhere in Rome.
I just saw something with him and he was doing,
uh,

911
00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.220
he was walking in a fashion show.
Yeah.
I've seen him at the UFC is before.

912
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:49.960
He's always there saying hi.

913
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:55.270
He's a nice guy and very good shape for his age,
you know?
I mean,

914
00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:00.170
he,
yeah.
Used to spar with James Toney.
He's too,
uh,

915
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.490
like one of the things that he did that was probably very questionable was when

916
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:05.140
he was at the height of his movie career.

917
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.560
He decided to stop and become a professional boxer later.

918
00:57:08.561 --> 00:57:11.260
But I think he was a fighter before he was an act.
He was.

919
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.630
But when he stopped down in Miami,

920
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:18.550
I think he kind of felt like acting was fake and then he needed something real

921
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:20.710
in his life.
So he's going to have some professional fights.

922
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:25.240
But apparently that's why he started getting all that plastic surgery fucked his

923
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:30.010
face up.
His face was smashed.
And you are an amateur and I,
no,
MMA,

924
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.850
kickboxing and taekwondo.

925
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:36.160
There was no a MMA when I was fighting.
It didn't exist yet.

926
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:38.500
At least not in America.
Wow.

927
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:41.350
I didn't find out about Himalayan until like being in the ring.

928
00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:46.390
Kickbox is nerve wracking.
The thing about it too is there's no money in it.

929
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.600
You know,
like you're fighting for free and you're,
you know,

930
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:54.370
you're training for months or weeks or however long it is for this that you

931
00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:56.560
have.
You're,
you're constantly sparring.

932
00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:01.030
You're constantly getting kicked and punched.
It's,
uh,
it's terrible for you,

933
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.680
but it's a good thing to learn.
I think it's a very important thing to learn,

934
00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:09.370
to know how to fight is a very good thing.
But to fight,
he got to know,

935
00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.130
unless you're doing it professionally,
you gotta know when to stop.

936
00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:16.530
He got to know when I started getting a lot of headaches.
Yeah,
it was,

937
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:19.420
I was sparring.
But that's one thing about Boston,

938
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:23.440
like we're talking about Boston,
you know,
Boston audiences are hard.

939
00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.610
Boston sparrings hard boss,
Boston fighters,
they fought.

940
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.100
There's not a lot of like technical sparring.

941
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.710
Like when you tactically spar with somebody,
like if you hit him,

942
00:58:32.711 --> 00:58:35.770
you hit him like this.
You don't,
you don't hit him full blast,
you know,

943
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:39.580
you tap each other.
So you know,
like where you making mistakes.

944
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.780
There was none of that.

945
00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:46.170
It was just swing for the bleachers every fucking like that,

946
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:50.140
that I still go to.
What I love is the golden gloves.
Oh yeah.

947
00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.220
I mean it's all action.
Three rounds.

948
00:58:52.221 --> 00:58:56.590
Three types of competition when I'm talking about is training the real beatings.

949
00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:59.640
He take her in the Cim,
the beatings that nobody ever see.
You know?

950
00:58:59.641 --> 00:59:03.010
And you know what's amazing is that this friend of mine,
Jimmy Feral,

951
00:59:03.011 --> 00:59:07.600
had a gym in Quinsy.
And I look at these guys and I say,
wow,

952
00:59:07.601 --> 00:59:10.930
this guy's amazing.
He said,
that guy's record,

953
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:14.350
it's five wins and 13 losses.
And I said,
well,

954
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:19.720
that guy,
I mean,
that's how good you have to be.
These guys are like this.

955
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.210
There's no,
well also some inch,
they're inconsistent.

956
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.070
Like a lot of fighters are very impulsive people.
So they're often inconsistent.

957
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.350
Like they'll get in shape for a few fights and then a few other fights I'll fuck

958
00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:31.640
off.
They drink too much,

959
00:59:31.641 --> 00:59:34.910
they party and then they go in and ring and they lose and they lose a close

960
00:59:34.911 --> 00:59:38.560
decision or lose,
uh,
lose a war.
Isn't it?

961
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:42.110
A lot of it about style too.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

962
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.200
My favorite fighters ever,
uh,

963
00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:50.590
from a boxing point of view was Ali and Frazier because,

964
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:53.960
well,
for one thing it was a fight to the death,
right?
I mean,

965
00:59:53.961 --> 00:59:57.260
they literally were fighting all three times to the death.

966
00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:00.860
But Joe Frazier was an inside fighter and he was so low.

967
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:04.160
And then I'll leave with,
stay away from him and just jab.

968
01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:08.390
And it was just a beautiful exhibition of fighting styles inside fighting.

969
01:00:08.391 --> 01:00:09.290
And outside fighting.

970
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:13.700
Anybody listening to this that is interested in this shit,

971
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.760
they are believing in that left hook that Joe Frazier Aaa in this hundred

972
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.730
percent the left took Joe Frazier Drop Muhammad Ali with when he won the title,

973
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.180
when he,
when he beat him,
when the Ali's comeback and that was like,
Whoa,

974
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.240
this is one of the greatest punches of all time.
One of the most epic,

975
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:33.380
but one of them.
Yeah,
I mean just swung that wild left,

976
01:00:33.381 --> 01:00:35.300
took and clipped and Ryan the Chin and dropped him.

977
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:39.920
It's one of the most iconic photos of all time is Joe Frazier leaping through

978
01:00:39.921 --> 01:00:44.480
the air,
landing that left hook on the jaw of Ali and Ali going down.

979
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.600
I'm going to go back.
Okay,
what are you going to do?

980
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.800
There was a guy named Floyd Patterson.
Sure.
Who had that.

981
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:57.100
He lost the Sonny Liston,
Sonny Liston.
I'm just reading about Sonny Liston.

982
01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:01.760
Sonny Liston was a murderer.
Sonny Liston was one of 25 kids.

983
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:05.470
He was his mother,
you know,
whatever.
It's fine.

984
01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.100
Was like a sharecropper and he got involved in gangs and all this and I'm

985
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:14.520
one of those guys,
you know,
I think he ended his career,

986
01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:16.850
that shot or something to died.
No,

987
01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.420
she died of a drug overdose or I'll go over it.
I think he ended his career as a,

988
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:24.580
like a bouncer in Vegas.
Yeah.
You know,
like a doorman or something like that.

989
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:28.760
Right.
Casino one of those,
one of those guys like Joe Louis,
whatever.
Yeah.

990
01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:33.080
Those big guys that ended up,
yeah.
You know,
it's a funny,
funny sport.

991
01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:37.100
Do you ever watch that fight with him in Floyd Patterson?
Uh,

992
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.350
not that one.
Oh yeah.
I think I may have terrifying,

993
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.930
but I remember when,
uh,

994
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:48.410
I'm old enough to remember when Cassius clay beats on him.
Beat him twice.

995
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.820
He was like eight to one.

996
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:51.830
That was another fight where a lot of people thought it was fixed.

997
01:01:51.831 --> 01:01:53.570
The second fight,
the second one in Lewiston,

998
01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:58.100
Maine and hit punch well was that you could see the punched it said,

999
01:01:58.101 --> 01:02:02.210
they said to call it a phantom punch.
You can see the punch,
but it was like a,

1000
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.500
he called it an anchor punch cause it's like as listing was coming forward,

1001
01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:10.430
he dropped it down on him like that and a lot of people say it didn't land but

1002
01:02:10.431 --> 01:02:12.590
you could see his head react.
It definitely landed.

1003
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:16.400
The question was whether or not he decided to stay down and once he got hit,

1004
01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:20.040
I think he did.
If you watch it just doesn't look realistic.

1005
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.200
I can be watched when he goes down the way he went down scene.
Maybe legit,

1006
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.300
but the way stumbled around it.

1007
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:30.450
He didn't stumble around like a guy who his central nervous system got jacked.

1008
01:02:30.451 --> 01:02:34.950
Here we go.
Watch it right here.
Oh,
what a great producer.
You the best.

1009
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:38.760
Watch this.
I'll get this pink.
See that's a real punch.

1010
01:02:38.761 --> 01:02:43.530
100% and the Dra,
the him dropping is real too.
There's no doubt about it.

1011
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.910
The question was whether that was enough to take them out.
Look at that bank.

1012
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:50.370
It could have,
but watch the case.

1013
01:02:50.371 --> 01:02:53.940
See if you can find the knockout Jamie because the what's not,

1014
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:58.530
what's crazy about it wasn't him dropping him cause I think that was legit.

1015
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.560
What's crazy was how afterwards he stumbled around like he couldn't move.

1016
01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:06.810
He couldn't get up.
It just didn't seem real.

1017
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.630
What'd we just had it there for a long explanation.

1018
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:11.460
I don't know if they're going to show the actual thing.

1019
01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.700
Well then they just showed him trying to get up.

1020
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:18.320
That kinda looks like Kevin Spacey.
Oh zero.

1021
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:23.130
That was the actual,
wow,
here it is.
Here it is.
Play it.
Watch,
here's the punch.

1022
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:24.270
Boom.
Now Watch.

1023
01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:28.560
He goes down and he just sort of laid down on his back

1024
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.140
and then he kind of stumbled around and acted like he couldn't get up.

1025
01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.760
They just keep showing it over and over again.

1026
01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.240
It was 100% of legitimate punch and people who say it's not,

1027
01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.080
they've never seen people get chaos cause people get Kol and all sorts of weird

1028
01:03:42.081 --> 01:03:44.060
ways.
It doesn't really make sense.

1029
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:48.620
Like it's a human being getting punched in the face.
Weird Shit happens.

1030
01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:52.540
Especially,
you get punched on the jaw,
like see,

1031
01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.650
people get touched with like a jab.

1032
01:03:54.651 --> 01:03:58.520
Sometimes when they go out it doesn't make sense.
And it also,

1033
01:03:58.521 --> 01:03:59.810
sometimes here it is,
it's right here.

1034
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:04.730
It's also sometimes it's weird because you might've gotten hurt real bad and

1035
01:04:04.731 --> 01:04:09.470
training.
So a lot of guys come in to these fights and they're already injured.

1036
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.950
They just boom right there.
Now let's watch them stumble around.

1037
01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.460
So he goes down and he lays down on his back seat.

1038
01:04:15.461 --> 01:04:19.460
This is where I'm not buying it.
This si just seems like Horse Shit.

1039
01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:24.170
But I could be wrong.
Now he's stumbling.
See like right there,

1040
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:28.730
that seemed like he decided to stumble and go down and he's trying to get back

1041
01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:33.380
up.
I could be wrong,
I could be wrong,
but I'm not buying it.

1042
01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.370
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1043
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:38.100
<v 1>And so,
uh,
the referee was jersey,
Joe Walcott,</v>

1044
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:42.060
who's a very famous champion of his own.

1045
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:46.860
Now they started way by,
no,
did they stop the fight?
I don't know.

1046
01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:51.420
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
Well,
you know the first fight,

1047
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.061
fifth round,

1048
01:04:54.061 --> 01:04:58.880
I think it was list and put some white stuff on his gloves.
Yeah.

1049
01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:02.340
And he blinded.
This is how crooked the game was he playing that?

1050
01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:06.930
Ali Cassius clay.
So listen wasn't above,

1051
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.610
you know,
cheating.
Yeah.
Do you remember that fighter?

1052
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:13.590
Oh my God,
this is so frightening.

1053
01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:18.100
He w he wrapped something in his Louie.
Yeah,

1054
01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.410
Billy Junior.
No,
he took all the padding Adam's gloves back in the day.

1055
01:05:23.411 --> 01:05:27.250
The day you still use horse hair with the gloves and you could,

1056
01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.690
you could put a little hole in the gloves and pull the padding out.
And uh,

1057
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.650
Louie Resto,

1058
01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:37.350
Panama Lewis was his trainer and Panama Lewis was also the same guy that gave a

1059
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.400
Aaron Pryor that little a jab cocaine right before he knocked out Alexis

1060
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.300
Arguayo.
I mean they think it was cocaine.
He said gimme the other bottle,

1061
01:05:46.301 --> 01:05:48.940
the one that I prepared,
he gives it to Aaron Pryor.

1062
01:05:48.941 --> 01:05:51.460
And then Aaron Pryor goes out and starches,
Alexis Arguayo,

1063
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.060
they had a crazy war of a fight and then he gives him something in this little

1064
01:05:55.061 --> 01:05:58.450
bottle.
And then Aaron Pryor goes out like a bat out of hell.

1065
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:02.200
And once the question was always what was in that bottle,

1066
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:05.950
cause there was no sophisticated drug testing back then,
but Panama Louis,

1067
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:10.210
but there was one of them that actually put cement or something in their gloves.

1068
01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:14.260
Um,
there was that,
that was a more recent one that was a,

1069
01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:19.030
that Mexican gentleman that fought,
uh,
what,
did he do that too?

1070
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:24.190
That the red hand?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He doesn't isn't fight anymore.

1071
01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:27.160
Fuck I'm drawing a blank on his name.
But he,

1072
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:30.280
he beat up some really prominent fighters that way.

1073
01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.250
How the fuck did he,

1074
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:37.720
there was a one fight in particular,
boy,

1075
01:06:37.721 --> 01:06:40.660
I'm seeing the guy in my face.
Yes.

1076
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.790
Antonio Margarito who pull,
pull up his record because he did it to,
uh,

1077
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:48.040
he did it to some like legit fighters and uh,

1078
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.570
really beat them up and they were like,

1079
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:52.080
it didn't even make sense how hard he was hitting me.
Cause he,

1080
01:06:52.081 --> 01:06:56.770
he would put plaster of Paris apparently inside the wraps and Miguel Cotto.

1081
01:06:56.771 --> 01:06:59.530
That's who it was.
Right.
And then Miguel Cotto beat the shit out of him.

1082
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:00.770
The rematch and Shane Mosley,

1083
01:07:00.771 --> 01:07:04.660
sugar Shane Mosley beat the fuck out of him when they found this seat.

1084
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.930
After he knocked out Miguel Cotto,
we beat him up in the 11th round.

1085
01:07:07.931 --> 01:07:11.290
He stopped him and it was a horrible stop.
It's too,
he beat the shit out of him.

1086
01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:15.260
Then the Shane Mosley fight was the fight that he lost.
That was the next fight.

1087
01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:20.430
During the wrapping of the gloves,
Shane Mosley's camp was go,

1088
01:07:20.431 --> 01:07:24.790
what the fuck is in his raps?
They recognized it and it had a rewrap his hands.

1089
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.550
And then Shane Mosley beat his fucking ass.

1090
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:31.300
And then he'd beat Robert Garcia and then Manny Pacquiao fucked him up.

1091
01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:36.610
And then Miguel Cotto fucked him up.
Um,
but the Miguel Cotto fight,
the first one,

1092
01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:39.550
it was,
it was bad.
I mean,
his face was busted up and,

1093
01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:42.640
and that's when people had suspicions,

1094
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:46.030
but they didn't know until they saw the wrapping of the gloves.

1095
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:48.490
And then they looked at every one of his fights before that,
and they will go,
oh,

1096
01:07:48.491 --> 01:07:49.840
this motherfucker had pledged

1097
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.450
that city fat city.
Stacy Keach.

1098
01:07:56.430 --> 01:08:01.390
It's about club fighters down at Stockton one,
you know,
fantastic movie.

1099
01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.870
I don't think I've ever seen bridges first movies and John used and directed it.

1100
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:10.030
One of the best fight movies ever.
This fight that I was talking about earlier,

1101
01:08:10.031 --> 01:08:13.360
the Louie Resto fight,
this Billy Collins junior guy was a,

1102
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:17.410
he was an up and coming contender and he was blinded in the fight and could

1103
01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:21.260
never fight again.
Wow.
This kid that he fought,
Louie Resto,

1104
01:08:21.261 --> 01:08:25.070
they pulled all the padding out of the gloves and he just fucked up this guy's

1105
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:29.360
face to the point where you know he had detached retinas and he couldn't see

1106
01:08:29.361 --> 01:08:31.700
straight and became an alcoholic afterwards.

1107
01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:35.090
When when your is right there look at his face.
Wow.
Yeah,

1108
01:08:35.091 --> 01:08:40.010
and it became a a a really big,
a big store salt with a deadly weapon

1109
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.820
I think at the end of the other guys live for it.

1110
01:08:43.821 --> 01:08:45.770
At some point he admitted that he did it.

1111
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.120
There was some documentary about it that the guide finally admitted that he was

1112
01:08:50.121 --> 01:08:53.840
using.
People have done that forever.
People who've done that forever.

1113
01:08:53.841 --> 01:08:56.420
I was sparring with a guy once and I went to touch his gloves and I was like,

1114
01:08:56.421 --> 01:08:59.810
what the fuck is and your gloves and is padding had all been,

1115
01:08:59.811 --> 01:09:02.150
it was those old style old style boxing gloves,

1116
01:09:02.151 --> 01:09:05.150
the padding you all push back and it was like,

1117
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:10.390
it was all like almost raw knuckle people are assholes.
Yeah,

1118
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:11.810
I've,
I've experienced that before.

1119
01:09:11.811 --> 01:09:15.260
What's interesting now is that people are actually fighting bare knuckle.

1120
01:09:15.261 --> 01:09:18.200
There's a whole bare knuckle boxing organization out of Wyoming.

1121
01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:22.650
You have all your knuckles?
Yeah,
they're all there.
There've been one broken out.

1122
01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:25.970
One that was broken.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
Moves Weird cliques.

1123
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.770
That was Bobby sell these knows

1124
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.720
blobby Salvey is there a more fucking Boston named Bobby [inaudible].

1125
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:38.290
Bobby Salvey.
I fucking hit him.
What a fucking over hand fucking left.
He fuck.

1126
01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:42.950
I went down like I'm gonna you know it's good to is the rap,

1127
01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.850
you know the guy's gonna fight,
you know like wrap it the end.
Well,
no,
it's,

1128
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:52.880
I used to beat guys like you up on the way to a fight.
Practice fall on asshole.

1129
01:09:52.881 --> 01:09:57.070
You know that shit.
I like that.
Just like in basketball,
you know,
the,
the,

1130
01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.290
the trash talk trash and yeah,

1131
01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:03.020
sometimes it works because the thing about when someone gets inside your head,

1132
01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.400
someone's really mean that.

1133
01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:09.500
I was kinda thinking that when you see listing and I'll leave,

1134
01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:12.230
right?
Yeah.
How could,
like,

1135
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:17.040
it looked like listen was like afraid of him.
How could he be?
Well,
you know,

1136
01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:21.170
the reason why,
and this is Ali did this on purpose.

1137
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.060
He acted like a crazy person because he's like that Sonny Liston was a bully and

1138
01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:27.770
Sonny Liston was a big scary man.

1139
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:31.430
And what he felt like sunny lifts it would be afraid of,
it's a crazy person.

1140
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:32.840
Someone who was afraid of him.

1141
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:36.710
So when all the press conferences and all the different things leading up to the

1142
01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:39.020
fight,
he would scream at them.
He would show up at Sonny Liston,

1143
01:10:39.021 --> 01:10:42.500
his house and Honk the horn in the middle of the night and get on his lawn and

1144
01:10:42.501 --> 01:10:43.400
scream and yell at him.

1145
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:46.310
Like he did a lot of crazy shit to Sonny Liston to fuck with them

1146
01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:49.230
psychologically.
He wanted something.
He did it.

1147
01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.910
He did it psychologically did he wanted Sonny Liston to think that he was a

1148
01:10:52.911 --> 01:10:57.710
crazy person and that you know,
that he would never stop.
And that's,

1149
01:10:57.770 --> 01:11:02.330
I mean he essentially did it and there was one point in time when they were,
um,

1150
01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.640
see we just let me hear some of this.

1151
01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:11.290
He,
he laid him,

1152
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:16.710
he let them know he wasn't scared of him and they were doing his blood pressure

1153
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:18.530
and his blood pressure was so high as Harvard,

1154
01:11:18.531 --> 01:11:22.560
it was so high they weren't going to let them find their like,
oh no,
Ali's,

1155
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:25.980
he had a calm itself down cause he got himself worked up into a lather.

1156
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.320
He was just so,
so angry.
And so,
you know,
so hyped up,

1157
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:34.360
trying to act like a crazy person than when they were doing is pre-fight

1158
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.310
medicals.
They were like,
hey,
you know,
like you can't fight your fucking,

1159
01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:41.310
there's something wrong with you.
And they had this,
here it is,

1160
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.630
the calming him down.

1161
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:50.970
He had to relax and calm down.
I don't know,
greatest,
greatest of all time.

1162
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:54.930
I beat him all.
He was just so,

1163
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:58.350
so smart at like psychological warfare.

1164
01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:02.700
There'd never been any anybody like him psychologically that could just,

1165
01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.540
he would,
he,
first of all,
he was very funny.

1166
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:10.260
He would say hilarious shit.
Like Howard Cosell said to them,

1167
01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:13.920
tramp it champion seem very trucky let and he goes,
whatever truculent is,

1168
01:12:13.921 --> 01:12:16.400
if it's good on that.
That's right.

1169
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.850
The timing was just perfect.
He was so,
he would,
you know,

1170
01:12:20.851 --> 01:12:24.720
say things that were funny.
He would say poetry.

1171
01:12:24.721 --> 01:12:28.260
He had that Guy Bundini Brown behind him and they were always,
you know,

1172
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:31.440
there were always like laughing and joking around together.

1173
01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.480
Like he had a tremendous support team and on top of that he could fight his

1174
01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:40.980
fucking ass off.
And he was a heavyweight that moved around like a middleweight.

1175
01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:44.800
Unbelievable.
I mean he was a 200 plus pound,

1176
01:12:44.801 --> 01:12:46.680
215 220 pound man.

1177
01:12:46.890 --> 01:12:51.630
And he would shuffle and move and Bob and weave and he would be out there almost

1178
01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:54.900
like a Welsh.
We think he's the greatest.
He's a boy.

1179
01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:57.690
It's hard to say who's the greatest heavyweight of all time,

1180
01:12:57.691 --> 01:13:00.690
but he's certainly in the conversation.
I mean,

1181
01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:05.370
you would have to say how would he have done against some of the bigger,

1182
01:13:05.371 --> 01:13:09.720
stronger guys have of the past,
like a Lennox Lewis who,
uh,
you know,

1183
01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:13.770
was in his prime in the high 240 pound range.

1184
01:13:13.771 --> 01:13:18.600
She was a much bigger,
much bigger guy.
But no,
there was nobody like,

1185
01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:21.210
see Holly also comes in two stages.

1186
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:25.530
There's Ali before 1967 when they took his license away.
And this is Ali.

1187
01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:30.030
After 1970 when he came back and when he came back,
he was never as fast.

1188
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:33.660
He was never as fleet of foot cause he didn't work out at all for three years.

1189
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:38.640
He didn't do shit.
No.
And when he came back,
his return fight,

1190
01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:43.890
um,
uh,
he just didn't look right.

1191
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:46.950
He didn't look like he had the same movement.

1192
01:13:46.951 --> 01:13:51.840
His body didn't have the same musculature.
He just,
uh,
he fought.
Um,

1193
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:57.510
Jerry,
no,
it wasn't Jerry Jerry Quarry.
That's how it was.
And he beat him.

1194
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.410
He beat him up,
but he just didn't look like them.

1195
01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:05.220
The homily that fought like go to boxing matches.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1196
01:14:05.221 --> 01:14:08.680
I'll still go a box of matches.
I love watching on TV.
Yeah.
I don't,

1197
01:14:08.681 --> 01:14:12.310
I try not to go too many live events anymore cause I go to so many of them with

1198
01:14:12.311 --> 01:14:17.260
the UFC.
Yeah.
You know,
it's hard for me to go and do,
you know,
go,

1199
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.540
go see more of them live.
But I do enjoy them.
You know,

1200
01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:26.170
it's nothing like being ringside for a,
um,
golden gloves.

1201
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.610
Have you ever been to a UFC fight?
No.
Well,
you come,
I'll get you tickets.
Sure.

1202
01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:34.510
Next time we're in Boston I'll hook it up.
We go to Boston almost every year.

1203
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.650
Okay.
Yeah.
I love it.
Some big fights together in Boston.
Yeah.
I want you to go.

1204
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.840
It's crazy.
It's wild to see it live.

1205
01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:44.890
I get you get your right there on the floor right in front of the cage to

1206
01:14:44.891 --> 01:14:49.210
amazing.
Yeah.
Something,
something unique.
He'll be a good date.

1207
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:54.610
Yeah.
It's um,
it's way wilder,
like when you get used to watching the UFC,

1208
01:14:54.611 --> 01:14:58.480
sometimes it's,
I mean,
I really appreciate boxing.
I love it as a sport.

1209
01:14:58.481 --> 01:15:03.070
I love it as a,
as a,
just as a martial art.
I appreciate the elite of the elite,

1210
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.473
but it's,

1211
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:09.810
it's not as wild the UFC because there's takedowns and kicks and strangle holds

1212
01:15:10.451 --> 01:15:15.180
and armbars it's just way more wild.
Yeah.
It's way,
it's way more exciting.

1213
01:15:15.181 --> 01:15:16.030
A street fight.

1214
01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.280
It's like a super technical street fight between trained killers.

1215
01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.960
That's what it's like.
Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well listen,

1216
01:15:25.961 --> 01:15:29.470
I want to thank you.
I want to thank,
you know,
I made it.
I want to thank you.

1217
01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:33.190
I mean,
listen,
when me,
when I was coming in with like a boxing show,

1218
01:15:33.191 --> 01:15:37.780
we just did cares.
They say you don't have it,
Mohammed.

1219
01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:40.690
We can do whatever we want,
man.
This is the beautiful thing about podcasts.

1220
01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.830
You do whatever the fuck you want,
but you were a big inspiration of mine,

1221
01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:50.080
you and,
and,
uh,
all those legends of Boston comedy.
And to this day,

1222
01:15:50.081 --> 01:15:54.130
I think I saw some of the best comedy of my life ever.
Um,

1223
01:15:54.131 --> 01:15:58.390
when I was a young man coming up and when I was just starting out and you know,

1224
01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.950
opening for guys like you and you know,
you know,

1225
01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:04.210
you know what made it special is nobody was doing it as a job.

1226
01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.850
We were all just doing it because they said I want to do this.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1227
01:16:07.851 --> 01:16:11.650
You know,
and there was no forethought or afterthought.
It was just,

1228
01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.330
I mean that's what I still love about
performing,

1229
01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:20.590
you know,
acting or stand up.
It's,
you're in the moment,
right?
Right.

1230
01:16:20.591 --> 01:16:24.120
You're in the moment.
But Fitzsimmons is a good buddy of mine and uh,

1231
01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:26.380
Greg Fitzsimmons and we started out together.

1232
01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:31.240
We talk about it to this day that back then we didn't think of having a career.

1233
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:33.310
Like what are you talking about?
A career though.

1234
01:16:33.311 --> 01:16:36.640
The best thing that we could ever envision was one day would be able to pay our

1235
01:16:36.641 --> 01:16:39.400
bills.
Doing stand up comedy.
That's right.

1236
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:43.940
That's all we would hope for because I would look at guys like you or all the,

1237
01:16:43.941 --> 01:16:47.430
the,
the Boston guys that were getting,
you know,
they were making a living.

1238
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.190
I was like,
these guys know.
I'm like,
Geez,
I watched this,
those guys,

1239
01:16:51.191 --> 01:16:55.060
myself and I was in awe guys like Kenny Rogers Center thing.
Sure.

1240
01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:59.530
What a mind Stephen.
Right?
I mean,
they do things I can't do,
you know,

1241
01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.610
and they,
the way they can create jokes.
Oh,

1242
01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:07.450
I did a movie with Rodney back to school and I'd just watch him,

1243
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:10.310
you know,
create these jokes.

1244
01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:13.580
<v 0>You know,
like the one line,
like a Haiku poem.</v>

1245
01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.650
I go to the dentist the other day for yellow teeth.
He says,
we're a brown tie.

1246
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:22.550
You know,
your mind's going in one direction.
Yeah.

1247
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:27.410
I'll tell you another guy who was a fantastic joke writer.
Uh,
he could,

1248
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.910
he,
the jokes he did,
he couldn't,

1249
01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:33.290
you couldn't do now is Martin Mall Martin Mall from Martin Martin.

1250
01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:35.420
That television show was at would tonight.

1251
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:40.610
He was on the tonight show and uh,
Johnny said,
how you doing?
And he said,

1252
01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.480
Johnny,
I'm as busy as jumper cables that are Puerto Rican wedding.

1253
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.390
You couldn't do that joke today.
So already say,
he said,
uh,

1254
01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.070
I was watching roots with 20 minutes.
No one scored a basket.
I turned it off.

1255
01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:01.940
By the way,
that's Martin Mall.
It's not made
and it's not.
Joe,

1256
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:05.330
did you like,
um,
the,
the documentary when standups stood out?

1257
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:10.310
I did not participate in that.
How come?
Because,
uh,

1258
01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:15.740
I didn't want my family to go through watching that.
How so?
What do you mean?
Oh,

1259
01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.180
it was about the decadence of it all and drugs and all that.
I like to think,

1260
01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:23.930
you know,
the important thing is the work.
Yeah.
You know,
well,

1261
01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:27.680
it was a little bit about the decadence,
but it was also about,

1262
01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:32.350
I was paranoid about Cremins and those guys.
Yeah.

1263
01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.040
I'm very,
very,
it was very sad,
but I was very happy to,

1264
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:40.010
to know him and to,
I used to say to Barry,

1265
01:18:40.011 --> 01:18:44.780
I'd be on a Gig with Barry
and I'd say,

1266
01:18:44.781 --> 01:18:48.050
Barry,
you're making these people are here to drink.

1267
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:53.180
You're making references to the third under secretary of State's policy and

1268
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.680
fricking Uganda.
They are not going to get it.
Yeah.

1269
01:18:56.790 --> 01:19:01.490
So you can't get mad at them for not getting it.
But he was,
you know,

1270
01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:06.260
I didn't agree with his politics at all,
but he really meant it.

1271
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.240
Yes.
So I respected that.
Well,

1272
01:19:08.241 --> 01:19:12.110
he's a very smart guy and he also had extremely powerful ethics.

1273
01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:16.780
Like he was one of the reasons why no one respected any hacks in Boston.
Now,

1274
01:19:16.781 --> 01:19:20.570
many thieves were punished as it was a,
it was because of Barry.

1275
01:19:20.571 --> 01:19:24.620
Like you had to have original material.
Absolutely.
And everybody policed it.

1276
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:29.030
It was a very unique environment because Rodney Dangerfield said that,
he said,

1277
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:33.850
when somebody steal the joke from me,
it's like,
like the hidden Mana.

1278
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:38.060
My kids
feel that personal,
you know?
Well,

1279
01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.810
you know how it is when you're working on a bid and it doesn't work well in the

1280
01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:43.460
beginning,
and then,
you know,

1281
01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:46.640
it takes months to figure out how to twist it and perfect it,

1282
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.520
and then someone comes along and takes the finished product.
It's,

1283
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.010
it's a horrific thing.
Yeah.
You know,

1284
01:19:52.011 --> 01:19:55.220
but Barry made sure that that environment of Boston was not,
it was,

1285
01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:58.850
it wasn't just that it was,
there was no,
there was no thieves.

1286
01:19:58.851 --> 01:20:03.320
There was also no hacks.
Like if you were doing like cop donut jokes or Sheila,

1287
01:20:03.321 --> 01:20:07.320
he would just fucking spit in your face.
He didn't want none of,
you know,

1288
01:20:07.321 --> 01:20:08.154
Barry was a,

1289
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:11.910
<v 1>and he was a scary guy,
man.
I remember when I was a,
an open Mike,</v>

1290
01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.090
I was so intimidated by him and when he started being nice to me,
I was like,

1291
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:17.460
Whoa,
Woo.
I made it through.

1292
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:20.250
I was so worried that he was going to hate me.

1293
01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:22.860
I was so worried he was going to hate me.
Well,

1294
01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:24.330
I was worried that all those guys are going to hate me.

1295
01:20:24.331 --> 01:20:27.960
And you guys were all doing yes.
Well,
you're terrible.

1296
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:31.140
You're terrible when you're first starting out and you see guys like you and

1297
01:20:31.141 --> 01:20:35.460
Calvin.
And I was always,
you know,
I was felt like I was never going to be inside.

1298
01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:38.820
I was never gonna make it,
you know,
it's just,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I was,

1299
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.780
I just felt like it was unattainable and you guys were the cane

1300
01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:46.540
<v 0>and now like I said,
you opened for me,</v>

1301
01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:50.200
you're going to going to hit the big time.
That's what the movie's about.

1302
01:20:50.201 --> 01:20:54.340
And by the way is Boston comedy.
Yeah,
we shoot it at the cow alone.

1303
01:20:54.341 --> 01:20:58.600
We shoot it downtown and we shoot all over the city.
It's about Boston.

1304
01:20:58.601 --> 01:21:02.740
It's about comedy and a,
I hope people come out and see it tonight.

1305
01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:07.090
Thursday.
It's at the Lameer musical here in Beverly Hills.

1306
01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:10.120
Oh is it really this Thursday?
Shit.
Do you want to go?

1307
01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.110
<v 1>Yeah,
I would love to go.
What time is it?
Seven 30 I have a show at eight.</v>

1308
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:17.080
I'm at the Improv boy.

1309
01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:25.540
Shit.
Well either.
Even if I can't make it on Thursday.
Um,
I will definitely.
Yeah,

1310
01:21:25.541 --> 01:21:27.520
I'm at the Improv at eight o'clock unfortunately.

1311
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:31.480
But I spent a lot of nights at the Improv Improv on Hollywood,

1312
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:35.020
on Melrose and Hollywood.
It's a great spot.
But was there,
it was great.

1313
01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:38.290
Those audiences were fantastic.
They still are to this day.

1314
01:21:38.291 --> 01:21:40.000
I've been doing a lot of shit.
I'm there tomorrow night.

1315
01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.270
I'm there Thursday night as well.
I'm there.
I'm trying to do more shows there.

1316
01:21:43.710 --> 01:21:43.890
Could,

1317
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:47.470
I'll mix it up cause I mostly just do the comedy store when I'm in town and the

1318
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:50.620
Ice House in Pasadena.
Did you ever do that place?
I think so.

1319
01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:55.120
How long are you in town for?
Friday morning and flying out,
but yeah.

1320
01:21:55.240 --> 01:22:00.120
What are you doing tomorrow night?
You want to do a set at the Improv?
Sure.

1321
01:22:00.121 --> 01:22:04.880
Why not?
Why Not Sweetie?
Tuesday.

1322
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:09.090
Tomorrow night's Tuesday.
Why not come on baby.
All right.
That'd be fun.

1323
01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.540
You get to be on w yeah,
you're,
you're going to be on for sure.
Yeah.

1324
01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:16.670
It'll be hot then people will know you from the shell.
All right.
Yeah.
Thank you.

1325
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:20.700
My pleasure.
Um,
so when you did decided to do this,
this,

1326
01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:24.330
this movie about Boston comedy and you didn't want to do that,
uh,

1327
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:29.010
that went standup stood out documentary.
That was many years ago.
What is,

1328
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.460
so you,
you knew it was just going to be about the deck and it's up,

1329
01:22:32.461 --> 01:22:37.290
but there's also documenting what standup was like and I didn't know what it

1330
01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:38.680
would be.
So you just decided,

1331
01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:44.190
<v 0>yeah.
You know,
it was one of those decisions,
you know,
it's like,
um,</v>

1332
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:49.010
sometimes you make decisions that are really fucked up.
Like,

1333
01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:54.800
do you remember Ed Mcmahon had a show?
What was it?
Star?
What?

1334
01:22:54.801 --> 01:22:59.210
Star search?
No,
it was something Ed Mcmahon had this,
wasn't he star search.
Yeah.

1335
01:22:59.211 --> 01:23:02.450
We'll start with that.
What it was Kevin James One.
So,

1336
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:07.510
so I'm auditioning for this show and I'm saying here I am auditioning for a show

1337
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.600
I don't want to do and I've been turned down,
you know,
so I said,
wow,

1338
01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:14.980
this is,
this is awful.

1339
01:23:14.981 --> 01:23:18.580
I did a lot of that sitcoms that I really didn't want and then,

1340
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:23.440
or a movies rather than,
I really didn't want to like the Adam anyway.
No,
no.

1341
01:23:23.441 --> 01:23:27.490
I retired.
I'm retired 100% from acting.
Wow.
Yeah.

1342
01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.680
Last movie I did was a Kevin James Movie,

1343
01:23:29.681 --> 01:23:32.380
but it's Kevin's a buddy of mine and I would,

1344
01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:36.670
I would do something with him just for,
for a goof.
But I don't enjoy acting.

1345
01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:41.290
I don't enjoy sitcoms.
I don't enjoy actors.
I like comics too much.

1346
01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.540
I liked hanging around with comedians so much.

1347
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.390
The one I'm hanging around with actors,
I'm like,
God,
I wish you guys were comics

1348
01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.700
comics or they don't have any filter.
They're loose.

1349
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.730
You know where you stand with,
you know,
where you stand with them.

1350
01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:55.301
If they like you,

1351
01:23:55.301 --> 01:23:59.630
they really like it and they're accepting of weird shit and flaws like,
hey,

1352
01:23:59.631 --> 01:24:01.540
it's fucking crazy.
What are you going to do?
It's funny though,

1353
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.400
you know they're little people say shit like that.
Like,

1354
01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.990
you know what they used to say to me,

1355
01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:09.850
say or all these comedians on drugs and I'd say no,

1356
01:24:09.851 --> 01:24:14.820
only the good ones I can.
George Carlin and Richard Pryor.
Yeah,

1357
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:18.910
yeah.
Well they're the,
the wild,
impulsive people.

1358
01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.560
But a lot of them,
you know,

1359
01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:24.550
like Bill Hicks got off the drugs and was probably even better when he was off

1360
01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:29.070
the drugs,
but it had a lot of great drug stories.
Oh yeah,
it did.

1361
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:34.570
You look back and there are great stories as long as you can look back and as

1362
01:24:34.571 --> 01:24:36.520
long as they're just stories.
Yeah.

1363
01:24:36.521 --> 01:24:38.770
As long as you're not in jail and as long as you get through.

1364
01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:40.570
And they're funny when you look back.

1365
01:24:40.571 --> 01:24:43.660
But then not so funny when you're in the middle of it.
Well,
the Ding Ho,

1366
01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:48.040
when you guys were starting out,
that was,
that was the legendary place.

1367
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:50.170
That was what we'd all,
I'd come a little bit too late.

1368
01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:54.370
I think the dino and closed,
it was a bartender there named Henry

1369
01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:58.420
and I'd always ask this crazy question.
I think,

1370
01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:03.130
is he an asshole or is he Chinese though?
It's like,
you know,

1371
01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:05.740
mutually exclusive,
you know,
Chinese,
you know,

1372
01:25:05.741 --> 01:25:08.650
they don't know if they're pissed off.
It's like,
oh,
well you go,

1373
01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:11.730
do you want Sweeney and Sweeney not here.
Swinging out again.
You know,
I'm,

1374
01:25:11.731 --> 01:25:14.130
I'm on the phone.
Yeah,
I'm swinging.
He,
yeah.
Sweden and not tell.

1375
01:25:14.131 --> 01:25:17.320
We don't know where Sweeney or,
you know,
I'm Sweeney,
I'm trying to get in there,

1376
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:20.970
you know.
Um,
yeah,
the thing,
Whoa,
that was,
that was wild.

1377
01:25:20.971 --> 01:25:25.910
The guy lost the place in a dominoes game.
No,

1378
01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.510
his name was Sean Lee and he compulsive gambler.

1379
01:25:30.511 --> 01:25:35.200
And so it was a Chinese restaurant with a theater,
like the w or a restaurant,

1380
01:25:35.201 --> 01:25:39.490
that thing.
Whole restaurant.
But there was a stage,
there was a stage,
but the,

1381
01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.100
you know,
one time it came in,
the doors were locked.

1382
01:25:42.101 --> 01:25:45.370
He lost it and what you guys would think of as a card game.

1383
01:25:45.371 --> 01:25:49.870
But apparently it played dominoes gambling.
And how did it get started?

1384
01:25:49.871 --> 01:25:52.320
How the Ding Ho gets Cremins Crimmons started,
you know,

1385
01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:55.510
Cremins what was going on before then?
There was no comedy club,
no comedy.

1386
01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.300
And what year was this?
Well,
I don't know.

1387
01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:01.520
I don't remember anything like that to seven eight.
It May.

1388
01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.950
If it was the nineties I don't remember what day of it,

1389
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.700
but it closed in [inaudible] 84 right.
I don't remember what it was.

1390
01:26:07.701 --> 01:26:09.710
I think he calls an 84 because it was gone.

1391
01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:14.610
Like it was a legend when I came around.
I came around in 88 and people are like,

1392
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:19.040
Oh,
you missed the Dang,
whoa.
We all had our own shows there.

1393
01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.820
I was Sunday nights and I do all these crazy characters.
I was just trying to,

1394
01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:27.560
you know,
find out what I want to do,
you know?
So I was doing like characters,

1395
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:33.170
but one week that's when the magic happened is Peter was solid from the tonight

1396
01:26:33.171 --> 01:26:36.440
show came in and at the time the tonight show was the tonight show.

1397
01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.760
He saw Stephen,
right.
And the next week Steven Wright was on the tonight show.

1398
01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.500
It was amazing,
you know,

1399
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:47.740
because we're there already what we were catapulted from Inman square fricking

1400
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:53.450
Chinese restaurants who Johnny Carson,
who was amazing.
It was wonderful.

1401
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:57.800
When did the other clubs started opening up?
It was after that when they,

1402
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:59.660
when people found out there was some money in it,

1403
01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.580
but then it was in the suburbs and it was all over the place.

1404
01:27:04.581 --> 01:27:05.211
Do you remember that?

1405
01:27:05.211 --> 01:27:10.211
There was one time where there was duck soup across from so soup was Nick's

1406
01:27:10.341 --> 01:27:14.570
comedy stop down the street from Nick's comedy stop was the comedy channel and

1407
01:27:14.571 --> 01:27:16.730
above it was common at the Charles Playoffs member.

1408
01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:19.400
Mike Clark was booking common at the Charles playhouse for awhile.

1409
01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:23.990
So there was four clubs on the same block that's right in Boston.

1410
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.730
And you know what?
They were all filled,

1411
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:28.860
the same guys were working in all of them.
And everybody was shuffling around,

1412
01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:32.320
but the shows were filled.
They couldn't,
was great.

1413
01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:35.250
Going next was doing three shows in three different rooms.
Yeah.

1414
01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.950
They were doing the disco downstairs.

1415
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:40.460
They had the smaller middle room and then they had the upper and one Saturday

1416
01:27:40.461 --> 01:27:44.750
night I did stitches,
which was uncommon map.
I did three shows there.

1417
01:27:44.751 --> 01:27:47.690
I did four,
I did about nine shows in one night.

1418
01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:50.090
And at the end of the night I was just,

1419
01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.570
I was saying that the audience did I already do that.
Joe

1420
01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.500
and I was so tired was like,

1421
01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:04.100
I'd be like setting it up and then what's the fucking punchline of this shit?

1422
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.780
Yeah.
You know,
in some point of diminishing returns,

1423
01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:13.580
sometimes you're not even thinking about what you're doing right.
And,

1424
01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:17.600
um,
they're not laughing.
And I say,
then you say,
well,

1425
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:23.140
you realize you're not saying it right.
You're not delivering it.
And you know,

1426
01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:25.490
then you deliver it and they laugh.

1427
01:28:25.491 --> 01:28:28.970
And then there's this other voice in your mind saying,
wow,
that's interesting.

1428
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:34.370
If I change my voice,
they'll laugh.
And it's like me watching me do this.

1429
01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.250
It's crazy.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,

1430
01:28:37.251 --> 01:28:42.170
I can remember if you want to hear a horrible coke story,
I was down in New York,

1431
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:46.460
I was up for a show called,
not necessarily the news,
I remember that.

1432
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:52.330
So we backstage at catch a rising star and that plays,

1433
01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:57.860
you know,
when somebody comes out to see on these shows,
they're always late.

1434
01:28:58.490 --> 01:29:03.490
So I'm downstairs and the guy says they're not here yet and this,

1435
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:09.180
all right,
so do you want to do a line?
I said,
all right,
I'm fucking,

1436
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:11.820
you know,
so I did it and not send out.

1437
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:15.000
Now time is going faster because you fucked up.

1438
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:19.200
And I said the here yet.
And I said,
well,
you just asked five minutes ago,
no,

1439
01:29:19.201 --> 01:29:22.920
they're not here.
Do you want to do another line?
I said,
yeah,
okay,
I'll do.

1440
01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:28.560
So I got,
by the time I'm on stage,
it's like,
oh,
I'm fucking,
you know,

1441
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:31.380
there's no comedy.
You know when your jam him,

1442
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:35.430
it's like at the intensity is fucking unbelievable.
You're on stage like this.

1443
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.360
So they were there to see me and I go out and I did this and I was like setting

1444
01:29:44.221 --> 01:29:48.540
up a joke and not doing the punchline and start and shit and ideas.

1445
01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:52.920
And it was fucked up.
It was like Charlie Sheen,
you know what I mean?

1446
01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:57.180
There's no dots to put together.
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1447
01:29:57.870 --> 01:30:02.700
I go off and I said to the kid,
how was it?
He said,

1448
01:30:02.701 --> 01:30:06.840
how was it?
He was supposed to do 25 minutes.
He did four minutes.

1449
01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.510
I thought it was out there for like an hour.

1450
01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.880
It's fucking off is when I think of those days.
When did you quit?

1451
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:20.120
26 years.
What was the reason?
You know,
when I talk to kids,
they,

1452
01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.140
they say that sometimes what?

1453
01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:27.470
And the closest thing I can say is something we'd say the program,

1454
01:30:27.471 --> 01:30:31.950
I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.
I was always exhausted.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1455
01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:36.990
Always tired.
Yeah.
So then I came back to life,

1456
01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:41.220
you know,
and now I enjoy every day.
Beautiful.
Yeah.

1457
01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:45.390
And I enjoyed being on the show and join having,
yeah.
Thanks buddy.
Thanks man.

1458
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:49.940
I appreciate you for it.
All right.
Thanks,

We can do it again.
We will.
And you,

1459

8:00 PM show.
Right?

1460
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:58.060
You know what?
I'll come and watch you come on mother fucking [inaudible].
Yes.

1461
01:30:58.110 --> 01:31:02.610
Well,
I'm on,
I close.
I'm on last,
so I'll go on at like nine,
something like that.

1462
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:05.580
Yeah,
I'll do five minutes.
Alright,
beautiful.
Alright.

Preordered thanks sir.

1465
01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:16.540

thanks.</v>
