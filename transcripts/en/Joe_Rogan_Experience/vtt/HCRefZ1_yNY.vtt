00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Five for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abby Martin,</v>

2
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you today to be here?</v>

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Shit's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy day for bill cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woopsies Hey,</v>

6
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reeling in that news man.</v>

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

8
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what was gonna happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the first one was a mistrial was</v>

9
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's the difference between this</v>

11
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a civil suit or is this,</v>

12
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I think these are these fines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Civil.</v>

13
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>This was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the retrial,</v>

14
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>so he got convicted of charges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>felony,</v>

15
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three different counts.</v>

16
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Each one carries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at least 10 years.</v>

17
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>He could go to jail for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is death for him.</v>

18
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

19
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>he's already blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

20
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

21
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could barely see.</v>

22
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

23
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy that he's getting charged</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of his life.</v>

24
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a creepy dude.</v>

25
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>He liked to have sex with lifeless dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>

26
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to,</v>

27
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purely speculation,</v>

28
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what would cause someone to want to</v>

29
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

30
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this theory,</v>

31
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people did that shit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 60s I think in the 60s it was a</v>

32
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>normal thing to drug people and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

33
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the terms.</v>

34
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've heard it slipping someone a</v>

35
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>mickey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

36
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I think they used to do that all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time back then and they didn't think</v>

37
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>if he's disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are fucking cross.</v>

39
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>If you just go back a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

40
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>like I'm watching the show vikings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great show by the way.</v>

41
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever wash it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

42
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were obviously fucking crazy</v>

43
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

44
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>They did wild shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was common.</v>

45
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was how people live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would storm into villages and kill</v>

46
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was normal shit just a thousand</v>

47
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>years ago or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you go back just a</v>

48
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people treated each other was</v>

49
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back 50 years ago,</v>

50
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>that's bill cosby's era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

51
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I really think that people back then</v>
<v Speaker 1>were different.</v>

52
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

53
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>they didn't understand how other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were viewing their activity.</v>

54
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>They thought they could hide this</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

55
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think there was a group of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>

56
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partiers that would drug people and I</v>

57
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>think it was a normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's probably a lot of people</v>

58
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>out there that are here in this bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosby thing and they're thinking about</v>

59
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>all the times that they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is horrifying.</v>

60
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking scary.</v>

61
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you catch yourself in it</v>
<v Speaker 1>being this like responsible,</v>

62
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>like I'm in a lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the black people pull up your pants.</v>

63
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be good.</v>

64
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time Wanda Sykes</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed him at something and he was</v>

65
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>a chastising her on the way she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking English and he was wearing</v>

66
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>sunglasses inside and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

67
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm just recovering off the raping that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said.</v>

68
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't see people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't look you in the eyes and I'll</v>

69
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>raped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

70
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy to hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did you see Weinstein chased out of</v>

71
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:56.620
<v Speaker 1>that bar like in Florida or whatever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy comes up and like slap,</v>

72
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slapped him in the face.</v>

73
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that happens to him all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

74
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that he's a disgusting pig who</v>

75
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 2>should be chased out of every public</v>
<v Speaker 2>forum.</v>

76
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I was just a lot of those out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot,</v>

77
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 2>a lot of creepy humans in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

78
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're in this unprecedented time</v>

79
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 2>of understanding in terms of like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of your behavior,</v>

80
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 2>what you can and can't do now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the fact that people will just,</v>

81
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing something horrific to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

82
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 2>other people are now going to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you know,</v>

83
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years ago nobody fucking knew</v>

84
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

85
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 2>think about JFK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

86
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Think about all the shit that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>with trump and trump just kind of this,</v>

87
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like water off a duck's back with</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump for whatever reason.</v>

88
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 2>So he's got some strange ability to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fake nose.</v>

89
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.800
<v Speaker 2>That's his brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His brand is being a misogynist piece.</v>

90
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's spelled lightheart.</v>

91
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

92
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 2>he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

93
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 2>he just says it's lies and he just keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>going and everybody knows it's not a lie</v>

94
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do it while he's</v>

95
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 2>not freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's acting like businesses usual and</v>

96
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:57.830
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

97
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 2>but if you go back to like what JFK was</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to,</v>

98
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 2>like JFK was a fucking freak and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows it.</v>

99
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.861
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

100
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was a freak in the area,</v>

101
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 2>in the era where the press knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that was going on and</v>

102
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>everybody like kind of kept her mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut.</v>

103
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 2>And everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like an unspoken agreement</v>

104
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 2>that they wouldn't report on affairs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other stuff.</v>

105
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to see our culture</v>

106
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 2>change wildly over a short period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

107
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tabloid journalism has taken</v>

108
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:31.880
<v Speaker 2>completely over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

109
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good,</v>

110
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see what these people are really</v>

111
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:35.711
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

112
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 2>you're totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>JFK was a complete womanizer and it's</v>

113
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 2>like lauded as this hero still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody was back then.</v>

114
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they want it to be present in</v>

115
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 2>the first place so they can just fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that moves.</v>

116
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to save the free world where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking weird.</v>

117
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>W W we're in a strange time.</v>

118
00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I think historians in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go back to the period where</v>

119
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 2>the Internet was created essentially was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 94 when it became mainstream.</v>

120
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to look at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>time between 94 and 2018 is</v>

121
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented explosion of change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is nuts.</v>

122
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 2>the stormy Daniels thing I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be,</v>

124
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>isn't doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anything is going to come</v>

125
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 2>out of the Russia stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that if anything,</v>

126
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come out of the Michael</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cohen.</v>

127
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.533
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

128
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 2>But Hen pardoning Libya is basically him</v>
<v Speaker 2>sending a message saying,</v>

129
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 2>don't worry man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got your back.</v>

130
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a part in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to jail to come.</v>

131
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think cause I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the hell?</v>

132
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Why else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why else would you just pardon Dick</v>

133
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Cheney's former man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

134
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 2>scooter libby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>

135
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 2>It was just him basically just being</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

136
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 2>don't worry bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Your back.</v>

137
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll get you out of prison if Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pardon that guy.</v>

138
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

139
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>

140
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 2>The trump stuff's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stormy Daniels thing is ridiculous.</v>

141
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that interview with Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cooper?</v>

142
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch that.</v>

143
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:55.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

144
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the craziest part about it is not the</v>

145
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>fact that</v>

146
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>he had sex with a porn star and that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to do a transactional thing</v>

147
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>to get on the apprentice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that he's sent someone a threatened</v>

148
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>her and her child after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking nuts.</v>

149
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

150
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 1>does he capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that's standard operational</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedure for lot of people.</v>

152
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>He's a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a mafia acting dude.</v>

153
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Well that wasn't that what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

154
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.820
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

155
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>who was saying that about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

156
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>call me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call me was saying that it was</v>

157
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>essentially you're reminded him of when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was prosecuting the mob that they</v>

158
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 1>have this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>same kind of attitude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

164
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Everyone just talks about jerking off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pixelated porn in the 80s and their</v>

165
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>dicks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I mean you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>

169
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

170
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 1>it was really fucking on a Netflix</v>
<v Speaker 1>special last weekend.</v>

171
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>How was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

172
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very happy.</v>

173
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't decided yet.</v>

174
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.720
<v Speaker 1>The tour I was calling strange times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

175
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>obviously we're in strange times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might just keep that.</v>

176
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made my change the name.</v>

177
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a really,</v>

178
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>haven't decided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was impressed.</v>

179
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of really good jokes about</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

180
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 1>which is you would think would be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess for Comedians it's probably</v>

181
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>not easy because it's so satirical that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're living in.</v>

182
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is reality is already a</v>

183
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:26.200
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

184
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>so it's so crazy that you have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out what is your</v>

185
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:32.790
<v Speaker 1>unique perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>if you have one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I just think we're very childlike in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do with an,</v>

188
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we treat our leaders and how we</v>

189
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>choose our leaders.</v>

190
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.160
<v Speaker 1>And I'm really fascinated by the cult of</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality that goes behind really any</v>

191
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>big time leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's trump or Obama,</v>

192
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>there's people that think that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do no wrong.</v>

193
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I was very fascinated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With Hillary.</v>

194
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>There was a giant group of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>refuse to look at any of the things that</v>

195
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Hillary was doing that were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of the things like the Clinton</v>

196
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Foundation or those speeches that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was giving to these bankers where she</v>

197
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't release the transcripts or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies that she would talk about.</v>

198
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>The difference between Colome's version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what the FBI had found her to have</v>

199
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 1>done wrong versus her version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a video where you see the</v>

200
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.450
<v Speaker 1>two of them back to back and she's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deceptive person.</v>

201
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 1>She's clearly a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not,</v>

202
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>she's not a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not like this shining example of</v>

203
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>what we would like our leader to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like our lead like love or hate or</v>

204
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that guy was.</v>

205
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:40.400
<v Speaker 1>To me it was like a statesman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's so the way he would</v>

206
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>communicate with so calm and smooth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

207
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

208
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:49.130
<v Speaker 1>even if he didn't like his policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to admit the guy was incredibly</v>

209
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 1>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully literate,</v>

210
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 1>like the way he would speak and</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>

211
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:58.811
<v Speaker 1>He was well read like he to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented what I would like the</v>

212
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:02.210
<v Speaker 1>version of the person who's running the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big thing to be.</v>

213
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the whole crux of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people who have brainwashed</v>

214
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 3>themselves into thinking there's some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like deep state apparatus that's</v>

215
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 3>outing trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that their real problem,</v>

216
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deep state is the military</v>

217
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 3>industrial complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're winning at the end of the day,</v>

218
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 3>no matter what defense contractors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stocks are skyrocketing,</v>

219
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 3>trump is basically the de facto arms</v>
<v Speaker 3>salesmen and chief on the phone at the</v>

220
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Japanese prime minister being like hog</v>
<v Speaker 3>these killer drones bro.</v>

221
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Like we got to sell these surveillance</v>
<v Speaker 3>drones.</v>

222
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 3>That's who's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day,</v>

223
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 3>the neo liberal establishment is who</v>
<v Speaker 3>hates him because he removes the mask of</v>

224
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 3>empire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

225
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He removes the mask.</v>

226
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:38.670
<v Speaker 3>He's making it less palatable to sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>imperialism around the world,</v>

227
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the crux of why you see a kind of</v>

228
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 3>these think tankers and the liberals on</v>
<v Speaker 3>on TV,</v>

229
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 3>and we can get into this later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a whole misnomer going on</v>

230
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 3>about the left and a miss</v>
<v Speaker 3>characterization about the left.</v>

231
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:52.140
<v Speaker 3>The left has no fucking power in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

232
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 3>The left has no voice in terms of news</v>
<v Speaker 3>coverage.</v>

233
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 3>So all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has not left.</v>

234
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 3>She has a new liberal corporate shill.</v>

235
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.440
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say that and so does Jimmy Dore.</v>

236
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Dore says the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

237
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.110
<v Speaker 1>He just thinks that she does not</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent</v>

238
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 3>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

239
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.120
<v Speaker 3>And there's a myth of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the fact that the media is liberal in</v>

240
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 3>general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

241
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tv,</v>

242
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 3>culture aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>news is not,</v>

243
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 3>there is no liberal media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Media is owned by multinational</v>

244
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 3>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with conservative business owners that</v>

245
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.190
<v Speaker 3>have interlocking boards of director.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's at defense contractors,</v>

246
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Monsanto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>

247
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Those people are fucking liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not left.</v>

248
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:34.620
<v Speaker 3>They pushed down their policies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if you're a Maoist</v>

249
00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:37.920
<v Speaker 3>working at Washington Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna be able to put out that</v>

250
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 3>contradictory narrative that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>shareholders are pushing.</v>

251
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

252
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:46.620
<v Speaker 3>it's really unfortunate that the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been basically,</v>

253
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they've just demonize the entire</v>

254
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 3>left where now you have the NRA</v>
<v Speaker 3>fomenting civil war against the fucking</v>

255
00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump and all of his followers are just</v>

256
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 3>like the left is what's really wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this country where there's no</v>

257
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:00.720
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have any power.</v>

258
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.540
<v Speaker 3>You have given me like I have more of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>platform than probably any other leftist</v>

259
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.840
<v Speaker 3>because you have given me a platform on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show.</v>

260
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 3>When have you ever heard my views?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like on TV ever?</v>

261
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:11.380
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

262
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were on tv,</v>

263
00:11:12.341 --> 00:11:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I heard them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why we go to archie.</v>

264
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.620
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

265
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.710
<v Speaker 1>But that's a weird thing to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people think of Russia.</v>

266
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Russia is the great enemy and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Russia today.</v>

267
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.930
<v Speaker 1>That'd be Martins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a tool of the Russians,</v>

268
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.440
<v Speaker 1>the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians.</v>

269
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.440
<v Speaker 1>The Russians were nothing forever like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians,</v>

270
00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:34.870
<v Speaker 1>like we got through the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the Russians are friends now</v>

271
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.330
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I was in high school we</v>

272
00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:39.310
<v Speaker 1>were always worried we're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombed by the Russians.</v>

273
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.220
<v Speaker 1>That shit went over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it feel to just have that back?</v>

274
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.200
<v Speaker 1>It feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>

275
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe we're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombed by the Russians.</v>

276
00:11:46.121 --> 00:11:48.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're going to bomb them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're going to bomb us.</v>

277
00:11:48.911 --> 00:11:53.911
<v Speaker 1>And I think as cliche as it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually assured is probably a really</v>

278
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 1>good incentive to not launch missiles</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the air.</v>

279
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that's still real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the serious</v>

280
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scares the shit out of me.</v>

281
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything to do with Isis,</v>

282
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 1>anything to do with like ideological</v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare.</v>

283
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff scares the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

284
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

285
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 1>when you see what people are capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

286
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:17.290
<v Speaker 1>if they really believe in their cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they really believe God's on their</v>

287
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really believe.</v>

288
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 1>And also if you really believe you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been fucked over by the Great Satan,</v>

289
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.260
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff scares the shit out of me</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most people were blissfully</v>

290
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 1>unaware of what the United States and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

291
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 1>what the commander in chief or whoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck is pulling the strings is doing</v>

292
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:36.100
<v Speaker 1>overseas and what the repercussions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those actions is going to be.</v>

293
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

294
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:36.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

295
00:12:36.931 --> 00:12:40.920
<v Speaker 3>that the guy who I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when the Quebec Mosque</v>

296
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.010
<v Speaker 3>mosque shooting was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his basically his justification was,</v>

297
00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic terrorism won.</v>

298
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:47.940
<v Speaker 3>It made me do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that's the case,</v>

299
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.430
<v Speaker 3>what are all the people that we kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>with drones?</v>

300
00:12:50.431 --> 00:12:54.510
<v Speaker 3>And we just killed the bride at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking wedding party in Yemen.</v>

301
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.160
<v Speaker 3>So another one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

302
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Bomb wedding part at least eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's our thing.</v>

303
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's deliberate because we're</v>

304
00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:04.170
<v Speaker 3>supplying intelligence and weapons to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia.</v>

305
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:05.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306
00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.780
<v Speaker 3>we supply them weapons and turned a</v>
<v Speaker 3>blind eye.</v>

307
00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:10.690
<v Speaker 3>We are supplying military intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 3>and targets for them to bomb and we're</v>

308
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.270
<v Speaker 3>actively helping them do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

309
00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:15.020
<v Speaker 3>they just bombed another wedding party</v>
<v Speaker 3>on top of the funerals,</v>

310
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.940
<v Speaker 1>but all schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why are they,</v>

311
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 1>why wedding parties is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there someone in the wedding party</v>

312
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or was it a mistake?</v>

313
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what the official line</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

314
00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:26.400
<v Speaker 3>but how many wedding parties can you</v>
<v Speaker 3>bomb before we draw our red line?</v>

315
00:13:26.401 --> 00:13:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just disgusting.</v>

316
00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:29.190
<v Speaker 3>And they killed the bride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed the fucking,</v>

317
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.050
<v Speaker 3>so what are all these people who grow</v>
<v Speaker 3>up?</v>

318
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.350
<v Speaker 3>This was supposed to be the happiest day</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their lives and now you know,</v>

319
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.070
<v Speaker 3>are they gonna grow up wanting to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kill Americans?</v>

320
00:13:37.071 --> 00:13:38.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blaming the marriage.</v>

321
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were conspiracy theorists,</v>

322
00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 1>that's what you'd say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would say the reason why they're</v>

323
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:46.360
<v Speaker 1>doing this is that the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants an endless war.</v>

324
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:51.570
<v Speaker 1>The best way to insure it and this war</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to occasionally blow up some people</v>

325
00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 1>that really have no dog in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you create a bunch of radicals.</v>

326
00:13:55.031 --> 00:13:57.880
<v Speaker 1>You create people that are hell bent on</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge because that,</v>

327
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.430
<v Speaker 1>that's the real hardcore conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

328
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.690
<v Speaker 1>the Alex Jones take on it.</v>

329
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

330
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.430
<v Speaker 3>a good way to look at the world as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

331
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 3>there's the colonizers and colonize the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

332
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:11.880
<v Speaker 3>the states that are basically remaining</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we know that the establishment or</v>

333
00:14:11.881 --> 00:14:13.740
<v Speaker 3>the empire wants to take down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Iran,</v>

334
00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Venezuela,</v>

335
00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:16.110
<v Speaker 3>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

336
00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:17.160
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they all have in common?</v>

337
00:14:17.161 --> 00:14:18.120
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

338
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:23.450
<v Speaker 3>independent of our economic a Gemini.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we use our economic and military</v>

339
00:14:23.941 --> 00:14:25.920
<v Speaker 3>might to commit violence around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

340
00:14:25.921 --> 00:14:29.400
<v Speaker 3>to subject these countries to bend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>our will economically.</v>

341
00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:32.790
<v Speaker 3>And it's really obvious and</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately people just continue to</v>

342
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:36.960
<v Speaker 3>buy into this humanitarian bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 3>propaganda no matter who's in office.</v>

343
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter who's in office.</v>

344
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 1>If you look at like the actions that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama administration took versus the</v>

345
00:14:42.161 --> 00:14:44.890
<v Speaker 1>action the Bush administration took</v>
<v Speaker 1>their super similar.</v>

346
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

347
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 3>And this whole deep state thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

348
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.960
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as junior I the deep state,</v>

349
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>the deep state I think is</v>

350
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 2>the military industrial complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the machine that churns on no</v>

351
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 2>matter who is the commander in chief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

352
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not trying to get rid of trump.</v>

353
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love him,</v>

354
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:01.604
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

355
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 2>They love this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

356
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 2>trump has a lot of enemies because he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a scorched earth.</v>

357
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.590

358
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 2>hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It appears that the media is uniformly</v>

359
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 2>against him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's because God can we pull</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

444

<v Speaker 3>The Voice of God and Hillary Clinton's</v>

445
00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:12.400
<v Speaker 3>soul was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was with the Rock and the king of Saudi</v>

446
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Arabia.</v>

<v Speaker 3>yet the king of Saudi Arabia is a cool</v>

449
00:19:17.201 --> 00:19:19.040
<v Speaker 3>dude who we should have dinner with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

450
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Is this the young king that's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

452
00:19:23.411 --> 00:19:26.170

<v Speaker 3>he locked up all those people for who</v>

453
00:19:26.171 --> 00:19:28.060
<v Speaker 3>the hell knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably to consolidate power.</v>

454
00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:29.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was the line that came out</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

458
00:19:33.161 --> 00:19:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I think that it was just to consolidate</v>
<v Speaker 3>power is a power grab and goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

467
00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:58.623
<v Speaker 3>New jobs,</v>

468
00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.880
<v Speaker 1>gigantic pile of email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thankfully to the wrong email address.</v>

469
00:20:03.881 --> 00:20:06.580
<v Speaker 1>But I still was aware of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

470
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.730
<v Speaker 1>have a bunch of people and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a,</v>

471
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:10.940
<v Speaker 1>a form letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

472
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.820
<v Speaker 1>talking about how you're a liar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're anti Israel and none of this</v>

473
00:20:15.821 --> 00:20:20.821
<v Speaker 1>stuff is happening between Israel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

474
00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

475
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.430
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got weird.</v>

476
00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.250
<v Speaker 1>It got weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a hundreds and hundreds and</v>

477
00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:28.100
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of emails</v>

478
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.180
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a campaign that's a campaign</v>

479
00:20:31.181 --> 00:20:34.480
<v Speaker 3>with large amount of money behind it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Israeli lobby likes to come</v>

480
00:20:34.481 --> 00:20:37.840
<v Speaker 3>down very hard on people who speak out</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the crimes of Israel.</v>

481
00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:39.460
<v Speaker 3>As you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a third rail issue.</v>

482
00:20:39.461 --> 00:20:41.740
<v Speaker 3>No one talks about it even though it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fucking obvious.</v>

483
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we heard the mantra,</v>

484
00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Putin kills journalists all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

485
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Israeli of forces are sniping</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists and children on camera and</v>

486
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 3>yet the world turns a blind eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

487
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 3>someone got killed just a few days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A journalist just died yesterday.</v>

488
00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:57.770
<v Speaker 3>He was shot in the abdomen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

489
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.280
<v Speaker 3>they're all Palestinian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been no Israeli casualties,</v>

490
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 3>wounded or otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>

491
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 3>stand with us is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is directly funded by the Israeli</v>

492
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of their giant Hasbro</v>

493
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 3>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

494
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.360
<v Speaker 3>they made a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were promoting a video,</v>

495
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 3>kind of trying to debunk what I said on</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

496
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can look at the empire files and see</v>

497
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.800
<v Speaker 3>all of the documentation of what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your style.</v>

498
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.050
<v Speaker 3>That's all my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

499
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.800
<v Speaker 3>the empire files on the empire files.tv</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a youtube channel that you can</v>

500
00:21:23.801 --> 00:21:25.960
<v Speaker 3>subscribe to too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean it's just very easy,</v>

501
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Speaker 3>easily verifiable facts like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israeli military law governs the West</v>

502
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is verifiable in five seconds on</v>

503
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Amnesty International.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was just very desperate measures</v>

504
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:38.470
<v Speaker 3>to try to obfuscate what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is really all they have left</v>

505
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:40.810
<v Speaker 3>because the tide is turning man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

506
00:21:40.811 --> 00:21:42.460
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Natalie Portman just signed on to</v>

507
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:45.940
<v Speaker 3>boycott this conference in Israel and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are running scared.</v>

508
00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:47.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to revoke her citizenship</v>

509
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:50.140
<v Speaker 3>because she's basically participating in</v>
<v Speaker 3>bds.</v>

510
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she said recent events have made</v>

511
00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:55.390
<v Speaker 3>her greatly disturbed as it should</v>
<v Speaker 3>disturb everyone.</v>

512
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 3>The fact that there's this ongoing</v>
<v Speaker 3>massacre.</v>

513
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.640
<v Speaker 3>And if I could just explain to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on really quickly,</v>

514
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:02.290
<v Speaker 3>it is horrifying you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

515
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.510
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing called the great march</v>
<v Speaker 3>of return,</v>

516
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.980
<v Speaker 3>and it's been completely nonviolent on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the side of Palestinians.</v>

517
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 3>It's in Gaza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the open air prison where about</v>

518
00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:13.690
<v Speaker 3>2 million people are housed in cage like</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

519
00:22:13.691 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 3>and they're not allowed to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of any other place in the</v>

520
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:19.930
<v Speaker 3>world that refugees actually can't leave</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise there'll be shot.</v>

521
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.230
<v Speaker 3>So there's like Israeli guard posts</v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounding this place that count their</v>

522
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:24.190
<v Speaker 3>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

523
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.250
<v Speaker 3>they don't let them have concrete</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that can be construed as a</v>

524
00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:28.084
<v Speaker 3>weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

525
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.001
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

526
00:22:29.001 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 3>they're protesting this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right because they have no dignity,</v>

527
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:33.880
<v Speaker 3>no humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no agency to live their lives.</v>

528
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 3>And so they're protesting nonviolently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going up to the,</v>

529
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.140
<v Speaker 3>to the fence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of them and 40</v>

530
00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 3>people have just been executed.</v>

531
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.870
<v Speaker 3>There's Israeli soldiers sitting up</v>
<v Speaker 3>perched on a hilltop with sniper scopes.</v>

532
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.360
<v Speaker 3>This isn't just random gunfire that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are being hit with.</v>

533
00:22:49.361 --> 00:22:52.990
<v Speaker 3>They are deliberately attacking every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single person with head shots,</v>

534
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.770
<v Speaker 3>with genitalia shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sick and press.</v>

535
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.360
<v Speaker 3>There's people marked press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

536
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:00.080
<v Speaker 3>that's an egregious war crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

537
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.540
<v Speaker 3>You have Nikki Haley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

538
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.900
<v Speaker 3>vetoing every single UN resolution or</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation into Israel.</v>

539
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.300
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine another country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that you look,</v>

540
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.570
<v Speaker 3>Israel can only survive with us</v>
<v Speaker 3>sponsorship and we love to have that</v>

541
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:16.270
<v Speaker 3>beach head in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We love to have that military garrison</v>

542
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:19.300
<v Speaker 3>because we use Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what happened in Syria,</v>

543
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:21.940
<v Speaker 3>we used as real to bomb Syria first to</v>
<v Speaker 3>test the waters.</v>

544
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.720
<v Speaker 3>We use Israeli forces to execute nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists in Iran.</v>

545
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:30.040
<v Speaker 3>We use the massage to do all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff so that we love to have that kind</v>

546
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:31.510
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

547
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 3>military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>military,</v>

548
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:37.120
<v Speaker 3>post outpost in the Middle East that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can use to try to intimidate all those</v>

549
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:40.390
<v Speaker 3>postcolonial states that are independent</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we want to overthrow.</v>

550
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.320
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

551
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.181
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

552
00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:45.650
<v Speaker 3>the lobby controls us and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong.</v>

553
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a lot of lobbies</v>

554
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:48.610
<v Speaker 3>that have influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's,</v>

555
00:23:48.611 --> 00:23:51.650
<v Speaker 3>it's more strategic than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

556
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the Palestinians,</v>

557
00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.670
<v Speaker 3>the Palestinians that are trapped in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gaza and if they leave,</v>

558
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.490
<v Speaker 3>there's no other way to go other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>through Israel.</v>

559
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:05.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they,</v>

560
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people are like,</v>

561
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what about Egypt and Jordan?</v>

562
00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 3>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can try to go out that way.</v>

563
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:13.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean basically they're all in cahoots</v>

564
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 3>with the Netanyahu is administration and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all basically client states of</v>

565
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:19.190
<v Speaker 3>the u s so no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't leave.</v>

566
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:22.070
<v Speaker 3>And Israel controls their water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the passageways,</v>

567
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.440
<v Speaker 3>everything that they don't let them</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave.</v>

568
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of these people who have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot with sniper rifles can't even get</v>

569
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 3>treatment because they're denied</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment.</v>

570
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 3>So there's so many amputations that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally unnecessary.</v>

571
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 3>So now that you have like thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are just amputated,</v>

572
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Speaker 3>5,000 people have been shot with live</v>
<v Speaker 3>ammunition and you've been there.</v>

573
00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:41.270
<v Speaker 3>And how much time did you spend when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were there?</v>

574
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 3>So I was in the West Bank for a month</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they let you go back and forth from</v>

575
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.800
<v Speaker 3>Gaza to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately I was banned from Gaza</v>

576
00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:52.370
<v Speaker 3>because I was told I was a propagandist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was not a real journalist and I</v>

577
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:55.100
<v Speaker 3>was told I was an Iranian agent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was confusing because I thought it</v>

578
00:24:55.101 --> 00:24:59.370
<v Speaker 3>was a Russian agent who was the press</v>
<v Speaker 3>minister of Israel who,</v>

579
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

580
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 3>So I think they thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably calculated that it would</v>

581
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:08.270
<v Speaker 3>be less risky to just block me from</v>
<v Speaker 3>entering then having me go in and show</v>

582
00:25:08.271 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 3>the horrors and the abuses that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on there.</v>

583
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 3>But I mean we're talking about executing</v>
<v Speaker 3>children and s sniper scopes and there's</v>

584
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 3>videos of these soldiers gleefully</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing.</v>

585
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 3>They are literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

586
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:22.240
<v Speaker 3>did you see his legs go up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like look at that shit man out.</v>

587
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.970
<v Speaker 3>You get a headshot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IDF soldiers have tee shirts where they</v>

588
00:25:25.971 --> 00:25:28.520
<v Speaker 3>have pregnant women in crosshairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says one shot,</v>

589
00:25:28.521 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 3>two kills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these people are fucking sick.</v>

590
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes there is.</v>

591
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IDF soldier,</v>

592
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:38.210
<v Speaker 3>pregnant women tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also have cross hairs of a babies.</v>

593
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

594
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.080
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then not only that,</v>

595
00:25:42.081 --> 00:25:47.081
<v Speaker 3>but on top of all of this happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have colonial settlers who come down</v>

596
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:48.560
<v Speaker 3>and they're cheering them on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

597
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:51.080
<v Speaker 3>this is the best show in town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sitting there drinking coffee</v>

598
00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 3>and beer and just cheering on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>massacre that's been going on for four</v>

599
00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:56.030
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

600
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.290
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

601
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.510
<v Speaker 3>I want to shot to kills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

602
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

603
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 3>So to stand with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that organization,</v>

604
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.140
<v Speaker 3>that is a crazy fucking tee shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

605
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.230
<v Speaker 3>So stand with us and all these other</v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations that work on the behalf of</v>

606
00:26:12.231 --> 00:26:14.960
<v Speaker 3>the Israeli government to try to smear</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone who criticizes it.</v>

607
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Your time is up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

608
00:26:16.161 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 3>People are waking up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just keep executing people on</v>

609
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:21.490
<v Speaker 3>camera and getting away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

610
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.430
<v Speaker 3>if stand with us means stand with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>snipers shooting kids from a sniper</v>

611
00:26:25.431 --> 00:26:27.050
<v Speaker 3>scope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are they doing this?</v>

612
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.290
<v Speaker 3>They want to terrorize and put fear in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hearts of these people.</v>

613
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:34.070
<v Speaker 3>They don't want them to protest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want them to sub submit,</v>

614
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:38.780
<v Speaker 3>they want them to submit and they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically have dehumanize them to</v>

615
00:26:38.781 --> 00:26:39.830
<v Speaker 3>the point where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

616
00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:42.440
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't put a kid in a sniper scope</v>

617
00:26:42.441 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 3>and kill him unless you are.</v>

618
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 3>You have completely dehumanized them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where you think that he's an</v>

619
00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:48.330
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

620
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.160
<v Speaker 3>and that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just how it works.</v>

621
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean there had been so dehumanized</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

622
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:55.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not even funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what these people are asking is,</v>

623
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.840
<v Speaker 3>is very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want the right to return,</v>

624
00:26:57.841 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 3>which is authorized by the UN.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the refugees were expelled in 1948</v>

625
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 3>715 turned to Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right to return to Israel and live</v>

626
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:07.770
<v Speaker 3>as equal citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about,</v>

627
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ball like it's not about expelling the</v>

628
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Jews or people who live there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about living and coexisting and</v>

629
00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:16.740
<v Speaker 3>having equal rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because right now there is an apartheid</v>

630
00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 3>state where there's 50 discriminatory</v>
<v Speaker 3>laws within Israel proper.</v>

631
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Not to mention the fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Westbank sender,</v>

632
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Israeli military law not dimension the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that Gaza is an open air prison.</v>

633
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.450
<v Speaker 3>So within Israel proper there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>apartheid too.</v>

634
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.840
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sick.</v>

635
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 3>We are sponsoring this with $10 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>a day is real,</v>

636
00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:38.310
<v Speaker 3>would not survive without the US,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I focused on ending the u s</v>

637
00:27:38.311 --> 00:27:39.150
<v Speaker 3>empire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm like,</v>

638
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.730
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter if everyone in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world boycotts Israel,</v>

639
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 3>we're still going to subsidize the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whores and the daily atrocities with our</v>

640
00:27:46.201 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 3>tax dollars and they're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

641
00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Speaker 3>And that's why this is so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>brazen.</v>

642
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have we been vindicated,</v>

643
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I can't think of another.</v>

644
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean what else have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has anyone done something this brazen?</v>

645
00:27:57.271 --> 00:27:59.700
<v Speaker 3>Committing an ongoing massacre for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>month straight.</v>

646
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Just sniping people who are completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>on an armed.</v>

647
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.460
<v Speaker 3>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I can think of that's</v>

648
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 3>slightly similar is when Israeli</v>
<v Speaker 3>commandos hijack that boat,</v>

649
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 3>there was a flotilla going to Gaza to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring wheelchairs because they don't</v>

650
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 3>allow wheelchairs in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can be construed as a weapon.</v>

651
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Even though there's done tons of</v>
<v Speaker 3>amputees.</v>

652
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.420
<v Speaker 3>There was a boat going with aid workers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were bringing aid supplies and</v>

653
00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:25.170
<v Speaker 3>commandos jumped on the ship like</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter down and just started</v>

654
00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:30.171
<v Speaker 3>executing like people humanitarians that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to bring Gaza aid.</v>

655
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 3>And the news made it seem like there</v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

656
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.010
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at these people on the boat,</v>

657
00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:37.470
<v Speaker 3>like hitting them with chairs and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

658
00:28:37.471 --> 00:28:40.410
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucking propelled onto the boat and</v>

659
00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:42.810
<v Speaker 3>started executing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you're going to use whatever</v>

660
00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 3>you can to try to like ward off these</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers.</v>

661
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:47.880
<v Speaker 3>So that's the only other thing and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that really woke me up to the whole</v>

662
00:28:47.881 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 3>situation is when I saw how the media</v>
<v Speaker 3>was covering that massacre.</v>

663
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.690
<v Speaker 3>So now seeing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

664
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they're getting away</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

665
00:28:55.771 --> 00:28:58.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how people have not woken</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to this,</v>

666
00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:00.810
<v Speaker 3>but the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that they're covering it is</v>

667
00:29:00.811 --> 00:29:03.810
<v Speaker 3>atrocious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying there's clashes there</v>

668
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:06.000
<v Speaker 3>saying that the Palestinians are dying</v>
<v Speaker 3>of head wounds.</v>

669
00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:06.391
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

670
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Speaker 3>just say that they were executed with</v>
<v Speaker 3>sniper scopes.</v>

671
00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:10.710
<v Speaker 3>Like this is deliberate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

672
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.550
<v Speaker 3>but the way that the media plays around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uses this passive voice is just not</v>

673
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:17.000
<v Speaker 3>just whether it's Palestine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Venezuela's,</v>

674
00:29:17.001 --> 00:29:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you have like complete,</v>

675
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:22.860
<v Speaker 3>complete media uniformity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just peddling align,</v>

676
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.560
<v Speaker 3>probably the truth is somewhere on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other side,</v>

677
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.810
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is Israel want?</v>

678
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.450
<v Speaker 1>But as a state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what do they want from the</v>

679
00:29:32.451 --> 00:29:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Palestinians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they expect?</v>

680
00:29:34.221 --> 00:29:37.880
<v Speaker 1>They expect to just keep the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep business going as usual.</v>

681
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Never let those people live a normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

682
00:29:40.071 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Like what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they and why do they have so</v>

683
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:45.490
<v Speaker 1>much hate and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why haven't the Israeli people like</v>

684
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:47.590
<v Speaker 1>seeing the horrors of this and rebelled?</v>

685
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a leftist in Israel,</v>

686
00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult.</v>

687
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:53.500
<v Speaker 3>And to be an anti Zionist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even more difficult because you're</v>

688
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 3>rejecting your entire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I know religion as well as your</v>

689
00:29:56.921 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 3>political identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

690
00:29:58.091 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a settler colonial state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

691
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of other,</v>

692
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things in,</v>

693
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 3>in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is different because it's</v>

694
00:30:04.601 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 3>ongoing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ever since the inception of Israel</v>

695
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:09.940
<v Speaker 3>to today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the colonizers who colonized that land</v>

696
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.500
<v Speaker 3>always knew that there was an indigenous</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arab population that they wanted to kill</v>

697
00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:15.720
<v Speaker 3>or expel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

698
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.970
<v Speaker 3>and that's still the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like from Ben Gurion himself,</v>

699
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:20.620
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the original,</v>

700
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prime minister of Israel.</v>

701
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:24.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said there's so many Arabs here when</v>

702
00:30:24.121 --> 00:30:25.930
<v Speaker 3>you do expel them and take them there</v>
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>

703
00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 3>So it was never a land without a people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a people without a land.</v>

704
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:32.740
<v Speaker 3>It was always overrun with Arabs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've always just wanted to expel the</v>

705
00:30:32.741 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 3>indigenous population so they can have</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ethno supremacist state.</v>

706
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 3>And that's really what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is.</v>

707
00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's how can you be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

708
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 1>but can you be a Muslim and live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel?</v>

709
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Can you be a Muslim and live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem?</v>

710
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>

711
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many discriminatory laws</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

712
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.330
<v Speaker 3>that basically it's an apartheid state</v>
<v Speaker 3>for non Jews.</v>

713
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 3>Like in what way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are the laws that,</v>

714
00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there,</v>

715
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.560
<v Speaker 3>there's so many things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people can check out,</v>

716
00:30:59.561 --> 00:31:01.600
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would really recommend the work of</v>

717
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:06.690
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] and Ronny Bark in there to</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti Zionist Israeli born Jews who have</v>

718
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.300
<v Speaker 3>extensively talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

719
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:09.971
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

720
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:12.640
<v Speaker 3>just in the roads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's settler only roads compared</v>

721
00:31:12.641 --> 00:31:14.390
<v Speaker 3>to Palestinian only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

722
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Compared to Palestinian roads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have different license plates,</v>

723
00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.970
<v Speaker 3>you have different ID cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

724
00:31:18.971 --> 00:31:22.630
<v Speaker 3>so if you are segregated schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just all that stuff.</v>

725
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.430
<v Speaker 3>So you can't go to regular school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

726
00:31:24.431 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

727
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's so segregated and hostile and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so indoctrinated from an early</v>

728
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:33.640
<v Speaker 3>age to basically hate these people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of them as the other.</v>

729
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I encourage everyone to check out</v>

730
00:31:35.531 --> 00:31:38.530
<v Speaker 3>interviews that I did with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with just average Israelis in the</v>

731
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 3>streets because the genocidal rhetoric</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very apparent and it's very open and</v>

732
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.950
<v Speaker 3>these people weren't talking to anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

733
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

734
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Checkout Abby Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

735
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Israelis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>candid,</v>

736
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.560
<v Speaker 3>candid interview with Shirley.</v>

737
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.560
<v Speaker 1>One Opinion of that situation before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>went there and then a different one</v>

738
00:31:55.561 --> 00:31:56.580
<v Speaker 1>after you came back.</v>

739
00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what Palestine was</v>

740
00:31:58.301 --> 00:32:01.090
<v Speaker 3>until I was 18 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when people say,</v>

741
00:32:01.091 --> 00:32:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're only telling us one side of the</v>

742
00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:02.891
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

743
00:32:02.891 --> 00:32:07.030
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know the Palestine side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>story until I was an adult,</v>

744
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.840
<v Speaker 3>which really you should say something</v>
<v Speaker 3>about our education system and our media</v>

745
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.690
<v Speaker 3>when you completely obfuscate an entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

746
00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:16.900
<v Speaker 3>And our only told one side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

747
00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:17.940
<v Speaker 3>but before I went there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

748
00:32:17.941 --> 00:32:19.120
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

749
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a conception of what it was,</v>

750
00:32:21.251 --> 00:32:24.550
<v Speaker 3>but once you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really see how much worse it is.</v>

751
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:26.980
<v Speaker 3>So this is really party approves</v>
<v Speaker 3>annexation plan.</v>

752
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.581
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Two minutes.</v>

758
00:32:40.611 --> 00:32:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people after this,</v>

759
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>

760
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.170
<v Speaker 3>And what do you ask you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

761
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:49.260
<v Speaker 3>this is good too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

762
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.910
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got to start playing here.</v>

763
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

764
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.110
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing and also the stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>with us.</v>

765
00:32:55.111 --> 00:32:56.940
<v Speaker 3>People in the Israeli lobby basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

766
00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:58.410
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cherry picked these interviews.</v>

767
00:32:58.411 --> 00:33:00.510
<v Speaker 3>You only picked like genocidal people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to you.</v>

768
00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:03.270
<v Speaker 3>What the hell you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Jerusalem as a place called</v>

769
00:33:03.271 --> 00:33:05.460
<v Speaker 3>tolerance square is a bustling shopping</v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

770
00:33:05.461 --> 00:33:08.940
<v Speaker 3>I spoke to people from all backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all walks of life and I just asked them</v>

771
00:33:08.941 --> 00:33:10.620
<v Speaker 3>very simple questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it like to live here?</v>

772
00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:11.830
<v Speaker 3>How do you deal with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

773
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.350
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

774
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:18.060
<v Speaker 3>and basically they just were very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very readily like comfortable to tell me</v>

775
00:33:18.061 --> 00:33:22.110
<v Speaker 3>very crazy genocidal things on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like no thinking that that would</v>

776
00:33:22.111 --> 00:33:24.450
<v Speaker 3>actually look good for an American</v>
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

777
00:33:24.451 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 3>So keep that in mind out.</v>

778
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are sympathizing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Palestinian plight.</v>

779
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you talk about what it's like to</v>

780
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 2>kind of live in this situation?</v>

781
00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.670
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all it's very hard.</v>

782
00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:42.170
<v Speaker 5>I also am an er visit or good position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's cooled lava against the Jews</v>

783
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:48.240
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't marry Arabs called it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you say the organization was,</v>

784
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.670
<v Speaker 5>did what again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

785
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.630
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is the,</v>

786
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.390
<v Speaker 5>the thing of it is tone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Jews shouldn't marry Arabs shouldn't</v>

787
00:33:57.391 --> 00:33:59.550
<v Speaker 5>marry Arabs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you feel strongly about that?</v>

788
00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:04.850
<v Speaker 5>Because Jews is his special relation</v>
<v Speaker 5>that God give it to the Jews and Jews to</v>

789
00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:08.850
<v Speaker 5>get mixed up together with a different</v>
<v Speaker 5>nation.</v>

790
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:14.370
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>Israelis I have to take over and uh,</v>

791
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:18.340
<v Speaker 5>they have to kick them or kicked him</v>
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>

792
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:23.240
<v Speaker 5>It will be much better</v>
<v Speaker 5>not to,</v>

793
00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.220
<v Speaker 5>not to kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to,</v>

794
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:30.640
<v Speaker 2>to go back to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Arab countries as if they didn't lose</v>

795
00:34:30.641 --> 00:34:32.170
<v Speaker 2>their people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no need to try it.</v>

796
00:34:32.171 --> 00:34:35.290
<v Speaker 2>There's no need to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we can do is one that they,</v>

797
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 2>they do enough harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We retaliate.</v>

798
00:34:36.801 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 2>That's war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the situation that any Jew</v>

799
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:39.770
<v Speaker 2>lives in Israel has to deal with.</v>

800
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.090
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

801
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.740
<v Speaker 2>The Arabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody name and memory</v>

802
00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.450
<v Speaker 2>obliterated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about to get really crazy.</v>

803
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.130
<v Speaker 2>He killed terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be afraid to cause any more</v>

804
00:34:58.131 --> 00:34:59.930
<v Speaker 2>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll be fine.</v>

805
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 2>There'll be in their villages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morgan here,</v>

806
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to live together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything will be just fine.</v>

807
00:35:05.501 --> 00:35:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

808
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.010
<v Speaker 6>Every Arab that doing a terrorism</v>
<v Speaker 6>attack,</v>

809
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.450
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have to kill him.</v>

810
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.480
<v Speaker 6>And not because it's an Arab,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he's a terrorist.</v>

811
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 6>Think he should,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

812
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:19.620
<v Speaker 6>also kick out the family because it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>all begins with the I saying the,</v>

813
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.560
<v Speaker 2>he's wearing a sons of anarchy tee shirt</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

814
00:35:22.561 --> 00:35:24.180
<v Speaker 2>which is just so strange.</v>

815
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:26.360
<v Speaker 6>The kids does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

816
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:27.380
<v Speaker 6>it's families.</v>

817
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:32.600
<v Speaker 5>I made that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

818
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.890
<v Speaker 3>how do you kick out the Arab?</v>

819
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.360
<v Speaker 7>They're getting a mini Manila.</v>

820
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.280
<v Speaker 6>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tell me the words.</v>

821
00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's like,</v>

822
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:43.770
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can click translate.</v>

823
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:46.590
<v Speaker 6>She doesn't want to say it Jesse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really well.</v>

824
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:51.330
<v Speaker 6>I think we should give them a country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're doing any problem,</v>

825
00:35:51.331 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 6>you just going there to give them a</v>
<v Speaker 6>country and then it's going to be a war</v>

826
00:35:55.201 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 6>between countries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

827
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.910
<v Speaker 6>if they gonna throw rockets,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to throw one big one and</v>

828
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 6>done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's any answers.</v>

829
00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:07.170
<v Speaker 6>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's only one way I would carpet bomb</v>

830
00:36:07.171 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the only,</v>

831
00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:13.950
<v Speaker 6>it's the only way you could deal with it</v>
<v Speaker 6>or try to stop them a different way.</v>

832
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 6>It never worked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You mean all Arabs are Gaza or</v>

833
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 6>I I believe that the like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hope to believe that are there or not,</v>

834
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.080
<v Speaker 6>but I do think they are because I never,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

835
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.820
<v Speaker 6>I don't trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One more thing.</v>

836
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:36.070
<v Speaker 6>Do you want to coming up and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 6>only way I believe that the only,</v>

837
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 6>the only way is just to stop it</v>
<v Speaker 6>completely.</v>

838
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.360
<v Speaker 7>I'm things that day we miserable that</v>
<v Speaker 7>they Arab,</v>

839
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.480
<v Speaker 7>he say make it big.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We amen</v>

840
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.710
<v Speaker 3>these terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A tiny to killer.</v>

841
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.060
<v Speaker 3>She's laughing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with friends like,</v>

842
00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

843
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.820
<v Speaker 3>have a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk about this later.</v>

844
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.870
<v Speaker 3>This is reflected in polls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people,</v>

845
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.510
<v Speaker 3>when you look at Israeli society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

846
00:37:07.511 --> 00:37:10.270
<v Speaker 3>it started off as kind of a socialist</v>
<v Speaker 3>project with the Kubota is,</v>

847
00:37:10.271 --> 00:37:14.440
<v Speaker 3>and now it's just turned into a fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a supremacist state where Netanyahu</v>

848
00:37:14.441 --> 00:37:17.470
<v Speaker 3>reflects the true face of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like trump rep reflects the true</v>

849
00:37:17.471 --> 00:37:18.850
<v Speaker 3>face of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this country.</v>

850
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.870
<v Speaker 3>And when it's getting too toxic for even</v>
<v Speaker 3>Natalie Portman to be,</v>

851
00:37:22.871 --> 00:37:23.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

852
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.620
<v Speaker 3>this ambassador to Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that the tide is turning.</v>

853
00:37:26.621 --> 00:37:28.810
<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately there's so much shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

854
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:32.470
<v Speaker 3>Congress hasn't said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just totally support this man.</v>

855
00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.090
<v Speaker 3>And there's weird like bds legislation</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to criminalize basically descent</v>

856
00:37:37.091 --> 00:37:40.600
<v Speaker 3>where you have contractors in Texas</v>
<v Speaker 3>having to sign clauses,</v>

857
00:37:40.601 --> 00:37:44.230
<v Speaker 3>promise that they won't support boycott</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Israel to in order to rebuild</v>

858
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.100
<v Speaker 3>hurricane homes.</v>

859
00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.590
<v Speaker 3>What is bds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boycott divestment sanctions.</v>

860
00:37:47.591 --> 00:37:51.330
<v Speaker 3>It's the movement that Palestinians have</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked us to help them to boycott.</v>

861
00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.290
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what Stephen Hawking was all</v>

862
00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:53.740
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

863
00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.820
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he boycotted,</v>

864
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific conferences in Tel Aviv.</v>

865
00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.580
<v Speaker 3>So this is what we gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we have to fight our government to</v>

866
00:38:00.581 --> 00:38:03.400
<v Speaker 3>stop endorsing these massacres in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>atrocities.</v>

867
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.650
<v Speaker 3>Obviously this attitude that these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have,</v>

868
00:38:05.651 --> 00:38:08.770
<v Speaker 3>it's coming from a place and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about terrorist attacks,</v>

869
00:38:08.771 --> 00:38:11.850
<v Speaker 3>like how many terrorist attacks are</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually happening in Jerusalem or in,</v>

870
00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.330
<v Speaker 3>in Austria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at,</v>

871
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.220
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the breakdown of</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist attacks,</v>

872
00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:16.990
<v Speaker 3>how many are guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers?</v>

873
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.550
<v Speaker 3>And that really gives you an insight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

874
00:38:18.551 --> 00:38:20.380
<v Speaker 3>these people are being occupied</v>
<v Speaker 3>militarily.</v>

875
00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:22.960
<v Speaker 3>The occupation is illegal under</v>
<v Speaker 3>international law.</v>

876
00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and resistance is a lot of times</v>

877
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.220
<v Speaker 3>acceptable under international law when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being illegally occupied.</v>

878
00:38:30.221 --> 00:38:34.810
<v Speaker 3>So you looking at terrorist attacks</v>
<v Speaker 3>against their look,</v>

879
00:38:34.811 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 3>not many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

880
00:38:36.251 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 3>and when you look at the actual amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people who,</v>

881
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.860
<v Speaker 3>when you look at those tears of docs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how many are against soldiers,</v>

882
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.900
<v Speaker 3>like how many stabbing and techs are</v>
<v Speaker 3>against soldiers,</v>

883
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:45.730
<v Speaker 3>the numbers become very different.</v>

884
00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit different in Israel and</v>

885
00:38:48.861 --> 00:38:52.100
<v Speaker 1>they're more unified because the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mandatory military service,</v>

886
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:56.150
<v Speaker 1>it's totally so everyone is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if soldiers are attacked,</v>

887
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.160
<v Speaker 1>citizens are attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all the same thing.</v>

888
00:38:58.161 --> 00:39:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is a soldier in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

889
00:39:00.381 --> 00:39:00.950
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>

890
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:01.311
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

891
00:39:01.311 --> 00:39:04.040
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these are like aren't armed</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers that are</v>

892
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.350
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying everyone identifies with</v>

893
00:39:06.351 --> 00:39:08.660
<v Speaker 1>them because they have to do military</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

894
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

895
00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

896
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing with South Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's places that have mandatory</v>

897
00:39:13.371 --> 00:39:15.680
<v Speaker 1>military service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a totally different idea and</v>

898
00:39:15.681 --> 00:39:19.310
<v Speaker 1>concept of nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they feel like if,</v>

899
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.490
<v Speaker 1>if a military base got attacked in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

900
00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.980
<v Speaker 1>we would think damn soldiers got</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked.</v>

901
00:39:24.981 --> 00:39:29.420
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't necessarily think of it the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way is if say Dallas got attack</v>

902
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:32.750
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrorist attack happened in Dallas,</v>

903
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:35.450
<v Speaker 1>we would think of it as an attack on</v>
<v Speaker 1>American citizens.</v>

904
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Not just military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their military is their citizens</v>

905
00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.480
<v Speaker 1>because mandatory military service.</v>

906
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's really weird is during the</v>

907
00:39:43.221 --> 00:39:47.000
<v Speaker 3>last massacre in Gaza in 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like half of the Israeli soldiers that</v>

908
00:39:47.001 --> 00:39:49.610
<v Speaker 3>died were American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what colonial,</v>

909
00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.270
<v Speaker 3>that's what the colonial settlers are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

910
00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:54.740
<v Speaker 3>they go over there from New Jersey and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just post up and top of nerve</v>

911
00:39:54.741 --> 00:39:58.550
<v Speaker 3>village and this is what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's off of the soldiers that</v>

912
00:39:58.551 --> 00:39:59.900
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where is our consultants?</v>

913
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.420
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not actually sure about that</v>

914
00:40:02.421 --> 00:40:04.400
<v Speaker 3>statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember a lot where I was like,</v>

915
00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:09.060
<v Speaker 3>why are so many Americans going over</v>
<v Speaker 3>their 17 year olds in joining the IDF?</v>

916
00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean how bizarre is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of mentality do you have to</v>

917
00:40:12.411 --> 00:40:16.160
<v Speaker 3>have to move from like a comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 3>suburban Philadelphia to go like move on</v>

918
00:40:16.161 --> 00:40:20.030
<v Speaker 3>top of an Arab village and he's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These Jewish people that are doing this?</v>

919
00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

920
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.100
<v Speaker 3>that want to go back to the motherland.</v>

921
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a huge,</v>

922
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.280
<v Speaker 3>there's always this desire to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherland.</v>

923
00:40:25.281 --> 00:40:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Like it's such a tribal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

924
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.930
<v Speaker 3>the purest form of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conflict,</v>

925
00:40:29.931 --> 00:40:32.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's types the Wailing Wall and</v>

926
00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the spot,</v>

927
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the epicenter of conflict too.</v>

928
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.890
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's so sad that so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>Palestinians can ever go to Jerusalem,</v>

929
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:40.900
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

930
00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.070
<v Speaker 3>one of their holiest sites is there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>their band,</v>

931
00:40:43.071 --> 00:40:46.220
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're banned from everything.</v>

932
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.830
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you're a Palestinian and you live</v>

933
00:40:48.831 --> 00:40:50.180
<v Speaker 3>in Gaza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

934
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.430
<v Speaker 3>you're just stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're stuck forever.</v>

935
00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And that's why these people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people from America,</v>

936
00:40:54.471 --> 00:40:55.301
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why that,</v>

937
00:40:55.301 --> 00:40:56.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why you have this mantra like,</v>

938
00:40:56.841 --> 00:40:57.830
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to die.</v>

939
00:40:57.831 --> 00:41:00.470
<v Speaker 3>They raise their kids to be suicide</v>
<v Speaker 3>bombers know when you're in Gaza,</v>

940
00:41:00.471 --> 00:41:04.490
<v Speaker 3>you are born dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have a life.</v>

941
00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.290
<v Speaker 3>So that's why these people are giving up</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives to send a message to us.</v>

942
00:41:09.291 --> 00:41:11.600
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only reason they're doing</v>

943
00:41:11.601 --> 00:41:14.240
<v Speaker 3>this is to send a message to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>help us.</v>

944
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.030
<v Speaker 3>That's all they can do is use their</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies.</v>

945
00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.590
<v Speaker 1>So their concern is if they open up</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaza,</v>

946
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.060
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that if the Palestinians</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and they live in Israel with</v>

947
00:41:26.061 --> 00:41:28.250
<v Speaker 1>everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're just going to cause trouble</v>

948
00:41:28.251 --> 00:41:30.830
<v Speaker 1>and kill people and create suicide</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs.</v>

949
00:41:30.831 --> 00:41:31.340
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

950
00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.270
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

951
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.110
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though when I and and and the</v>

952
00:41:36.111 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Israeli lobby and the stand with us and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people have said,</v>

953
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:39.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

954
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:42.470
<v Speaker 3>you're portraying us as as really</v>
<v Speaker 3>different than we really are cause they</v>

955
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 3>like to portray themselves as peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loving democratic nation.</v>

956
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Palestinians will say the same thing</v>

957
00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:48.890
<v Speaker 3>about us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not True.</v>

958
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:53.090
<v Speaker 3>I was driving around and subtler plates</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a car that looked like I was a</v>

959
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:58.070
<v Speaker 3>colonial settler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not hear one person say anything</v>

960
00:41:58.071 --> 00:42:00.280
<v Speaker 3>remotely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genocidal about Jewish people I talked</v>

961
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.440
<v Speaker 3>to you look like cheesy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

962
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 3>you could fit right in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fit right in.</v>

963
00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Just move on top of an Arab village.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's nuts and thank you for</v>

964
00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 3>letting me talk about this because it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to talk about it and I'm sure</v>

965
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:16.940
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't easy to get hundreds of of</v>
<v Speaker 3>emails telling you to denounce me and</v>

966
00:42:16.941 --> 00:42:19.220
<v Speaker 3>all that other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been friends for a long time.</v>

967
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

968
00:42:19.991 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not denouncing and you know it's</v>

969
00:42:23.451 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 3>coming from somewhere coordinated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a thing.</v>

970
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of money behind these</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack campaigns</v>

971
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:32.120
<v Speaker 1>and I understand their perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't have the same experience</v>

972
00:42:32.121 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 1>that you've had being over there and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean there's a lot of people over here</v>

973
00:42:36.441 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 1>that are extremely loyal to Israel that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have never stepped foot in Israel.</v>

974
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:41.151
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

975
00:42:41.151 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they haven't experienced what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've experiment,</v>

976
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:49.580
<v Speaker 1>not maybe most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just terrifying to me.</v>

977
00:42:49.581 --> 00:42:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Forget about whether it's Israel or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palestine,</v>

978
00:42:51.921 --> 00:42:53.150
<v Speaker 1>forget about what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

979
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.980
<v Speaker 1>the idea that people could be stuck born</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock in this spot and really have no</v>

980
00:42:57.981 --> 00:43:02.981
<v Speaker 1>recourse and not know where to go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be thought of by people that live</v>

981
00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:06.710
<v Speaker 1>just a few miles away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a subhuman and that the fact that</v>

982
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:09.260
<v Speaker 1>someone can make that t shirt with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet,</v>

983
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 1>two kills and show a pregnant woman with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross hairs on her belly.</v>

984
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 1>That scares the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

985
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:16.090
<v Speaker 1>that is Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

986
00:43:16.091 --> 00:43:21.091
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they can understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this treatment of the Palestinians in</v>

987
00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:26.570
<v Speaker 1>that tee shirt is essentially the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way the Nazis were looking at the choose</v>

988
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.740
<v Speaker 1>is treating people as the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult to understand</v>

989
00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:35.741
<v Speaker 1>quality of human psychology is that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in conflict with another nation,</v>

990
00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 1>another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of them as less than us,</v>

991
00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:42.500
<v Speaker 1>like literally less human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not human.</v>

992
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:45.950
<v Speaker 1>The enemy there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing that we have to stop and it's</v>

993
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:48.620
<v Speaker 1>been a part of warfare since the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time.</v>

994
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so trippy to me about like</v>

995
00:43:51.031 --> 00:43:54.540
<v Speaker 3>the British occupation of Ireland</v>
<v Speaker 3>because these,</v>

996
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've seen that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wind that shakes the barleys.</v>

997
00:43:57.181 --> 00:44:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just nuts because I can see</v>

998
00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.720
<v Speaker 3>like the conflicts around the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

999
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:07.020
<v Speaker 3>the other ism is usually someone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks different than you and,</v>

1000
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:11.010
<v Speaker 3>but this is like all white dudes who</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all speak the same language and</v>

1001
00:44:11.011 --> 00:44:13.350
<v Speaker 3>they're just massacring each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.670
<v Speaker 3>I was in Belfast a few years back</v>

1003
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.160
<v Speaker 1>show out there and after the show we</v>
<v Speaker 1>went outside and the cars,</v>

1004
00:44:20.161 --> 00:44:23.430
<v Speaker 1>the police cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they looked like they were in the</v>

1005
00:44:23.431 --> 00:44:25.620
<v Speaker 1>craziest fucking war zone you'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

1006
00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:27.510
<v Speaker 1>The first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire thing,</v>

1007
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:31.140
<v Speaker 1>the front of the car was completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in thick steel.</v>

1008
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.350
<v Speaker 1>They had this big steel grate over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>windshield.</v>

1009
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 1>They are bomb like bomb shielding all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the car.</v>

1010
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.290
<v Speaker 1>We were looking at the cop car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

1011
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:41.550
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1012
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when the IRA was bombing.</v>

1013
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.400
<v Speaker 1>This is what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just started setting everything up</v>

1014
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:50.330
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking to this driver in</v>

1015
00:44:50.331 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Speaker 1>the driver was explaining to us what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be like when,</v>

1016
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were at war and what people had</v>

1017
00:44:58.381 --> 00:45:01.320
<v Speaker 1>done to people that knew him and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1018
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:04.230
<v Speaker 1>just people that look incredibly similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>to each other.</v>

1019
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Again speaking the same language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gutting each other in the street,</v>

1020
00:45:08.401 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 1>torturing each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing each other,</v>

1021
00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 1>protestants versus Catholics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's that thing that humans do</v>

1022
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:19.910
<v Speaker 1>where they treat an enemy as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than them the other and just decide</v>

1023
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:23.430
<v Speaker 1>that that's the red team and we're the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue team.</v>

1024
00:45:23.431 --> 00:45:26.310
<v Speaker 1>So fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that is a scary,</v>

1025
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.560
<v Speaker 1>creepy fucking thing that humans are</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of.</v>

1026
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1027
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused about the whole religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1028
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.220
<v Speaker 1>like how it grew into a religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

1029
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Because originally it was just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>British colonial overlords,</v>

1030
00:45:38.341 --> 00:45:41.730
<v Speaker 1>like harassing the fucking beating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell and raping women to her,</v>

1031
00:45:41.731 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 1>just Irish and these villages and towns</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1032
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 1>how much can you subjugate other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put them in cages like in Gaza or do</v>

1033
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:53.880
<v Speaker 1>this and harass them and humiliate them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and told they'd do something about it.</v>

1034
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just the nature of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

1035
00:45:56.611 --> 00:45:59.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't cage people well if anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>

1036
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.800
<v Speaker 1>If you really want peace on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wa,</v>

1037
00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that really possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1038
00:46:06.511 --> 00:46:08.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a question like we're so</v>

1039
00:46:08.131 --> 00:46:12.690
<v Speaker 1>tribal and people are so committed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their side and then their team and is it</v>

1040
00:46:12.691 --> 00:46:17.691
<v Speaker 1>ever possible to eliminate all war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first step has got to be you.</v>

1041
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:23.520
<v Speaker 1>We have to be able to identify with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people and see their plight and</v>

1042
00:46:23.521 --> 00:46:25.560
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in their position.</v>

1043
00:46:25.561 --> 00:46:28.410
<v Speaker 1>If you are born in Gaza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were born,</v>

1044
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Speaker 1>you know in Northern Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in back when the war was going on,</v>

1045
00:46:31.471 --> 00:46:34.440
<v Speaker 1>if you were born and big pickups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick a spot where there's a conflict.</v>

1046
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be able to realize like we</v>
<v Speaker 1>got lucky.</v>

1047
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.020
<v Speaker 1>You got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got lucky.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We live in California.</v>

1049
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 1>You've got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got lucky.</v>

1050
00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I was born in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got lucky.</v>

1051
00:46:43.561 --> 00:46:45.420
<v Speaker 1>We're not in Gaza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got lucky.</v>

1052
00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:47.160
<v Speaker 1>We're not where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it is,</v>

1053
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.310
<v Speaker 1>wherever the conflict is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't see that,</v>

1054
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:54.270
<v Speaker 1>if you've blocked off that aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your perception that that is,</v>

1055
00:46:54.271 --> 00:46:59.271
<v Speaker 1>this is a classic trait that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have exhibited since probably the</v>

1056
00:47:01.021 --> 00:47:06.021
<v Speaker 1>beginning of tribal life to be getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like organized groups of people</v>

1057
00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:09.560
<v Speaker 1>living together in a community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting against all outsiders and so</v>

1058
00:47:09.561 --> 00:47:14.130
<v Speaker 1>almost like ingrained in our DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we stay alive is anybody who is</v>

1059
00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.450
<v Speaker 1>outside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>

1060
00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Literally like,</v>

1062
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.040

<v Speaker 1>that's how crazy.</v>

1063

<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1068
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean that and no one says that.</v>

1069
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't look at it like human beings.</v>

1070
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:37.450
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we rely on information,</v>

1071
00:47:37.451 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rely on like,</v>

1072
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going on.</v>

1073
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:40.683
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

1074
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible] most of us don't know.</v>

1075
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.380
<v Speaker 1>You're just driving in your car or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing your life.</v>

1076
00:47:45.381 --> 00:47:47.560
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really not getting information</v>

1077
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 1>from all over the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people accurately even</v>

1078
00:47:51.191 --> 00:47:56.191
<v Speaker 1>understand why North Korea hates us so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much and what do the amount of fucking</v>

1079
00:47:57.101 --> 00:48:01.480
<v Speaker 1>shit we dropped on them during the war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>20% of their population.</v>

1080
00:48:01.481 --> 00:48:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Percent.</v>

1081
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Imagine millions of Americans is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're like,</v>

1082
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:07.400
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Wacky Kim John Boone,</v>

1083
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:09.340
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear what he did?</v>

1084
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has Dennis Rodman comes over there.</v>

1085
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:13.900
<v Speaker 1>They played basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1086
00:48:13.901 --> 00:48:17.980
<v Speaker 1>that's literally most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the extent of their understanding</v>

1087
00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 1>of why North Korea distrust the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

1088
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 1>After we decimated the entire country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the infrastructure drop napalm over</v>

1089
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:27.400
<v Speaker 1>the entire country where we actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>retreated only because there was no</v>

1090
00:48:27.401 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure left to bomb.</v>

1091
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.760
<v Speaker 1>And for the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1092
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 1>70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea has literally been building</v>

1093
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:37.720
<v Speaker 1>up defenses to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to prepare for the next time that they</v>

1094
00:48:37.721 --> 00:48:39.100
<v Speaker 1>know that that will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

1095
00:48:39.101 --> 00:48:40.120
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the one,</v>

1096
00:48:40.121 --> 00:48:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this crazy military fascist</v>

1097
00:48:42.491 --> 00:48:43.031
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1098
00:48:43.031 --> 00:48:44.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1099
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason behind all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1100
00:48:46.421 --> 00:48:49.510
<v Speaker 1>They don't happen in a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading an article today about how</v>

1101
00:48:49.511 --> 00:48:54.511
<v Speaker 1>their nuclear test site is imploding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they've blown up so much over there</v>

1102
00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 1>that the fucking grounds caving and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're opening up a portal of the hell.</v>

1103
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to blow a hole through the earth,</v>

1104
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.640
<v Speaker 1>but something really good could come out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it with the peace talks,</v>

1105
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.760
<v Speaker 1>president moon of South Korea and Kim</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jong noon.</v>

1106
00:49:06.761 --> 00:49:08.980
<v Speaker 1>And now trump is forced to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to jump on board.</v>

1107
00:49:08.981 --> 00:49:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And if trump can can pull this off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then more power to them.</v>

1108
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gotta be so strange to North</v>

1109
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Koreans and South Koreans looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same,</v>

1110
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:18.640
<v Speaker 1>staring at each other across the lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1111
00:49:18.641 --> 00:49:21.310
<v Speaker 1>back when I was competing and taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1112
00:49:21.311 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1113
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Koreans are extremely nationalistic and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1114
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:29.290
<v Speaker 1>the South Koreans and the North Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1115
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 1>they would occasionally compete in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>

1116
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.310
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1117
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:38.340
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be so bizarre to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you zigged you for your ancestor</v>

1118
00:49:39.021 --> 00:49:43.750
<v Speaker 1>zigged instead of zagged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were born like 50 miles that way</v>

1119
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 1>you'd be North Korean and you'd be stuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the ruling of this fucking wacky</v>

1120
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:51.550
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead you're over here making</v>

1121
00:49:51.551 --> 00:49:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Samsung phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1122
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first couple of decades,</v>

1123
00:49:55.241 --> 00:49:59.050
<v Speaker 1>South Korea was ruled by dictators who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were just as crazy.</v>

1124
00:49:59.051 --> 00:50:01.060
<v Speaker 1>So this whole like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh were we weren't friends with him</v>

1125
00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 1>because of him being a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1126
00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:03.221
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

1127
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:04.090
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1128
00:50:04.091 --> 00:50:04.541
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1129
00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:09.541

<v Speaker 1>supported makes kickass electronics and</v>

1130
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.890
<v Speaker 1>they're addicted to plastic surgery.</v>

1131
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen what they're doing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's eyes over there?</v>

1132
00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:16.240
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

1133
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Women in South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so common that they get their eyes</v>

1134
00:50:21.671 --> 00:50:22.990
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get their eyes done,</v>

1135
00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:27.991
<v Speaker 1>like an anime character was like white</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cut their lids cut and pulled up so</v>

1136
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:34.931
<v Speaker 1>that they have these giant Western eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exaggerated and it's so common that</v>

1137
00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:39.020
<v Speaker 1>it like if you didn't know any better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think that this is like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ago when I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was just a girl that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like that.</v>

1145
00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not even a good example that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that girl still looks Asian.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but there's some,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like they're doing this strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with their eyes or their making</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1157
00:51:35.271 --> 00:51:37.760
<v Speaker 1>that's so much more eye lashes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1158
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this girl.</v>

1159
00:51:40.381 --> 00:51:41.290
<v Speaker 1>That's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1160
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but afterwards she gets so much more</v>

1161
00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:44.834
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

1162
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

1163
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why genetically their eyes are</v>

1164
00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:54.680
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting to think of like</v>

1165
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:57.620
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we know that the reason why people</v>

1166
00:51:57.621 --> 00:52:01.820
<v Speaker 1>in England and Ireland and in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern climates like why they became</v>

1167
00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:04.010
<v Speaker 1>so pale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became so pale because they had a</v>

1168
00:52:04.011 --> 00:52:06.280
<v Speaker 1>very strong lack of vitamin D because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no sun,</v>

1169
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.930
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there they basically like a reflector</v>

1170
00:52:08.931 --> 00:52:11.810
<v Speaker 1>for the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to absorb as much sun as</v>

1171
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:16.280
<v Speaker 1>possible because they live in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>cloudy area as opposed to our great,</v>

1172
00:52:16.281 --> 00:52:18.440
<v Speaker 1>great ancestors lived in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1173
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 1>that's literally why white people exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just Africans with the lack of</v>

1174
00:52:22.731 --> 00:52:25.370
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So racism as a construct.</v>

1175
00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most certainly is.</v>

1176
00:52:26.871 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>But it's also observable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1177
00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a clear ancestral origin to</v>

1178
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.410
<v Speaker 1>certain body types and diets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's certain people that live in</v>

1179
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:39.830
<v Speaker 1>parts of West Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just fucking phenomenal runners</v>

1180
00:52:39.831 --> 00:52:43.400
<v Speaker 1>and there's no denying that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain traits that people have that you</v>

1181
00:52:43.401 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 1>can clearly say.</v>

1182
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I think the real problem is when we say</v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

1183
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>like the real prime and then that gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>us tribal again.</v>

1184
00:52:49.161 --> 00:52:52.310
<v Speaker 1>That's us versus them again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just humans.</v>

1185
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just humans that that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one race.</v>

1186
00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.400
<v Speaker 1>But humans that live in high altitude</v>
<v Speaker 1>climates that are much more adapted to</v>

1187
00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:05.390
<v Speaker 1>low oxygen environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans that live in like the inuits that</v>

1188
00:53:05.391 --> 00:53:08.510
<v Speaker 1>live in extreme cold climates and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>no access to vegetables,</v>

1189
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.570
<v Speaker 1>they adapt to this specific fat rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

1190
00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Their hands are less likely to get cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually developed like a genetic</v>

1191
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.220
<v Speaker 1>predisposition to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1192
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:22.820
<v Speaker 1>for their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to withstand cold with</v>

1193
00:53:22.821 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 1>their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we would go over there and we</v>

1194
00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:26.150
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our hands would be normally</v>

1195
00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:26.461
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1196
00:53:26.461 --> 00:53:26.761
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1197
00:53:26.761 --> 00:53:27.091
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1198
00:53:27.091 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

1199
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:29.520
<v Speaker 2>And they would just be like playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>piano and shit.</v>

1200
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Like it wouldn't even bother them like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1201
00:53:31.651 --> 00:53:32.730
<v Speaker 2>This is genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1202
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:34.260
<v Speaker 2>this is because their bodies have</v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted.</v>

1203
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 2>But there one race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just humans are malleable.</v>

1204
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:40.190
<v Speaker 2>We're super flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1205
00:53:40.191 --> 00:53:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see that in your lifetime,</v>

1206
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:42.391
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1207
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 2>if someone works out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they develop more muscle that gets</v>

1208
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:47.880
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the concept of</v>

1209
00:53:47.881 --> 00:53:50.520
<v Speaker 2>epigenetics and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility that some of these</v>

1210
00:53:50.521 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 2>traits and some of these learned</v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors you're passing onto your</v>

1211
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:56.790
<v Speaker 2>children through genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see an animal planet.</v>

1212
00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 2>What do we mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it a show?</v>

1213
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a show that it shows how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1214
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:05.760
<v Speaker 2>animals and the symbiotic relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>between humans and animals.</v>

1215
00:54:05.761 --> 00:54:09.300
<v Speaker 2>It's really insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a whole [inaudible] section,</v>

1216
00:54:09.301 --> 00:54:10.440
<v Speaker 2>but there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1217
00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:15.441
<v Speaker 2>tribes and the jungle and stuff who will</v>
<v Speaker 2>work with birds to get beehives and the</v>

1218
00:54:15.661 --> 00:54:17.460
<v Speaker 2>birds will get the reward and get some</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1219
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 2>And then if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if you don't give them any</v>

1220
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they'll trick you and take you to</v>

1221
00:54:20.761 --> 00:54:22.240
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not beehive tree.</v>

1222
00:54:22.241 --> 00:54:23.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just nuts.</v>

1223
00:54:23.431 --> 00:54:28.431
<v Speaker 2>And then helping humans fish and man</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue planet two is also fuck fucking</v>

1224
00:54:29.881 --> 00:54:31.430
<v Speaker 2>nominal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>

1225
00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.460
<v Speaker 2>You would love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1226
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.250
<v Speaker 2>There's an optimist who makes a sea</v>
<v Speaker 2>shell suit.</v>

1227
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.090
<v Speaker 2>He literally makes it suit of armor out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shells to block themselves from a</v>

1228
00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:40.890
<v Speaker 2>shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>

1229
00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.650
<v Speaker 2>One super nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Animals are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1231
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.810
<v Speaker 2>they're weird and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1232
00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:48.300
<v Speaker 2>we're animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't like to think we are because we</v>

1233
00:54:48.301 --> 00:54:51.330
<v Speaker 2>can talk and sing songs and Shit and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>her eyes done,</v>

1234
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:55.560
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're animals and some sort of strange</v>

1235
00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.270
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the same as trump.</v>

1236
00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the big boxy suits somehow?</v>

1237
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:01.740
<v Speaker 2>He's got a good ass Taylor man.</v>

1238

<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1239
00:55:03.031 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 2>obese is the trump statute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie and I were talking about it</v>

1240
00:55:06.301 --> 00:55:08.610
<v Speaker 2>yesterday in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was it?</v>

1241
00:55:08.611 --> 00:55:11.970
<v Speaker 2>The presidential house of wax or some</v>
<v Speaker 2>show?</v>

1243
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:16.160
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like punking him.</v>

1244
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.430
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

<v Speaker 2>let me look at it though.</v>

1246
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make that larger so he could see what it</v>

1247
00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:24.600
<v Speaker 2>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Operation Fuck trump.</v>

1248
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Trump debuts at Disney world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you,</v>

1249
00:55:27.601 --> 00:55:29.490
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look anything like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1250
00:55:29.491 --> 00:55:30.750
<v Speaker 2>if I was the person who created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1251
00:55:30.751 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's George Washington seems normal.</v>

1252
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.710
<v Speaker 2>But look at the trump one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck is that?</v>

1254
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.280
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look anything like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1255
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.440
<v Speaker 2>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to Jamie,</v>

1256
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.760
<v Speaker 2>he looks like he's like 20 years older</v>
<v Speaker 2>than he is.</v>

1257
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't even look like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean whoever that artist is like he's</v>

1258
00:55:47.881 --> 00:55:50.610
<v Speaker 2>gotta be punking him is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is no way.</v>

1259
00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:55.200
<v Speaker 2>He liked did some weird shit to his jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His jaws like extended and creepy.</v>

1260
00:55:55.201 --> 00:55:57.900
<v Speaker 2>He made his neck skin is the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>artists that did the Chris John Rowe,</v>

1261
00:55:57.901 --> 00:55:59.550
<v Speaker 2>not Chris Johnno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Renaldo,</v>

1262
00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bust.</v>

1263
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.600
<v Speaker 2>You saw that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks pretty much the same.</v>

1264
00:56:03.601 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 2>And so you didn't find a photo of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in high res photos is a low res</v>

1265
00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:10.320
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to see how shitty it is.</v>

1266
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.110
<v Speaker 2>But it's so shitty that it looks fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1267
00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:15.010
<v Speaker 2>like no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not really the one.</v>

1268
00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:15.810
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one,</v>

1269
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:18.690
<v Speaker 2>they fucking commissioned an artist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the artist's creation.</v>

1270
00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Whereas this animatronic wax museum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1271
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.810
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going over is in Disney world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disney land.</v>

1272
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:28.410
<v Speaker 2>So inbred looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1273
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 2>do you think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking bread.</v>

1274
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Eric Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks odd.</v>

1275
00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:34.830
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he has no upper like look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that.</v>

1276
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1277
00:56:36.131 --> 00:56:38.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're talking him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1278
00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 2>But either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good or bad.</v>

1279
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:45.200
<v Speaker 2>This is clearly a little bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that if Hillary,</v>

1280
00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not tell me that.</v>

1281
00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:48.430
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1282
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.860
<v Speaker 2>This is the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy who did the Obama one,</v>

1283
00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 2>this terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just saw I could do better than</v>

1284
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:53.830
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's fucking knocked off wax</v>

1285
00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:54.664
<v Speaker 2>museum.</v>

1286
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Look how bad that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't look anything like him.</v>

1287
00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great that they can do like Jeff</v>

1288
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 2>for sin and Lincoln and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause all they had was drawings.</v>

1289
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:09.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

1290
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:10.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty bad.</v>

1291
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how we got onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1292
00:57:12.881 --> 00:57:15.020
<v Speaker 2>humans malleable humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1293
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping,</v>

1294
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:21.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like slavery doesn't exist anymore</v>

1295
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.150
<v Speaker 2>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least.</v>

1296
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that as time goes on there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be less tribalism and that as</v>

1297
00:57:27.011 --> 00:57:30.180
<v Speaker 2>human beings are able to freely travel</v>
<v Speaker 2>and communicate with each other,</v>

1298
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:31.480
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be dealing with less of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1299
00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:35.020
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it sad that it seems like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost getting worse even though we have</v>

1300
00:57:35.021 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 2>all the information available at our</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingertips,</v>

1301
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:39.430
<v Speaker 2>we're still like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just elected someone who basically</v>

1302
00:57:39.431 --> 00:57:43.210
<v Speaker 2>got famous politically because he said</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama was a secret Muslim and Kenyon</v>

1303
00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:45.860
<v Speaker 1>people love hearing that Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love hearing that shit and they</v>

1304
00:57:45.861 --> 00:57:47.840
<v Speaker 1>don't want to hear anything differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what's going on right now?</v>

1305
00:57:47.841 --> 00:57:50.280
<v Speaker 1>But she yeti coolers and the NRA?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1306
00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:55.550
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating because this just shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>how tribal and crazy people get yeti</v>

1307
00:57:55.551 --> 00:57:58.400
<v Speaker 1>coolers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They canceled some,</v>

1308
00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 1>they had these programs like go to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1309
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know my friend Ben O'brien's</v>

1310
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.760
<v Speaker 1>instagram?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>

1311
00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it on Adam Green trees and we'll,</v>

1312
00:58:10.661 --> 00:58:11.660
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could read it,</v>

1313
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:13.340
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Yeti did,</v>

1314
00:58:13.341 --> 00:58:17.240
<v Speaker 1>they discontinued these Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they,</v>

1315
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:19.670
<v Speaker 1>the way they describe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe the program,</v>

1316
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but they had a bunch of outdated um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive programs where like,</v>

1317
00:58:25.451 --> 00:58:26.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you signed up for something and</v>

1318
00:58:26.991 --> 00:58:28.730
<v Speaker 1>get a discount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a discounted program,</v>

1319
00:58:28.731 --> 00:58:31.810
<v Speaker 1>here it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cow outdated discounting program</v>

1320
00:58:31.811 --> 00:58:36.740
<v Speaker 1>and Yeti makes super high end coolers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like really expensive,</v>

1321
00:58:36.741 --> 00:58:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but they literally will keep ice for</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1322
00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:43.460
<v Speaker 1>You could put ice in them and go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desert and five days later you have ice</v>

1323
00:58:43.461 --> 00:58:46.800
<v Speaker 1>in that cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not bullshit fucking phenomenon.</v>

1324
00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.580
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal.</v>

1325
00:58:49.581 --> 00:58:52.850
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they notified the NRA and the</v>

1326
00:58:52.851 --> 00:58:55.490
<v Speaker 1>organization has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getty explained to them that they're</v>

1327
00:58:55.491 --> 00:58:59.450
<v Speaker 1>offering an alternative customization</v>
<v Speaker 1>program broadly available to consumers</v>

1328
00:58:59.451 --> 00:59:01.910
<v Speaker 1>and organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the NRA foundation.</v>

1329
00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 1>So then the NRA releases this statement</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Yeti coolers doesn't want to work</v>

1330
00:59:08.301 --> 00:59:10.310
<v Speaker 1>with the NRA anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't support the second</v>

1331
00:59:10.311 --> 00:59:13.430
<v Speaker 1>amendment's of fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people start blowing up their yeti</v>

1332
00:59:13.431 --> 00:59:16.860
<v Speaker 1>coolers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like that Karen coffee maker,</v>

1333
00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.690
<v Speaker 1>they filled the Yeti coolers up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thermite shit.</v>

1334
00:59:20.691 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Or what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that stuff not thermite?</v>

1335
00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:25.760
<v Speaker 1>What's that explosion of Shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Paddock had a bunch of that shit</v>

1336
00:59:25.761 --> 00:59:26.690
<v Speaker 1>in his car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1337
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.500
<v Speaker 1>what does that cricket not whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day is that what it is?</v>

1338
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 1>And yeti support is blown up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeti coolers.</v>

1339
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:33.583
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all done.</v>

1340
00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>coolers.</v>

1341
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.340
<v Speaker 1>You can suck my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm American.</v>

1342
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.100
<v Speaker 1>So they filled it out with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive shit.</v>

1343
00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:45.980
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these coolers are fucking expensive.</v>

1344
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:51.080
<v Speaker 1>There's super engineered and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start at like 300 bucks a so this</v>

1345
00:59:51.081 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 1>is looking at their blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1346
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are just looking for an</v>

1347
00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:58.790
<v Speaker 1>excuse to blow shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a great quote in this</v>

1348
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:00.230
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this article from,</v>

1349
01:00:00.231 --> 01:00:02.780
<v Speaker 1>what does this website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the Washington Post and nuts.</v>

1350
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.771
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1351
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a great quote in this article</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of highlights how fucking</v>

1352
01:00:07.401 --> 01:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>preposterous this all is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all me.</v>

1353
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's The Washington Post</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies stability.</v>

1354
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:14.203
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1355
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I really think is that they want an</v>

1356
01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're happy when something happens.</v>

1357
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>And even though Yeti's explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know their whole fucking business is</v>

1358
01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:28.040
<v Speaker 1>hunters and fishermen and anglers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not anti NRA.</v>

1359
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>They're definitely not anti second</v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment like fucking relaxed.</v>

1360
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:33.260
<v Speaker 1>So even after they put out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

1361
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>the NRA doubled down and released</v>
<v Speaker 1>another statement.</v>

1362
01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made a big mistake and now you're</v>

1363
01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:38.984
<v Speaker 1>paying for it.</v>

1364
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I really think we have a real problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially there's a real problem in</v>

1365
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>that regard because they need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand everybody don't understand</v>

1366
01:00:50.571 --> 01:00:55.571
<v Speaker 1>that we should all anybody that supports</v>
<v Speaker 1>any outdoor activities has to understand</v>

1367
01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>that the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have any internal conflict</v>

1368
01:00:59.691 --> 01:01:00.501
<v Speaker 1>against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1369
01:01:00.501 --> 01:01:02.810
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about hunters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishermen,</v>

1370
01:01:02.811 --> 01:01:06.830
<v Speaker 1>all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their real opposition is is animal</v>

1371
01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>rights activists and radical Animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberation Organization type people.</v>

1372
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the real enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The enemy isn't Yeti coolers,</v>

1373
01:01:15.201 --> 01:01:19.670
<v Speaker 1>who makes their business selling shit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters and fishermen and anglers.</v>

1374
01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Like these people are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this conflict just shows to me like</v>

1375
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>people are just looking for a fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1376
01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:26.961
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1377
01:01:26.961 --> 01:01:29.540
<v Speaker 1>You know how long it takes to get all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking explosive shit and put it</v>

1378
01:01:29.541 --> 01:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>in a cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just happened.</v>

1424
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down a little bit because of the</v>

<v Speaker 2>second amendment like here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down to scroll down so I could</v>

1426
01:03:26.371 --> 01:03:27.620
<v Speaker 2>read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bottom texts has,</v>

1427
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:31.560
<v Speaker 2>so here we find ourselves in the midst</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a dumb as rocks arm race between</v>

1428
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.610
<v Speaker 2>essentially indistinguishable cooler</v>
<v Speaker 2>blend brands all trying to declare their</v>

1429
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:39.870
<v Speaker 2>undying devotion to guns more fervently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then their rivals.</v>

1430
01:03:39.871 --> 01:03:42.450
<v Speaker 2>The whole shit is exactly as stupid as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems.</v>

1431
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 2>And amid the fog of marketing bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bad faith NRA posturing,</v>

1432
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:52.010
<v Speaker 2>there's one truth that none of this can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of this mess can obscure 479 99 is</v>

1433
01:03:52.471 --> 01:03:53.580
<v Speaker 2>too much to pay for a cooler.</v>

1434
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I disagree because there's solid fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>coolers.</v>

1435
01:03:57.930 --> 01:03:58.591
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1436
01:03:58.591 --> 01:04:00.120
<v Speaker 2>they're worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can keep it here,</v>

1437
01:04:00.121 --> 01:04:04.170
<v Speaker 2>using it for what you're using it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go hunting or camping,</v>

1438
01:04:04.171 --> 01:04:08.150
<v Speaker 2>you can keep fucking dairy important to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1445
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:27.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like mass hallucinations on both</v>
<v Speaker 2>sides of the political aisle.</v>

1446
01:04:27.501 --> 01:04:29.850

<v Speaker 2>bordain was tweeting that there's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a rabbit reddit forum with</v>

<v Speaker 2>all these folks and there's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>$40,000.</v>

1457
01:04:58.881 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1458
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.820
<v Speaker 2>the guy who shot a bunch of women in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Barbara a couple of years ago,</v>

1459
01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 2>he was also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so attractive.</v>

1460
01:05:04.411 --> 01:05:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you guys want to have sex with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

1461
01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:06.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1462
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:08.670
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what you look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's healthy,</v>

1463
01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.950
<v Speaker 2>loving relationships that exist for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

1464
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was acuity,</v>

1465
01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.040
<v Speaker 2>the little murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a little cutie.</v>

1466
01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>So it's just crazy when people blame</v>
<v Speaker 2>women in are violent misogynists</v>

1467
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.450
<v Speaker 3>because they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they think that they're unattractive and</v>

1470
01:05:21.491 --> 01:05:24.460
<v Speaker 3>they're basically just blame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like attractive women for not having sex</v>

1471
01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really disturbing.</v>

1472
01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 3>And this guy apparently mowed down a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people in Toronto because he,</v>

1473
01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:30.900
<v Speaker 3>he was one of these people</v>

1474
01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:35.340
<v Speaker 1>insoles creating rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And honestly the sickens me what,</v>

<v Speaker 1>idea that okay here it is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1499
01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.310
<v Speaker 1>but just socially fucked up and</v>

1500
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:41.150
<v Speaker 3>they live on reddit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't leave their basement and this</v>

1501
01:06:41.151 --> 01:06:43.250
<v Speaker 3>is what comes out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really unfortunate.</v>

1502
01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.330
<v Speaker 3>They need to interact with normal people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in society and realize that there's some</v>

1503
01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>someone for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1504
01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:49.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1505
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:53.580
<v Speaker 1>not really though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there.</v>

1506
01:06:53.581 --> 01:06:55.320
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to find an insole.</v>

1507
01:06:55.321 --> 01:06:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Women are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no insult.</v>

1508
01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women can always get laid,</v>

1509
01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:00.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no such something tells me</v>

1510
01:07:00.361 --> 01:07:01.560
<v Speaker 1>there's no insulin and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1511
01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:02.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

1512
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about this term before?</v>

1513
01:07:06.031 --> 01:07:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I did not know about this term before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1514
01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>How many of these terms are out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't know about that are going</v>

1515
01:07:10.011 --> 01:07:10.930
<v Speaker 1>to blow up in our face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1516
01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:11.813
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1517
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:14.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are going to commit massacres and</v>

1518
01:07:14.611 --> 01:07:17.070
<v Speaker 3>then we're going to have to find out</v>
<v Speaker 3>about some other weird subculture on</v>

1519
01:07:17.071 --> 01:07:20.220
<v Speaker 3>reddit that has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's multiple of them.</v>

1520
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:25.830
<v Speaker 3>So fucking weird time to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the weirdest,</v>

1521
01:07:25.831 --> 01:07:27.570
<v Speaker 3>I think in really insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1522
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:29.820
<v Speaker 3>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass hallucination is there's no way</v>

1523
01:07:29.821 --> 01:07:34.530
<v Speaker 3>to have actual dialogue or discourse</v>
<v Speaker 3>about reality because you're a Russian</v>

1524
01:07:34.531 --> 01:07:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Bot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1525
01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:39.090
<v Speaker 3>The liberals have not an a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean the liberals meaning the Neo</v>

1526
01:07:39.091 --> 01:07:41.220
<v Speaker 3>Liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the think tank establishment that people</v>

1527
01:07:41.221 --> 01:07:43.500
<v Speaker 3>that people call leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a misnomer.</v>

1528
01:07:43.501 --> 01:07:46.770
<v Speaker 3>But those people are so in denial about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that trump won,</v>

1529
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:49.830
<v Speaker 3>that they still just have to blame</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia for the fact that trump is our</v>

1530
01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:52.080
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't accept that he won</v>

1531
01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:53.610
<v Speaker 3>democratically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1532
01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's really pathetic that now you</v>

1533
01:07:55.711 --> 01:07:59.790
<v Speaker 3>have them suing the DNC over this</v>
<v Speaker 3>erroneous fraudulent lawsuit that's</v>

1534
01:07:59.791 --> 01:08:01.050
<v Speaker 3>basically threatening press freedom.</v>

1535
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:03.930
<v Speaker 3>They're basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you publish leaks,</v>

1536
01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.420
<v Speaker 3>including trump's tax returns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could even say,</v>

1537
01:08:06.421 --> 01:08:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what journalists do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They publish things that are sure people</v>

1538
01:08:09.121 --> 01:08:11.640
<v Speaker 3>give them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's echoing economic espionage,</v>

1539
01:08:11.641 --> 01:08:13.080
<v Speaker 3>they said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like,</v>

1540
01:08:13.081 --> 01:08:17.000
<v Speaker 3>this has profound implications for press</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's an incredible how desperate</v>

1541
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:17.480
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1542
01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.210
<v Speaker 3>they're slapping a lawsuit on Julian</v>
<v Speaker 3>assange choose still arbitrarily</v>

1543
01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 3>detained in an embassy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1544
01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:25.250
<v Speaker 3>they cut off his internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how's he get online?</v>

1545
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 3>He is not online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1546
01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.000
<v Speaker 3>they basically are trying to force him</v>
<v Speaker 3>out at this point.</v>

1547
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:32.300
<v Speaker 3>And if they forced him out that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to jail him on trumped up charges</v>

1548
01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.730
<v Speaker 3>because they're trying to get them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sex charge.</v>

1549
01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.470
<v Speaker 3>But hasn't that sex charges been</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped?</v>

1550
01:08:36.471 --> 01:08:40.220
<v Speaker 3>It was dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird things about it</v>

1551
01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.480
<v Speaker 3>initially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1552
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1553
01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.490
<v Speaker 3>all I know is that a son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically said that they could not</v>

1554
01:08:46.491 --> 01:08:49.940
<v Speaker 3>promise that he won't be extradited to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the u s which means they will extradite</v>

1555
01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:51.950
<v Speaker 3>him to the U S and we've already had</v>
<v Speaker 3>palm peo,</v>

1556
01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:54.950
<v Speaker 3>who's the psychotic Koch brothers Shill</v>
<v Speaker 3>who just got appointed.</v>

1557
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.113
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said he,</v>

1558
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.910
<v Speaker 3>he wants to basically see Julian assange</v>
<v Speaker 3>go down.</v>

1559
01:08:58.911 --> 01:09:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had harsh words for Julian assange.</v>

1560
01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 3>So even though trump talks out of both</v>
<v Speaker 3>sides of his mouth on the campaign,</v>

1561
01:09:03.561 --> 01:09:04.970
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Wiki leaks.</v>

1562
01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 3>He is going to prosecute him probably to</v>
<v Speaker 3>save his own ass.</v>

1563
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:09.410
<v Speaker 3>And it pretend like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1564
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:10.700
<v Speaker 3>did he say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love wikileaks?</v>

1565
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:12.110
<v Speaker 3>He actually did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1566
01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:15.380
<v Speaker 3>During the campaign he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Julian Assange Bang and Pamela Anderson.</v>

1567
01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:20.990
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he did on Julian hindered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pamela Anderson brought him a bunch of</v>

1568
01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:24.250
<v Speaker 3>Chinese food to the crazier it gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>cray.</v>

1569
01:09:24.251 --> 01:09:27.140
<v Speaker 3>She can never fucking Julian his sons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1570
01:09:27.141 --> 01:09:29.330
<v Speaker 3>Promote Gateway Pundit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's disturbing.</v>

1571
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:30.380
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that,</v>

1572
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the last time I was on,</v>

1573
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:33.860
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you brought up the whole pizzagate thing</v>

1574
01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:35.660
<v Speaker 3>and we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Julian assange has been,</v>

1575
01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.160
<v Speaker 3>I love Wiki leaks.</v>

1576
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:41.030
<v Speaker 3>I think that he's trolling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an irresponsible trolling where</v>

1577
01:09:41.031 --> 01:09:43.220
<v Speaker 3>he's just kind of trying to stir shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1578
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I were joining us on,</v>

1579
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:47.570
<v Speaker 3>who knows how I would feel being pushed</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an embassy.</v>

1580
01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:49.370
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being arbitrarily detained,</v>

1581
01:09:49.371 --> 01:09:52.880
<v Speaker 3>like kind of not being able to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at a shitty wrote.</v>

1582
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he must be going crazy.</v>

1583
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Julian assange literally must be going</v>

1584
01:09:56.631 --> 01:09:57.464
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.430
<v Speaker 3>that was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and embedded myself in the</v>

1809
01:19:03.431 --> 01:19:04.990
<v Speaker 3>protests there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Is the media line about that too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the line about their,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vices on the ground acting like bad</v>

1812
01:19:11.081 --> 01:19:12.520

<v Speaker 3>They're embedding themselves in the</v>

1813
01:19:12.521 --> 01:19:14.860
<v Speaker 3>protest and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at these fucking awesome dudes.</v>

1814

<v Speaker 3>tried to lynn just and we got chased out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the country and then our colleague</v>

<v Speaker 3>got shot because we dare to tell that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1817
01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.710
<v Speaker 3>the death toll that we kept hearing in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream media,</v>

1818
01:19:26.711 --> 01:19:28.600
<v Speaker 3>that Maduro is mowing down all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>protesters,</v>

1819
01:19:28.601 --> 01:19:31.300
<v Speaker 3>we found out that the majority of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dust are actually caused by the</v>

1820
01:19:31.301 --> 01:19:33.790
<v Speaker 3>protesters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like either shooting people,</v>

1821
01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:36.370
<v Speaker 3>lynching people alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>burning them alive,</v>

1822
01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:41.080
<v Speaker 3>or doing these giant roadblock cade's</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they would light giant flaming</v>

1823
01:19:41.081 --> 01:19:43.400
<v Speaker 3>piles of trash and people would be,</v>

<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>

1826

<v Speaker 3>then this lynch mob came after us.</v>

1827
01:19:51.461 --> 01:19:52.990

1842
01:20:26.551 --> 01:20:27.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vice repeats.</v>

1843
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:32.460
<v Speaker 3>He's not an imperial guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying they're lying.</v>

1844
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:33.780
<v Speaker 3>They're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're lying.</v>

1845
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:37.230
<v Speaker 3>The line not lying the line because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1846
01:20:37.231 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 3>I think Obama and Biden are war</v>
<v Speaker 3>criminals.</v>

1847
01:20:39.061 --> 01:20:42.420
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think it's cool as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalist to not challenge power.</v>

1848
01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:45.960
<v Speaker 3>And so when you invite these people into</v>
<v Speaker 3>your office and are really buddy buddy</v>

1849
01:20:45.961 --> 01:20:47.280
<v Speaker 3>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm offended by that.</v>

1850
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:48.990
<v Speaker 3>You're such a radical lefty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

1851
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.750
<v Speaker 3>It's trailing Obama and Biden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a war criminals.</v>

1852
01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Even though the lefties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the lefties,</v>

1853
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.380
<v Speaker 3>they drone King Babe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drone King.</v>

1854
01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was definitely a lot of drone</v>

1855
01:20:59.851 --> 01:21:00.640
<v Speaker 3>desks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1856
01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:03.720
<v Speaker 3>check out a very heavy agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my brother's documentary just goes</v>

1857
01:21:03.721 --> 01:21:06.750
<v Speaker 3>over kind of a lot of stuff about vice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the problem that I have with</v>

1858
01:21:06.751 --> 01:21:08.820
<v Speaker 3>advice is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just like the problem that I have</v>

1859
01:21:08.821 --> 01:21:10.590
<v Speaker 3>with all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all other corporate media,</v>

1860
01:21:10.591 --> 01:21:13.410
<v Speaker 3>like we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always a that's uniform that</v>

1861
01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:16.380
<v Speaker 3>basically promotes the u s empire and</v>
<v Speaker 3>promotes American exceptionalism.</v>

1862
01:21:16.381 --> 01:21:18.120
<v Speaker 3>So clearly you've never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you fuck,</v>

1863
01:21:18.121 --> 01:21:19.740
<v Speaker 3>that's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1864
01:21:19.741 --> 01:21:21.630
<v Speaker 3>what is that best show on Vice</v>

1865
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Wong's world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two?</v>

1866
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:27.170
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Action Bronson is.</v>

1867
01:21:27.171 --> 01:21:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's delicious.</v>

1868
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.140
<v Speaker 1>That's his show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1869
01:21:30.141 --> 01:21:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Action Bronson has the rapper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Yay.</v>

1870
01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't watched it.</v>

1871
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Never had a human being come in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>studio and smoke more weed.</v>

1872
01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Never seen anybody smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd just non stop.</v>

1873
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:42.830
<v Speaker 1>We had an ashtray that we took photos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it afterwards.</v>

1874
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Like this is how much weed action</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bronson smoked while he was on the show.</v>

1875
01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.110
<v Speaker 1>I just ran into him the other day at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

1876
01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:51.080
<v Speaker 1>He smoked like how many joints?</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 joints.</v>

1877
01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Ass joints.</v>

1878
01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Big Fat boys puffed him down to the NUB.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were,</v>

1879
01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:59.120
<v Speaker 1>we were with Jamie and I were stunned</v>
<v Speaker 1>where like,</v>

1880
01:21:59.121 --> 01:22:01.630
<v Speaker 1>how's he keep going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's on fights too.</v>

1881
01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does have a lot of good,</v>

1882
01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:06.550
<v Speaker 3>she got a lot of good Shim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that when it comes to coverage,</v>

1883
01:22:06.551 --> 01:22:08.530
<v Speaker 3>a foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they really missed the boat.</v>

1884
01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Well it's been good on like that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1885
01:22:11.501 --> 01:22:12.700
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still accept.</v>

1886
01:22:12.730 --> 01:22:13.481
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1887
01:22:13.481 --> 01:22:16.030
<v Speaker 3>it's like anyone can kind of submit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a kind of like Huffington Post.</v>

1888
01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:16.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like a huge</v>

1889
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:19.590
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have a hard time filtering</v>

1890
01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:21.150
<v Speaker 1>everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they've gotten,</v>

1891
01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:24.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were this radical sort of like</v>

1892
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.050
<v Speaker 1>upstart where people hadn't heard of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them before and they were doing wild</v>

1893
01:22:28.051 --> 01:22:30.180
<v Speaker 1>shit and they had some really cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos like,</v>

1894
01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:34.470
<v Speaker 1>like the guide to travel and they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing where they went to Liberia</v>

1895
01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:37.920
<v Speaker 1>and met with general button naked and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's explaining about eating children</v>

1896
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:39.660
<v Speaker 1>and cutting their heart's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

1897
01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.090
<v Speaker 1>So that was all shane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane did a lot of that stuff.</v>

1898
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:43.680
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was the early days.</v>

1899
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:45.150
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's I,</v>

1900
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:48.100
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of style of journalism.</v>

1901
01:22:48.101 --> 01:22:50.230
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like what's missing is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>context behind it.</v>

1902
01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:52.480
<v Speaker 3>Like just vice will go to India and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1903
01:22:52.481 --> 01:22:53.710
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking nuts.</v>

1904
01:22:53.711 --> 01:22:55.450
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why is there this massive</v>

1905
01:22:55.451 --> 01:22:56.980
<v Speaker 3>disparity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1906
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:59.320
<v Speaker 3>it qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a different style of journalism.</v>

1907
01:22:59.321 --> 01:23:01.990
<v Speaker 3>But I do think that they really missed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boat on Venezuela,</v>

1908
01:23:01.991 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Russia and Ukraine and some other things</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to global conflicts</v>

1909
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:09.370
<v Speaker 3>because that's just the problem with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of journalism and corporate media in</v>

1910
01:23:09.371 --> 01:23:12.430
<v Speaker 3>general is that you're towing a line</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're an American.</v>

1911
01:23:12.431 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Just like we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israelis.</v>

1912
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:16.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have preconceived notions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have your own bias,</v>

1913
01:23:16.931 --> 01:23:19.690
<v Speaker 3>you have your own ethnocentric lens</v>
<v Speaker 3>about world issues.</v>

1914
01:23:19.691 --> 01:23:21.610
<v Speaker 3>So it bleeds over into those conflicts.</v>

1915
01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:23.290
<v Speaker 3>And unless you're like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>internationalist,</v>

1916
01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.630
<v Speaker 3>can you see the world from a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lens?</v>

1917
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:27.040
<v Speaker 3>But when I was on the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Venezuela,</v>

1918
01:23:27.041 --> 01:23:29.170
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not what we're seeing.</v>

1919
01:23:29.370 --> 01:23:31.240
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think is happening in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Venezuela?</v>

1920
01:23:31.241 --> 01:23:34.120
<v Speaker 3>So what we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there,</v>

1921
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:37.120
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that the u s government</v>

1922
01:23:37.121 --> 01:23:39.790
<v Speaker 3>wants to obfuscate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why you see Venezuela</v>

1923
01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:44.020
<v Speaker 3>continues to come up all the time as</v>
<v Speaker 3>another country that needs to be taken</v>

1924
01:23:44.021 --> 01:23:46.450
<v Speaker 3>out and helped by US interests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1925
01:23:46.451 --> 01:23:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Because they haven't bowed down to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Economic Agenda,</v>

1926
01:23:49.401 --> 01:23:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Gemini,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very simple.</v>

1927
01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.510
<v Speaker 3>The XERO has popular support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maduro has a mass movement behind him.</v>

1928
01:23:55.511 --> 01:23:57.730
<v Speaker 3>The Child Easton movement is alive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1929
01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.580
<v Speaker 3>and that's undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if you hate him or</v>

1930
01:24:00.581 --> 01:24:02.320
<v Speaker 3>love him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what does the narrative like?</v>

1931
01:24:02.321 --> 01:24:04.450
<v Speaker 3>What are we being told?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the narrative is that he's a</v>

1932
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:08.820
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian dictator who has seized all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of power and that he has,</v>

1933
01:24:08.850 --> 01:24:12.070
<v Speaker 3>there's zero democracy and that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants him gone.</v>

1934
01:24:12.071 --> 01:24:15.190
<v Speaker 3>And that the protestors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he keeps mowing down and executing them</v>

1935
01:24:15.191 --> 01:24:16.670
<v Speaker 3>whenever they come to the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not True.</v>

1936
01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.860
<v Speaker 3>100% bullshit.</v>

1937
01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.330
<v Speaker 3>I think it's [inaudible] and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the same thing.</v>

1938
01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.010
<v Speaker 3>All these countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the same thing,</v>

1939
01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:25.930
<v Speaker 3>whether it be Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Venezuela,</v>

1940
01:24:25.931 --> 01:24:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of questions about the</v>

1941
01:24:27.621 --> 01:24:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Syria shit that we're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1942
01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.060
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that have questions</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>

1943
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.470
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe the gas attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that don't think</v>

1944
01:24:35.471 --> 01:24:37.930
<v Speaker 3>that actually happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes no tactical sense for Assad to</v>

1945
01:24:37.931 --> 01:24:40.540
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he was winning the war and was</v>

1946
01:24:40.541 --> 01:24:44.380
<v Speaker 3>taking back the remaining territory to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that also didn't we let them know</v>

1947
01:24:44.381 --> 01:24:46.770
<v Speaker 3>that we're going to bomb them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like the,</v>

1948
01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

1949
01:24:50.651 --> 01:24:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the thing is there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple journalists who have gone to</v>

1950
01:24:52.991 --> 01:24:57.160
<v Speaker 3>the site of the hospital and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's very contradictory</v>

1951
01:24:57.161 --> 01:24:58.900
<v Speaker 3>narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't know until the chemical</v>

1952
01:24:58.901 --> 01:25:01.060
<v Speaker 3>weapons inspectors go and do their</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation.</v>

1953
01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.010
<v Speaker 3>But why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I find odd is just the,</v>

1954
01:25:03.011 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uniformity with putting out these</v>

1955
01:25:04.781 --> 01:25:06.470
<v Speaker 3>fucking narratives by the same people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>

1956
01:25:06.471 --> 01:25:09.310
<v Speaker 3>who sold to see rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when Obama wanted to</v>

1957
01:25:09.311 --> 01:25:10.450
<v Speaker 3>bomb Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's like,</v>

1958
01:25:10.451 --> 01:25:12.820
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it just went away.</v>

1959
01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.280
<v Speaker 3>I remember he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1960
01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:15.820
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he staved off.</v>

1961
01:25:15.821 --> 01:25:18.310
<v Speaker 3>He staved off a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately we've,</v>

1962
01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:19.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white helmets over there,</v>

1963
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:22.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are kind of an arm of the US government</v>

1964
01:25:22.661 --> 01:25:25.450
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been funding them with $200</v>

1965
01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:28.900
<v Speaker 3>million and on USA id,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all of these groups on the</v>

1966
01:25:28.901 --> 01:25:30.610
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like whether you're Obama and you</v>

1967
01:25:30.611 --> 01:25:35.611
<v Speaker 3>use more covert means through USA ID and</v>
<v Speaker 3>more like drone warfare or you're the</v>

1968
01:25:36.071 --> 01:25:37.780
<v Speaker 3>trump John Bolton type where you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1969
01:25:37.781 --> 01:25:41.260
<v Speaker 3>let's fucking preemptively bond on him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kill their families and torture</v>

1970
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:42.103
<v Speaker 3>their families.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1971
01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.170
<v Speaker 3>it's two sides of the same coin.</v>

1972
01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:47.980
<v Speaker 3>It's the empire that that's consistent</v>
<v Speaker 3>and will maintain.</v>

1973
01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:50.350
<v Speaker 3>But it's scary because Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1974
01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:53.560
<v Speaker 3>it shows you how easy were duped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1975
01:25:53.561 --> 01:25:54.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the Iraq war,</v>

1976
01:25:54.581 --> 01:25:56.080
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least you had Colin Powell holding up</v>

1977
01:25:56.081 --> 01:25:57.150
<v Speaker 3>the vial being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

1978
01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.280
<v Speaker 3>And Dan thrax now it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have a social media video and</v>

1979
01:26:00.281 --> 01:26:02.620
<v Speaker 3>we just fucking have Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our garrison in the Middle East,</v>

1980
01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:05.870
<v Speaker 3>bomb Syria to test the waters and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just bombed them.</v>

1981
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.460
<v Speaker 3>And then you have asshole like neo</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal think tankers all paraded around</v>

1982
01:26:10.461 --> 01:26:11.900
<v Speaker 3>the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these generals.</v>

1983
01:26:11.901 --> 01:26:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these experts who are all literally</v>

1984
01:26:13.881 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Iraq war propaganda is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or generals or defense contractor ceos,</v>

1985
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:20.060
<v Speaker 3>and they're all just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump isn't doing enough.</v>

1986
01:26:20.061 --> 01:26:23.000
<v Speaker 3>He needs the bomb more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't sending enough of a message</v>

1987
01:26:23.001 --> 01:26:23.990
<v Speaker 3>to Assad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1988
01:26:24.650 --> 01:26:26.300
<v Speaker 3>what have we ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one is bombing.</v>

1989
01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.780
<v Speaker 3>Anyone ever done anything good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1990
01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Tell me when the fucking us is</v>
<v Speaker 3>intervene.</v>

1991
01:26:31.131 --> 01:26:34.190
<v Speaker 3>That's actually turned out good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So don't sell this bullshit.</v>

1992
01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Humanitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just nuts that we just keep falling</v>

1993
01:26:36.771 --> 01:26:37.910
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people were like,</v>

1994
01:26:37.911 --> 01:26:39.320
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we supposed to do?</v>

1995
01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Fucking don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

1996
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:44.870
<v Speaker 3>don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know that people are like,</v>

1997
01:26:44.871 --> 01:26:45.561
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1998
01:26:45.561 --> 01:26:49.490
<v Speaker 3>isolation is ms bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look the u s empires horrific and the</v>

1999
01:26:49.491 --> 01:26:52.940
<v Speaker 3>largest threat to humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world's biggest polluter.</v>

2000
01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:56.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm exempt from climate treaty's all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit you never see on the mainstream</v>

2001
01:26:56.331 --> 01:26:56.871
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2002
01:26:56.871 --> 01:26:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Because it's owned by oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oil corporations and defense</v>

2003
01:26:59.331 --> 01:27:01.460
<v Speaker 3>contractors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you see ads for Boeing and</v>

2004
01:27:01.461 --> 01:27:02.294
<v Speaker 3>Raytheon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're,</v>

2005
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:06.050
<v Speaker 3>we're not looking to buy a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we watch the news that's just</v>

2006
01:27:06.051 --> 01:27:08.450
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or overlords controlling the narrative,</v>

2007
01:27:08.451 --> 01:27:11.270
<v Speaker 3>they know the limitations of the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that parameters and the</v>

2008
01:27:11.271 --> 01:27:13.700
<v Speaker 3>framing that they're allowed to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>within.</v>

2009
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.330
<v Speaker 3>They can't even talk about the u s as an</v>
<v Speaker 3>empire of the world's biggest empire.</v>

2010
01:27:17.331 --> 01:27:18.164
<v Speaker 3>The world's ever seen.</v>

2011
01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between what you hear</v>

2012
01:27:21.401 --> 01:27:25.990
<v Speaker 1>from Internet commentators who are free</v>
<v Speaker 1>of networks and pr producers and</v>

2013
01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:28.900
<v Speaker 1>executives are telling them what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sponsors and,</v>

2014
01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.000
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the version that you're getting on</v>

2015
01:27:31.001 --> 01:27:33.130
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the version that you're getting on</v>

2016
01:27:33.131 --> 01:27:35.830
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on CNN or on any of these,</v>

2017
01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.380
<v Speaker 1>any of these major mainstream news</v>
<v Speaker 1>networks,</v>

2018
01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:43.240
<v Speaker 1>you're getting a very watered down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very homogenized and pasteurized</v>

2019
01:27:43.241 --> 01:27:43.770
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

2020
01:27:43.770 --> 01:27:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2021
01:27:45.271 --> 01:27:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Because I think that's why I do the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

2022
01:27:46.741 --> 01:27:49.470
<v Speaker 3>the empire files and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and media roots radio with my brother</v>

2023
01:27:49.471 --> 01:27:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Robbie Martin at fluorescent gray on</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>

2024
01:27:51.481 --> 01:27:54.210
<v Speaker 3>But I do the show with my partner Mike</v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoner.</v>

2025
01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we want to retell these</v>

2026
01:27:57.001 --> 01:27:59.490
<v Speaker 3>narratives that have been lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>History's always been written by the</v>

2027
01:27:59.491 --> 01:28:01.470
<v Speaker 3>victors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of the shit that we're seeing around</v>

2028
01:28:01.471 --> 01:28:05.370
<v Speaker 3>the world needs to be analyzed within</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lens of the u s being the largest</v>

2029
01:28:05.371 --> 01:28:08.820
<v Speaker 3>empire that's siphons all the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>money in the world for military</v>

2030
01:28:08.821 --> 01:28:10.320
<v Speaker 3>expenses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean every issue,</v>

2031
01:28:10.321 --> 01:28:12.780
<v Speaker 3>domestic and internationally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all shaped.</v>

2032
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:17.030
<v Speaker 1>You're out there doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're traveling the Palestine,</v>

2033
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you're traveling to Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you doing all this stuff,</v>

2034
01:28:18.691 --> 01:28:19.800
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're writing all these things,</v>

2035
01:28:19.801 --> 01:28:23.550
<v Speaker 1>you're doing all these videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this ever get too much for you?</v>

2036
01:28:23.551 --> 01:28:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Is this ever like overrun your brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has this ever freak you out that none of</v>

2037
01:28:28.531 --> 01:28:29.940
<v Speaker 1>this is getting any better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

2038
01:28:29.941 --> 01:28:30.870
<v Speaker 1>some of it's getting worse.</v>

2039
01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is depressing to,</v>

2040
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:34.420
<v Speaker 3>like I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just the,</v>

2041
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:37.510
<v Speaker 3>the discourse now where I'm called a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian student,</v>

2042
01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.151
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2043
01:28:38.151 --> 01:28:40.670
<v Speaker 3>I guess once a Putin puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always a Putin puppet,</v>

2044
01:28:40.671 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter if I left our t three</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

2045
01:28:42.621 --> 01:28:43.131
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2046
01:28:43.131 --> 01:28:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I told you what they were trying this</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking ship you off to Crimea because</v>

2047
01:28:47.451 --> 01:28:48.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're boots on the ground,</v>

2048
01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.900
<v Speaker 3>young lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go check out the war zone.</v>

2049
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:54.260
<v Speaker 3>And then the intelligence report that</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out as the definitive proof of</v>

2050
01:28:54.261 --> 01:28:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Russian hacking basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my show that had ended two years prior</v>

2051
01:28:57.651 --> 01:29:01.800
<v Speaker 3>was part of the reason why trump won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have all this desperation to try</v>

2052
01:29:01.801 --> 01:29:05.280
<v Speaker 3>to dilute the narrative and call</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone a Russian troll and,</v>

2053
01:29:05.281 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's depressing as hell Joe,</v>

2054
01:29:06.661 --> 01:29:10.170
<v Speaker 3>because I feel like the sanity is</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking lost and I can't actually have</v>

2055
01:29:10.171 --> 01:29:12.810
<v Speaker 3>conversations with people and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality because either you're a trump</v>

2056
01:29:12.811 --> 01:29:16.890
<v Speaker 3>boot licker who thinks everything's fake</v>
<v Speaker 3>news and you think q and on is gonna</v>

2057
01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:20.580
<v Speaker 3>fucking expose the pedophiles across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country or you think I'm a Russian troll</v>

2058
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:24.030
<v Speaker 3>because I'm saying something that goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the grain.</v>

2059
01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.780
<v Speaker 3>It's really disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're living in a really,</v>

2060
01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:28.620
<v Speaker 3>really disturbing time.</v>

2061
01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Too much information too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of the problem.</v>

2062
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the problem is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative gets so diluted toxify it and</v>

2063
01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:40.370
<v Speaker 1>to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know there are pedophiles</v>

2064
01:29:40.371 --> 01:29:42.950
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean whenever someone does get exposed</v>

2065
01:29:42.951 --> 01:29:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and some pedophile ring gets broken up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

2066
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:45.703
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>

2067
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Why don't even think it was real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because these people are so fucking</v>

2068

2090
01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>off the drugs that they would get from</v>

2115

<v Speaker 1>the Colombian cartel and you would drop</v>
<v Speaker 1>him off in Mena,</v>

2116

<v Speaker 1>Arkansas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the story?</v>

2117
01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was exposed because two kids were</v>

2118
01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:49.220
<v Speaker 1>there when the drugs got dropped off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were murdered and their bodies were</v>

2119
01:31:49.221 --> 01:31:53.540
<v Speaker 1>put on train tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trains ran over their bodies.</v>

2120
01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:57.470
<v Speaker 1>The cop said these kids were high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fell asleep on the train tracks.</v>

2121
01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Their parents did an independent found</v>
<v Speaker 1>out</v>

2122
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:04.180
<v Speaker 2>that there's stab wounds in the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then the parents brought this</v>

2123
01:32:04.181 --> 01:32:06.580
<v Speaker 2>information to light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything unfolds.</v>

2124
01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:10.840
<v Speaker 2>They find out that this is gigantic drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>ring that was supported by Bill Clinton</v>

2125
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:14.380
<v Speaker 2>is a big part of the movie was that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>barry seal guys gets arrested with</v>

2126
01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars in cash and coke and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton Calls Up.</v>

2127
01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:20.920
<v Speaker 2>The prosecutor makes them walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

2128
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:25.030
<v Speaker 2>That really did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was all in Mena Arkansas when Bill</v>

2129
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Clinton was the governor of Arkansas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then goes on to be the president.</v>

2130
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:33.930
<v Speaker 2>But this guy was bringing in drugs from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia and from South America at the</v>

2131
01:32:34.061 --> 01:32:36.700
<v Speaker 2>behest of the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a big part of the film now.</v>

2132
01:32:36.701 --> 01:32:39.400
<v Speaker 2>How much of the film is bullshit and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of it is real?</v>

2160
01:33:53.081 --> 01:33:55.480
<v Speaker 2>into the building and they were trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that it didn't happen that</v>

<v Speaker 2>people are inside of them.</v>

2163
01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:05.950
<v Speaker 2>They were driving over the houses while</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people are inside of him.</v>

2164
01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:09.310
<v Speaker 2>That's when the militia movement posed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>threat to the government and now they've</v>

2165
01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:11.320

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2172
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:29.890

<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting thing.</v>

2173
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Like I've heard very different versions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that from z Zinky when that guy,</v>

2174
01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.490
<v Speaker 2>what does he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretary of the interior,</v>

2175
01:34:36.491 --> 01:34:39.010
<v Speaker 2>what does Zinky yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was talking about it and he's</v>

2176
01:34:39.011 --> 01:34:42.550
<v Speaker 2>explaining to us not what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that essentially went right back to</v>

2177
01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:47.350
<v Speaker 2>where the way it was before Obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed the legislation changed the</v>

2178
01:34:47.351 --> 01:34:48.820
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

2179
01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:51.440
<v Speaker 2>It was protected under Obama for a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

2180
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:54.730
<v Speaker 2>There's dinosaur fossils,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're native Americans have monuments</v>

2181
01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:55.990
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course we don't care about native</v>

2182
01:34:55.991 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 2>American monuments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just care about confederate</v>

2183
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.530
<v Speaker 1>monuments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't care about abolishing all the</v>

2184
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:02.450
<v Speaker 1>native American land and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>treaties.</v>

2185
01:35:02.451 --> 01:35:06.500
<v Speaker 1>We just care about protecting bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 1>confederate statues around the country.</v>

2186
01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>confederate statues and s in the sense</v>

2187
01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:12.740
<v Speaker 1>that I don't think they should be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2188
01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of fucking times,</v>

2189
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:18.560
<v Speaker 1>squares and shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they should do something with them</v>

2190
01:35:18.561 --> 01:35:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the same way they should do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Gingiss con statutes.</v>

2191
01:35:22.110 --> 01:35:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that most of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>were made during the,</v>

2192
01:35:25.191 --> 01:35:27.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jim Crow era?</v>

2193
01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.140
<v Speaker 1>That that's a really good point</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed.</v>

2194
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.640
<v Speaker 1>That's an amazing point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think that it was right</v>

2195
01:35:31.641 --> 01:35:36.050
<v Speaker 1>after the civil war and in fact it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the 60s it was during the civil</v>

2196
01:35:36.051 --> 01:35:38.480
<v Speaker 1>rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a protest to the civil rights</v>

2197
01:35:38.481 --> 01:35:39.231
<v Speaker 1>move with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Yay,</v>

2198
01:35:39.231 --> 01:35:40.250
<v Speaker 1>we'll little don't do it here.</v>

2199
01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Well here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a statue.</v>

2200
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And they're shitty statues to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2201
01:35:48.051 --> 01:35:50.330
<v Speaker 1>like really poorly constructed there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made him quickly.</v>

2202
01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a protest to the civil rights</v>

2203
01:35:53.031 --> 01:35:53.960
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them.</v>

2204
01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:57.200
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is like they are a</v>

2205
01:35:57.201 --> 01:36:01.010
<v Speaker 1>representation of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a gang is con statute would be</v>

2206
01:36:01.011 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 1>a representation that monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we think of gangs.</v>

2207
01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Khan is a guy who opened up trade with</v>
<v Speaker 1>China today.</v>

2208
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:09.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you vaguely understand that he was</v>

2209
01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:13.580
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the death of 10% of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population of the world back then.</v>

2210
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Change The fucking New York Times had an</v>
<v Speaker 1>article about how he changed the carbon</v>

2211
01:36:17.811 --> 01:36:19.880
<v Speaker 1>footprint of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2212
01:36:19.881 --> 01:36:24.560
<v Speaker 1>there's literally a difference in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon footprint because 10% less people</v>

2213
01:36:24.561 --> 01:36:28.820
<v Speaker 1>were alive during gingiss Khan's reign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed everybody.</v>

2214
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:30.770
<v Speaker 1>They fucking quit killing millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2215
01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a great Dan Carlin series on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the wrath of the cons,</v>

2216
01:36:34.191 --> 01:36:35.630
<v Speaker 1>but I've talked about it way too much.</v>

2217
01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:40.130
<v Speaker 1>But today Gingiss comms not offensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could bring up gaviscon nobody</v>

2218
01:36:40.131 --> 01:36:43.580
<v Speaker 1>cares me weighing more horrific than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that happened during the civil</v>

2219
01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:45.430
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had slaves and they,</v>

2220
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:48.710
<v Speaker 1>they did everything they used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would capture people and use them</v>

2221
01:36:48.711 --> 01:36:50.930
<v Speaker 1>as the front line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd push them towards their own</v>

2222
01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:53.570
<v Speaker 1>people so they would get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will be the first people to get</v>

2223
01:36:53.571 --> 01:36:57.920
<v Speaker 1>shot with arrows and I mean there's some</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific shit but I think the think we</v>

2224
01:36:57.921 --> 01:37:01.610
<v Speaker 1>shared melt gingiss con statues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the confederacy is just so much</v>

2225
01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:05.360
<v Speaker 1>more recent and do something with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2226
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think it should be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>town square for sure.</v>

2227
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:09.450
<v Speaker 1>In anybody's townsquared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2228
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:12.170
<v Speaker 1>but I think they should do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them instead of melting them are</v>

2229
01:37:12.171 --> 01:37:14.780
<v Speaker 1>smashing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should put them somewhere at least</v>

2230
01:37:14.781 --> 01:37:17.870
<v Speaker 1>for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least for future people to like look</v>

2231
01:37:17.871 --> 01:37:18.110
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2232
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2233
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:23.630
<v Speaker 1>this is how fucking wacky people were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1960s they construct these Omadjela</v>

2234
01:37:23.631 --> 01:37:25.880
<v Speaker 1>has to the 18 hundreds and slavery was</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal.</v>

2235
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000
<v Speaker 1>They constructed these statues to sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of paint these people in this heroic</v>

2236
01:37:32.901 --> 01:37:36.770
<v Speaker 1>fashion that we're fighting to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people slaves.</v>

2237
01:37:36.771 --> 01:37:38.300
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

2238
01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:40.670
<v Speaker 1>this is all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of the history of this</v>

2239
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.440
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to put it somewhere.</v>

2240
01:37:42.710 --> 01:37:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that should be worshiped.</v>

2241
01:37:44.690 --> 01:37:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Definitely shouldn't be prominently</v>
<v Speaker 1>featured.</v>

2242
01:37:46.761 --> 01:37:49.040
<v Speaker 1>So some black kid has to filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2243
01:37:49.570 --> 01:37:51.350
<v Speaker 1>there should be something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2244
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and but it should be like detailed of</v>

2245
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>when it was</v>

2246
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.160
<v Speaker 2>constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an instructor who made it.</v>

2247
01:37:59.161 --> 01:38:01.470
<v Speaker 2>What was the political affiliation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that created it?</v>

2248
01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Totally stopped us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whitewash whitewashing bullshit like</v>

2250
01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:07.140
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time mlk day comes around,</v>

2251
01:38:07.141 --> 01:38:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm always just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you know mlk was like a rabid anti</v>

2252
01:38:10.621 --> 01:38:13.200
<v Speaker 2>militarist and anti imperialist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2253
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:15.600
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the most hated black man in</v>

2254
01:38:15.601 --> 01:38:16.780
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone said,</v>

2255
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:18.710
<v Speaker 2>know that he used to fuck all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>white women,</v>

2256
01:38:18.711 --> 01:38:21.890
<v Speaker 2>like who does only fucking white women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives a flat of funny did.</v>

2257
01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can a time</v>

2258
01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be the bad day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well you just turned it around for</v>

2259
01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:30.930
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck mlk.</v>

2260
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:35.931
<v Speaker 2>That I have a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange that people,</v>

2261
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.200
<v Speaker 2>they turn on things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about this whole like</v>

2262
01:38:40.201 --> 01:38:44.250
<v Speaker 2>dueling narrative though about trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how he's somehow absolved from all</v>

2263
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.650
<v Speaker 2>of his wrongdoings or he's a Russian</v>
<v Speaker 2>plant?</v>

2264
01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Like are you having trouble talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people about that?</v>

2265
01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

2266
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the good thing about him,</v>

2267
01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:59.090
<v Speaker 1>this is the good thing is that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize now how easy it is for a person</v>

2268
01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:03.600
<v Speaker 1>to win the popularity contest that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presidency of the United States and</v>

2269
01:39:03.601 --> 01:39:06.660
<v Speaker 1>that you could get a popular person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's trump or whether it's oprah</v>

2270
01:39:06.661 --> 01:39:08.550
<v Speaker 1>or whoever the fuck it is that decides</v>
<v Speaker 1>to win next.</v>

2271
01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:13.760
<v Speaker 1>And this is a ridiculous way to pick the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who runs the biggest fucking</v>

2272
01:39:13.891 --> 01:39:16.260
<v Speaker 1>military complex the world has ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>

2273
01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest army the world has ever</v>

2274
01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:21.420
<v Speaker 1>known by far is the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>

2275
01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:24.870
<v Speaker 1>The commander in chief is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was the host of the apprentice</v>

2276
01:39:24.871 --> 01:39:26.700
<v Speaker 1>that was famous for saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fired.</v>

2277
01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.170
<v Speaker 1>You're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2278
01:39:28.190 --> 01:39:28.800
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2279
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.140
<v Speaker 1>this is a popularity contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2280
01:39:31.290 --> 01:39:33.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have special</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualifications.</v>

2281
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.310
<v Speaker 1>You just have to be deemed the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2282
01:39:35.410 --> 01:39:37.080
<v Speaker 1>the person that people like the most.</v>

2283
01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2284
01:39:38.250 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 1>It's also insane to have one giant Alpha</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimp to be the top guy.</v>

2285
01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the top gal to run the whole project.</v>

2286
01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.040
<v Speaker 1>And I saw that with Hillary too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was so many people that were</v>

2287
01:39:47.041 --> 01:39:50.040
<v Speaker 1>looking for Hillary to win because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted a woman to win because they</v>

2288
01:39:50.041 --> 01:39:53.670
<v Speaker 1>thought it would be historic victory</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of how fucking creepy she is,</v>

2289
01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:55.830
<v Speaker 1>regardless of all the crazy shit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's done,</v>

2290
01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.610
<v Speaker 1>regardless of her history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of all the fucking way that</v>

2291
01:39:59.611 --> 01:40:03.930
<v Speaker 1>they hacked the DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they literally conspired to keep</v>

2292
01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders from winning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nomination.</v>

2293
01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hacked the democracy.</v>

2294
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:10.080
<v Speaker 1>They did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the Russians.</v>

2295
01:40:10.230 --> 01:40:10.740
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2296
01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:11.241
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2297
01:40:11.241 --> 01:40:12.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work.</v>

2298
01:40:12.931 --> 01:40:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't even count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Screw voter ID,</v>

2299
01:40:14.701 --> 01:40:16.080
<v Speaker 2>voter suppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that Shit.</v>

2300
01:40:16.081 --> 01:40:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Gerrymandering woman's so bad that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were willing to look to sleep.</v>

2301
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.410
<v Speaker 2>And then while the gay person next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2302
01:40:22.411 --> 01:40:25.360
<v Speaker 2>the black person and a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our trans persons person,</v>

2303
01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the problem.</v>

2304
01:40:28.471 --> 01:40:31.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the conflation with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left and the neo liberal think</v>

2305
01:40:31.891 --> 01:40:35.400
<v Speaker 2>tankers is that they use identity</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics to sell more corporatism.</v>

2306
01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Like they use it to brand slap pink shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Boeing jets and be like women's Day.</v>

2307
01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:46.080
<v Speaker 2>But it's not like they actually care</v>
<v Speaker 2>about oppressed and marginalized people.</v>

2308
01:40:46.081 --> 01:40:48.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>

2309
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:52.090
<v Speaker 2>We're in an infancy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The infancy of understanding really are,</v>

2310
01:40:52.210 --> 01:40:53.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three people ago,</v>

2311
01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:56.070
<v Speaker 2>three people go and it's like three</v>
<v Speaker 2>people from now or,</v>

2312
01:40:56.071 --> 01:41:00.800
<v Speaker 2>but like these fucking apes were crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do think that.</v>

2313
01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're in the middle of it.</v>

2314
01:41:03.431 --> 01:41:04.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the apprentice guy,</v>

2315
01:41:04.661 --> 01:41:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he didn't win,</v>

2316
01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:07.240
<v Speaker 2>what would you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Ted Cruz to win?</v>

2317
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:09.250

<v Speaker 2>Out of his mind too.</v>

2318
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.590
<v Speaker 2>And now all he's doing is sucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's ass.</v>

2319
01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:13.570
<v Speaker 2>You see all those speeches about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2320
01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:16.990

<v Speaker 2>Trump calls his wife a dog that says his</v>

2321
01:41:16.991 --> 01:41:19.450
<v Speaker 2>dad killed jfk and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Ted Cruz is like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He gives him a name.</v>

2326
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Just a lot of things that he does that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wish he wasn't the president.</v>

2327
01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could just laugh at some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things he does and I wouldn't feel bad</v>

2328
01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:35.400
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2331
01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:42.490
<v Speaker 2>He does a bunch of wacky shit that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>find to be incredibly entertaining.</v>

2332
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.460
<v Speaker 2>If he wasn't the leader of the free</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

2333
01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:46.510
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't in fucking power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>writing's on the wall for him.</v>

2411
01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:50.480

2423
01:45:19.011 --> 01:45:23.810
<v Speaker 2>ride of celebrity until he got busted</v>
<v Speaker 2>raping people and then the last years of</v>

2424
01:45:23.811 --> 01:45:28.290
<v Speaker 2>his life were in helacious state of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being accused of something and,</v>

2425
01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:30.890
<v Speaker 2>and probably only got a fraction of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was actually,</v>

2426
01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.120
<v Speaker 2>what he actually did.</v>

2427
01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many women out there know that they</v>

2428
01:45:33.741 --> 01:45:36.920
<v Speaker 2>were raped by him and just said nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they just don't,</v>

2429
01:45:36.921 --> 01:45:38.490
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to be a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big.</v>

2430
01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many victims are there already?</v>

2431
01:45:41.121 --> 01:45:46.121
<v Speaker 2>Fuck is at least 50 at least 50 fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>than Weinstein.</v>

2432
01:45:46.521 --> 01:45:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone else that's that much of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a serial rapist?</v>

2433
01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:51.170
<v Speaker 2>She bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Weinstein thing was like he was</v>

2434
01:45:51.171 --> 01:45:54.470
<v Speaker 2>forcing them to have sex with him in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to give them roles.</v>

2435
01:45:54.471 --> 01:45:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't drugging them.</v>

2436
01:45:56.181 --> 01:46:00.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just as creepy in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not quite the same thing</v>

2437
01:46:00.291 --> 01:46:05.170
<v Speaker 2>because bill cosby was almost like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>monster or you know,</v>

2438
01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.900
<v Speaker 2>like fucking did to you while you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>passed out for a day in his house.</v>

2439
01:46:09.110 --> 01:46:12.610
<v Speaker 2>But he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you posed at like Weinstein was</v>

2440
01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:15.990
<v Speaker 2>this fat gross got like Shrek</v>

<v Speaker 2>We was everybody.</v>

2442
01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay the fuck away from him.</v>

2443
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Right up to his room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a monster.</v>

2444
01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:23.270
<v Speaker 2>That was the whole thing with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>

<v Speaker 2>comedian that Richard Pryor was.</v>

2490
01:49:27.461 --> 01:49:29.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like six minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

2498
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>while Eddie Murphy</v>

<v Speaker 1>was doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to realize this is the 80s,</v>

2500
01:49:49.961 --> 01:49:51.790

<v Speaker 1>So while Eddie Murphy was doing that</v>

2501
01:49:51.791 --> 01:49:54.820

2506
01:49:58.951 --> 01:50:00.050

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

2558
01:52:10.981 --> 01:52:12.150
<v Speaker 3>There's just an odd switch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2559
01:52:12.151 --> 01:52:13.000
<v Speaker 3>But I don't buy it.</v>

2560
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Fangs come out every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2561
01:52:15.530 --> 01:52:18.340
<v Speaker 1>The Jane Fonda Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the Jane Fonda Shit,</v>

2562
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:21.700
<v Speaker 1>she asked Jane Fonda about plastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery and Jane Fonda,</v>

2563
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:25.120
<v Speaker 1>fuck you asking me about plastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

2564
01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to promote a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2565
01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have three minutes.</v>

2566
01:52:28.090 --> 01:52:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You know what would I look good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2567
01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.750
<v Speaker 1>but except that she's talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>having plastic surgery.</v>

2568
01:52:32.751 --> 01:52:34.120
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2569
01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:36.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she's,</v>

2570
01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:37.860
<v Speaker 1>this is not organic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2571
01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:39.920
<v Speaker 1>These shows are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's not a podcast.</v>

2572
01:52:39.921 --> 01:52:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sitting down talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2573
01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:45.560
<v Speaker 1>So she wants to get some sound bite and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is probably like part the agenda.</v>

2574
01:52:45.561 --> 01:52:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So Jane Fonda's shut her down and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking about the movie again and</v>

2575
01:52:49.311 --> 01:52:53.030
<v Speaker 1>then talked about her and so then later</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it looks damn good.</v>

2576
01:52:53.070 --> 01:52:57.120
<v Speaker 1>She's not not bad for 150,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So later,</v>

2577
01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:02.540
<v Speaker 1>later on Megan Kelly started talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit about Jane Fonda on the air saying</v>

2578
01:53:04.131 --> 01:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>about how people used to call her</v>
<v Speaker 1>annoyed Jane.</v>

2579
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Let's see the fans come out and utr</v>
<v Speaker 3>number when she said she had alluded to</v>

2580
01:53:13.611 --> 01:53:15.920
<v Speaker 3>the fact that trump poisoned her the</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning of the debate.</v>

2581
01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.330
<v Speaker 3>I think we talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2582
01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well she got coffee from some weird</v>

2583
01:53:19.761 --> 01:53:23.390
<v Speaker 3>driver the morning of the debate and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>already know that that crazy shit was</v>

2584
01:53:23.391 --> 01:53:26.330
<v Speaker 3>happening between her and trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said she got violently ill.</v>

2585
01:53:26.331 --> 01:53:27.860
<v Speaker 3>She was trying to tell him I don't drink</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>

2586
01:53:27.861 --> 01:53:28.680
<v Speaker 3>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no drink.</v>

2587
01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.190
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She drank the coffee got violently ill</v>

2588
01:53:31.191 --> 01:53:33.830
<v Speaker 3>and had to like sit next to a puke</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucket almost thinking that she would</v>

2589
01:53:33.831 --> 01:53:36.410
<v Speaker 3>have to cancel the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically alluding to the fact that</v>

2590
01:53:36.411 --> 01:53:40.430
<v Speaker 3>trump might have poisoned her that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear on,</v>

2591
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have never taken a coffee from some</v>

2592
01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:45.770
<v Speaker 3>strange way to force me to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2593
01:53:45.771 --> 01:53:46.250
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2594
01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not as famous.</v>

2595
01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:50.960
<v Speaker 3>She's recanted it after he got elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe out of fear,</v>

2596
01:53:50.961 --> 01:53:52.100
<v Speaker 3>maybe she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

2597
01:53:52.190 --> 01:53:55.400
<v Speaker 3>if he really did do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then a bull shit,</v>

2598
01:53:55.401 --> 01:53:56.830
<v Speaker 3>their pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once he got elected,</v>

2599
01:53:57.790 --> 01:54:01.520
<v Speaker 3>scorched earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he made a lot of enemies and a</v>

2600
01:54:01.521 --> 01:54:02.840
<v Speaker 3>lot of people made enemies with him.</v>

2601
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:06.980
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be really interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what happens with all these criminal</v>

2602
01:54:06.981 --> 01:54:10.670
<v Speaker 1>charges and what's going to happen with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colin and all these other people.</v>

2603
01:54:10.690 --> 01:54:13.880
<v Speaker 1>The Mueller investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange because it's all just,</v>

2604
01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:19.010
<v Speaker 1>we're waiting for something to be highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal and obvious and it's not yet.</v>

2605
01:54:19.011 --> 01:54:20.090
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the thing?</v>

2606
01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:22.520
<v Speaker 1>And when the thing comes out and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>start going down,</v>

2607
01:54:22.521 --> 01:54:24.190
<v Speaker 1>they start going to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2608
01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.000
<v Speaker 1>who's going to rat him out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen?</v>

2609
01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:27.450
<v Speaker 3>I can get a part in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2610
01:54:27.451 --> 01:54:31.560
<v Speaker 3>that's going to impeach him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a consensus in the</v>

2611
01:54:31.561 --> 01:54:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Republican majority Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't understand how that's going</v>

2612
01:54:34.271 --> 01:54:36.210
<v Speaker 3>to happen unless he perjures himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2613
01:54:36.211 --> 01:54:39.990
<v Speaker 3>The perjury trap like Bill Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless he says some shit on the stand.</v>

2614
01:54:39.991 --> 01:54:42.210
<v Speaker 3>But I think it that he's smart enough to</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say yes.</v>

2615
01:54:42.211 --> 01:54:43.044
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2616
01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully saying I want them to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nph.</v>

2617
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:47.410
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hate that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trumps.</v>

2618
01:54:47.411 --> 01:54:49.270
<v Speaker 3>And people were saying that trump's</v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters,</v>

2619
01:54:49.290 --> 01:54:52.830
<v Speaker 3>hence to public and trump's supporters</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the ones that okayed the Mueller</v>

2620
01:54:52.831 --> 01:54:55.560
<v Speaker 3>raid on Cohen's office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2621
01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:57.930
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean do I miss that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2622
01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:00.390
<v Speaker 3>the people that rated Mueller's office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2623
01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:05.660
<v Speaker 3>That trump supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>republicans had to give the green light.</v>

2624
01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The judge was appointed by trump.</v>

2625
01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2626
01:55:12.150 --> 01:55:14.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like this.</v>

2627
01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:16.890
<v Speaker 3>There must have been overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>

2628
01:55:16.891 --> 01:55:19.680
<v Speaker 3>The crazy thing about this is it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like game of thrones,</v>

2629
01:55:19.681 --> 01:55:23.310
<v Speaker 3>like it's playing out so slow and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a year and a half.</v>

2630
01:55:23.311 --> 01:55:24.600
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is the proof?</v>

2631
01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:26.600
<v Speaker 3>It's trays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

2632
01:55:26.610 --> 01:55:30.390
<v Speaker 3>it just keeps building and people keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting indicted and people keep getting</v>

2633
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:32.850
<v Speaker 3>pulled in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Cohen just pleaded the fifth.</v>

2634
01:55:32.851 --> 01:55:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is that what happened?</v>

2635
01:55:33.721 --> 01:55:37.420
<v Speaker 3>That little pussy cushner gets indicted</v>
<v Speaker 3>for something man that have you heard</v>

2673
01:57:11.881 --> 01:57:14.490
<v Speaker 2>strenuous at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His hands are probably like silk.</v>

2674
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.530
<v Speaker 2>They probably do this thing well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the a little tiny hands.</v>

2675
01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:23.730

<v Speaker 2>who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that she had an affair with</v>

2714
01:58:48.190 --> 01:58:48.731

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2715
01:58:48.731 --> 01:58:50.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama admitted that he almost shot up</v>

2716
01:58:50.651 --> 01:58:51.341
<v Speaker 1>heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2717
01:58:51.341 --> 01:58:52.690
<v Speaker 1>why couldn't trump have just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2718
01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I banged a porn star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who did he say he almost shot up heroin.</v>

2719
01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Said the needle was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2720
01:58:57.551 --> 01:59:00.610
<v Speaker 1>he said that he was almost going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and he was sitting there and yeah,</v>

2721
01:59:00.730 --> 01:59:02.110
<v Speaker 1>that's heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

2722
01:59:02.111 --> 01:59:07.111
<v Speaker 1>why did trump go through this whole nda</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense knowing that it could even him</v>

2723
01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:09.000
<v Speaker 1>vitamin the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2724
01:59:09.001 --> 01:59:11.950
<v Speaker 1>He probably thought that Michael Cohen</v>
<v Speaker 1>had it locked down and then,</v>

2725
01:59:11.951 --> 01:59:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pay people off in the past.</v>

2726
01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it probably no one cared until he</v>

2727
01:59:17.951 --> 01:59:19.160
<v Speaker 1>became president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2728
01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:20.710
<v Speaker 1>What's your president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

2729
01:59:20.711 --> 01:59:22.990
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scrutiny is just so overwhelming.</v>

2730
01:59:23.110 --> 01:59:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a scrutiny from the</v>

2731
01:59:24.461 --> 01:59:26.570
<v Speaker 1>American media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the scrutiny all across the world.</v>

2732
01:59:26.571 --> 01:59:26.921
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2733
01:59:26.921 --> 01:59:29.410
<v Speaker 1>everybody's paying attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you've ever done,</v>

2734
01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.670
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with him,</v>

2735
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:32.110
<v Speaker 1>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

2736
01:59:32.111 --> 01:59:35.740
<v Speaker 1>the thing that scares me is not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that scares me is all the</v>

2737
01:59:35.741 --> 01:59:38.980
<v Speaker 1>business deals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy is how many small business</v>

2738
01:59:38.981 --> 01:59:42.160
<v Speaker 1>owners went under because trump had</v>
<v Speaker 1>these relationships,</v>

2739
01:59:42.161 --> 01:59:43.540
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly,</v>

2740
01:59:43.570 --> 01:59:45.880
<v Speaker 1>whatever I have to say with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2741
01:59:45.881 --> 01:59:47.530
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would do these construction jobs</v>

2742
01:59:47.531 --> 01:59:50.140
<v Speaker 1>and small contractors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not get paid.</v>

2743
01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:52.750
<v Speaker 1>And they would have to sue and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would wind up going under.</v>

2744
01:59:52.751 --> 01:59:54.400
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't compete with them.</v>

2745
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:57.610
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that Joey Dee has</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about on the podcast,</v>

2746
01:59:57.611 --> 02:00:01.330
<v Speaker 1>and he knew people that were involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>and construction companies that went</v>

2747
02:00:01.331 --> 02:00:03.280
<v Speaker 1>under because trump fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2748
02:00:03.310 --> 02:00:05.530
<v Speaker 1>This is like a standard thing that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do back then.</v>

2749
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Not pay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2750
02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:08.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2751
02:00:08.081 --> 02:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>he had a reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called Google.</v>

2752
02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Trump had a reputation for not paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>contractors,</v>

2753
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>construction contractors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2754
02:00:17.530 --> 02:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>it was a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an issue of character and</v>

2755
02:00:20.741 --> 02:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>morals and ethics that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

2756
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>way more important than who he decides</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have sex.</v>

2757
02:00:25.810 --> 02:00:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds alleged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills.</v>

2758
02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:30.431
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

2759
02:00:30.431 --> 02:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>It's all just what box?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dishwasher.</v>

2760
02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Say billionaire didn't pay dishwashers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Painters.</v>

2761
02:00:34.741 --> 02:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Waiters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2762
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:37.930
<v Speaker 1>the lowly minions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2763
02:00:37.931 --> 02:00:41.590
<v Speaker 1>and then you know how much of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't really pay because someone</v>

2764
02:00:41.591 --> 02:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>else pays form and it got lost in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shuffle.</v>

2765
02:00:43.721 --> 02:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant slumlord too.</v>

2766
02:00:46.330 --> 02:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2767
02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looks like a slumlord.</v>

2768
02:00:49.890 --> 02:00:50.551
<v Speaker 1>Criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2769
02:00:50.551 --> 02:00:54.370
<v Speaker 1>you got to hear that guy being trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having as much money in property as you</v>

2770
02:00:54.371 --> 02:00:56.890
<v Speaker 1>do and not having any criminal activity.</v>

2771
02:00:56.890 --> 02:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell you can't be that fucking</v>

2772
02:00:59.590 --> 02:01:01.900
<v Speaker 1>be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to know a few crooks,</v>

2773
02:01:02.530 --> 02:01:04.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just the amount of money that's</v>

2774
02:01:04.961 --> 02:01:07.270
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how the fuck can you pay attention</v>

2775
02:01:07.271 --> 02:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>to all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd have to have someone like to</v>

2776
02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:13.600
<v Speaker 1>think that he's responsible for all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also naive honestly because if you</v>

2777
02:01:13.601 --> 02:01:16.930
<v Speaker 1>really look at the amount of properties</v>
<v Speaker 1>at trump owns and to think that he's</v>

2778
02:01:16.931 --> 02:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to all that and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>management of all that and the paying of</v>

2779
02:01:20.501 --> 02:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>the contractors and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it probably trickles down from the</v>

2780
02:01:24.371 --> 02:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>top right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kind of ethics that would be</v>

2781
02:01:27.251 --> 02:01:31.870
<v Speaker 1>involved and not paying off contractors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the whole Russia thing just</v>

2782
02:01:31.871 --> 02:01:34.360
<v Speaker 1>kills me because like we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a year and a half.</v>

2783
02:01:34.380 --> 02:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>There has been no smoking gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a whole bunch of little things</v>

2784
02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:39.560
<v Speaker 1>like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian trolls online.</v>

2785
02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2786
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.840
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the DNI report,</v>

2787
02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:43.050
<v Speaker 3>which I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2788
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:46.940
<v Speaker 3>but no one is talking about the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he obviously has ties with Saudi</v>

2789
02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:47.773
<v Speaker 3>Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey,</v>

2790
02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:48.890
<v Speaker 3>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all,</v>

2791
02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:50.540
<v Speaker 3>there's collusion with all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

2792
02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Why just stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

2793
02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>would you see what he said today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that Komi lied and that he did</v>

2794
02:01:56.091 --> 02:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>stay the night in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Komi lied in his memo.</v>

2795
02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>That's me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2796
02:02:00.261 --> 02:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I did not catch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the latest,</v>

2797
02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>oh Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened.</v>

2798
02:02:05.710 --> 02:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>He's realized that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2799
02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:11.990
<v Speaker 1>they found his flight records and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that the jet was in Russia for</v>

2800
02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:16.100
<v Speaker 1>more than 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he said call me lied.</v>

2801
02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I never said I didn't s stay the night</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia.</v>

2802
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2803
02:02:20.181 --> 02:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a strange move here.</v>

2804
02:02:23.210 --> 02:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is either check or checkmate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a sneaky one.</v>

2805
02:02:26.391 --> 02:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're Colombian line.</v>

2806
02:02:29.210 --> 02:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>If Komi lied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing's fucked.</v>

2807
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:33.940
<v Speaker 1>If comi really did lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>

2808
02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if trump lied and Komi somehow or</v>

2809
02:02:38.181 --> 02:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>another have some recording or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

2810
02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome</v>

2811
02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:44.290
<v Speaker 3>juice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that,</v>

2812
02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:46.210
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russia collusion thing,</v>

2813
02:02:46.211 --> 02:02:49.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like where is the smoking gun?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or where is it?</v>

2814
02:02:49.181 --> 02:02:50.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all we see are these,</v>

2815
02:02:50.801 --> 02:02:54.400
<v Speaker 3>this Hamilton 68 dashboard that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally run by the Chertoff Group.</v>

2816
02:02:54.430 --> 02:02:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Michael turned off was bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dhs Hamilton 68 dash.</v>

2817
02:02:57.761 --> 02:03:01.360
<v Speaker 3>What's the think tank that you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>unquestioning needed repeated in every</v>

2818
02:03:01.361 --> 02:03:04.450
<v Speaker 3>single article about Russian trolls</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's like Russian trolls are</v>

2819
02:03:04.451 --> 02:03:09.220
<v Speaker 3>spreading nra shit online to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>foment discontent in this country are</v>

2820
02:03:09.221 --> 02:03:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Russian trolls are promoting Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanders or a Russian trolls are</v>

2821
02:03:12.311 --> 02:03:15.250
<v Speaker 3>promoting Jill Stein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the actual methodology</v>

2822
02:03:15.251 --> 02:03:18.700
<v Speaker 3>of how they determine who's a Russian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bot and who's a Russian troll,</v>

2823
02:03:18.701 --> 02:03:23.701
<v Speaker 3>it all comes from this think tank run by</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally Iraq war propagandists Bill</v>

2824
02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Crystal and Michael Chertoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I'm saying.</v>

2825
02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:29.860
<v Speaker 3>These narratives are so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so obscure to find out who's really</v>

2826
02:03:29.861 --> 02:03:32.380
<v Speaker 3>managing the narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it really is all the same people</v>

2827
02:03:32.590 --> 02:03:34.240
<v Speaker 3>selling where they're corniness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2828
02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:35.813
<v Speaker 1>they're canniness</v>

2829
02:03:36.490 --> 02:03:40.630
<v Speaker 3>because we want the end goal of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>empire is basically Russia,</v>

2830
02:03:40.690 --> 02:03:41.830
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iran,</v>

2831
02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Iran and Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The steppingstones basically ultimately</v>

2832
02:03:44.621 --> 02:03:47.920
<v Speaker 3>to China and Russia and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the biggest competitors with,</v>

2833
02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:50.980
<v Speaker 3>with the empire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they want to just foment that hot</v>

2834
02:03:50.981 --> 02:03:51.814
<v Speaker 3>war with Russia.</v>

2835
02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:53.820
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been going down a rabbit hole with</v>

2836
02:03:55.130 --> 02:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Chinese electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weiwei got banned from 18 and t and</v>

2837
02:04:02.211 --> 02:04:07.211
<v Speaker 1>verizon and all these other walway is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number three phone manufacturer in</v>

2838
02:04:08.601 --> 02:04:10.700
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also manufacture network</v>

2839
02:04:10.701 --> 02:04:13.220
<v Speaker 1>equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some,</v>

2840
02:04:13.221 --> 02:04:16.760
<v Speaker 1>so it seems to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is my conspiratorial mind and</v>

2841
02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to say right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a moron and I know very little about</v>

2842
02:04:20.751 --> 02:04:22.550
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is what,</v>

2843
02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>this is what's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Huawei makes some really good cell</v>

2844
02:04:28.071 --> 02:04:32.390
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like beautiful 40 megapixel camera,</v>

2845
02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:34.700
<v Speaker 1>excellent design,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous screen.</v>

2846
02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And they were about to be launched</v>
<v Speaker 1>America under a t and t and then the</v>

2847
02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:45.720
<v Speaker 1>State Department warned against people</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying walway phones,</v>

2848
02:04:45.721 --> 02:04:50.190
<v Speaker 1>sitting their spy devices and told</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to not buy walway phones.</v>

2849
02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:55.200
<v Speaker 1>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they're bringing up charges against</v>

2850
02:04:55.201 --> 02:04:58.470
<v Speaker 1>wowway for something to do with Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2851
02:04:58.471 --> 02:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>and then there was an article today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets really weird,</v>

2852
02:05:01.141 --> 02:05:02.400
<v Speaker 1>the compliance of the media.</v>

2853
02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:06.960
<v Speaker 1>There was an article today about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drop in sales of Chinese cell</v>

2854
02:05:06.961 --> 02:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Chinese cell phone sales plummet by</v>

2855
02:05:09.751 --> 02:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>21% I was reading today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2856
02:05:12.570 --> 02:05:14.490
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is happening here?</v>

2857
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Like they were saying that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>some networking equipment that was made</v>

2858
02:05:19.141 --> 02:05:24.141
<v Speaker 1>by waterway that was sending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sending a certain amount of data</v>

2859
02:05:25.561 --> 02:05:30.561
<v Speaker 1>that didn't seem right and they believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that some something was encoded in their</v>

2860
02:05:30.661 --> 02:05:35.280
<v Speaker 1>software and their hardware that allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to hack into it and extract data</v>

2861
02:05:35.281 --> 02:05:39.900
<v Speaker 1>and use this as a spying device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they were saying that this is</v>

2862
02:05:39.901 --> 02:05:43.350
<v Speaker 1>the case with the phones and these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't buy these wowway phones.</v>

2863
02:05:43.710 --> 02:05:47.190
<v Speaker 1>But then the android people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent Jamie a couple articles on it</v>

2864
02:05:47.191 --> 02:05:49.770
<v Speaker 1>because I was fascinated by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like 30 articles about it.</v>

2865
02:05:49.771 --> 02:05:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm like in like the last week and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>

2866
02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:55.410
<v Speaker 1>and these real smart tech people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2867
02:05:55.411 --> 02:05:56.244
<v Speaker 1>this is horseshit.</v>

2868
02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:59.910
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if these devices did have something in</v>

2869
02:05:59.911 --> 02:06:04.260
<v Speaker 1>them other than stock android or android</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a whatever they're a operating</v>

2870
02:06:04.261 --> 02:06:06.660
<v Speaker 1>system is that they put on over it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>their skin,</v>

2871
02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:08.940
<v Speaker 1>you would see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys would be able to see it.</v>

2872
02:06:08.941 --> 02:06:10.020
<v Speaker 1>They'd be able to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't,</v>

2873
02:06:10.021 --> 02:06:12.090
<v Speaker 1>they're not any more sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

2874
02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:14.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just something going on.</v>

2875
02:06:14.370 --> 02:06:16.230
<v Speaker 1>There's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some weirdness to it all.</v>

2876
02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:18.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like they might be trying to tank</v>
<v Speaker 1>these companies.</v>

2877
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:21.570
<v Speaker 1>They might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be a concerted effort,</v>

2878
02:06:21.690 --> 02:06:25.770
<v Speaker 1>and then the thought was that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps there's some sort of a deal with</v>

2879
02:06:25.771 --> 02:06:30.771
<v Speaker 1>Samsung and iphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the two top manufacturers to</v>

2880
02:06:31.201 --> 02:06:35.160
<v Speaker 1>keep out this third party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes these really high end cell</v>

2881
02:06:35.161 --> 02:06:39.750
<v Speaker 1>phones like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wowway has this porsche design mate</v>

2882
02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:43.140
<v Speaker 1>pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our s it's $2,000 it's like the most</v>

2883
02:06:43.141 --> 02:06:44.550
<v Speaker 1>expensive cell phone you could buy.</v>

2884
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:46.290
<v Speaker 1>This thing is off the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

2885
02:06:46.530 --> 02:06:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean it takes like nighttime a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns it into like almost daylight,</v>

2886
02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:53.490
<v Speaker 1>like crazy 40 megapixel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

2887
02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:58.170
<v Speaker 1>adjustable aperture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like like as good as it gets in terms of</v>

2888
02:06:58.171 --> 02:07:00.120
<v Speaker 1>like modern day cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>

2889
02:07:00.121 --> 02:07:01.140
<v Speaker 1>don't buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't buy it.</v>

2890
02:07:01.141 --> 02:07:03.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a spy device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tech guys are going,</v>

2891
02:07:03.541 --> 02:07:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2892
02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:08.220
<v Speaker 1>if she shouldn't buy it because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't update them very well.</v>

2893
02:07:09.230 --> 02:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>By devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2894
02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:12.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2895
02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:13.133
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2896
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about something and I don't type</v>

2897
02:07:15.361 --> 02:07:16.440
<v Speaker 1>it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't write a message.</v>

2898
02:07:16.441 --> 02:07:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't write an email and I'll see an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ad,</v>

2899
02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:20.490
<v Speaker 1>so it's fine on us all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen to you.</v>

2900
02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't happened to me,</v>

2901
02:07:22.021 --> 02:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's happened to enough people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you.</v>

2902
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:24.863
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2903
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I believe you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what,</v>

2904
02:07:26.131 --> 02:07:28.440
<v Speaker 1>but really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to so many people that have</v>

2905
02:07:28.441 --> 02:07:32.010
<v Speaker 1>had that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sent me a tweet yesterday that</v>

2906
02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:35.560
<v Speaker 1>said they were listening to a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were doing,</v>

2907
02:07:35.561 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>we were talking</v>

2908
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:39.870
<v Speaker 2>about something and then that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something appeared in their Google ads</v>

2909
02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:42.010
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never looked up this.</v>

2910
02:07:42.011 --> 02:07:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and oh no.</v>

2911
02:07:42.881 --> 02:07:45.130
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a google ad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a youtube search.</v>

2912
02:07:45.131 --> 02:07:47.810
<v Speaker 2>It was a youtube suggested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like my fucking computers</v>

2913
02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:48.850
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2914
02:07:49.210 --> 02:07:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Pewter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what APP is doing this?</v>

2915
02:07:51.041 --> 02:07:52.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to just go to a flip phone</v>

2916
02:07:52.691 --> 02:07:53.900
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2917
02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that youtube audio is being</v>

2918
02:07:56.561 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 2>listened to because they're mining it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>for ad ad stuff already.</v>

2919
02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:02.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a spy thing that's just out</v>

2920
02:08:02.831 --> 02:08:03.910
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they do it.</v>

2921
02:08:03.970 --> 02:08:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that if you're playing things?</v>

2922
02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when we're playing,</v>

2923
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:12.460
<v Speaker 2>so if he's playing a podcast on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube listening to that and that's how</v>

2924
02:08:12.461 --> 02:08:14.500
<v Speaker 2>they suggest it's just happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ads.</v>

2925
02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:18.580
<v Speaker 2>What I think might be happening with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are noticing now is not just that</v>

2926
02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:22.030
<v Speaker 2>it's happening within the software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that your actual device,</v>

2927
02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:25.300
<v Speaker 2>the microphone is on and the Laptop</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera is on.</v>

2928
02:08:25.301 --> 02:08:28.750
<v Speaker 2>So people block the camera with tape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not blocking the microphone.</v>

2929
02:08:28.751 --> 02:08:29.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2930
02:08:29.291 --> 02:08:30.580
<v Speaker 2>How the hell do you block the</v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone?</v>

2931
02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Don't even know where it is.</v>

2932
02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.460
<v Speaker 3>How do I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can we have like some sort of</v>

2933
02:08:33.461 --> 02:08:37.540
<v Speaker 3>tutorial about like how are we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>prevent all of our shit from being</v>

2934
02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:38.710
<v Speaker 3>collected?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that whole,</v>

2935
02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:40.750
<v Speaker 3>the facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cambridge analytica thing.</v>

2936
02:08:41.110 --> 02:08:43.690
<v Speaker 3>I feel like everyone missed the boat of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that story was.</v>

2937
02:08:43.691 --> 02:08:44.390
<v Speaker 3>You heard about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2938
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:46.420
<v Speaker 3>The Cambridge Analytica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're data mining all your shit.</v>

2939
02:08:46.421 --> 02:08:46.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2940
02:08:46.930 --> 02:08:49.210
<v Speaker 3>if you're on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's being taken in data mind.</v>

2941
02:08:49.211 --> 02:08:52.390
<v Speaker 3>That's very obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what wasn't really investigated,</v>

2942
02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:55.810
<v Speaker 3>I think channel four did this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation where they pretended like</v>

2943
02:08:55.811 --> 02:08:59.020
<v Speaker 3>they were a patron trying to hire</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cambridge Analytica,</v>

2944
02:08:59.030 --> 02:09:02.230
<v Speaker 3>some billionaire dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they put them on camera.</v>

2945
02:09:02.231 --> 02:09:04.600
<v Speaker 3>It's all recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guys are basically like,</v>

2946
02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:07.810
<v Speaker 3>it's basically like a private</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence from almost like a black</v>

2947
02:09:07.811 --> 02:09:11.140
<v Speaker 3>water where you going to hire</v>
<v Speaker 3>mercenaries to set up honeypots with</v>

2948
02:09:11.141 --> 02:09:13.000
<v Speaker 3>prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take down politicians,</v>

2949
02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 3>spy on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They set up shell companies with mis six</v>

2950
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:18.390
<v Speaker 3>massaad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2951
02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:21.310
<v Speaker 3>it's all just untraceable shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just go sit out.</v>

2952
02:09:21.311 --> 02:09:23.140
<v Speaker 3>They said they can ghost in out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

2953
02:09:23.410 --> 02:09:26.140
<v Speaker 3>They literally said that they staged the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire Kenyan election.</v>

2954
02:09:26.141 --> 02:09:27.340
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we staged the whole thing.</v>

2955
02:09:27.341 --> 02:09:29.500
<v Speaker 3>We wrote all the speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>know of because it's only when,</v>

2979
02:10:20.401 --> 02:10:23.000
<v Speaker 2>when something fucks up or someone gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot in the head and like,</v>

2980
02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:24.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was He wearing?</v>

2981
02:10:24.110 --> 02:10:24.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

2982
02:10:24.701 --> 02:10:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

2983
02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the Kenyan elections.</v>

2984
02:10:27.581 --> 02:10:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in cell,</v>

2985
02:10:28.871 --> 02:10:31.120
<v Speaker 2>we never heard of a sudden people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it.</v>

2986
02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be so many of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are just bubbling up in the</v>

2987
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disturbing.</v>

2988
02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:37.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

2989
02:10:37.611 --> 02:10:40.520
<v Speaker 1>how do I deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to do art and you got to go on</v>

2990
02:10:40.521 --> 02:10:42.500
<v Speaker 1>hikes and go explore nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2991
02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:44.270
<v Speaker 1>But you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever want to like knock,</v>

2992
02:10:44.271 --> 02:10:46.100
<v Speaker 1>concentrate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever feel like it's not gonna do</v>

2993
02:10:46.101 --> 02:10:47.600
<v Speaker 1>any good like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2994
02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:50.420
<v Speaker 1>this is my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question that I give to everybody</v>

2995
02:10:50.421 --> 02:10:54.380
<v Speaker 1>who's like an activist who's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>adamant about change and doing</v>

2996
02:10:54.381 --> 02:10:57.080
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever feel like you just don't</v>

2997
02:10:57.081 --> 02:10:59.000
<v Speaker 1>want to participate anymore and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to just,</v>

2998
02:10:59.970 --> 02:11:02.190
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone asked me the other day,</v>

2999
02:11:02.191 --> 02:11:02.671
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3000
02:11:02.671 --> 02:11:06.210
<v Speaker 3>you have to admit that you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather live anywhere in the world other</v>

3001
02:11:06.211 --> 02:11:07.050
<v Speaker 3>than here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3002
02:11:07.090 --> 02:11:07.923
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3003
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:11.010
<v Speaker 3>I would because I can't have a kid here</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't have maternity leave and</v>

3004
02:11:11.011 --> 02:11:11.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3005
02:11:11.911 --> 02:11:12.541
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3006
02:11:12.541 --> 02:11:15.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stay here because I have to and I have</v>

3007
02:11:15.001 --> 02:11:17.490
<v Speaker 3>to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about me and it's not about</v>

3008
02:11:17.491 --> 02:11:19.740
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the greater good.</v>

3009
02:11:20.250 --> 02:11:22.800
<v Speaker 3>And it's about putting this information</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there because,</v>

3010
02:11:22.801 --> 02:11:27.270
<v Speaker 3>especially in the trump era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like no one is really criticizing</v>

3011
02:11:27.271 --> 02:11:30.420
<v Speaker 3>him in the correct way and putting it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proper context of the u s empire.</v>

3012
02:11:30.421 --> 02:11:32.220
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like I need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3013
02:11:32.670 --> 02:11:33.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3014
02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:36.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't get sick of it and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3015
02:11:36.661 --> 02:11:38.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you do get burnt out and you get</v>

3016
02:11:38.461 --> 02:11:40.050
<v Speaker 3>tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have to keep going because this</v>

3017
02:11:40.051 --> 02:11:41.190
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to,</v>

3018
02:11:41.191 --> 02:11:44.280
<v Speaker 3>you don't do it for recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't do it to be on a magazine</v>

3019
02:11:44.281 --> 02:11:47.070
<v Speaker 3>cover because you're never going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>rewarded in the system that we live in,</v>

3020
02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:50.370
<v Speaker 3>that we're going to always live on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>margins and we're going to always fight</v>

3021
02:11:50.371 --> 02:11:51.930
<v Speaker 3>on the margins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3022
02:11:51.931 --> 02:11:52.860
<v Speaker 3>and that's just the way it is.</v>

3023
02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you hope to somebody who's listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that alters their perception and then</v>

3024
02:11:56.611 --> 02:11:57.780
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another it spreads.</v>

3025
02:11:58.040 --> 02:11:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think history is instructive and I</v>

3026
02:11:59.931 --> 02:12:01.640
<v Speaker 3>think that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I do what I do.</v>

3027
02:12:01.641 --> 02:12:05.480
<v Speaker 3>I want to instruct people about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>history has shaped our reality today and</v>

3028
02:12:05.481 --> 02:12:10.190
<v Speaker 3>how we can use it to learn and prevent</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar atrocities from continuing.</v>

3029
02:12:10.191 --> 02:12:12.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just hope that we can evolve to the</v>

3030
02:12:12.711 --> 02:12:13.850
<v Speaker 3>point where we can do that.</v>

3031
02:12:14.590 --> 02:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>You essentially work for yourself now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3032
02:12:16.740 --> 02:12:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I worked for Telesur tell a store is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3033
02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:23.820
<v Speaker 3>also state media six Latin American</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries and including Venezuela and</v>

3034
02:12:23.821 --> 02:12:26.100
<v Speaker 3>including Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ecuador,</v>

3035
02:12:26.730 --> 02:12:27.291
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3036
02:12:27.291 --> 02:12:29.310
<v Speaker 3>and some other countries fun tell a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sore,</v>

3037
02:12:29.610 --> 02:12:32.850
<v Speaker 3>but because of the sanctions that trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>has put on a Venezuela,</v>

3038
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.280
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's on a tedious leg.</v>

3039
02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:38.340
<v Speaker 3>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sucks that the only other place that</v>

3040
02:12:38.341 --> 02:12:40.750
<v Speaker 3>you can go is really just begging you</v>
<v Speaker 3>for donations on Patrion.</v>

3041
02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:44.260
<v Speaker 1>But as the empire files that is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>through Telstra?</v>

3042
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:45.011
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3043
02:12:45.011 --> 02:12:47.590
<v Speaker 3>so we are pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a production company and I</v>

3044
02:12:47.620 --> 02:12:49.300
<v Speaker 3>produced the show and then I sell it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3045
02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:53.780
<v Speaker 1>But you say begging for donations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't see it that way because</v>

3046
02:12:53.781 --> 02:12:57.080
<v Speaker 1>if you just give people the option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet people would be more than willing</v>

3047
02:12:57.081 --> 02:12:59.900
<v Speaker 1>to support your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your work if they're interested in your</v>

3048
02:12:59.901 --> 02:13:03.050
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like there's so many people</v>

3049
02:13:03.051 --> 02:13:07.970
<v Speaker 1>out there that would be now and it'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great way to be completely independent</v>

3050
02:13:07.971 --> 02:13:11.540
<v Speaker 1>and not beholden to any state run group</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything else.</v>

3051
02:13:11.541 --> 02:13:15.080
<v Speaker 1>You just basically be putting out</v>
<v Speaker 1>content and people didn't like it</v>

3052
02:13:15.081 --> 02:13:16.490
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't pay for it anymore.</v>

3053
02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:17.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3054
02:13:17.421 --> 02:13:18.440
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3055
02:13:18.441 --> 02:13:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not beholding to anyone because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't really have anyone telling me what</v>

3056
02:13:20.901 --> 02:13:21.830
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in Venezuela,</v>

3057
02:13:21.831 --> 02:13:25.070
<v Speaker 3>I was interviewing the defense minister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one vetted my questions.</v>

3058
02:13:25.071 --> 02:13:27.770
<v Speaker 3>I was confronting him about all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit.</v>

3059
02:13:27.771 --> 02:13:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one in corporate media would be</v>

3060
02:13:29.361 --> 02:13:31.710
<v Speaker 3>allowed to do that with our government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3061
02:13:31.711 --> 02:13:33.600
<v Speaker 3>to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we've just gotten to a</v>

3062
02:13:33.601 --> 02:13:36.530
<v Speaker 3>place with journalism and media where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3063
02:13:36.630 --> 02:13:39.210
<v Speaker 3>that's the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to invest in the</v>

3064
02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:43.020
<v Speaker 3>journalists that you want to support and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just the way that the world</v>

3065
02:13:43.021 --> 02:13:45.180
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because media is not a sustainable</v>

3066
02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:48.060
<v Speaker 3>business if you want it to be holding</v>
<v Speaker 3>power to account.</v>

3067
02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:52.660
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like that's not the worst</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in the world to have something</v>

3068
02:13:52.661 --> 02:13:57.661
<v Speaker 2>like Patrion or some similar type of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where people can just donate.</v>

3069
02:13:58.070 --> 02:13:59.810
<v Speaker 3>And I have that on media roots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3070
02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:01.430
<v Speaker 3>and on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>media roots radio,</v>

3071
02:14:01.431 --> 02:14:02.960
<v Speaker 3>I do have a Patriot in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3072
02:14:02.961 --> 02:14:03.980
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to do it.</v>

3073
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:07.370
<v Speaker 3>But to do investigative journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard one to do documentaries.</v>

3074
02:14:07.371 --> 02:14:09.800
<v Speaker 3>It takes a lot of money and time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3075
02:14:09.890 --> 02:14:13.640
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably where it'll end</v>
<v Speaker 3>up if we keep going down the road that</v>

3076
02:14:13.641 --> 02:14:14.600
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

3077
02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:17.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it be our to your teleseminar,</v>

3078
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:20.090
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this a fear campaign against state media</v>

3079
02:14:20.091 --> 02:14:22.730
<v Speaker 3>and against the Russian propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3080
02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:24.170
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3081
02:14:24.171 --> 02:14:26.960
<v Speaker 3>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll just keep trying to f uh,</v>

3082
02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:29.970
<v Speaker 3>speak that truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3083
02:14:30.850 --> 02:14:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm glad you're out there swinging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3084
02:14:34.751 --> 02:14:37.630
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a scary job and punching up.</v>

3085
02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:40.810
<v Speaker 2>You go to crazy places too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're not,</v>

3086
02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:43.270
<v Speaker 2>you're not swinging from the comfort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own home.</v>

3087
02:14:43.271 --> 02:14:44.980
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out there in the war zone.</v>

3088
02:14:45.620 --> 02:14:49.490
<v Speaker 3>It was scary when I confronted soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Columbia because I realized that I</v>

3089
02:14:49.491 --> 02:14:52.760
<v Speaker 3>could probably die either by hazing or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>

3090
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause there's mines all over the fucking</v>

3091
02:14:54.801 --> 02:14:57.950
<v Speaker 3>place and they were just like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>put my life on the line.</v>

3111
02:15:41.411 --> 02:15:45.100
<v Speaker 3>this bullshit because it just keeps</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening and we keep getting duped and</v>

3112
02:15:45.101 --> 02:15:48.160
<v Speaker 3>someone has to be out there countering</v>
<v Speaker 3>the narrative and telling these stories</v>

3113
02:15:48.161 --> 02:15:52.570
<v Speaker 3>from marginalized and oppressed people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have not been given those platforms.</v>

3114
02:15:52.571 --> 02:15:53.830
<v Speaker 3>And I have to keep doing that part.</v>
