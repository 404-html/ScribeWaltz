1
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you a couple of things on Joe and some of the things that I've</v>

2
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:12.324
<v Speaker 1>been working on now,</v>

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>like I mentioned the door,</v>

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>my whole,</v>

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>my main direction in Jujitsu is always been to major Jitsu better in MMA,</v>

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.763
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC.</v>

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.930
<v Speaker 1>The UFC is what got me into Jujitsu when I felt you have seals.</v>

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>That was the most amazing thing ever.</v>

9
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>immediately I started doing Jujitsu.</v>

12
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Quite is my favorite fighter.</v>

13
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who did anything,</v>

14
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:33.771
<v Speaker 1>what you did.</v>

15
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>So I was going from always been,</v>

16
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>oh and then like it's funny because you,</v>

17
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>and one way some,</v>

18
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people in that community see you as a bed.</v>

19
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Why did you see how the Guy Stopped?</v>

20
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] has got against us but I don't see,</v>

21
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I never saw that too.</v>

22
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like you trying to create your own routines and others trying to</v>

23
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>help to Jensen and that's all it was,</v>

24
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:55.711
<v Speaker 1>is I,</v>

25
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

26
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.933
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

27
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I got tired of seeing like in UFC 13,</v>

29
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:00.511
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

30
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>17 tired of seeing Jujitsu guys just,</v>

31
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>when Jerry Bolander Font,</v>

34
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 1>five years your shout,</v>

36
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

37
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.853
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

38
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>how was he?</v>

39
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>How he was getting beat up when,</v>

40
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.391
<v Speaker 1>what had been eight,</v>

42
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I fought Matt Hughes.</v>

43
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.371
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

44
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>that hurts so much because Jujitsu was my life and I thought we got to do</v>

45
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>something to fix this,</v>

46
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>especially in the car.</v>

47
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.291
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

48
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

49
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 1>let me show you a little bit.</v>

50
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

51
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>the one thing,</v>

52
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.321
<v Speaker 1>pride too.</v>

53
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:26.154
<v Speaker 1>I saw him,</v>

54
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I saw him the just pulled on like this for a second.</v>

55
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I thought,</v>

56
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.051
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

57
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>that could be something there.</v>

58
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Because generally,</v>

59
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.221
<v Speaker 1>people would be,</v>

61
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:35.821
<v Speaker 1>you'd be quick.</v>

62
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>You guys were doing like this when there was headbutts right?</v>

63
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>And then it headbutts came out.</v>

64
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>So this became a good way to survive from the punishment.</v>

65
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>So from there,</v>

66
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.880
<v Speaker 1>when I saw him some do this and hold,</v>

68
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I decided to start bringing it all up and really get use my legs.</v>

69
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:52.870
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

70
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Because with the key,</v>

71
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to control here,</v>

72
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>control the posture,</v>

73
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>but hard to control the posh and your legs keep slipping down.</v>

74
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>You want to go high guard.</v>

75
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>

76
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>my host,</v>

77
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>my host system started becoming this kind of stuff.</v>

78
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no way he could touch my face here.</v>

79
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

80
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>And I see chrome again,</v>

81
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.121
<v Speaker 1>Shinier EOP.</v>

82
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

83
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>and even Marcello sometimes he comes here to hold,</v>

84
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.413
<v Speaker 1>to hold up man.</v>

86
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>So the rubber guard,</v>

87
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:18.541
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you heard that,</v>

88
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's all about just getting into this position.</v>

89
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>If his arms up here is awful care,</v>

90
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll attack this on,</v>

91
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll even go like this and there's no way he can hit me and there's no way,</v>

92
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.083
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

93
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>he can pull out and stand up again.</v>

95
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 1>So that became my obsession is to develop a guard where they can't get up and</v>

96
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>run away and being able to prevent him.</v>

97
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>You can't elbow me right here.</v>

98
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Soon as I cross both these legs,</v>

99
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.660
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can help me.</v>

100
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible?</v>

101
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

102
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.813
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.953
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

104
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>that's what I developed in those for Jujitsu.</v>

105
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And like you said,</v>

106
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.500
<v Speaker 1>the judge would come here and do,</v>

107
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them took that as,</v>

108
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.791
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

109
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>he thinks he knows more than us.</v>

110
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.541
<v Speaker 1>Look at him,</v>

111
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:08.810
<v Speaker 1>he's turning his back on due dates.</v>

112
00:03:08.811 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I dropped the Guid is cause I felt that every second you grabbed</v>

113
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>the call and grab the sleeve,</v>

114
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same fighting stance MMA.</v>

115
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.993
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

116
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.344
<v Speaker 1>let's look,</v>

118
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't drop the game to say fuck you Jujitsu.</v>

119
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.251
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

120
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you know what for Nma,</v>

121
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>the gives them how good we have to,</v>

122
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>the fighting stance has to be the same.</v>

123
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>When we trap,</v>

124
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>when we train grappling with no punches or with punches,</v>

125
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>it has to be the same stance,</v>

126
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>the same final stance.</v>

127
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.820
<v Speaker 1>So based on what,</v>

128
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.381
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

129
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:46.280
<v Speaker 1>when I saw you and hence or doing it had to come from that defensive posture and</v>

130
00:03:46.281 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>their old book so you don't get hit.</v>

131
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Then the legs come up.</v>

132
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Then you started talking while you control them while you keep them from</v>

133
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>standing up and go and stand up again.</v>

134
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Because there was a fight with Fabiana [inaudible] and Dave Fernanda,</v>

135
00:03:58.421 --> 00:03:59.254
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>

136
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>UFC 20 something.</v>

137
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.521
<v Speaker 1>We're Fabiana,</v>

138
00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>he had a good arm bar from the guard so he fights day for night.</v>

139
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.100
<v Speaker 1>He was a pretty good rustler Fabiana he had,</v>

140
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>could not take him down.</v>

141
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>So they get against the cage and Fabiano here,</v>

142
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>which are full guard,</v>

143
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>pulled him into his garb and then put the feet on the hips and two to set up for</v>

144
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:17.771
<v Speaker 1>the arm bar.</v>

145
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's how he does it.</v>

146
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>And then Dave and I just stood up and just walked away,</v>

147
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.163
<v Speaker 1>do it again.</v>

148
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>So then Fabiana here gets up,</v>

149
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>he did it five times in that fight.</v>

150
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>He jumps garden,</v>

151
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>pulls him down.</v>

152
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as he opened up his legs and put his feet on the hips,</v>

153
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Dave Linn ever just to do it again and it gave him,</v>

154
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>and I ended up winning.</v>

155
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

156
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.833
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

157
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem because they don't have to be on top.</v>

158
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>If you pull guard because you can't take the fire down.</v>

159
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have to stay there.</v>

160
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you opened the guard,</v>

161
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get up just like a Allister over.</v>

162
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.770
<v Speaker 1>And when he fought five,</v>

163
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

164
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>you Superdome [inaudible] pulled them in his guard.</v>

165
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as he opened it,</v>

166
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.871
<v Speaker 1>Alister said,</v>

167
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

168
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go down there.</v>

169
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.503
<v Speaker 1>So it became a,</v>

170
00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

171
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.393
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

172
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to have them in the guard.</v>

173
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 1>If we can't wrestle low,</v>

174
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>we have to pull guard and then keep them from standing up.</v>

175
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>So the clinch became,</v>

176
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

177
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing,</v>

178
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 1>cause you've gotta be able to coach him and not only him,</v>

179
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:16.020
<v Speaker 1>so they don't stand up but conscience.</v>

180
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>So they don't hit you.</v>

181
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to hop off offense from that clench.</v>

182
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>So anytime someone would train the key and have the call in the sleep,</v>

183
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>that's not working on the club quarters.</v>

184
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's like you're not working on it.</v>

185
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 1>So that's why we're seeing all these black Delsi come in five or after fighting</v>

186
00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:31.991
<v Speaker 1>or all these guys,</v>

187
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>American talking black,</v>

188
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:33.964
<v Speaker 1>the black man,</v>

189
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>and then when they're on their back,</v>

190
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>they're not used to offense from the defense.</v>

191
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:42.530
<v Speaker 1>The best defense of position it.</v>

192
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>They just don't ever work there.</v>

193
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.951
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

194
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:45.191
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

195
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to train your game,</v>

196
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 1>grabbed the call and grab the sleeve and then it's going to somehow work itself</v>

197
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>out somehow.</v>

198
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.020
<v Speaker 1>It's going to work itself out when it doesn't work like that.</v>

199
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>

200
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>if you're practicing,</v>

201
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting stance like this,</v>

202
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>but in a fight you have to go here,</v>

203
00:05:58.671 --> 00:05:59.504
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be different.</v>

204
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.260
<v Speaker 1>You should have been practicing like of course.</v>

205
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

206
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>That was my philosophy and everything I've ever done,</v>

207
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

208
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>every little tweak I'd ever done.</v>

209
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Did you Dentsu some people in the Jiu Jitsu community got me and he goes,</v>

210
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.053
<v Speaker 1>number one guy,</v>

211
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 1>he thinks that I'm doing it just to think that I'm the best guy and that I'm</v>

212
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 1>better than Jujitsu.</v>

213
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Keep that.</v>

214
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Always look.</v>

215
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>He dropped the key.</v>

216
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.880
<v Speaker 1>He hits you gypsy.</v>

217
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.130
<v Speaker 1>He's betraying and like it's not about that.</v>

218
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.051
<v Speaker 1>He even calls you,</v>

219
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking.</v>

220
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.080
<v Speaker 1>He said [inaudible],</v>

221
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.953
<v Speaker 1>what's he doing?</v>

222
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.870
<v Speaker 1>He's taken off the guy.</v>

223
00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>You gave him a black down here.</v>

224
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause I said if I ever teach Jujitsu,</v>

225
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to teach without the gate just to do my part for MMA.</v>

226
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>You can keep the gate and you can train that you need to do the mood in the</v>

227
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:38.811
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

228
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:43.811
<v Speaker 1>But some I need to focus and dedicate myself to try and to try.</v>

229
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to approve Jujitsu and MMA.</v>

230
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 1>That's all I was ever tried for Jujitsu,</v>

231
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>not for Samba and not pro wrestling.</v>

232
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm for striking.</v>

233
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jujitsu,</v>

234
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.063
<v Speaker 1>pure blood,</v>

235
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.143
<v Speaker 1>pure blood.</v>

236
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And so that is the misconception that it has it around and they're saying,</v>

237
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:02.181
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

238
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:03.270
<v Speaker 1>he's changing names.</v>

239
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.690
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

240
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 1>he's taking moves and changing the names.</v>

241
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.561
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

242
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the rest of the move to twister.</v>

243
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>He calls it the twister.</v>

244
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.030
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the,</v>

245
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 1>the wrestlers guillotine and well I didn't change the mood Hicken and John John</v>

246
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Changed it because I would come in and I say,</v>

247
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>this is a guilty I learned in wrestling and they were like,</v>

248
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.860
<v Speaker 1>there was already a killer team.</v>

249
00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the front headlock.</v>

250
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a good,</v>

251
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.990
<v Speaker 1>so they started calling it twister.</v>

252
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

253
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.223
<v Speaker 1>It's not the twister.</v>

254
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 1>So then later people started saying,</v>

255
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.201
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

256
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>he changes a wrestling move and he's a fraud.</v>

257
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 1>He's taken moves and changing them and he's making all these new facilities</v>

258
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>positions and changing.</v>

259
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Then the only names that I invent,</v>

260
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 1>like the names that I came up with were moves or transitions that didn't have</v>

261
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:44.294
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>

262
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 1>So in my,</v>

263
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.423
<v Speaker 1>in my brain,</v>

264
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I can teach better and I could learn better than every transition,</v>

265
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.800
<v Speaker 1>every position,</v>

266
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 1>not even if it's a submission.</v>

267
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Every transition,</v>

268
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>every set up has a name so that I could with my students,</v>

269
00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I can get on the phone and we have a language that we're talking to them.</v>

270
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

271
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise if you're on the phone,</v>

272
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going,</v>

273
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.361
<v Speaker 1>you know that one,</v>

274
00:08:03.361 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>who would he put your hand on hip and like what mood you have to show,</v>

275
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:07.270
<v Speaker 1>you have to show that.</v>

276
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

277
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

278
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.833
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

279
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Americans like naming everything.</v>

280
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's what,</v>

281
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what the naming process came in.</v>

282
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I came up with all these crazy names,</v>

283
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>these stupid names because it was not until he came back down.</v>

284
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And then my goal is to pull my form over here.</v>

285
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Now there's more pressure now,</v>

286
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:24.370
<v Speaker 1>right here,</v>

287
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 1>very hard to do anything.</v>

288
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

289
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 1>the next step was to come here and then hug right here.</v>

290
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're going to punch with this here,</v>

291
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be ready already and I'm already holding the foot and I can control</v>

292
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:37.124
<v Speaker 1>right here,</v>

293
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 1>very hard to do anything.</v>

294
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm right here.</v>

295
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 1>This is where I'm at.</v>

296
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 1>You need flexibility.</v>

297
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.150
<v Speaker 1>And then if you join to stand up with this leg,</v>

298
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I went to figure four here and then right here it's over.</v>

299
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>You'd be very hard.</v>

300
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.680
<v Speaker 1>You feel that,</v>

301
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.183
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

302
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 1>so that is a way to make it so that you're defensive and they can't punch you.</v>

303
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

304
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually going for the kill.</v>

305
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being defensive.</v>

306
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going for the Co.</v>

307
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 1>And in my experience,</v>

308
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the government wants 60,</v>

309
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the guy is.</v>

310
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 1>If he's won 85,</v>

311
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 1>one 90,</v>

312
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and he's a wrestler.</v>

313
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 1>In my experience,</v>

314
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that works is to get here in time and hug that I'm right here.</v>

315
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 1>This is an old hot right cause we've very hard for,</v>

316
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>for anybody to do it.</v>

317
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Then once this book comes over here and then here,</v>

318
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.510
<v Speaker 1>very hard really to do anything there.</v>

319
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:34.981
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal.</v>

320
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 1>And it's really not that hard.</v>

321
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I played this game against my Tufts students on the day on a daily basis.</v>

322
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 1>So the best thing for you to do is keep both your hands on the chest,</v>

323
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.153
<v Speaker 1>both of them.</v>

324
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.771
<v Speaker 1>And then yes,</v>

325
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:50.350
<v Speaker 1>that's that's cause now you have an opportunity to maybe posture you do.</v>

326
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 1>So what I want to do and leave you these fan,</v>

327
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 1>now you can't punch me and now you can't posture because you only can do it with</v>

328
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:57.264
<v Speaker 1>one heart.</v>

329
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.433
<v Speaker 1>They understand.</v>

330
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And then once I grabbed the other leg here and clear here,</v>

331
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.153
<v Speaker 1>very hard,</v>

332
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>you can't punch and then I can attack this on her hair.</v>

333
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.133
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at this one.</v>

334
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I could take this arm this way or I could just right here.</v>

335
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't defend with your right arm because I've already tracked it and then</v>

336
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 1>we're here.</v>

337
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 1>This is my,</v>

338
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.230
<v Speaker 1>one of my go to arm ourselves and then if it all fails and a lot of times we</v>

339
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:24.931
<v Speaker 1>just ended up here.</v>

340
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Then we had the finding from here,</v>

341
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.650
<v Speaker 1>like you survived everything and then now we're here.</v>

342
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking to come back to hook here.</v>

343
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking to come back to the cure and take this or you roll.</v>

344
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.380
<v Speaker 1>And then this week,</v>

345
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of times it got one guy will get there and he's like,</v>

346
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.381
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

347
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:41.214
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to roll.</v>

348
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 1>And then at the sweep and I go up and I roll it too and I pass your guard at the</v>

349
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:46.210
<v Speaker 1>same time with that role.</v>

350
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.600
<v Speaker 1>But that's the last resort I'm trying to grab to the neck that our first connect</v>

351
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.443
<v Speaker 1>the arm,</v>

352
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.870
<v Speaker 1>keep control in the way.</v>

353
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.270
<v Speaker 1>How on the next year I'm going to,</v>

354
00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go after their arm or putting my foot over and hold onto your hat.</v>

355
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.933
<v Speaker 1>What a joke.</v>

356
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.263
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

357
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.213
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

358
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to get this aren't on the bat.</v>

359
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.930
<v Speaker 1>If I can't get off the island on the mat,</v>

360
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.720
<v Speaker 1>then there's a different things I can do here.</v>

361
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I can try to clear the neck anyways.</v>

362
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I been try to clear them.</v>

363
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.950
<v Speaker 1>If I can't clear the night,</v>

364
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.100
<v Speaker 1>then we can just stay here and then I could punch here until yet they're going</v>

365
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.520
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] yeah,</v>

366
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.420
<v Speaker 1>well he could stall it out.</v>

367
00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 1>People could smell some news.</v>

368
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 1>They always didn't want to stay.</v>

369
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Especially now they want to stay here.</v>

370
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

371
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.690
<v Speaker 1>So he did the recipes come from the butcher heater's fine.</v>

372
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

373
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.531
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

374
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

375
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Miss it.</v>

376
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:44.820
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

377
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.391
<v Speaker 1>this comes from,</v>

378
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:46.171
<v Speaker 1>this is a patient,</v>

379
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.004
<v Speaker 1>a patient game.</v>

380
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.190
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I can still work from here and I could still,</v>

381
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.060
<v Speaker 1>what I would do another may as punch here until you and then Google.</v>

382
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.963
<v Speaker 1>Now we're here.</v>

383
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

384
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.321
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

385
00:11:56.321 --> 00:12:00.400
<v Speaker 1>but the most important thing is to get that hand on the map before the Lex come</v>

386
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:00.730
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

387
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.110
<v Speaker 1>So anytime you're here and I have the under hook,</v>

388
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>that means whether I'm here or here,</v>

389
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.170
<v Speaker 1>that means all I got to do is bring this up here and now that arm is right out</v>

390
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.013
<v Speaker 1>of the mix.</v>

391
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm rolling,</v>

392
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm always looking for that overlook.</v>

393
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

394
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I get this Oprah hook here,</v>

395
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

396
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.360
<v Speaker 1>These lectures that come in here,</v>

397
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be right here and then fam right here and then because this</v>

398
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:25.084
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>

399
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.640
<v Speaker 1>so it's all come from the overall.</v>

400
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Even from butterfly card here,</v>

401
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.220
<v Speaker 1>if I'm here and butterfly guard,</v>

402
00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 1>all I got to do is release and now I'm here and then,</v>

403
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a stacking.</v>

404
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.160
<v Speaker 1>You have to be patient.</v>

405
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's quick.</v>

406
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Am I fail?</v>

407
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>You might pull out of it,</v>

408
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 1>but then we go back to it again.</v>

409
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

410
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:43.830
<v Speaker 1>some guys pull out of sweaty.</v>

412
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.170
<v Speaker 1>It was just like a,</v>

413
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to take him down.</v>

414
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.350
<v Speaker 1>You didn't take him down.</v>

415
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.873
<v Speaker 1>You set it up again.</v>

416
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Trying to think to like where Joe,</v>

417
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 1>it takes me four times to get him in his own polite.</v>

418
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>He's seen so much wrong.</v>

419
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 1>He'll pull out and then we have started again.</v>

420
00:12:59.240 --> 00:12:59.511
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

421
00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 1>He smashed me and then he pulls out and let me start again and then boom,</v>

422
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:03.581
<v Speaker 1>like on the fourth one,</v>

423
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:03.940
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

424
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.441
<v Speaker 1>I caught him.</v>

425
00:13:04.441 --> 00:13:05.110
<v Speaker 1>He puts on,</v>

426
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.943
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to bat,</v>

427
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Speaker 1>so it's just like take down.</v>

428
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 1>If you keep trying to take a guy down and meanwhile,</v>

429
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.500
<v Speaker 1>even though it's failing,</v>

430
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you can't get hit because the way to defendant is the stack stay tight and not</v>

431
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:17.680
<v Speaker 1>do anything.</v>

432
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 1>The way to stop it,</v>

433
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 1>it's don't punch because as soon as you punch a mess at Max me out at one point,</v>

434
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>your hands already on the map.</v>

435
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

436
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.040
<v Speaker 2>The best analogy that you've ever made about it is when you talked about head</v>

437
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:29.730
<v Speaker 2>kicks.</v>

438
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Like if you tried to teach someone how to throw a head kick,</v>

439
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.720
<v Speaker 2>know I can't fucking kicks him out,</v>

440
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:35.190
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

441
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.330
<v Speaker 2>How am I going to kick some of that?</v>

442
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.720
<v Speaker 2>But you're getting a guy who was like,</v>

443
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Maury Smith a great kickboxer.</v>

444
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:39.991
<v Speaker 2>It's easy,</v>

445
00:13:39.991 --> 00:13:42.630
<v Speaker 2>but then it kicks them in because they've done it so many times.</v>

446
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.520
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a part of their natural movement.</v>

447
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Once you develop the type of guard that he has,</v>

448
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I tell everybody,</v>

449
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 2>if you don't roll with him,</v>

450
00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:52.170
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand what's possible.</v>

451
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Once you roll with him,</v>

452
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.840
<v Speaker 2>his legs are like arms and they're moving in positions that you don't come to</v>

453
00:13:57.841 --> 00:14:01.140
<v Speaker 2>expect a normal training and until you experience it,</v>

454
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.670
<v Speaker 2>you don't know the possibilities.</v>

455
00:14:02.671 --> 00:14:04.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the next level of MMA.</v>

456
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I think what he's doing right now is going to be,</v>

457
00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:07.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

458
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:11.340
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing all these new like wheel kicks and new techniques and it's</v>

459
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:12.174
<v Speaker 2>striking.</v>

460
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.490
<v Speaker 2>That's the next thing is his car techniques.</v>

461
00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:17.300
<v Speaker 2>I really believe it all started from watching Hanzo diversity.</v>

462
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.151
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

463
00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:18.500
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

464
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.333
<v Speaker 2>Ooh</v>

465
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.020
<v Speaker 1>cause I was a high guard player with the key.</v>

466
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.183
<v Speaker 1>No key,</v>

467
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 1>the legs keep slipping the let's leave some.</v>

468
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:26.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to attack.</v>

469
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.210
<v Speaker 1>So then we're like,</v>

470
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh let's just keep the leg up here.</v>

471
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:30.250
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>

472
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.250
<v Speaker 3>the necessity to keep the light glows and that matter is a really,</v>

473
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.910
<v Speaker 3>is it really effective?</v>

474
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.773
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

475
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.083
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

476
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.290
<v Speaker 3>if the guy try to be defensive,</v>

477
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

478
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.460
<v Speaker 3>is hard for you I believe.</v>

479
00:14:49.461 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>I believe you had combine some kinds</v>

480
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.551
<v Speaker 1>of strikes,</v>

481
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:53.460
<v Speaker 1>some kind of punishment.</v>

482
00:14:53.461 --> 00:14:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

483
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:54.141
<v Speaker 1>Your fee.</v>

484
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

485
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 1>We've was maybe to create that kind of panic.</v>

486
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:03.120
<v Speaker 1>The show is the best day in day out of those positions without struck.</v>

487
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.470
<v Speaker 1>So I was here,</v>

488
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I love the shoulder here.</v>

489
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.343
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding</v>

490
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.100
<v Speaker 1>this position right here.</v>

491
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.170
<v Speaker 1>If you could,</v>

492
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll do it on Joe,</v>

493
00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 1>but if you could see this right here.</v>

494
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Again this is all you're going to keep it.</v>

495
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.900
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to let me have the arm bar cause as soon as you straighten that</v>

496
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:18.763
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be tight.</v>

497
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 1>So all I'm going to do is just throw elbows rammed the perfect angle to come</v>

498
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 1>down this anchor Russia</v>

499
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:30.830
<v Speaker 1>that's published and setting up the arm bar and listen.</v>

500
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Very common and my,</v>

501
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 1>and my style I have getting here,</v>

502
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm keeping this tight.</v>

503
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>See this position right?</v>

504
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I call this muddy waters here and he can't do anything and I have full away on</v>

505
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:44.160
<v Speaker 1>his elbow and the pump.</v>

506
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Take the arm.</v>

507
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 1>This arm is out of Mexico.</v>

508
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.053
<v Speaker 1>This is tight.</v>

509
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.970
<v Speaker 1>So this is a position I worked to get into.</v>

510
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 1>This could take three minutes to get into,</v>

511
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 1>but once I'm here it's over now and slowly bit by bit.</v>

512
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I have to move this elbow and cause how do you move that boy?</v>

513
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.950
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard.</v>

514
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I can't move into here.</v>

515
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Pop so hard.</v>

516
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.260
<v Speaker 1>He has good posture.</v>

517
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.093
<v Speaker 1>So why?</v>

518
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.020
<v Speaker 1>So what I need to do is to get my form on this side,</v>

519
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 1>cross my here I'm looking at how I squeeze the elbows,</v>

520
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.200
<v Speaker 1>see how it's easier and then I go back to this and that.</v>

521
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:16.034
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>

522
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.880
<v Speaker 1>this is my on one move that I do all the time and then once I'm here I don't</v>

523
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 1>even need to bring the leg over the face.</v>

524
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I could just finish it right here.</v>

525
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.670
<v Speaker 1>If he has flexible arms then we take,</v>

526
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.730
<v Speaker 1>if I don't want to take a chance,</v>

527
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I know this way.</v>

528
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.633
<v Speaker 1>So interesting.</v>

529
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.540
<v Speaker 1>That's stuff that I would love to show crop.</v>

530
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I would love to cause he's already trying to do it.</v>

531
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.130
<v Speaker 1>He's already flexible.</v>

532
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be very valuable in all my guys do this.</v>

533
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 1>This is standard stuff that all,</v>

534
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.020
<v Speaker 1>I got some guys that are doing amazing.</v>

535
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I'm in the car,</v>

536
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.490
<v Speaker 1>the lights come up and guys already in trouble.</v>

537
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:53.853
<v Speaker 1>She Aoki,</v>

538
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.913
<v Speaker 1>he got,</v>

539
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 1>he's the one who uses it the most.</v>

540
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 1>If you watch New York,</v>

541
00:16:57.681 --> 00:16:59.380
<v Speaker 1>he just a very hot,</v>

542
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.760
<v Speaker 1>basic version of this.</v>

543
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I was in 2000 I was in Japan in 2005 and um,</v>

544
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I showed off stuff.</v>

545
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.170
<v Speaker 1>He never seen it before.</v>

546
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Immediately starts using it and his fights,</v>

547
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.240
<v Speaker 1>he starts trying on everybody.</v>

548
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And so just something that I would love to show chrome,</v>

549
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.100
<v Speaker 1>I would love to.</v>

550
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I think I might be able just in case he's in a bad spot,</v>

551
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.460
<v Speaker 1>if I the lesser of the two on top of them might,</v>

552
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:31.540
<v Speaker 1>it might be an extra weapon that made it a gay Wacko is good.</v>

553
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

554
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 1>When we go to [inaudible],</v>

555
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.300
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for your patience and thanks for your input.</v>

556
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to spend to come.</v>

557
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.423
<v Speaker 1>They're going to slip on it.</v>

558
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

559
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Also can estimate this again like.</v>
