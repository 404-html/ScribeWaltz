<v Speaker 1>interdimensional child molester.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd yet.</v>

10
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I've been probed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who was doing it,</v>

11
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 2>but somebody was probing me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interdimensionally.</v>

12
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that.</v>

13
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.973
<v Speaker 1>Just about to talk about getting Alex </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones high on the podcast before we </v>

14
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said save it.</v>

15
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:27.414
<v Speaker 1>You got to say,</v>

16
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.340
<v Speaker 2>well see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that tuned into who he is.</v>

17
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just hear you know,</v>

18
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 2>occasionally Alex Jones is this right </v>
<v Speaker 2>wing conspiracy guy and I never listened</v>

19
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:37.694
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I saw you was on your show and I was </v>

20
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:40.244
<v Speaker 2>working at home doing some shit around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the house so I put it on youtube so I </v>

21
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:43.214
<v Speaker 2>could actually see him doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking these things off the headphones </v>

22
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:48.400
<v Speaker 2>on and off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God man.</v>

23
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 2>And like for the first hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half,</v>

24
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this guy,</v>

25
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.303
<v Speaker 2>about half of what he says actually kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of makes sense to me and he's obviously </v>

26
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 2>really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High Iq off the fucking charts,</v>

27
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:04.184
<v Speaker 2>no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he would just veer off and the </v>

28
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>more we add in whiskey got involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more it was just like,</v>

29
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 2>this is performance art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just nuts.</v>

30
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Beyond that,</v>

31
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>once he started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

32
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>right before the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

33
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I want to get a drink and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

34
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.433
<v Speaker 1>he had some whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he have some whiskey before I got </v>

35
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been right as you got it right as I</v>

36
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was already here and he's like,</v>

37
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>well before we get started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give it,</v>

38
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.113
<v Speaker 1>let me get a drink real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went back and I had a drink with </v>

39
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:34.611
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

40
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:36.110
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to let them drink alone.</v>

41
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:36.950
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

42
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.053
<v Speaker 1>But it was a dangerous proposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Eddie Bravo was here and Eddie </v>

43
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.953
<v Speaker 1>Bravo is Mexican and Joey Diaz says that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans are basically a native </v>

44
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he's right.</v>

45
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's,</v>

46
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>there's Mexicans that were native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans that bread with the Spanish.</v>

47
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:59.360
<v Speaker 1>You would know more about this having </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in Spain and so that's why.</v>

48
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean so.</v>

49
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And when grid with Mexicans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spaniard,</v>

50
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't breed with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>

51
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but attempted breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone through the motions.</v>

52
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

53
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:11.864
<v Speaker 1>they look like some of them look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from Spain and some of them look </v>

54
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 1>like native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting,</v>

55
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>like Mexico is a kind of really diverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a genetic line.</v>

56
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>

57
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old stereotype about native </v>

58
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Americans that you can get them drunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Indian goes fucking crazy.</v>

59
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo,</v>

60
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.453
<v Speaker 1>who's Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz is always saying you get them </v>

61
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking Indian comes out.</v>

62
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And that is exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>So we got Eddie drunk and he just went </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the fucking rails with.</v>

64
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 1>He thinks the government sprain shit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky and he's been saying it forever,</v>

65
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.050
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much so that he's constantly got legs</v>

66
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias thing where he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly looking to confirm.</v>

67
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.343
<v Speaker 1>So he just had this agenda that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to Alex Jones even after you </v>

68
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 1>talked about interdimensional child </v>
<v Speaker 1>molesters,</v>

69
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 2>right in Obama's mother sea sex work.</v>

70
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Still crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

71
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.044
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people got a chance to see what </v>

72
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I see in him because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>

73
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>how can you be friends with Alex Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

74
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy,</v>

75
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>he's a lot of fun and he's right about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of shit.</v>

76
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>

77
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:18.794
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody emailed me this morning and </v>

78
00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:21.180
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

79
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had said,</v>

80
00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

81
00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:25.520
<v Speaker 2>this guy is actually making sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

82
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.600
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a.</v>

83
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.750
<v Speaker 2>He denies the Sandy Hook massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

84
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

85
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.080
<v Speaker 2>That's such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

86
00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of thing that for me,</v>

87
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like if he's denying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then fuck that guy.</v>

88
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.120
<v Speaker 2>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:03:38.121 --> 00:03:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Obama's mother was a CIA sex worker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just funny.</v>

90
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

91
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

92
00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I think this is my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my take on him and I,</v>

93
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.360
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this guy dearly.</v>

94
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he's a high high power </v>

95
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.090
<v Speaker 1>corvette engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.310
<v Speaker 1>But some of the spark plugs are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally connected.</v>

97
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the Obama's wife is a CIA,</v>

98
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Mama's Mama was a cia sex slave and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandy hook and we've got the documents.</v>

99
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.663
<v Speaker 1>There's a few of those things that get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through where maybe if he had someone </v>

100
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:15.530
<v Speaker 1>next to them going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at this objective.</v>

101
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it possible that this could be the</v>

102
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:19.144
<v Speaker 1>case or isn't it possible that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be the case and it's the opposite </v>

103
00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>of what he's got is millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

104
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us more of that.</v>

105
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>People fucking love conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They loved them,</v>

106
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>they loved them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

107
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>this is where I was.</v>

108
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I was surprised to be agreeing with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>

109
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Because we do live in a conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a conspiracy.</v>

110
00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Modern civilization is a fucking lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I agree that,</v>

111
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he saying like,</v>

112
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're being.</v>

113
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.813
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he gets into lizard people and </v>

114
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:51.180
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

115
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't get into lizard people.</v>

116
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm David Eick.</v>

117
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.661
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

118
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get into a super organisms,</v>

119
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.630
<v Speaker 2>like I think we're embedded in a super </v>
<v Speaker 2>organism.</v>

120
00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 2>You and I've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

121
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.803
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we as a species are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are detrimental to our own </v>

122
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:08.754
<v Speaker 2>interests as individual human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we are embedded in the super </v>

123
00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:15.900
<v Speaker 2>organism just like our bacteria is </v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded in us and you know,</v>

124
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.230
<v Speaker 2>using the super organism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth itself,</v>

125
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.460
<v Speaker 2>like what do you think?</v>

126
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.450
<v Speaker 2>It's technology too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

127
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you and I and Duncan and talked </v>

128
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 2>about this a bunch and we were doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrimp parade thing because I see,</v>

129
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.283
<v Speaker 2>I see it as the end of humanity and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a negative thing because I kind of </v>

130
00:05:34.671 --> 00:05:38.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the way we lived for 200,000</v>

131
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:38.994
<v Speaker 2>years embedded in the environment like </v>
<v Speaker 2>other animals and pretty fucking happy </v>

132
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 2>and living in the moment and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's,</v>

134
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.483
<v Speaker 2>Duncan thinks it's great that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading out into the universe and you </v>

135
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:49.584
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if we stopped being humans to do </v>

136
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:52.830
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

137
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating conversation.</v>

138
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm crazy too,</v>

139
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 2>is my point,</v>

140
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.143
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's a certain amount of </v>

141
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 3>craziness that certainly called for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're crazy.</v>

142
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 3>I think you're looking at like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>extrapolating,</v>

143
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.083
<v Speaker 3>you're just looking at what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they didn't mean it's really clear </v>

144
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

145
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 3>We're not operating in the best interest</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the species.</v>

146
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we continue,</v>

147
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 3>do you just see this new crack in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Holy Shit.</v>

148
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.373
<v Speaker 3>It's grown over the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>months by like a mile and the things </v>

149
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 3>like the size of Delaware or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous.</v>

150
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:27.434
<v Speaker 3>And if it breaks off Foxville just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic floating iceberg like the size </v>

151
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 3>of a state might just head to Hawaii and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking crash into it.</v>

152
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:38.774
<v Speaker 3>Like this shocking animation reveals how</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive hell a massive Antarctic crack </v>

153
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 3>has grown 17 miles in the last two </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

154
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go back.</v>

155
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Let's go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

156
00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:48.784
<v Speaker 3>and experts say it's now inevitable that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will create one of the biggest </v>

157
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 3>icebergs ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

158
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Inevitable size of Jamaica.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

159
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>

160
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

161
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.443
<v Speaker 3>It would be so scary to see like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>floating state in the ocean and </v>

162
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Fukushima radiation is worse than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>

163
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 3>and they don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no idea how to contain it.</v>

164
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Not all problems are solvable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

165
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that Fukushima.</v>

166
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 3>It scares the shit out of me because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't really know how to shut off a</v>

167
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:23.954
<v Speaker 3>lot of those ancient power plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones that they first correct </v>

168
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:27.374
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Essentially they just have to keep </v>

169
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 3>running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like grow the fuck.</v>

170
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Let whoever the fuck let them do that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>so crazy.</v>

171
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.960
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how to shut them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see so much.</v>

172
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:38.590
<v Speaker 3>A technology is based on this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

173
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.910
<v Speaker 3>when we need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we face the problem,</v>

174
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 3>we'll have an answer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

175
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 3>like the disposal of nuclear waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

176
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Well we'll figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll shoot it into space or will.</v>

177
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.883
<v Speaker 3>We know they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've kind of figured out a way to </v>

178
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:51.164
<v Speaker 3>turn nuclear waste into batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They turned it into diamonds that lasts </v>

179
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 3>for like they embedded into diamonds and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can last.</v>

180
00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:57.691
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

181
00:07:57.691 --> 00:07:58.524
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technology of the battery can last </v>

182
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:01.120
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

183
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

184
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 3>And let's get on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

185
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:04.790
<v Speaker 3>there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was,</v>

186
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.653
<v Speaker 3>which podcast was it that we were doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>where someone was talking about a young </v>

187
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:10.540
<v Speaker 3>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember who was who?</v>

188
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.553
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about a young </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist that has these incredible </v>

189
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

190
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him.</v>

191
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.880
<v Speaker 3>That was the one I did in 2012 or 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

192
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 3>he does this little reactor in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>backyard,</v>

193
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.310
<v Speaker 3>essentially meant to many podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

194
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.193
<v Speaker 3>it was fairly recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go over the fairly recent podcasts </v>

195
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 3>and vice did a thing on him.</v>

196
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.480
<v Speaker 3>It was Shane Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

197
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Shane Smith from vice?</v>

198
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

199
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.283
<v Speaker 3>so maybe he's right or maybe people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>right that we will come up with </v>

200
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:42.224
<v Speaker 3>technology that's going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to solve these </v>

201
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:44.930
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

202
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't see that's the thing here</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are Fukushima,</v>

203
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.583
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how to solve it when we </v>

204
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 3>need it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

205
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 3>or a year ago or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dump.</v>

206
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.093
<v Speaker 3>We bear this radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diamond batteries making good use of </v>

207
00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.124
<v Speaker 3>nuclear waste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're going to have these diamond </v>

208
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 3>battery that lasts for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

209
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 3>which is really incredible because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shane Smith was saying is essentially we</v>

210
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 3>have enough nuclear waste to power the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth for thousands of years.</v>

211
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Our civilization like we can literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

212
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.703
<v Speaker 3>We can stop all production of batteries </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the different things that we're </v>

213
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:20.364
<v Speaker 3>doing coal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's where we're getting into </v>

214
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy shit again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't let us do it.</v>

215
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 3>They'll shut that shit down because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>will lose jobs.</v>

216
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Like right now they're trying to open </v>
<v Speaker 3>coal mines again for fucks sake.</v>

217
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's they?</v>

218
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Coal miners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coal Mine,</v>

219
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unions and coal mine presidents.</v>

220
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 3>And the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

221
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:38.574
<v Speaker 3>Exxon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy from Exxon who's going to be </v>

222
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 3>secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tillerson.</v>

223
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy who said,</v>

224
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 3>what's the point of saving the earth if </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans have to suffer?</v>

225
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Is that what he said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

226
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.973
<v Speaker 3>Smart Guy.</v>

227
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

228
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.233
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to drag us down and </v>

229
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.170
<v Speaker 3>depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Depressing.</v>

230
00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we were right though that what </v>

231
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 3>you're saying about technology and about</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're serving technology.</v>

232
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.353
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying this for a long time </v>

233
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 3>that I essentially think that what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is giving birth.</v>

234
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.050
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a larva form.</v>

235
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.403
<v Speaker 3>Were like some sort of a butterfly </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna emerge or we will be a </v>

236
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 3>butterfly and a caterpillar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now we're creating the iphones and</v>

237
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm a caterpillar going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>

238
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I liked the color stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want to lose it.</v>

239
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think those single celled </v>
<v Speaker 3>organisms like guys,</v>

240
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're branching out.</v>

241
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 3>We're fucking joining together with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other cells.</v>

242
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:33.114
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked being by myself being </v>

243
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 3>essentially immortal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immortal,</v>

244
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 3>single celled squid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be,</v>

245
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:41.790
<v Speaker 3>but when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

246
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>advancing stage requires the destruction</v>

247
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 3>of your entire environment and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other species as well.</v>

248
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is fucked.</v>

249
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know if it's all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>

250
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 3>I think rats will be fine if he watched </v>
<v Speaker 3>that netflix documentary on rats.</v>

251
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

252
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I saw you posted some shit and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

253
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 3>Nina and I want to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is amazing.</v>

254
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.240
<v Speaker 3>It has no rats will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keith Richards,</v>

255
00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:05.074
<v Speaker 3>there'll be fine cockroaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need 25 percent of the species have </v>

256
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:13.230
<v Speaker 3>gone extinct in the last generation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

257
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that always happens though.</v>

258
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.360
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not at this rate.</v>

259
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a mass extinction event,</v>

260
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 3>but there's always been mass extinction </v>
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>

261
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:21.264
<v Speaker 3>There's been a ton of them and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>90 percent of everything that's ever </v>

262
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:26.310
<v Speaker 3>lived as dead everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every living organism.</v>

263
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 3>But that's obscuring the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

264
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:29.544
<v Speaker 3>The rate of extinction right now due to </v>
<v Speaker 3>human interventions is higher than it's </v>

265
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:35.640
<v Speaker 3>been in probably hundreds of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

266
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Young Jamie can look at a case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the last major extinction event was,</v>

267
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of years ago,</v>

268
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 65 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is that dinosaurs,</v>

269
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.103
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what killed off the dinosaurs and there </v>

270
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:48.744
<v Speaker 3>was also a major extinction event in </v>
<v Speaker 3>North America that coincided with the </v>

271
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.170
<v Speaker 3>end of the Ice Age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 10 fold.</v>

272
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which they attributed to humans.</v>

273
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.691
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

274
00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 3>they don't anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

275
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.733
<v Speaker 3>Well some people do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they're thinking now due to a </v>

276
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 3>lot of geological data is asteroidal </v>
<v Speaker 3>impacts.</v>

277
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were at Randall Carson.</v>

278
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Is he on that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

279
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I never bought that human thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this whole man,</v>

280
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:11.374
<v Speaker 3>the hunter bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause like they didn't even have bows </v>

281
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 3>and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have adult models,</v>

282
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 3>which are cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're cool.</v>

283
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.430
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty cool invention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

284
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 3>That's the fucking saber tooth tiger </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

285
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.660
<v Speaker 3>The last one too.</v>

286
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 3>They're like five left and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hunt them down and kill them.</v>

287
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:25.084
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just wasn't enough people here to do </v>

288
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:27.184
<v Speaker 3>that and it's much more likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>considering the fact they found these </v>

289
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 3>essentially like graveyards filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>wooly mammoths had died instantaneously.</v>

290
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 3>The asteroid impact theory also a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

291
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:39.311
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

292
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:40.520
<v Speaker 3>the big game died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

293
00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:43.530
<v Speaker 3>the giant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the carnivores.</v>

294
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 3>The big giraffes and all that shit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was here,</v>

295
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:46.834
<v Speaker 3>but also a lot of shellfish went extinct</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time and snails and things </v>

296
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:52.150
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

297
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:52.984
<v Speaker 3>Extinctions during human error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Worse than thought the gravity of the </v>

298
00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:56.434
<v Speaker 3>world's current extinction rate becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes clear upon knowing what it </v>

299
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:00.814
<v Speaker 3>was before people came along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A new estimate finds of species die off </v>

300
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 3>as much as 1000 times more frequently </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowadays than they used to.</v>

301
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.010
<v Speaker 3>It's 10 times worse than the old </v>
<v Speaker 3>estimate of 100 times who,</v>

302
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.703
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good,</v>

303
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.830
<v Speaker 3>and that's three years ago.</v>

304
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.940
<v Speaker 3>This is a three year old article in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>

305
00:13:16.941 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 3>like three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like shit's old bro.</v>

306
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Shit's from September Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it funny?</v>

307
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.413
<v Speaker 3>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're moving at such a fast rate that </v>

308
00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:28.370
<v Speaker 3>our minds are kind of tuned into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when anybody.</v>

309
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Someone shows you something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's from a year ago.</v>

310
00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:30.850
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

311
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 3>you're quoting a year old stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about.</v>

312
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like talk about an ancient technology.</v>

313
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm trying not to refer to </v>
<v Speaker 3>papers that were published 10 years ago,</v>

314
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:43.900
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you not,</v>

315
00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's crazy 10 years ago is </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

316
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

317
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darwin was a long fucking time ago.</v>

318
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:57.710
<v Speaker 3>What we're looking at is this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerated existence and it's,</v>

319
00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:00.550
<v Speaker 3>it's happening right in front of it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we sort of acknowledged it,</v>

320
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.830
<v Speaker 3>but we're not recognizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've acknowledged it.</v>

321
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.873
<v Speaker 3>What we can't comprehend it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're living in a world we can't </v>

322
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:07.444
<v Speaker 3>comprehend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which again gets back to this whole </v>

323
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.334
<v Speaker 3>hunter gatherer thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you lived in a world they </v>

324
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:11.770
<v Speaker 3>understood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

325
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 3>this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we assume the generational,</v>

326
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>misunderstanding or sort of common human</v>

327
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:19.690
<v Speaker 3>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human experience.</v>

328
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:20.524
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a hunter gatherer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your parents and grandparents lived in </v>

329
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 3>the same world you live in and they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

330
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw that recently,</v>

331
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.920
<v Speaker 3>uncontacted tribe like recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>contacted tribe in Brazil.</v>

332
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

333
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.700
<v Speaker 3>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're live there.</v>

334
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:34.360
<v Speaker 3>They're a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a time capsule.</v>

335
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 3>They're living the way people lived </v>
<v Speaker 3>100,000</v>

336
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

337
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.103
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

338
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.460
<v Speaker 3>it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really.</v>

339
00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:41.130
<v Speaker 3>The pictures are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cds,</v>

340
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.970
<v Speaker 3>people pointing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bows and arrows,</v>

341
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:45.670
<v Speaker 3>and helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What have you ever heard?</v>

342
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:46.504
<v Speaker 3>There's a great book called at play in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fields of the Lord by Peter </v>

343
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:50.291
<v Speaker 3>Matheson's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of it.</v>

344
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>I've never read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful bug man.</v>

345
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good film to Daryl Hannah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Lithgow,</v>

346
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Kathy Bates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing cast.</v>

347
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

348
00:14:58.941 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about,</v>

349
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a novel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's about this,</v>

350
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:03.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two guys.</v>

351
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:04.484
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Waits is one of the actors in the </v>

352
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 2>play pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like smugglers,</v>

353
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:08.774
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they get hired to go in and bomb </v>

354
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:11.954
<v Speaker 2>this uncontacted tribe before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>missionaries make contact with them </v>

355
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:16.754
<v Speaker 2>because once they are contacted then all</v>
<v Speaker 2>their land gets set aside as a reserve </v>

356
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 2>and this corrupt politician wants to log</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and mine and you know,</v>

357
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:24.993
<v Speaker 2>all the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he hires these two ne'er do wells to </v>

358
00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:28.590
<v Speaker 2>go in and bomb them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

359
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.730
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

360
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not ruining the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like the first 20 pages.</v>

361
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 2>You get the setup and what happens is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

362
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.261
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

363
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 2>they go out and they sort of fly over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first day and they see,</v>

364
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:39.734
<v Speaker 2>they see the clearing in the jungle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the Indians run into the jungle and </v>

365
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 2>then they're sort of flying low.</v>

366
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:45.973
<v Speaker 2>There may be a thousand feet up and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>one warrior runs into the clearing and </v>

367
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.933
<v Speaker 2>fires an Arrow at the airplane and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're laughing like this fucking guy </v>

368
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:55.100
<v Speaker 2>thinks he's going to shoot down an </v>
<v Speaker 2>airplane with an Arrow,</v>

369
00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:55.934
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they go back to the village and one </v>

370
00:15:57.231 --> 00:15:58.064
<v Speaker 2>of the pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Tom Waits and I'm forget the other </v>

371
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:01.364
<v Speaker 2>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he plays a Navajo and they're like </v>

372
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam vets bombing around South </v>
<v Speaker 2>America with their plane,</v>

373
00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:06.704
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're back in the village and I </v>

374
00:16:09.391 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 2>get shit faced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the Tom waits character goes to</v>

375
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:12.974
<v Speaker 2>bed and the other guy's still hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in this little bar and somebody </v>

376
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 2>slips him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some IOWASCA.</v>

377
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.630
<v Speaker 2>And so he's already drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He drinks this Iowasca heats,</v>

378
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.920
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts hallucinating.</v>

379
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.780
<v Speaker 2>He goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets in the airplane,</v>

380
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 2>flies off in the air in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night,</v>

381
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 2>flies out to this spot in the jungle </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they saw where they're supposed to</v>

382
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:31.970
<v Speaker 2>bomb them that day.</v>

383
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Instead he puts on a parachute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ditches the plane,</v>

384
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.000
<v Speaker 2>jumps out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my lands in the jungle,</v>

385
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.730
<v Speaker 2>takes off all his clothes and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>pistol,</v>

386
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.760
<v Speaker 2>buries it in the jungle and then walks </v>
<v Speaker 2>naked into the village to spoiler alert.</v>

387
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:48.891
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

388
00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:51.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the beginning of the movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

389
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.093
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing this down as young as he </v>

390
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.873
<v Speaker 2>sexy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at them.</v>

391
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was this?</v>

392
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.790
<v Speaker 2>The film 90.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

393
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I was fresh out of John Lithgow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

394
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

395
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

396
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.280
<v Speaker 2>that's how it begins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Matheson's a great writer.</v>

397
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.920
<v Speaker 2>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a hard hardcore dude.</v>

398
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Real bad ass guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

399
00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:16.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it starts.</v>

400
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:19.220
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this guy literally goes back in time,</v>

401
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:20.054
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's a Navajo and when he saw </v>

402
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:21.764
<v Speaker 2>that guy shoot the Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sort of had this vision of how his </v>

403
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.210
<v Speaker 2>people had lost their dignity and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture had been destroyed.</v>

404
00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:30.044
<v Speaker 2>And if only they had known what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were facing and these people in the </v>

405
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 2>jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what's coming for them.</v>

406
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:35.654
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so his mission is I'm going to go </v>

407
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:40.130
<v Speaker 2>back and save them because I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>them what's coming.</v>

408
00:17:40.131 --> 00:17:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

409
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.300
<v Speaker 2>move through worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can move back in time and it's fucking</v>

410
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:46.130
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a great plot.</v>

411
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ high right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scaring</v>

412
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 1>the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So La Man,</v>

413
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm back in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

414
00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were going to be an ex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat.</v>

415
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.720
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fucking get out of here </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the big one landed a.</v>

416
00:17:59.721 --> 00:18:01.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still,</v>

417
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.333
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching very closely at all before </v>

418
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:07.230
<v Speaker 1>they close the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna I gotta weigh out.</v>

419
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.213
<v Speaker 1>What's it like coming back right at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time when Donald Trump becomes </v>

420
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:11.820
<v Speaker 1>president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an adventure,</v>

421
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's strange.</v>

422
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.543
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I was saying this on my </v>

423
00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 1>podcast the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the like,</v>

424
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you know how the solar system is moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole galaxy is moving.</v>

425
00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:26.130
<v Speaker 1>So there are all these zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta be careful,</v>

426
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:28.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about don't be countered.</v>

427
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Don't be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no need to be careful.</v>

428
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Think about Tom Waits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Tom Waits?</v>

429
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Is that the name of the actor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

430
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 1>that's the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Waits and Tom Barrett.</v>

431
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 1>He's the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same guy.</v>

432
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.773
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Tom Berenger who was in saving </v>

433
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:45.810
<v Speaker 1>private Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

434
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:46.883
<v Speaker 1>Or platoon platoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the bad guy and platoon with a </v>

435
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 1>scar on his face and I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

436
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.593
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

437
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of mediators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you guys see this in Michigan at the</v>

438
00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:56.640
<v Speaker 1>other day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

439
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

440
00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.253
<v Speaker 1>A giant fucking hunk of metal from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sky slammed into a or something from </v>

441
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:05.040
<v Speaker 1>this guy slammed into Lake Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

442
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.510
<v Speaker 1>That might've actually burned out before</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hit the ground.</v>

443
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:11.263
<v Speaker 1>So you see it like kind of fizzle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the end it's amazing what the </v>

444
00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:14.574
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just things coming through the </v>

445
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:17.094
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like remember when the space shuttle </v>

446
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.540
<v Speaker 1>lost some tiles and then burned out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere.</v>

447
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm good Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing that our air just </v>

448
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 1>traveling through the air at a high rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>of speed destroys things.</v>

449
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.350
<v Speaker 1>It just rips them apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

450
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 1>burns him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

451
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

452
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.243
<v Speaker 1>the threat of the impact for something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in space is ever looming and </v>

453
00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:42.534
<v Speaker 1>always ignored mean we rarely think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it until something like this </v>

454
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:48.660
<v Speaker 1>happens and I think it's just so scary </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's part of our brain that just</v>

455
00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:49.200
<v Speaker 1>puts it off.</v>

456
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.940
<v Speaker 1>We just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

457
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.030
<v Speaker 1>and then move on to the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing you could do about it.</v>

458
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.163
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happened before you look up at the </v>

459
00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:58.614
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an amazing video that Neil </v>

460
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:01.074
<v Speaker 1>degrasse Tyson posted on his instagram </v>
<v Speaker 1>page the other day and it's a guy using </v>

461
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:08.400
<v Speaker 1>a camera and he has some incredible lens</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

462
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>

463
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

464
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.760
<v Speaker 1>you mean he's got a really good camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get really cool by the way,</v>

465
00:20:17.761 --> 00:20:20.850
<v Speaker 1>that might not be nailed to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grass Tyson's actual page.</v>

466
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.953
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be like a fan page </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it links up to twitter and the </v>

467
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:27.594
<v Speaker 1>twitter is Neil degrasse Tyson fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it might not be his real instagram </v>

468
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:31.281
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

469
00:20:31.281 --> 00:20:32.114
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome video and it gets to a </v>

470
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 1>really close up when it gets really </v>
<v Speaker 1>close up.</v>

471
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.040
<v Speaker 1>The thing you see is just craters </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

472
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no atmosphere to protect them.</v>

473
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what?</v>

474
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Drop the charges dropped</v>

475
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.010
<v Speaker 4>and then you start thinking about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>much shit is out there.</v>

476
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.320
<v Speaker 4>Like that thing is just covered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just covered with but time.</v>

477
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 4>Think about how long it's been out there</v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

478
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:00.874
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the one I'm worried about is the </v>

479
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 4>solar flare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

480
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 4>You know because that was it like 1880 </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>

481
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:07.594
<v Speaker 4>There was a big one in North America and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it melted out the transmission cables </v>

482
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:15.160
<v Speaker 4>for the claymores cohorts code guys the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Telegraph.</v>

483
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.970
<v Speaker 4>So when that hits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all our computers are gone now,</v>

484
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Speaker 4>computers are our grid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

485
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:24.310
<v Speaker 4>The transformers are out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're saying if something like that</v>

486
00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:25.144
<v Speaker 4>does happen and you can never predict if</v>
<v Speaker 4>or when it would take months to get </v>

487
00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:30.490
<v Speaker 4>power back up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

488
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.880
<v Speaker 4>And people live in Phoenix in August,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucked.</v>

489
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.773
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean [inaudible] you live in a cold </v>

490
00:21:36.821 --> 00:21:38.860
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least you could burn wood.</v>

491
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people did that for a long time.</v>

492
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:41.703
<v Speaker 4>They figured out fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was actually an article recently </v>

493
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.543
<v Speaker 4>about neanderthals and they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out when there's still a debate </v>

494
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.893
<v Speaker 4>as to whether or not they actually knew </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to make fire or whether they knew </v>

495
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:55.890
<v Speaker 4>how to keep it lit or once they found it</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

496
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.913
<v Speaker 4>you know that they would find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be like the sacred fire and </v>

497
00:21:58.331 --> 00:21:59.164
<v Speaker 4>they would keep it lit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they weren't quite smart enough to </v>

498
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.203
<v Speaker 4>actually make it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now they're thinking that might not </v>

499
00:22:02.891 --> 00:22:03.724
<v Speaker 4>be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might have had a lot of debate on </v>

500
00:22:05.201 --> 00:22:06.034
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

501
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 4>You studied a lot of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilizations.</v>

502
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.520
<v Speaker 4>How much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much debate is there?</v>

503
00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Like whenever I hear someone say people </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely did this.</v>

504
00:22:15.911 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 4>They definitely did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

505
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.873
<v Speaker 4>like when they're looking back at </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence like as far as far as like who </v>

506
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.900
<v Speaker 4>could handle fire?</v>

507
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.150
<v Speaker 4>Like who was the first people in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when did they figure it out,</v>

508
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.730
<v Speaker 4>how do they put all that shit together?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

509
00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:30.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean it depends on the specific case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

510
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 4>With in the case of fire with they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at is uh,</v>

511
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also because it's so,</v>

512
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:40.840
<v Speaker 4>there's such a scarcity of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things change really quickly,</v>

513
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like for a long time,</v>

514
00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:43.414
<v Speaker 4>they thought people crossed over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first few North Americans are about </v>

515
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:48.460
<v Speaker 4>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago and now they're saying,</v>

516
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.870
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least 14.</v>

517
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.740
<v Speaker 4>And now they're finding places in Chile </v>
<v Speaker 4>what appear to be 40,000</v>

518
00:22:53.741 --> 00:22:54.574
<v Speaker 4>and other union,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they came over in boats and there were </v>

519
00:22:55.811 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 4>several different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

520
00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:58.203
<v Speaker 4>groups that came in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of change in that </v>

521
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:04.420
<v Speaker 4>because there's so little evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when a new piece comes in,</v>

522
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:07.690
<v Speaker 4>it really radically transformed things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with fire,</v>

523
00:23:07.691 --> 00:23:10.040
<v Speaker 4>what they're looking at is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

524
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 4>evidence of fire concurrent with human </v>
<v Speaker 4>habitation.</v>

525
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.163
<v Speaker 4>So with carbon dating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can figure out the age of the coals </v>

526
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:21.310
<v Speaker 4>or the stuff that's left in the ash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

527
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:25.360
<v Speaker 4>and then you'd look at pieces of bone or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that they were cooking.</v>

528
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.930
<v Speaker 4>And if you get the same area then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can figure,</v>

529
00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:29.680
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

530
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.513
<v Speaker 4>this wasn't a fire 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years after somebody ate a rat here or </v>

531
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:34.700
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right there cooking yet,</v>

532
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.540
<v Speaker 4>especially if the bones show charring as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

533
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.374
<v Speaker 4>then they're cooking the food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's just in the last 15 or 20 </v>

534
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:42.424
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The estimate of human use of fire has </v>

535
00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 4>gone from like</v>

536
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.740
<v Speaker 1>500,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years to a million.</v>

537
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just keep back dating things.</v>

538
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fascinating.</v>

539
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.123
<v Speaker 1>Just to those mounds they found in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon really recently they used drones </v>

540
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.913
<v Speaker 1>and they were getting these photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drones or satellites or getting these </v>

541
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:04.094
<v Speaker 1>images from space from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from above rather show like grids and </v>

542
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.653
<v Speaker 1>they show all these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These structures that they previously </v>

543
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 1>had never recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't notice.</v>

544
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Some of them look like stonehenge in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same sort of shape.</v>

545
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:17.054
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like irrigation canals and </v>

546
00:24:19.071 --> 00:24:19.810
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

547
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea who,</v>

548
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:23.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this?</v>

549
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this idea it.</v>

550
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need like a bunch of graduate students</v>

551
00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:31.064
<v Speaker 1>because I have ideas for books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never get around to writing the </v>

552
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 1>story of my life should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a stat.</v>

553
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 1>You should be like a guy who tells it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

554
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.370
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to work on this.</v>

555
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.610
<v Speaker 1>If you're curious but you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined or you don't have the time,</v>

556
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.690
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

557
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.630
<v Speaker 1>but in between doing your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing your book and live in your life,</v>

558
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you have left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live in my life.</v>

559
00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Takes up a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

560
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

561
00:24:57.231 --> 00:24:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

562
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a very um,</v>

563
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.943
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an intelligent but it's an honest </v>

564
00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

565
00:25:09.771 --> 00:25:10.604
<v Speaker 1>you don't have like this overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambition and you don't have like this </v>

566
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming desire to be recognized or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that,</v>

567
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.793
<v Speaker 1>but you do have an overwhelming desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have fun and be comfortable and be </v>

568
00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:23.834
<v Speaker 1>curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying I'm a lazy fucking </v>

569
00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:26.760
<v Speaker 1>hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you?</v>

570
00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.330
<v Speaker 1>You're having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you might be doing it right.</v>

571
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:31.280
<v Speaker 1>I get all the people that I know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are super smart.</v>

572
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 1>You like the least stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Smart Dude.</v>

573
00:25:33.651 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

574
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

575
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I quote you on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my next book,</v>

576
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.020
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean considering you're always around,</v>

577
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:43.820
<v Speaker 1>you always enjoy in different parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

578
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.043
<v Speaker 1>You're always coming back with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy stories and interesting </v>

579
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.043
<v Speaker 1>perspectives are you gathered up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't seem stressed and so many </v>

580
00:25:52.581 --> 00:25:53.414
<v Speaker 1>people that I know that are like in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual realm are fucking freaking </v>

581
00:25:57.651 --> 00:26:00.210
<v Speaker 1>out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>

582
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm stressed,</v>

583
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.180
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get stressed by my lack of stress.</v>

584
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:10.700
<v Speaker 1>That's my biggest problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're built for podcasts.</v>

585
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your,</v>

586
00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:15.450
<v Speaker 1>your mind and your curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>

587
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.510
<v Speaker 1>you're trapped in this medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

588
00:26:17.511 --> 00:26:19.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I don't think your book is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

589
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I thought sex at dawn was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I keep coughing?</v>

590
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that the weed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sex at dawn was amazing,</v>

591
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

592
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.893
<v Speaker 1>you're really well suited for podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really well suited for freeform </v>

593
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.890
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell you enjoy it,</v>

594
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.331
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

595
00:26:35.331 --> 00:26:37.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

596
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.590
<v Speaker 1>that's what I love about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did one last night.</v>

597
00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I occasionally do a,</v>

598
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 1>what I call a Roma renting out my ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode</v>

599
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.570
<v Speaker 4>and it's where it's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No gas.</v>

600
00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.720
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So last night I did,</v>

601
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:51.900
<v Speaker 4>when I'm drinking beer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like reading letters from people and</v>

602
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:52.734
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and going off on whatever the fuck I'm </v>

603
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:56.810
<v Speaker 4>going off on and it occurred to me later</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

604
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not dealing with the kind of numbers</v>

605
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:00.330
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

606
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:04.660
<v Speaker 4>I've got a stadium of people listening </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me fucking stadium,</v>

607
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:10.430
<v Speaker 4>but I am more relaxed than if I were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to a friend on the phone because</v>

608
00:27:11.461 --> 00:27:14.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't see anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just alone drinking a beer,</v>

609
00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 4>talking into this microphone and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel the presence of anyone listening.</v>

610
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 4>So I'm totally fucking relaxed sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 4>to my detriment.</v>

611
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:23.514
<v Speaker 4>I probably say things I shouldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 4>and share shit that I've meant to keep </v>

612
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 4>private or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

613
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.693
<v Speaker 4>it is a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Jamie and I were talking about </v>

614
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:35.640
<v Speaker 4>this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you said,</v>

615
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Hey Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

616
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.140
<v Speaker 4>it's been awhile to come.</v>

617
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.120
<v Speaker 4>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

618
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go hang out with my buddy </v>
<v Speaker 4>joe.</v>

619
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.733
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there are a fucking million people </v>

620
00:27:42.151 --> 00:27:45.120
<v Speaker 4>hovering around here listening to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

621
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:45.954
<v Speaker 4>it's really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 90 percent of my friendship with </v>

622
00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:50.580
<v Speaker 4>you has taken place here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

623
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:51.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so.</v>

624
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 4>And it's the same worries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same Moshe Kasher.</v>

625
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:58.590
<v Speaker 4>I've got all these friends who I only </v>
<v Speaker 4>see when we're on a fucking mind,</v>

626
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting is Duncan and I,</v>

627
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.113
<v Speaker 4>we were having a really hard time </v>
<v Speaker 4>spending time together because he's </v>

628
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:08.190
<v Speaker 4>always busy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd have a really hard time with only a</v>

629
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.023
<v Speaker 4>few times we got together and just hung </v>
<v Speaker 4>out as friends over the last couple of </v>

630
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.210
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we did so many podcasts together for</v>

631
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:16.044
<v Speaker 4>that and we'd have these conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the things that's unique </v>

632
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:19.854
<v Speaker 4>about this form is that you have these </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations that are like so isolated </v>

633
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 4>from any distraction and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that exists anywhere else anymore.</v>

634
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.250
<v Speaker 4>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to people looking at you.</v>

635
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:31.080
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't like when people look</v>
<v Speaker 4>at their phones.</v>

636
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:33.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't like when people like bring a </v>
<v Speaker 4>laptop or something like that.</v>

637
00:28:33.661 --> 00:28:34.494
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

638
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.350
<v Speaker 4>I try to close mine now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to not.</v>

639
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 4>I used to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not smart.</v>

640
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.403
<v Speaker 4>The smart thing to do is just put it </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and this form of conversation that </v>

641
00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.690
<v Speaker 4>collect the kind of like I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>encourage people to have podcasts,</v>

642
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.970
<v Speaker 4>have their own podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even if they want to read,</v>

643
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.240
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even have to release it,</v>

644
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 4>but by doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just the act of doing it,</v>

645
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.340
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're having these conversations,</v>

646
00:28:56.341 --> 00:28:59.510
<v Speaker 4>these extended conversations with people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think it,</v>

647
00:28:59.511 --> 00:29:04.350
<v Speaker 4>it exercises your thought process in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way and the engagement process.</v>

648
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.720
<v Speaker 4>It focuses your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People used to say,</v>

649
00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:09.990
<v Speaker 4>some famous writer said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I write to see what I think,</v>

650
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.350
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

651
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.490
<v Speaker 4>I think podcasting sort of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way you're describing it,</v>

652
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:15.324
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

653
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.080
<v Speaker 4>it's one place where we turn off all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>distractions and just focus.</v>

654
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my plan now is to get a van.</v>

655
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.633
<v Speaker 4>I want to get a sprinter van and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>put a bed in it and a little kitchen </v>

656
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.620
<v Speaker 4>with the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>travel the country doing podcasts.</v>

657
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.090
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a great idea.</v>

658
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.163
<v Speaker 4>And I had this other idea because </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I see you've got enough weight </v>

659
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:37.620
<v Speaker 4>that people will come to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to do shit on skype and</v>

660
00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 4>phone and I hate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate that.</v>

661
00:29:39.421 --> 00:29:40.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels weird,</v>

662
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:40.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

663
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 4>There's delays</v>

664
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.280
<v Speaker 2>and you're talking over each other and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see the body language.</v>

665
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:46.114
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if they're disengaging </v>
<v Speaker 2>from what you're talking about or </v>

666
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.580
<v Speaker 2>they're getting uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're getting too personal,</v>

667
00:29:50.581 --> 00:29:51.414
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really like being in a room with </v>

668
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I went back into the archives and </v>

695
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.503
<v Speaker 2>archives and found them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had this thing where he has this </v>

696
00:31:04.691 --> 00:31:05.524
<v Speaker 2>couple living in the house in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>backyard and like they'd met by chance </v>

697
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:11.074
<v Speaker 2>and then it turned out that he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked the woman 15 years earlier after </v>

698
00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:15.784
<v Speaker 2>a gig in Reno or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now she's with her boyfriend and </v>

699
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:23.350
<v Speaker 2>they're living in the backyard and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all buddies and the four of them</v>

700
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:24.184
<v Speaker 2>are all the two couples I guess had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual thing and it was all cool and it </v>

701
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:29.464
<v Speaker 2>was just really beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're talking about how they met </v>

702
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:33.160
<v Speaker 2>in the history of the relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

703
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.500
<v Speaker 2>The boyfriends there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the girlfriend's not there.</v>

704
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:36.334
<v Speaker 2>It turns out the girlfriends in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital about to have open heart </v>

705
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:40.630
<v Speaker 2>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the cliffhanger.</v>

706
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the end of this hour and a half,</v>

707
00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.540
<v Speaker 2>two hour conversation where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this,</v>

708
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this relationship with it turns out like</v>

709
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.970
<v Speaker 2>she's going to have open heart surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She might be dead.</v>

710
00:31:51.971 --> 00:31:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Folks tune in next week to find out if </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's dead and they're laughing,</v>

711
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.650
<v Speaker 2>but they're laughing and this was jake's</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

712
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:05.610
<v Speaker 2>They're processing grief through </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughter and that there is nothing new.</v>

713
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:10.990
<v Speaker 2>And they're not denying how intense and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sad and scared they are.</v>

714
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.990
<v Speaker 2>But they're still laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

715
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:14.824
<v Speaker 2>Finally grief over death is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>few things where we demand you behave a </v>

716
00:32:19.541 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

717
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:23.470
<v Speaker 2>they're Irish wakes right where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody gets drunk and laughs.</v>

718
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Intel's crazy body stories about the</v>

719
00:32:26.561 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 2>dead guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you celebrate the life.</v>

720
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way.</v>

721
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very.</v>

722
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.820
<v Speaker 2>This imposed sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of seriousness.</v>

723
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:39.530
<v Speaker 2>I think he's very sort of Protestant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

724
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:40.030
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's</v>

725
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.240
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also,</v>

726
00:32:41.241 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I think we want to know who feels bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

727
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:46.250
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't feel bad like </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribally,</v>

728
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very dangerous person </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have around.</v>

729
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a psychopath or something.</v>

730
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:52.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that might be something </v>

731
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:56.300
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we might enforce it and there might</v>

732
00:32:56.301 --> 00:32:57.134
<v Speaker 1>be like this urge and instinct to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforce extreme grief because we feel </v>

733
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:05.480
<v Speaker 1>like people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't feel that are either not on my</v>

734
00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:08.960
<v Speaker 1>team really didn't care about the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I cared about or might be a psycho.</v>

735
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

736
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:15.650
<v Speaker 1>some cultures have professional mourners</v>
<v Speaker 1>like greet you,</v>

737
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:17.500
<v Speaker 1>how chip Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.500
<v Speaker 1>you pay him to come to the funeral and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

739
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:21.343
<v Speaker 1>we'll and scream and cry and express the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion so the other people can just </v>

740
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 1>sort of chill and wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:28.550
<v Speaker 1>go to the buffet.</v>

742
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Did you see after Kim Jong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Il,</v>

743
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.433
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il died in North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people were being punished because </v>

744
00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:36.824
<v Speaker 1>they didn't mourn hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got six month jail sentences </v>

745
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't mourn hard enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were just the worst fake acting</v>

746
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:45.913
<v Speaker 1>like all throughout the streets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're filming it for their propaganda </v>

747
00:33:48.021 --> 00:33:49.370
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

748
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.860
<v Speaker 1>see if he could pull some of it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of hilarious.</v>

749
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.903
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious and terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea terrifies me and one of the </v>

750
00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:57.734
<v Speaker 1>things that terrifies me the most about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that it is in our face everyday </v>

751
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 1>direct evidence that things could go </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly wrong at any point in time with</v>

752
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:07.154
<v Speaker 1>human beings and we got so fucking lucky</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're born who at wherever you are </v>

753
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:14.054
<v Speaker 1>that you can listen to this and not have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to worry about being locked up for </v>

754
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:16.214
<v Speaker 1>possessing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in England or Norway or </v>

755
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Canada or wherever you're listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

756
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.133
<v Speaker 1>We got sold lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could've easily been bored in North </v>

757
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:25.603
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of us can be born in a prison in </v>

758
00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:27.704
<v Speaker 1>North Korea where you're born as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoner and you'll die as a prisoner </v>

759
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2017,</v>

760
00:34:34.161 --> 00:34:34.994
<v Speaker 1>there is a fucking military dictatorship</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're killing people and </v>

761
00:34:38.361 --> 00:34:42.050
<v Speaker 1>imprisoning people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the lights are off at night when you</v>

762
00:34:42.051 --> 00:34:44.690
<v Speaker 1>fly over it and they take satellite </v>
<v Speaker 1>footage of it.</v>

763
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:48.110
<v Speaker 1>You see the lights are all off like </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people wailing on the street.</v>

764
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Immediate is fucking Uber Bizarre there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all on their knees.</v>

765
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Whaling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not a god damn tier to be seen.</v>

766
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.460
<v Speaker 1>They're just throwing their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

767
00:35:01.461 --> 00:35:04.670
<v Speaker 1>they're probably scared to that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be beaten if they don't.</v>

768
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Well hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're scared of that.</v>

769
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll make you curse is the emotion.</v>

770
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:09.703
<v Speaker 1>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is unbelievable that human beings </v>

771
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:12.674
<v Speaker 1>no different than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between them and </v>

772
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:15.800
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just there.</v>

773
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy could be your neighbor.</v>

774
00:35:18.201 --> 00:35:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Like one of those people wailing could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and you could be this awesome guy.</v>

777

780
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:26.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>better spot.</v>

784
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.440
<v Speaker 1>These are all women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oddly enough,</v>

785
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.110
<v Speaker 1>this is all women whaling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

786
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 1>there's some men that they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate</v>

787
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.813
<v Speaker 3>so they don't fuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want any fucking monkey </v>

788
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:44.340
<v Speaker 3>business while you screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at these guys crying,</v>

789
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:46.180
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

790
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Speaker 3>it's so strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so strange,</v>

791
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:55.080
<v Speaker 3>but this is happening today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I understand this a different part of</v>

792
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:56.210
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to,</v>

793
00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:01.550
<v Speaker 3>we have to all recognize that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb luck that we were born here because</v>

794
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:02.844
<v Speaker 3>there's these systems that exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you have gigantic groups of </v>

795
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 3>people that are at least fairly isolated</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these systems,</v>

796
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:11.920
<v Speaker 3>these operating systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

797
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:12.763
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get enforced and it doesn't matter </v>

798
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:16.860
<v Speaker 3>where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once they get enforced,</v>

799
00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:21.861
<v Speaker 3>they're super difficult to break like </v>
<v Speaker 3>those surrey women who cut their lip and</v>

800
00:36:22.411 --> 00:36:26.040
<v Speaker 3>stick those plates in them and stretch </v>
<v Speaker 3>their lips out and do like,</v>

801
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.760
<v Speaker 3>that's a part of a system that exists in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that area.</v>

802
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 3>And that system is the women are trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get away from it now.</v>

803
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.910
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of women are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to slobber all the time.</v>

804
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:39.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to knock my teeth out to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put some fucking stupid plate in this.</v>

805
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I heard of a tribe where women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

806
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.540
<v Speaker 3>laser the hair off their pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

807
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:46.374
<v Speaker 3>I heard about that when sometimes they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wax it right and the usage of shade it </v>

808
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 3>and they were the shoes with like a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>stick in the back so they can't walk.</v>

809
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

810
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.080
<v Speaker 3>The things people will do in the women </v>
<v Speaker 3>wear these like really short skirts.</v>

811
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:02.483
<v Speaker 3>I described like Megan Kelly's outfit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and my bit was a bit I'm working on </v>

812
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 3>right now that I talk about what she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing.</v>

813
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:11.310
<v Speaker 3>It's basically a vagina curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw your bit the other night.</v>

814
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:16.050
<v Speaker 3>That literally is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just these beautiful women on TV,</v>

815
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:17.183
<v Speaker 3>on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were wearing something that </v>

816
00:37:18.191 --> 00:37:18.600
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

817
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.433
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know of could lift that up and fuck </v>

818
00:37:21.431 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 3>her with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the.</v>

819
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.710
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the skirt is lift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole point of it.</v>

820
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.740
<v Speaker 3>That's why that fatal attraction scene </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Susan,</v>

821
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.490
<v Speaker 3>what was in it and that Susan Sharon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharon stone,</v>

822
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.340
<v Speaker 3>it was so impactful because we've all </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagined that a million times,</v>

823
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:36.340
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Kick the fuck out of dodge.</v>

826
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.470
<v Speaker 3>If she didn't have that clipboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're blocking the light.</v>

827
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.320
<v Speaker 3>The glorious light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Very interesting woman and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious to see what happens to her </v>

832
00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:01.344
<v Speaker 3>now that she's at NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she'll come on the Joe Rogan </v>

833
00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:03.984
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it to be cross from around </v>

846
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to fuck her or anything</v>

<v Speaker 1>that kind of challenge,</v>

849
00:38:37.691 --> 00:38:40.540
<v Speaker 1>but I am fascinated that you came here </v>
<v Speaker 1>from working out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>easy going thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're like the Martha Stewart of men or</v>

<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you do everything.</v>

856
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:54.123
<v Speaker 1>How do you do you're living like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped your name occasionally and </v>

857
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 1>someone will be like,</v>

00:38:59.200 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

860
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 1>And like his friend will go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was the UFC guy.</v>

861
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:03.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

862
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 1>That too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

863
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:04.653
<v Speaker 1>but wait isn't either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have nine lives and you're </v>

864
00:39:07.091 --> 00:39:08.710
<v Speaker 1>living them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck do you do that?</v>

865
00:39:08.711 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your efficiency.</v>

866
00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:12.520
<v Speaker 1>You never sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you're a father,</v>

867
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:14.530
<v Speaker 1>you're a husband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do all that stuff.</v>

868
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

869
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:16.853
<v Speaker 1>it's an illusion that it takes more time</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it does with all the stuff that I </v>

870
00:39:20.801 --> 00:39:21.270
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

871
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Job Chill.</v>

872
00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>

873
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 1>When I watched like documentaries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

874
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.490
<v Speaker 1>but see that's a chill and that's why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't chill,</v>

875
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.270
<v Speaker 1>chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chill.</v>

876
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Just like getting your hammock and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hands behind your head and go do,</v>

877
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:33.930
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

878
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:34.763
<v Speaker 1>do you ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brain doesn't work like that so that </v>

879
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:40.120
<v Speaker 1>my brain's like my day to do something.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You take long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a nice 10 minute hot shower,</v>

882
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.433
<v Speaker 1>pleasure and showers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have like a good shit in the </v>

883
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:53.941
<v Speaker 1>shower and that's your chill time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Alaska to Prince of Wales.</v>

884
00:39:54.461 --> 00:39:55.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

885
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince of Wales Island and uh,</v>

886
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.833
<v Speaker 1>it is this unbelievably wet spot and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>rains there more than I think anywhere </v>

887
00:40:04.991 --> 00:40:08.020
<v Speaker 1>else in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

888
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just constantly drenched </v>
<v Speaker 1>with southeast.</v>

889
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it is geographically.</v>

890
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.183
<v Speaker 1>I flew in for this TV show mediator with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Steven Rinella and my friend </v>

891
00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Brian Cowen and Yonis retell us and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to this island.</v>

892
00:40:21.341 --> 00:40:23.470
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing experience.</v>

893
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:24.723
<v Speaker 1>So beautiful and so remote and so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't even a successful hunting </v>

894
00:40:27.761 --> 00:40:28.840
<v Speaker 1>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was amazing.</v>

895
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.840
<v Speaker 1>The experience was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the most amazing things about</v>

896
00:40:31.841 --> 00:40:32.674
<v Speaker 1>it was that I was wet and uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this weird sort of environment where </v>

897
00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:37.174
<v Speaker 1>you never really get dry because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly raining for five or six days </v>

898
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:46.050
<v Speaker 1>and then when I got home I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so happy.</v>

899
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I was happy in a way that I'd never been</v>
<v Speaker 1>before in a way,</v>

900
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:51.363
<v Speaker 1>during a regular day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just driving down the street to the </v>

901
00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:54.574
<v Speaker 1>studio and coming in and hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Jamie and doing a podcast and I </v>

902
00:40:57.641 --> 00:41:00.310
<v Speaker 1>just felt so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt so good.</v>

903
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.140
<v Speaker 1>You felt good to be back or just that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

904
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I feel good to be back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

905
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:07.954
<v Speaker 1>I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel really good and I think that </v>

906
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:11.883
<v Speaker 1>especially for California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weather here is so god damned good </v>

907
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.863
<v Speaker 1>that we have a few days where it rains </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people literally start to complain </v>

908
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.223
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know how crazy it is that you're </v>

909
00:41:21.611 --> 00:41:26.611
<v Speaker 1>complaining that it rains maybe 10 days </v>
<v Speaker 1>a year out of 365,</v>

910
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.610
<v Speaker 1>and the [inaudible] latest so beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>after they're cleared.</v>

911
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

912
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 1>There's no bugs.</v>

913
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.563
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this place is so easy to get by </v>

914
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:38.354
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very little wildlife that were </v>

915
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:42.680
<v Speaker 3>ever concerned with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just live this ideal.</v>

916
00:41:42.681 --> 00:41:45.300
<v Speaker 3>It can idolic what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have delicate.</v>

917
00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.970
<v Speaker 3>A delicate sounds wrong though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>

918
00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not an idol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an ideal.</v>

919
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:53.930
<v Speaker 3>We live a fairytale life for anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone else anywhere in the world.</v>

920
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.790
<v Speaker 3>And I think just coming here from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rain soaked island,</v>

921
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 3>like as I was driving around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

922
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:02.510
<v Speaker 3>I would realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

923
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:03.853
<v Speaker 3>at least for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to go through some intense </v>

924
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:12.350
<v Speaker 3>struggle to appreciate normal existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no Yang without yen.</v>

925
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.213
<v Speaker 3>That's for me for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no comfort without </v>

926
00:42:15.291 --> 00:42:16.850
<v Speaker 3>discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>

00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 3>like for me to be happy and calm and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like sit here and talk to you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you don't see them.</v>

980
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.790
<v Speaker 3>They smell dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sick,</v>

981
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.660
<v Speaker 3>I was walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of fresh air,</v>

982
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:26.450
<v Speaker 3>so they're outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a dirty dog.</v>

983

<v Speaker 3>It doesn't offend you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get that close to.</v>

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:36.943
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking in the view and I hear these two </v>

988
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:40.750
<v Speaker 4>guys coming up the trail and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>see me because there's,</v>

989
00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.073
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a curve and they're talking and the one </v>

998
00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:08.804

<v Speaker 4>I don't do that.</v>

1002
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.400
<v Speaker 4>It's always the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1003
00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.070
<v Speaker 4>When people just feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:23.760
<v Speaker 4>We'll go one more fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then an hour and a half later you're</v>

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.033
<v Speaker 4>I was called in to consult on a case in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Spain with a guy that was in a mental </v>

1008
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:33.414
<v Speaker 4>hospital and I'm the psychiatrist who </v>
<v Speaker 4>was treating him was a friend of mine </v>

1009
00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:42.990
<v Speaker 4>and knew that I took a lot of drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy didn't,</v>

1010
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 4>hadn't taken any drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's like,</v>

1011
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.970
<v Speaker 4>could you just come in and like talk to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy and see what you think,</v>

1012
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.950
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I meet with the guy and I'm like,</v>

1013
00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:50.960
<v Speaker 4>so what's your story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

1014
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.661
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well look,</v>

1015
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:56.640
<v Speaker 4>I was in Amsterdam and I ate a Brownie </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I wasn't feeling anything.</v>

1016
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:58.880
<v Speaker 4>And so then I took these mushrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1017
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:04.300
<v Speaker 4>And next thing I know I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the jail cell naked.</v>

1018
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.333
<v Speaker 4>I started walking down this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they told me I was screaming </v>

1019
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.540
<v Speaker 4>and singing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1020
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:14.220
<v Speaker 4>so are you all right man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1021
00:46:14.221 --> 00:46:14.971
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine,</v>

1022
00:46:14.971 --> 00:46:17.200
<v Speaker 4>but everyone thinks I'm crazy because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing.</v>

1023
00:46:17.201 --> 00:46:18.034
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like I get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I keep telling him it's deal like the </v>

1024
00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:24.270
<v Speaker 4>guy from the Tom Berenger mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1025
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.310
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I talked to my.</v>

1026
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:29.400
<v Speaker 4>Are you guys flying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy's not crazy.</v>

1027
00:46:29.401 --> 00:46:32.460
<v Speaker 4>He just like ate too many fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>brownies in Amsterdam.</v>

1028
00:46:32.461 --> 00:46:33.294
<v Speaker 4>It happens to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you eat brownies too many </v>

1029
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:40.410
<v Speaker 4>brownies and mushrooms together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they work together though.</v>

1030
00:46:40.411 --> 00:46:43.110
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the interesting things </v>
<v Speaker 4>about marijuana and psilocybin.</v>

1031
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:44.183
<v Speaker 4>They're very complimentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that was what Mckenna used to do </v>

1032
00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:47.544
<v Speaker 4>when he would take a mushroom trip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would eat the mushroom and then he </v>

1033
00:46:50.471 --> 00:46:54.930
<v Speaker 4>would wait for it to kick in and while </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was waiting for it to kick in,</v>

1034
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:55.764
<v Speaker 4>he would roll joints and so he would </v>
<v Speaker 4>just roll a shitload of joints and then </v>

1035
00:46:59.161 --> 00:46:59.994
<v Speaker 4>just start smashing the joints and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>the marijuana would sort of like reach </v>

1036
00:47:04.441 --> 00:47:05.274
<v Speaker 4>out and grab the silicide that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>embrace it and just create this tornado </v>

1037
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:14.250
<v Speaker 4>of awesomeness and that's how we used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>trip and he used to do it by himself.</v>

1038
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna's thing was about silent </v>
<v Speaker 4>darkness.</v>

1039
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:18.173
<v Speaker 4>Really concerned with experiencing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic state in a very undisturbed </v>

1040
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:26.100
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like to him,</v>

1041
00:47:26.101 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 4>the idea of taking mushrooms going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>amusement was insane.</v>

1042
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 1>He had no desire to do anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1043
00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.590
<v Speaker 1>It just wanted to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1044
00:47:35.591 --> 00:47:36.424
<v Speaker 1>what is the quote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each time he would try to see how much </v>

1045
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 1>more he could stand and he would do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while.</v>

1046
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he was describing another guy when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about that now that I think</v>

1047
00:47:48.821 --> 00:47:51.540
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a,</v>

1048
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.790
<v Speaker 1>like a proponent of five dried grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would.</v>

1049
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:57.160
<v Speaker 1>He called it heroic dose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 1>That fucking heroic dose got me in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

1051
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.793
<v Speaker 2>I was reading Mckenna and I got this </v>
<v Speaker 2>acid from a friend of mine that I can't </v>

1052
00:48:09.171 --> 00:48:10.004
<v Speaker 2>talk about where it came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like one of these sources </v>

1053
00:48:11.541 --> 00:48:12.374
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1054
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really from that source.</v>

1055
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:16.483
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right from Albert Hoffman's lab pretty </v>

1056
00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:18.950
<v Speaker 2>much that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:48:18.951 --> 00:48:19.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1058
00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:20.893
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like I'm used to be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded in that world of like </v>

1059
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:27.230
<v Speaker 2>scientists who were doing hallucinogenic</v>
<v Speaker 2>research and stuff.</v>

1060
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1061
00:48:29.591 --> 00:48:31.000
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1062
00:48:31.001 --> 00:48:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I decided to take a heroic dose because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1063
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:35.023
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do a lot more acid in </v>

1064
00:48:35.871 --> 00:48:36.740
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might as well,</v>

1065
00:48:36.741 --> 00:48:37.574
<v Speaker 2>like go out with a bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I took the stuff and how much you </v>

1066
00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.530
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was liquid a.</v>

1067
00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.610
<v Speaker 2>funnily enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened was I,</v>

1068
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:48.020
<v Speaker 2>this psychiatrist who was a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine,</v>

1069
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.930
<v Speaker 2>he hadn't done any drugs since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>

1070
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:52.363
<v Speaker 2>Back in the days when you could order </v>
<v Speaker 2>acid from Sandoz and they'd send it to </v>

1071
00:48:55.341 --> 00:48:56.840
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1072
00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.980
<v Speaker 2>How long did that last?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That lasted until it was made illegal in</v>

1073
00:49:00.981 --> 00:49:03.170
<v Speaker 2>64,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1074
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:04.563
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What didn't lsd go down with that </v>

1075
00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:10.980
<v Speaker 1>sweeping psychedelic acts of 1970 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>could've been later.</v>

1076
00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Was that maybe lsd went down before that</v>
<v Speaker 1>went on afterwards?</v>

1077
00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of them that were made</v>

1078
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 1>illegal in 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even ones that aren't even</v>

1079
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1080
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:23.043
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1081
00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:23.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1082
00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:25.830
<v Speaker 2>in any case they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1083
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:26.673
<v Speaker 2>it was marketed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>LSD was marketed to doctors and two </v>

1084
00:49:31.501 --> 00:49:32.334
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrists and psychologists who </v>
<v Speaker 2>would take it in order to experience </v>

1085
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:39.930
<v Speaker 2>psychosis so they could better treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>their patients.</v>

1086
00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:41.363
<v Speaker 2>It was called a psychotomimetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could just order it and take it </v>

1087
00:49:45.601 --> 00:49:46.051
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1088
00:49:46.051 --> 00:49:49.260
<v Speaker 2>this is what it's like to be psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and understand that,</v>

1089
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.440
<v Speaker 2>but you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean from a medical perspective,</v>

1090
00:49:52.441 --> 00:49:53.274
<v Speaker 2>think about the nobility of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what a cool doctor and what an </v>

1091
00:49:57.691 --> 00:49:59.610
<v Speaker 2>interesting time where it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1092
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.420
<v Speaker 2>we all need to experience nine hours of </v>
<v Speaker 2>insanity,</v>

1093
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:05.700
<v Speaker 2>so that will be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or psychiatrist.</v>

1094
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.250
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty fucking cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is very cool.</v>

1095
00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Very cool way of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1096
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lifeguard who jumps into the </v>

1097
00:50:11.731 --> 00:50:14.940
<v Speaker 2>water and not a lifeguard who stands on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the beach and throws you a pill,</v>

1098
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:15.420
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1099
00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you talk to a psychiatrist and the </v>

1100
00:50:17.551 --> 00:50:20.730
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist doesn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences,</v>

1101
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.360
<v Speaker 1>you you can understand it because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1102
00:50:24.361 --> 00:50:26.700
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're an academic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be respected.</v>

1103
00:50:26.701 --> 00:50:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Psychedelic experiences for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>part are illegal and you know,</v>

1104
00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:31.154
<v Speaker 1>people get weird about it and I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand wanting to keep it under </v>

1105
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:33.704
<v Speaker 1>wraps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not really interested in </v>

1106
00:50:35.961 --> 00:50:38.660
<v Speaker 1>it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much are you studying the mind?</v>

1107
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Exactly and you not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Experiential evidence is invalid.</v>

1108
00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1109
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.093
<v Speaker 1>It's very valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that there's some extreme </v>

1110
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.950
<v Speaker 1>effects that happen with some very </v>
<v Speaker 1>potent psychedelics.</v>

1111
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1112
00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a sage.</v>

1113
00:50:55.821 --> 00:50:56.730
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it called?</v>

1114
00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.250
<v Speaker 1>What are they called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvia.</v>

1115
00:50:58.251 --> 00:50:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvia divinorum,</v>

1116
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially sage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1117
00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1118
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.983
<v Speaker 1>that stuff will blow your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that shit was available in head </v>

1119
00:51:07.251 --> 00:51:08.084
<v Speaker 1>shops just a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most potent psychedelics </v>

1120
00:51:13.521 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 1>known to man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Ari who had.</v>

1121
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:20.780
<v Speaker 1>He did it and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a life.</v>

1122
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.220
<v Speaker 1>He lived a whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three years.</v>

1123
00:51:25.221 --> 00:51:27.800
<v Speaker 1>He felt like he lived a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had friends,</v>

1124
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:29.750
<v Speaker 1>he had girlfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He broke up with him.</v>

1125
00:51:29.751 --> 00:51:32.750
<v Speaker 1>He had jobs like the whole deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that matrix.</v>

1126
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.613
<v Speaker 1>And then he came back and he was only </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone for like 10 minutes on this couch </v>

1127
00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.670
<v Speaker 1>on a Salvia trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we isolate that?</v>

1128
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:42.020
<v Speaker 1>A clip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're looking for?</v>

1129
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1130
00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a clip of him doing it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he talked about what happened later.</v>

1131
00:51:47.391 --> 00:51:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it was with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I want to dunk into podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the clip of him doing it.</v>

1133
00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian's old podcast,</v>

1134
00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:56.143
<v Speaker 1>naughty show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Tripoli's podcast on Brian's death </v>

1135
00:51:59.331 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 1>squad network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he uh,</v>

1136
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:04.123
<v Speaker 1>res.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's gone there and they're all </v>

1137
00:52:09.471 --> 00:52:10.850
<v Speaker 1>laughing and talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hee Hee,</v>

1138

<v Speaker 1>ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this guy's trip and his balls off </v>

1139
00:52:13.881 --> 00:52:15.470
<v Speaker 1>like he's in another dimension.</v>

1140
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:23.630
<v Speaker 5>Tell him I tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take him off.</v>

1141
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:29.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm serious actually.</v>

1142
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:38.860
<v Speaker 5>You're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're fine.</v>

1143
00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:44.740
<v Speaker 5>You're fine buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get away</v>

1144
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:47.120
<v Speaker 1>from him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave him alone.</v>

1145
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was tripping so hard.</v>

1146
00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Did he think he was like suffocating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know at that.</v>

1147
00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Explains the Turlock podcast during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

1148
00:53:00.321 --> 00:53:01.154
<v Speaker 1>He explained it suffering there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happened is they just probably </v>

1149
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.833
<v Speaker 1>talking too much and it probably snapped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it and it was in the middle of </v>

1150
00:53:07.641 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 1>this haze of reality and the illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think doing something like that,</v>

1151
00:53:11.871 --> 00:53:13.610
<v Speaker 1>like you got to be around people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be quiet,</v>

1152
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do it,</v>

1153
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.240
<v Speaker 1>you know they're quiet and when they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1154
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:18.680
<v Speaker 1>you're quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit there.</v>

1155
00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1156
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I saw you,</v>

1157
00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I saw you about a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I went from here to Mexico.</v>

1158
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 1>I went to that Ibogaine</v>

1159
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.100
<v Speaker 2>clinic in Tijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1160
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:28.943
<v Speaker 2>you did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1161
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what it was like.</v>

1162
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:32.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a podcast with a doctor who </v>

1163
00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:38.130
<v Speaker 2>works there and I met some people down </v>
<v Speaker 2>there who had,</v>

1164
00:53:38.131 --> 00:53:40.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five meo DMT,</v>

1165
00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:45.390
<v Speaker 2>the painter or the toad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did that.</v>

1166
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.790
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really intense.</v>

1167
00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:51.850
<v Speaker 2>I'd never done dmt before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked her but never smoked dmt five.</v>

1168
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Mel was the really weird stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very empty.</v>

1169
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.640
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go away,</v>

1170
00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:59.190
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to the center of the university,</v>

1171
00:53:59.191 --> 00:54:02.020
<v Speaker 2>become everything I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1172
00:54:02.021 --> 00:54:02.970
<v Speaker 2>How strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1173
00:54:02.971 --> 00:54:05.250
<v Speaker 2>how much of a dose did you get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you blast off?</v>

1174
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Blast it off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel like that?</v>

1175
00:54:08.221 --> 00:54:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Like you were gone the first few minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

1176
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.310
<v Speaker 2>who knows how many minutes or time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1177
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:17.970
<v Speaker 2>but the first period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1178
00:54:17.971 --> 00:54:18.804
<v Speaker 2>there was that sort of ego dissolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's not me having this </v>

1179
00:54:22.411 --> 00:54:25.720
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just fucking experience right now.</v>

1180
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.633
<v Speaker 2>It's just what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just colors and shapes and around holy </v>

1181
00:54:29.551 --> 00:54:30.384
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1182
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:33.850
<v Speaker 2>But that in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this just reminded me of it,</v>

1183
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 2>watching already there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

1184
00:54:35.281 --> 00:54:40.281
<v Speaker 2>what happened was I got overwhelmed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>sadness like I've because people,</v>

1185
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:42.923
<v Speaker 2>some people I'm close to are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through really heavy shit in the last </v>

1186
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:47.640
<v Speaker 2>couple of years and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sorta,</v>

1187
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:51.230
<v Speaker 2>you feel compassion and you check in </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them and you,</v>

1188
00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 2>you compassion literally means to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1189
00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you feel that with them.</v>

1190
00:54:57.421 --> 00:55:01.020
<v Speaker 2>But on another level it's like I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the one who's got ms,</v>

1191
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:01.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the one who's got chronic pain </v>

1192
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:06.090
<v Speaker 2>and suffering all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1193
00:55:06.091 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 2>so there's a separation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I experienced with that was the</v>

1194
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:09.504
<v Speaker 2>absence of separation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just immersed in the sadness </v>

1195
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:15.570
<v Speaker 2>of people I love and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing them suffering and not being able</v>

1196
00:55:15.571 --> 00:55:16.140
<v Speaker 2>to help them.</v>

1197
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And it was overwhelming man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I cried like a baby literally.</v>

1198
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1199
00:55:22.411 --> 00:55:23.244
<v Speaker 2>and then I started coming out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the room was quiet and he was </v>

1200
00:55:26.491 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 2>candlelight and all this and the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was sort of overseeing it was really</v>

1201
00:55:30.961 --> 00:55:32.640
<v Speaker 2>nice and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1202
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.533
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're starting to feel better now and </v>

1203
00:55:34.711 --> 00:55:35.544
<v Speaker 2>here's the tissue and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the music came on and my first </v>

1204
00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:43.230
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first conscious thought was,</v>

1205
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:44.843
<v Speaker 2>remember when I write the yelp review of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this experience to mention that the </v>

1206
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:53.511
<v Speaker 2>music should be different because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music sucked.</v>

1207
00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.670
<v Speaker 2>It was shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new age shit music.</v>

1208
00:55:59.671 --> 00:56:01.770
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to play music,</v>

1209
00:56:01.771 --> 00:56:06.000
<v Speaker 2>play some fucking Bach or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play some Yani or whatever the fuck this</v>

1210
00:56:06.001 --> 00:56:07.740
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my,</v>

1211
00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:08.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1212
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:12.450
<v Speaker 2>not that I use yelp a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just sort of like,</v>

1213
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember to mention this.</v>

1214
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 2>This could improve the experience for </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

1215
00:56:16.021 --> 00:56:18.450
<v Speaker 2>You know what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a weird way of thinking.</v>

1216
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.313
<v Speaker 2>That's a very weird way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had like this super profound </v>

1217
00:56:22.561 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>experience encased in the</v>

1218
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.410
<v Speaker 1>most trivial bullshit imaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1219
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.393
<v Speaker 1>Stan hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that five Meo dmt back when you </v>

1220
00:56:31.271 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 1>could buy it online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:34.930
<v Speaker 1>And he did it at my place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did it together,</v>

1222
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:36.063
<v Speaker 1>but he had never done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had done it a few times when he and I </v>

1223
00:56:39.821 --> 00:56:43.660
<v Speaker 1>did it and he did it and I've never seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody get hit by it harder.</v>

1224
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:45.063
<v Speaker 1>Like he literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like slumped on my couch and he </v>

1225
00:56:49.061 --> 00:56:53.350
<v Speaker 1>was making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was groaning like it was,</v>

1226
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it was disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

1227
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:56.800
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1228
00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 1>it was so extreme that I was wondering </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1229
00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I knew that this is something that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human body makes.</v>

1230
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.633
<v Speaker 1>I knew that it's one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>transient drugs ever observed in the </v>

1231
00:57:05.831 --> 00:57:06.664
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body brings it back to baseline </v>

1232
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:10.440
<v Speaker 1>really quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not at that dosage.</v>

1233
00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.710
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't take that much in,</v>

1234
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:14.583
<v Speaker 1>take any more than I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it hit him like a Goddamn mack </v>

1235
00:57:18.251 --> 00:57:20.210
<v Speaker 1>truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1236
00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.780
<v Speaker 1>he came out of it and he just kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1237
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:23.853
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life just becomes life and then eats </v>

1238
00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 1>life becomes life and just life just </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes,</v>

1239
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 1>this just goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just goes on,</v>

1240
00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.210
<v Speaker 1>goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's no denying that.</v>

1241
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:35.590
<v Speaker 1>He's just looking at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1242
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tripped balls.</v>

1243
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:42.880
<v Speaker 1>But I was worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1244
00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't kill my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was literally word for a few minutes.</v>

1245
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what of his body just can't handle it.</v>

1246
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Doug is world famous for abusing</v>

1247
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:52.864
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes and booze and it's just </v>

1248
00:57:54.941 --> 00:57:55.990
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got hernias.</v>

1249
00:57:55.991 --> 00:57:56.824
<v Speaker 1>You could stick out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can flex his stomach and things that </v>

1250
00:57:58.771 --> 00:58:00.400
<v Speaker 1>pop out of his gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting.</v>

1251
00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:02.320
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1252
00:58:02.321 --> 00:58:03.480
<v Speaker 1>he's a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

1253
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:04.683
<v Speaker 1>there's not a game man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not playing an act as doug that he </v>

1254
00:58:08.921 --> 00:58:09.754
<v Speaker 1>is who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking maybe this is like </v>

1255
00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:16.620
<v Speaker 1>slapping a corvette engine into a 1969 </v>
<v Speaker 1>dodge dart that's got 299,000</v>

1256
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:22.120
<v Speaker 1>miles and just share wheels on the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad breaks.</v>

1257
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And it just seemed like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1258
00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:27.400
<v Speaker 1>what have I done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot up to it because when I did it,</v>

1259
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 1>it felt like I got shot through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannon.</v>

1260
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:33.010
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1261
00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.370
<v Speaker 1>the experience of the launch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it came on slow,</v>

1262
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.970
<v Speaker 1>like it came on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it took a few seconds and then once</v>

1263
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:40.804
<v Speaker 1>it hit itches it's almost like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling back against a catapult band or </v>

1264
00:58:44.191 --> 00:58:49.191
<v Speaker 1>a rubber band or slingshot and just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was just flying to know me.</v>

1265
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.190
<v Speaker 1>So like where I flew to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no me,</v>

1266
00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:59.220
<v Speaker 1>there was no difference between me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air that's in front of me and the,</v>

1267
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:00.303
<v Speaker 1>the wood that makes this table and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor beneath and all the different </v>

1268
00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:04.564
<v Speaker 1>molecules and atoms I could broke down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existence of everything to some </v>

1269
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:15.331
<v Speaker 1>strange geometric level and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really intense and totally colorless.</v>

1270
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.653
<v Speaker 1>It's like a big white thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it would bring you to this weird </v>

1271
00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.490
<v Speaker 1>geometric white thing.</v>

1272
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Whereas DMT is come n n </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine is five,</v>

1273
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:28.723
<v Speaker 3>methoxy dimethyltryptamine is five meo </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just a different visual </v>

1274
00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:32.864
<v Speaker 3>experience than n n dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the one that brings you these </v>

1275
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:39.710
<v Speaker 3>intense visions of geometric patterns </v>
<v Speaker 3>and dancing.</v>

1276
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:40.783
<v Speaker 3>Like the last time I did it it was they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were dancing jokers that were giving me </v>

1277
00:59:44.001 --> 00:59:44.834
<v Speaker 3>the finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just kept giving me the finger and </v>

1278
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:47.751
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1279
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:49.360
<v Speaker 3>I deserve that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt it,</v>

1280
00:59:49.361 --> 00:59:50.540
<v Speaker 3>like as they were doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1281
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:52.610
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

1282
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 3>And I was realizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1283
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:55.070
<v Speaker 3>someone needs to say that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1284
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:56.450
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm being silly person.</v>

1285
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Like by even trying to control this </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip,</v>

1286
00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:02.960
<v Speaker 3>like by even like thinking that like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>just going to go into this.</v>

1287
01:00:02.961 --> 01:00:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm been a good boy,</v>

1288
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.190
<v Speaker 3>but doing my yoga and eating healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this should be a good good trip.</v>

1289
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1290
01:00:08.511 --> 01:00:10.670
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got no control out of this.</v>

1291
01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 3>You better relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes it a heroic dose.</v>

1292
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.870
<v Speaker 3>You gotta let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1293
01:00:14.871 --> 01:00:15.704
<v Speaker 3>all DMT is a heroic dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you passed that three hit </v>

1294
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:19.034
<v Speaker 3>threshold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1295
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Good bye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gone.</v>

1296
01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.880
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

1297
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:23.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gone.</v>

1298
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.970
<v Speaker 3>You're gone or you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just gone.</v>

1299
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That heroic dose I took,</v>

1300
01:00:27.681 --> 01:00:30.360
<v Speaker 3>I ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the story was a lot of weird shit</v>

1301
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:33.620
<v Speaker 3>how he never got done explaining how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much did it actually take four hits.</v>

1302
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:34.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

1303
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.473
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I gave this old psychiatrist </v>

1304
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.040
<v Speaker 3>three hits and I saw him a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks later and he was like,</v>

1305
01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:41.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was good clean stuff.</v>

1306
01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:42.323
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1307
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:43.483
<v Speaker 3>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if that guy he's in his sixties </v>

1308
01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:46.190
<v Speaker 3>could take three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take four.</v>

1309
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.173
<v Speaker 3>I met this dude in Montana recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very nice guy named Jeff and he was </v>

1310
01:00:49.821 --> 01:00:53.450
<v Speaker 3>working with us on this mediator show </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's told us that he took 25 hits of</v>

1311
01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:54.284
<v Speaker 3>acid one night.</v>

1312
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.530
<v Speaker 3>See I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back in the day.</v>

1313
01:00:57.531 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I did five or six or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I felt like there was a plateau,</v>

1314
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.490
<v Speaker 3>like I couldn't trip any harder than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>tripped.</v>

1315
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.370
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that 20 would be.</v>

1316
01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just went with it.</v>

1317
01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:11.210
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget how he described it,</v>

1318
01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.270
<v Speaker 3>but just went with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1319
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 3>last night I watched this documentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the sunshine makers,</v>

1320
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:19.184
<v Speaker 3>about the guys Owsley and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the two guys who were making orange </v>

1321
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:24.950
<v Speaker 3>sunshine together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the famous acid of the sixties.</v>

1322
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the guys was like,</v>

1323
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.430
<v Speaker 3>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Send those.</v>

1324
01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:29.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all Sandoz lamps.</v>

1325
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:31.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the legal shit.</v>

1326
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:36.380
<v Speaker 3>And so this is the guys in California </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Colorado briefly who were making the</v>

1327
01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:38.520
<v Speaker 3>illegal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1328
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.430
<v Speaker 3>and who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was in the sunshine,</v>

1329
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two guys.</v>

1330
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:44.820
<v Speaker 3>The one guy was a ghost champions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got.</v>

1331
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.920
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was a documentary.</v>

1332
01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:47.243
<v Speaker 3>Nicholas Tim scully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlikely duo at the heart of the 19 </v>

1333
01:01:50.481 --> 01:01:54.140
<v Speaker 3>sixties American drug countercultural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1334
01:01:54.141 --> 01:01:54.974
<v Speaker 3>it's quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird that that was so </v>

1335
01:01:57.171 --> 01:01:58.004
<v Speaker 3>incredibly recent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but within a few decades they had </v>

1336
01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.850
<v Speaker 3>basically erased all evidence of it from</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture except for a few fringe people,</v>

1337
01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.173
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1338
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about old research,</v>

1339
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:08.534
<v Speaker 3>there were thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tens of thousands of scientific papers </v>

1340
01:02:10.611 --> 01:02:13.730
<v Speaker 3>published on how hallucinogens affect </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain.</v>

1341
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:16.790
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Sarah Turner Jack System,</v>

1342
01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 3>the whole understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitters really</v>

1343
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 4>was fueled by trying to understand how </v>
<v Speaker 4>so little lsd could make you so high.</v>

1344
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:25.223
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what got people into looking at </v>

1345
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:27.474
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmitters in the effects on </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness in the late fifties </v>

1346
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:31.740
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1347
01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:36.420
<v Speaker 4>we could talk for ever about how a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hallucinogens have changed culture.</v>

1348
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:38.760
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell was I saying?</v>

1349
01:02:38.761 --> 01:02:39.594
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you took forehead and the movie this </v>

1350
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:42.210
<v Speaker 4>guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1351
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.280
<v Speaker 4>but the movie this guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1352
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:46.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about how they're doing the</v>

1353
01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 4>vats and he's a chemist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1354
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:51.810
<v Speaker 4>every once in a while you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you touch something and it's hot and you</v>

1355
01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:52.231
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1356
01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:53.820
<v Speaker 4>and you put your thumb in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

1357
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:56.850
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just took 200 micrograms of LSD.</v>

1358
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.043
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1359
01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 4>they were high all the time while they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were working.</v>

1360
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:04.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's actually 22,000</v>

1361
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 4>La isn't there like a number?</v>

1362
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:09.510
<v Speaker 4>Like someone told me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is maybe one of those urban myths,</v>

1363
01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:10.344
<v Speaker 4>like you have to register your hands as </v>
<v Speaker 4>lethal weapons once you get your black </v>

1364
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:14.370
<v Speaker 4>belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was an urban with too,</v>

1365
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:17.790
<v Speaker 4>but isn't there an urban myth that like </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do a certain amount of acid,</v>

1366
01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:19.800
<v Speaker 4>you're considered legally insane?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard that.</v>

1367
01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:21.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's true.</v>

1368
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.270
<v Speaker 4>I hope it is because then I'm like free </v>
<v Speaker 4>and clear.</v>

1369
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 4>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie's at real.</v>

1370
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've heard that my whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>life as well.</v>

1371
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember hearing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bullshit.</v>

1372
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:32.880
<v Speaker 4>I was like seven hits and make you </v>
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>

1373
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.760
<v Speaker 4>You're gone bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Legally.</v>

1374
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:36.623
<v Speaker 4>So anything you do afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can prove you tripped at least </v>

1375
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.490
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven times.</v>

1376
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.393
<v Speaker 4>People that have done big doses of acid </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of them have had a really hard </v>

1377
01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:48.330
<v Speaker 4>time grasping regular reality and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wonder if there's a correlation.</v>

1378
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:49.163
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if there's a connection between</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some of them have like really </v>

1379
01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:54.420
<v Speaker 4>distorted perceptions of what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now in terms of like,</v>

1380
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.540
<v Speaker 4>like an experience will happen and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll have a version of the experience</v>

1381
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.330
<v Speaker 4>and you'll relay your version of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and they didn't.</v>

1382
01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 4>They didn't remember that at all and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1383
01:04:02.011 --> 01:04:04.770
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who's got this right,</v>

1384
01:04:04.771 --> 01:04:06.330
<v Speaker 4>because memory is kind of a slippery </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

1385
01:04:06.331 --> 01:04:08.250
<v Speaker 4>but I don't remember him saying that to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1386
01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:09.084
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember someone doing that to </v>

1387
01:04:09.841 --> 01:04:11.250
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember that going down.</v>

1388
01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:12.084
<v Speaker 4>Like people have these weird perceived </v>
<v Speaker 4>interactions that maybe are a little </v>

1389
01:04:15.631 --> 01:04:16.464
<v Speaker 4>skewed and I always wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it the 39 hits of acid you took one </v>

1390
01:04:20.761 --> 01:04:21.331
<v Speaker 4>night?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

1391
01:04:21.331 --> 01:04:22.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you blow a fuse?</v>

1392
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Can you blow a few of these in it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

1393
01:04:24.451 --> 01:04:28.110
<v Speaker 4>somebody who works out and they mess up </v>
<v Speaker 4>their back and you say,</v>

1394
01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:28.944
<v Speaker 4>well you can blame it on working out or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could blame it on and working out </v>

1395
01:04:30.691 --> 01:04:31.524
<v Speaker 4>wrong or you could blame it on the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you probably already had a </v>

1396
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:37.110
<v Speaker 4>structural issue in your back that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>just uncovered.</v>

1397
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:38.443
<v Speaker 4>So I think a lot of people who have bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences or end up fucked up from </v>

1398
01:04:42.181 --> 01:04:45.510
<v Speaker 4>hallucinogens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be fucked up anyway.</v>

1399
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:48.000
<v Speaker 4>And there are psychotic breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1400
01:04:48.001 --> 01:04:49.890
<v Speaker 4>like this kid that I talked about </v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier,</v>

1401
01:04:49.891 --> 01:04:52.170
<v Speaker 4>Nance Amsterdam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a psychotic break,</v>

1402
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.633
<v Speaker 4>but generally you can recover from that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'll be fine unless there's some </v>

1403
01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:01.290
<v Speaker 4>underlying structural issue in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality.</v>

1404
01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:03.320
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know.</v>

1405
01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:06.340
<v Speaker 4>I think it's multifactorial like </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1406
01:05:06.341 --> 01:05:08.850
<v Speaker 4>And so ultimately I think you're totally</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1407
01:05:08.851 --> 01:05:09.684
<v Speaker 4>That completely makes sense and it's one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the things that you've got to think </v>

1408
01:05:12.091 --> 01:05:12.924
<v Speaker 4>about when you talk about food or </v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol or anything that people want up </v>

1409
01:05:16.171 --> 01:05:17.400
<v Speaker 4>getting addicted to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1410
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 4>People</v>

1411
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:21.880
<v Speaker 3>can blow their brains out on a variety </v>
<v Speaker 3>of different substances that are readily</v>

1412
01:05:21.881 --> 01:05:22.714
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're always looking for the reason for </v>

1413
01:05:25.601 --> 01:05:26.434
<v Speaker 3>the effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but normally it's a million reasons for </v>

1414
01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:28.954
<v Speaker 3>an effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's no constellation if your son </v>

1415
01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:32.180
<v Speaker 3>goes crazy from taking acid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1416
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things if acid became </v>
<v Speaker 3>legal and your son walked into a cvs and</v>

1417
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.013
<v Speaker 3>bought acid and did too much with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and never came back and you had </v>

1418
01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:42.600
<v Speaker 3>to take care of him when he's 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1419
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:44.270
<v Speaker 3>it's no constellation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1420
01:05:44.271 --> 01:05:45.104
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have psychotic breaks </v>
<v Speaker 3>when their girlfriend breaks up with </v>

1421
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:48.160
<v Speaker 3>them the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1422
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 3>So are we going to blame women for </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychosis?</v>

1423
01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.553
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to describe or to really </v>

1424
01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:55.900
<v Speaker 3>recognize like what is a psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>break,</v>

1425
01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:59.290
<v Speaker 3>what is real mental illness and when are</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just being a bitch?</v>

1426
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.983
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a professional should be able to </v>

1427
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:05.170
<v Speaker 3>recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would hope so.</v>

1428
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.900
<v Speaker 3>At least when you're just being near an </v>
<v Speaker 3>edge,</v>

1429
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.033
<v Speaker 3>during an edge to like mental illness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just being a bench like we're </v>

1430
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:14.950
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychosis.</v>

1431
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Neurosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One more time,</v>

1432
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:18.940
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't call her.</v>

1433
01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I've got to call her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No you don't.</v>

1434
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:22.650
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The universe was telling me to call her.</v>

1435
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.693
<v Speaker 3>I have to talk to her right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll understand what's her talked to </v>

1436
01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.370
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a restraining order.</v>

1437
01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to go to jail?</v>

1438
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:32.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to knock on our window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it.</v>

1439
01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.293
<v Speaker 3>There's people that get obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people when it comes to relationships </v>

1440
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.473
<v Speaker 3>and you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what will people get addicted to each </v>

1441
01:06:39.821 --> 01:06:40.654
<v Speaker 3>other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get as addicted to each other as </v>

1442
01:06:41.771 --> 01:06:42.604
<v Speaker 3>they get addicted to sugar easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's harder for people to break up with </v>

1443
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:46.900
<v Speaker 3>people than it is from the kick.</v>

1444
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Sugar people can kick sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They decide they want to lose weight.</v>

1445
01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.393
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when people break up like the </v>

1446
01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:54.364
<v Speaker 3>emotional toll that you take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so devastating and I think part of </v>

1447
01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:00.334
<v Speaker 3>the reason why the emotional toll so </v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating and less being with the </v>

1448
01:07:02.531 --> 01:07:05.860
<v Speaker 3>person was completely negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was completely negative.</v>

1449
01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finally,</v>

1450
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:07.684
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met a few of those in my life and </v>

1451
01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:11.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's other ones.</v>

1452
01:07:11.321 --> 01:07:12.101
<v Speaker 3>We like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1453
01:07:12.101 --> 01:07:12.934
<v Speaker 3>this feels terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like it's stuck a emotional </v>

1454
01:07:15.971 --> 01:07:17.180
<v Speaker 3>flu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1455
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't want to go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's because we get addicted</v>

1456
01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:21.604
<v Speaker 3>to each other in the same way that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonded to create these communal tribes </v>

1457
01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:30.130
<v Speaker 3>have 50 people back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those instincts still remain and I think</v>

1458
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:31.203
<v Speaker 3>one of the reward systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you would know better than I have </v>

1459
01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:34.533
<v Speaker 3>connecting everybody together with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is got to be this deep affection and </v>

1460
01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.380
<v Speaker 3>this addiction that we developed towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1461
01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1462
01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:43.810
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to be loved.</v>

1463
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.673
<v Speaker 3>We need to be touched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of times if you don't have a </v>

1464
01:07:46.481 --> 01:07:47.770
<v Speaker 3>partner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's touching,</v>

1465
01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:50.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an adult.</v>

1466
01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.600
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1467
01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:56.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean I love is a funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about this a lot on the podcast,</v>

1468
01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm.</v>

1469
01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:59.530
<v Speaker 3>People think I'm some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship expert,</v>

1470
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:02.000
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1471
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.063
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1472
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:05.020
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told this,</v>

1473
01:08:05.021 --> 01:08:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I've told this story in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your podcast,</v>

1474
01:08:06.641 --> 01:08:10.690
<v Speaker 3>but my dad has this golden retriever and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's had like five of them.</v>

1475
01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:12.220
<v Speaker 3>They all look the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know this one,</v>

1476
01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.720
<v Speaker 3>just the last one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brandy.</v>

1477
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the fourth of July</v>

1478
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.963
<v Speaker 4>they had the dog out in the backyard and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they went to watch some fourth of July </v>

1479
01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some party somewhere.</v>

1480
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:22.514
<v Speaker 4>And apparently the fireworks scared the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dog and the dog jumped a fence and took </v>

1481
01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

1482
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 4>and so my dad and my sister were all </v>
<v Speaker 4>freaked out and they're putting up store</v>

1483
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:31.543
<v Speaker 4>signs all over the neighborhood and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Colin and the shelters and all that day </v>

1484
01:08:34.491 --> 01:08:35.960
<v Speaker 4>or two later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get a call from shelter.</v>

1485
01:08:35.961 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got your dog come down and like,</v>

1486
01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:38.640
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there she is,</v>

1487
01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.113
<v Speaker 4>so take the dog home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're in the backyard throwing the </v>

1488
01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 4>ball with the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my sister's boyfriend comes home and</v>

1489
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Speaker 4>he looks out the window and he says to </v>
<v Speaker 4>my mom,</v>

1490
01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:50.810
<v Speaker 4>who's dog are they play in with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>

1491
01:08:50.811 --> 01:08:51.730
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's brandy.</v>

1492
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.480
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not brandy.</v>

1493
01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:56.000
<v Speaker 4>And then a few minutes later the phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>rings.</v>

1494
01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:56.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.590
<v Speaker 4>it's the wrong dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1497
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:01.833
<v Speaker 4>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took it back to the found should </v>

1498
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.333
<v Speaker 4>killed it.</v>

1499
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:10.950
<v Speaker 4>Your imposter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You try to pretend you're not branding,</v>

1500
01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:16.460
<v Speaker 4>respond to brandy fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my point,</v>

1501
01:09:16.461 --> 01:09:16.911
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1502
01:09:16.911 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 4>the dog was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did I do wrong?</v>

1503
01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.150
<v Speaker 4>I chased your ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1504
01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:21.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>

1505
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.380
<v Speaker 4>They sound like a great dog owner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should have just kept that.</v>

1506
01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:24.243
<v Speaker 4>She brought it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They found of exactly where you adopt a </v>

1507
01:09:27.521 --> 01:09:29.600
<v Speaker 4>kid and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to send you back.</v>

1508
01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:31.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If somebody comes looking for that dog,</v>

1509
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.090
<v Speaker 4>then call me until then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dog lives here.</v>

1510
01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 4>Should have been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't bring it back.</v>

1511
01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:38.120
<v Speaker 4>The power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a fucking drag for the dog.</v>

1512
01:09:38.121 --> 01:09:38.954
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my point is there in the backyard </v>

1513
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:43.700
<v Speaker 4>with the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are they feeling?</v>

1514
01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.380
<v Speaker 4>My Dad's feeling incredible relief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brandi's back love.</v>

1515
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:51.140
<v Speaker 4>He loves brandy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brandy,</v>

1516
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:53.323
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't matter because he's still</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling love and I think we do that in </v>

1517
01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:58.520
<v Speaker 4>our relationships.</v>

1518
01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.210
<v Speaker 4>We project our need to love on whoever </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck will take it.</v>

1519
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:03.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that Beatle Song?</v>

1520
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:07.370
<v Speaker 4>I need somebody to love and then in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>back you ever listed in the back,</v>

1521
01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:11.210
<v Speaker 4>they see can it be anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he says,</v>

1522
01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:14.000
<v Speaker 4>I just want someone to love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck who it is.</v>

1523
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.120
<v Speaker 4>I just want a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

1524
01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:19.370
<v Speaker 4>I want a girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take whatever.</v>

1525
01:10:19.371 --> 01:10:21.950
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a thing with a lot of people that</v>

1526
01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.290
<v Speaker 4>don't have relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a bunch of pets.</v>

1527
01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need someone or something.</v>

1528
01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:29.320
<v Speaker 4>I love anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1529
01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:30.910
<v Speaker 4>if you're a single person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you come home,</v>

1530
01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:31.763
<v Speaker 4>your dogs are so happy to see you really</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't your kisses in get your pets </v>

1531
01:10:37.071 --> 01:10:37.821
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1532
01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:41.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean dogs are like emotional bandaids </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people.</v>

1533
01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Even cats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have cats.</v>

1534
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.890
<v Speaker 4>I love cats and they don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't give a fuck.</v>

1535
01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:46.724
<v Speaker 4>Are you there or not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they'll sit on your lap and purr </v>

1536
01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:48.980
<v Speaker 4>when you pet them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1537
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.950
<v Speaker 4>they'll accept your love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is nice.</v>

1538
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.280
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes that's enough dogs better </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

1539
01:10:55.281 --> 01:10:57.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe you can get new cats.</v>

1540
01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Fucking shows sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1541
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.553
<v Speaker 4>I forget where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The millions of listening and it's just </v>

1542
01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:09.350
<v Speaker 4>such a hackneyed debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dogs versus cats.</v>

1543
01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:12.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm really into fucking aardvarks bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pet aardvark.</v>

1544
01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched a video</v>

1545
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.053
<v Speaker 1>online of a wild pig that had eaten </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a cow's body and got stuck in </v>

1546
01:11:19.621 --> 01:11:20.454
<v Speaker 1>the farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found the cow and this wild pig is like </v>

1547
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.630
<v Speaker 1>coming out through a hole in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach,</v>

1548
01:11:25.631 --> 01:11:29.250
<v Speaker 1>like he'd eaten through the cow and got </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck.</v>

1549
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jim Carrey and pet detective </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he comes out of the Zebra.</v>

1550
01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Is this it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1551
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:37.050
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watch a lot of gross shit,</v>

1552
01:11:37.051 --> 01:11:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but this is not that gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1553
01:11:38.231 --> 01:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stuck.</v>

1554
01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I can't get out of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skin,</v>

1555
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:44.063
<v Speaker 1>the skin of the cow at eight through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it can't get fat body through </v>

1556
01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.000
<v Speaker 1>and got his head through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can't fit the rest of it through.</v>

1557
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.943
<v Speaker 1>How could it not back out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't know what to do with stupid </v>

1558
01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 1>fucking wild pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who has a pig.</v>

1559
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:56.700
<v Speaker 1>A pet pig.</v>

1560
01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.080
<v Speaker 1>A potbelly pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1561
01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.770
<v Speaker 1>exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he passed.</v>

1562
01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:05.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bummer if there's a little </v>

1564
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:10.110
<v Speaker 1>bacon's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about what is it is.</v>

1565
01:12:10.111 --> 01:12:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I keep trying to find cruelty free bacon</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just not.</v>

1566
01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:15.990
<v Speaker 1>They're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find you got to shoot a pig.</v>

1567
01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:16.824
<v Speaker 1>Get Bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a certain amount of cruelty </v>

1568
01:12:17.821 --> 01:12:20.850
<v Speaker 1>involved in that delicious Taylor here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pig or see a pink dye.</v>

1569
01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I've killed pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cope.</v>

1570
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:23.880
<v Speaker 1>They don't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happy.</v>

1571
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1572
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:25.143
<v Speaker 1>The one I killed died real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot it with a 300 win mag and died </v>

1573
01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:32.220
<v Speaker 1>instantly in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the body body cavity like blue.</v>

1574
01:12:32.221 --> 01:12:34.770
<v Speaker 1>It's hard out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he died instantaneously.</v>

1575
01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:35.773
<v Speaker 1>Turned around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drove a 300 the scope into my </v>

1576
01:12:38.971 --> 01:12:41.760
<v Speaker 1>forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was nice.</v>

1577
01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:42.594
<v Speaker 1>Got a lot of kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good round because anything it </v>

1578
01:12:45.931 --> 01:12:49.530
<v Speaker 1>hits dies very humanely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly if you hit it right,</v>

1579
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.620
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1580
01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm wild.</v>

1581
01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:52.914
<v Speaker 1>Pigs are a huge problem and I know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pig people have a problem with people </v>

1582
01:12:57.901 --> 01:13:01.860
<v Speaker 1>eating animals and I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's always going to be an issue.</v>

1583
01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Even if we didn't need any animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want all of your vegetables</v>

1584
01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:06.923
<v Speaker 1>eaten up by wild pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody has to control the population </v>

1585
01:13:09.391 --> 01:13:12.960
<v Speaker 1>because there's no way to control them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They breed at a staggering rate.</v>

1586
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.200
<v Speaker 1>They breed three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'll have these letters.</v>

1587
01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:18.330
<v Speaker 1>They can have literally two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times a year.</v>

1588
01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.390
<v Speaker 1>They started having litters when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months old,</v>

1589
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.720
<v Speaker 1>when they're six months old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start shitting out pigs and there's</v>

1590
01:13:24.721 --> 01:13:25.940
<v Speaker 1>a ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1591
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.550
<v Speaker 1>there's around Sonoma county.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in San Jose,</v>

1592
01:13:29.551 --> 01:13:31.890
<v Speaker 1>they're eating people's lawns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>residential neighborhoods.</v>

1593
01:13:31.891 --> 01:13:34.860
<v Speaker 1>They're not to be fucked with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get outta here.</v>

1594
01:13:34.861 --> 01:13:35.694
<v Speaker 1>Pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll kill your dog to the fuck your </v>

1595
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:39.200
<v Speaker 1>dog up and slice them up and they'll eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>them too.</v>

1596
01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Once he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their tusks,</v>

1597
01:13:40.891 --> 01:13:43.770
<v Speaker 1>like especially the big boars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're enormous animals too.</v>

1598
01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:44.970
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about like some of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

1599
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:46.283
<v Speaker 1>They shot one at that to hone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ranch thing was about 350 pounds last </v>

1600
01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.440
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred 50 pounds for.</v>

1601
01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:55.290
<v Speaker 1>This is a wild snorting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific beast.</v>

1602
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not a fat pig wallowing around </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1603
01:13:58.621 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Fast and aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fast,</v>

1604
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:01.584
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a what's called a a shield </v>

1605
01:14:04.951 --> 01:14:09.930
<v Speaker 1>plate all around their front body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where their face is like from their</v>

1606
01:14:09.931 --> 01:14:10.764
<v Speaker 1>jaw line back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this incredibly thick like </v>

1607
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:15.124
<v Speaker 1>leather and it's to protect them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to war with other male bores in </v>

1608
01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:20.354
<v Speaker 1>those giant tusks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they fucking slice each other up and </v>

1609
01:14:23.081 --> 01:14:28.081
<v Speaker 1>so these things are just their tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're super durable tanks who are born</v>

1610
01:14:28.751 --> 01:14:32.890
<v Speaker 1>at a ridiculous rate if there's millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them roaming through the country.</v>

1611
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.450
<v Speaker 1>And there was an article that I posted </v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter just a few days ago where,</v>

1612
01:14:37.451 --> 01:14:38.284
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientists were saying it's just a </v>

1613
01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:44.530
<v Speaker 1>matter of time before every county in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every state has a wild pig problem.</v>

1614
01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.753
<v Speaker 1>It's just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not stopping the breeding and </v>

1615
01:14:47.351 --> 01:14:48.184
<v Speaker 1>not stopping the growth and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to slowly spread out like coyote </v>

1616
01:14:51.011 --> 01:14:51.160
<v Speaker 1>roadies</v>

1617
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.300
<v Speaker 3>and the meat's good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1618
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really good.</v>

1619
01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:56.280
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The perfect situation because you're,</v>

1620
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:59.140
<v Speaker 3>you're killing something that needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be killed,</v>

1621
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.393
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it used to be cougars were killing them </v>

1622
01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:02.464
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever other predators we're keeping </v>

1623
01:15:04.481 --> 01:15:05.950
<v Speaker 3>them in check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no not,</v>

1624
01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:09.220
<v Speaker 3>they're an invasive species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't native to North America.</v>

1625
01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Now they're brought over here from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

1626
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.733
<v Speaker 3>They were brought over here from Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They brought over here from different </v>

1627
01:15:13.451 --> 01:15:14.284
<v Speaker 3>parts of the world are some ferocious </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian ones that are in the northern </v>

1628
01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:21.751
<v Speaker 3>California coast that are connected to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was William Randolph hearst,</v>

1629
01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.253
<v Speaker 3>the hearst castle up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think William Randolph hearst had </v>

1630
01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.570
<v Speaker 3>bores up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one more thing they came from,</v>

1631
01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:29.710
<v Speaker 3>there were predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1632
01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:30.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Siberia,</v>

1633
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.843
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1634
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.860
<v Speaker 3>they probably lived in incredibly harsh </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments and it's one of the reasons</v>

1635
01:15:34.861 --> 01:15:35.770
<v Speaker 3>why they thrive here.</v>

1636
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.633
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my point is there's no Predator now </v>

1637
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.420
<v Speaker 3>they're living free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

1638
01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:41.283
<v Speaker 3>they're not like pigs that are turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>into bacon or fucking cages where they </v>

1639
01:15:44.261 --> 01:15:46.120
<v Speaker 3>can turn around and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1640
01:15:46.121 --> 01:15:47.850
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that gets me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1641
01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:51.850
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem eating meat because as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug Stanhope said,</v>

1642
01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:53.200
<v Speaker 3>life becomes life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1643
01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.060
<v Speaker 3>life eats life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it does.</v>

1644
01:15:55.061 --> 01:15:55.894
<v Speaker 3>There's no getting around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a book called the Vegetarian </v>

1645
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.863
<v Speaker 3>Myth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever read that?</v>

1646
01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1647
01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:03.760
<v Speaker 3>It was a woman who was a Vegan for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and then she's like,</v>

1648
01:16:03.761 --> 01:16:04.594
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to grow my own food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as she started growing her </v>

1649
01:16:07.571 --> 01:16:09.790
<v Speaker 3>own food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she realized there's no way to even grow</v>

1650
01:16:09.791 --> 01:16:10.624
<v Speaker 3>food without killing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to put this stuff down to </v>

1651
01:16:13.181 --> 01:16:16.150
<v Speaker 3>protect the garden from the slugs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>kills the slugs.</v>

1652
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:19.210
<v Speaker 3>The fertilizer is made out of bone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood meal.</v>

1653
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Where's that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1654
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:24.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's no way to not kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in order to eat.</v>

1655
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.340
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're eating vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still killing things to eat them.</v>

1656
01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the connection to the actual food</v>

1657
01:16:29.681 --> 01:16:30.514
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rate right from the source and it gives </v>

1658
01:16:31.691 --> 01:16:33.880
<v Speaker 3>you this understanding of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still you can,</v>

1659
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:36.620
<v Speaker 3>you can mitigate the amount of suffering</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've asked.</v>

1660
01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:37.900
<v Speaker 3>What I was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1661
01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I've got no problem eating something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that lived a life,</v>

1662
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:43.090
<v Speaker 3>a free life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these wild boars.</v>

1663
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:43.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I have a problem with is the </v>

1664
01:16:44.681 --> 01:16:47.030
<v Speaker 3>industrial process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1665
01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 3>wild boar is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be one of the few things that we,</v>

1666
01:16:50.801 --> 01:16:51.634
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we almost have enough where everybody </v>

1667
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:57.670
<v Speaker 3>can hunt them because I mean there's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough deer.</v>

1668
01:16:57.671 --> 01:17:01.690
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough elk for people to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hunt in this country.</v>

1669
01:17:01.691 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Like if everybody wanted to do what some</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are trying to do with it,</v>

1670
01:17:04.811 --> 01:17:05.644
<v Speaker 3>just trying to get all the meat from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild does it just not enough wild but </v>

1671
01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 3>there enough for the amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are doing it for sure.</v>

1672
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:12.463
<v Speaker 3>Definitely it's a very sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's also why it's really </v>

1673
01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:16.364
<v Speaker 3>difficult to get certain tags for </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain animals in certain areas where </v>

1674
01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:22.220
<v Speaker 3>they do monitor the population and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1675
01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.140
<v Speaker 3>well we have like a certain amount here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

1676
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:25.303
<v Speaker 3>this is the amount that we have and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the amount that we think would be </v>

1677
01:17:27.171 --> 01:17:28.004
<v Speaker 3>healthy to removed from the population </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the competition for food and </v>

1678
01:17:30.921 --> 01:17:32.610
<v Speaker 3>this and that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1679
01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:35.060
<v Speaker 3>so these people compete for not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>compete,</v>

1680
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:39.190
<v Speaker 3>but they put it in there for like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>apply for a tag,</v>

1681
01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 3>like a lottery system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be a thousand people apply,</v>

1682
01:17:41.601 --> 01:17:42.434
<v Speaker 3>but only 100 get tags and now those 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time it's not even 50 </v>

1683
01:17:46.941 --> 01:17:47.774
<v Speaker 3>percent success rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are the proposition of going </v>

1684
01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:52.260
<v Speaker 3>out and just trying to get your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>meats.</v>

1685
01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Very sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to do.</v>

1686
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Not everybody could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not,</v>

1687
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:59.750
<v Speaker 3>it's not really a viable alternative to </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeding 350 million people.</v>

1688
01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it could be viable for you.</v>

1689
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:06.170
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like that's the thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people when it comes to impact.</v>

1690
01:18:06.171 --> 01:18:07.610
<v Speaker 3>We always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have this weird thing,</v>

1691
01:18:07.611 --> 01:18:08.444
<v Speaker 3>we're go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1692
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:10.430
<v Speaker 3>everybody can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

1693
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.353
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can't live in your house </v>

1694
01:18:12.651 --> 01:18:13.430
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1695
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:15.800
<v Speaker 3>Everybody doesn't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can't sleep in your bed.</v>

1696
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.823
<v Speaker 3>Every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can't fuck your wife unless </v>

1697
01:18:17.811 --> 01:18:19.520
<v Speaker 3>you guys would like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless your brakes,</v>

1698
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's a certain amount of </v>

1699
01:18:22.971 --> 01:18:26.080
<v Speaker 3>shit you can think of for your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for your own life.</v>

1700
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:28.220
<v Speaker 3>You want to feel better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go shoot a wild pig.</v>

1701
01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:30.560
<v Speaker 3>That's where you get your food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll feel better.</v>

1702
01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:31.970
<v Speaker 3>You'll feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

1703
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.433
<v Speaker 3>Michael Pollan wrote a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>essay about him shooting a wild pig up </v>

1704
01:18:37.221 --> 01:18:37.830
<v Speaker 3>in sonoma.</v>

1705
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:38.663
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's included in the Omnivore's </v>

1706
01:18:40.101 --> 01:18:40.934
<v Speaker 3>dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his big best seller where he wanted to </v>

1707
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.880
<v Speaker 3>trace the origins of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every element of a meal.</v>

1708
01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.280
<v Speaker 3>And so he built a book around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>

1709
01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I remember reading that essay in the New</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yorker,</v>

1710
01:18:52.611 --> 01:18:54.440
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1711
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I was struck by how he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he conveys really powerfully the feeling</v>

1712
01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:00.734
<v Speaker 3>of having killed something where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was this sort of jubilation followed by </v>

1713
01:19:04.731 --> 01:19:05.564
<v Speaker 3>shame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>followed by like a confusion and </v>

1714
01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:13.480
<v Speaker 3>discussed and like all these things were</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of waves passing through him.</v>

1715
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't a big hunter.</v>

1716
01:19:15.861 --> 01:19:17.780
<v Speaker 3>He just wanted to have this one </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

1717
01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1718
01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.680
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my buddy,</v>

1719
01:19:21.681 --> 01:19:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Justin's gonna take me hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been offering for a couple of years</v>

1720
01:19:25.731 --> 01:19:27.950
<v Speaker 3>now and I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big killer,</v>

1721
01:19:27.951 --> 01:19:28.784
<v Speaker 3>but I know how to shoot guns and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>some responsibility to face the reality </v>

1722
01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:34.760
<v Speaker 3>of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1723
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:37.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean just face it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're killing shit,</v>

1724
01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:38.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just because someone's doing it for </v>

1725
01:19:39.231 --> 01:19:42.530
<v Speaker 3>you in a factory and cutting it up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it in plastic,</v>

1726
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:45.380
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean you're not involved in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that process.</v>

1727
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Would you be one of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would adopt lab created meat?</v>

1728
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Would you put that in your diet once </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1729
01:19:51.670 --> 01:19:52.503
<v Speaker 3>that actually happens because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty sure that they're going to be </v>

1730
01:19:54.291 --> 01:19:58.250
<v Speaker 3>able to make that happen soon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or would you look at it and say,</v>

1731
01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:58.701
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1732
01:19:58.701 --> 01:19:59.534
<v Speaker 3>how would you look at it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd want to look at it scientifically </v>

1733
01:20:01.941 --> 01:20:02.750
<v Speaker 3>and no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1734
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:03.583
<v Speaker 3>what's the nutritional content?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm very suspicious of these </v>

1735
01:20:07.201 --> 01:20:08.480
<v Speaker 3>things that come out of laboratory.</v>

1736
01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if it turned out that it was,</v>

1737
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:12.983
<v Speaker 4>it tasted the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nutritional content was as good as </v>

1738
01:20:15.151 --> 01:20:16.130
<v Speaker 4>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1739
01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:19.620
<v Speaker 4>meet with grass Fed Omega three and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff.</v>

1740
01:20:19.621 --> 01:20:21.930
<v Speaker 4>They Omega three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Omega six ratios were right?</v>

1741
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:23.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd eat it.</v>

1742
01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.060
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat a lot of weird shit and we all do.</v>

1743
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 4>Or most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1744
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:33.060
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mother had a bowl of cheese puffs the</v>

1745
01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:35.570
<v Speaker 4>other day at the superbowl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is a cheese puff?</v>

1746
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.193
<v Speaker 4>Asshole fire talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that comes out of a lab or </v>

1747
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:45.000
<v Speaker 4>marshmallows when they have banned trans</v>
<v Speaker 4>fats in the United States,</v>

1748
01:20:45.001 --> 01:20:45.834
<v Speaker 4>but they allow people to put them in for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next couple of years in 2018 runs </v>

1749
01:20:50.611 --> 01:20:54.360
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So until then you could poison people.</v>

1750
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:55.613
<v Speaker 4>Until then you can keep throwing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and whatever the fuck baked goods </v>

1751
01:20:58.591 --> 01:20:59.424
<v Speaker 4>and Taito creations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did we find out the Trans fats are </v>

1752
01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:03.210
<v Speaker 4>in?</v>

1753
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:05.570
<v Speaker 4>It was in like microwave popcorn I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>was one.</v>

1754
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:07.860
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That stuff's God damn delicious.</v>

1755
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:08.743
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love microwave popcorn and what do </v>

1756
01:21:09.991 --> 01:21:11.440
<v Speaker 4>you need to make popcorn?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

1757
01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:14.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean just make it normally a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>oil.</v>

1758
01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.290
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's so convenient.</v>

1759
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:20.660
<v Speaker 4>If you're a lazy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the stockpiles you can do,</v>

1760
01:21:20.661 --> 01:21:24.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole sort of fertilizer and I'm not</v>

1761
01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:28.200
<v Speaker 4>fertilizer pesticide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>insecticide and you know,</v>

1762
01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:29.123
<v Speaker 4>farm spraying crops and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That all started because at the end of </v>

1763
01:21:32.941 --> 01:21:36.840
<v Speaker 4>World War II there were huge stockpiles </v>
<v Speaker 4>of chemical weapons that weren't used.</v>

1764
01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:39.750
<v Speaker 4>And so they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we going to do with this shit?</v>

1765
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:42.540
<v Speaker 4>We gotta sell this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

1766
01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:46.420
<v Speaker 4>well we can dilute it and spray it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll kill aphids or whatever the fuck.</v>

1767
01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:47.633
<v Speaker 4>And there really wasn't a big problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>with pests in the American farming </v>

1768
01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:51.324
<v Speaker 4>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they had all the stock pile of </v>

1769
01:21:53.131 --> 01:21:53.490
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1770
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:56.220
<v Speaker 4>And the Rachel Carson writes about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>in silent spring.</v>

1771
01:21:56.410 --> 01:21:58.740
<v Speaker 4>A classic book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:01.920
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like there's bacon and eggs.</v>

1773
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:03.443
<v Speaker 4>We think that's a natural breakfast </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that was invented by an </v>

1774
01:22:05.641 --> 01:22:06.770
<v Speaker 4>advertising agency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:08.460
<v Speaker 4>We talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>

1776
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:09.383
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talked about this and we've talked </v>

1777
01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:13.920
<v Speaker 4>about how Kellogg's created really blend</v>
<v Speaker 4>cereal to keep people from beating off.</v>

1778
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:14.940
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my shtick.</v>

1779
01:22:14.941 --> 01:22:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a beautiful stick though.</v>

1780
01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:18.750
<v Speaker 4>Once people find out that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1781
01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:19.584
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just think of how bizarre Graham </v>

1782
01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:25.410
<v Speaker 4>crackers Graham crackers again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1783
01:22:25.411 --> 01:22:26.244
<v Speaker 4>it was current.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Graham and Kellogg were the two sort of </v>

1784
01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:29.124
<v Speaker 4>anti masturbation guy and he thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>Graham crackers keep you from being off </v>

1785
01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:33.690
<v Speaker 4>because they're so blend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

1786
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:36.750
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it hilarious that they associated </v>
<v Speaker 4>spicy food,</v>

1787
01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:41.751
<v Speaker 4>like Latino's dance?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had tacos.</v>

1788
01:22:41.941 --> 01:22:43.790
<v Speaker 4>We had to tell about the Taco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1789
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.590
<v Speaker 4>some fucking hot salsa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Salsa music.</v>

1790
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:48.423
<v Speaker 4>Getting crazy.</v>

1791
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:51.080
<v Speaker 4>You always associate salsa music with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman with like a dress.</v>

1792
01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:52.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like slit up the side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1793
01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:54.480
<v Speaker 4>and the way up to her hip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1794
01:22:54.481 --> 01:22:55.314
<v Speaker 4>I wish if I were efficient like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have learned to salsa dance </v>

1795
01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.160
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that efficient.</v>

1796
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:04.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even ice skate in your head.</v>

1797
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.843
<v Speaker 4>There's salsa dancing and then right </v>
<v Speaker 4>next to it on the shelf is ice skating </v>

1798
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:12.850
<v Speaker 4>seems to be something that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people know how to do.</v>

1799
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Not a lot of Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true of African ice skaters.</v>

1800
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:17.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what black people have,</v>

1801
01:23:17.991 --> 01:23:20.440
<v Speaker 4>haven't dominated hockey otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Able to take it over.</v>

1802
01:23:20.441 --> 01:23:21.274
<v Speaker 4>That shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm coming because ice skating like a </v>

1803
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:25.860
<v Speaker 4>fucking never learned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1804
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:27.420
<v Speaker 4>I can ice skate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1805
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:30.510
<v Speaker 4>I feel good now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My kids can but can.</v>

1806
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:34.180
<v Speaker 4>But like to me the sexiest women or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>women who were salsa dancing,</v>

1807
01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sweaty,</v>

1808
01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:38.163
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1809
01:23:40.331 --> 01:23:41.164
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's a party and I just love to be </v>

1816
01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:59.470
<v Speaker 4>No socks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could really stink after a while.</v>

1817
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get your fetal sweat and air and</v>

1818
01:24:01.711 --> 01:24:04.000
<v Speaker 4>it's disgusting and it's not as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1819
01:24:04.001 --> 01:24:04.780
<v Speaker 4>it's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1820
01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.613
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm lucky in that respect or I'm just </v>

1821
01:24:07.361 --> 01:24:09.500
<v Speaker 4>totally diluted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I.</v>

1822
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:14.590
<v Speaker 4>I think my body does instinct much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I may be wrong about that.</v>

1823
01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:18.340
<v Speaker 4>I may just have really friendly people </v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

1824
01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:21.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know how olfactory senses work,</v>

1825
01:24:21.611 --> 01:24:23.980
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They work on change.</v>

1826
01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:27.820
<v Speaker 4>They don't work on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't recognize like distinct smells</v>

1827
01:24:27.821 --> 01:24:28.654
<v Speaker 4>that last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a say if you're living in an area </v>

<v Speaker 4>The smell of baby shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1830
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:35.663
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily because baby shit's not </v>

1831
01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:38.284
<v Speaker 4>in front of you all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but things that are around you all the </v>

1832
01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:40.984
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your own funk or how your house </v>

1833
01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:42.930
<v Speaker 4>smells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your.</v>

1834
01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:44.970
<v Speaker 4>You become immune to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless there's like,</v>

1835
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:46.143
<v Speaker 4>like if you have a house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're at a cat pissing your </v>

1836
01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:50.060
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking my friend in bed.</v>

1837
01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:52.750
<v Speaker 4>Do you like walking around?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where the fuck is it?</v>

1838
01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.613
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm walking around like a God damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>dog trying to find out where my cat </v>

1839
01:24:55.631 --> 01:24:56.464
<v Speaker 4>pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when I used to have a carpet </v>

1840
01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:01.450
<v Speaker 4>grows because you never knew where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>pissed and then you never really totally</v>

1841
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:03.760
<v Speaker 4>got it out of there and then they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>you never got it out of there.</v>

1842
01:25:03.761 --> 01:25:08.761
<v Speaker 4>So they find that spot piano and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wretched a cat in college.</v>

1843
01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:17.040
<v Speaker 4>I'd moved into this shared apartment </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this woman and uh,</v>

1844
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:20.680
<v Speaker 4>she had this cat named Michael who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful cat,</v>

1845
01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:23.590
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big sort of whiskers and just a lovely,</v>

1846
01:25:23.591 --> 01:25:26.350
<v Speaker 4>beautiful of communism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1847
01:25:26.351 --> 01:25:27.184
<v Speaker 4>I think it was more like a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the cat would like get on a table </v>

1848
01:25:30.521 --> 01:25:31.354
<v Speaker 4>and he put his paws on your shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just rub his face and your face and </v>

1849
01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:34.991
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1850
01:25:34.991 --> 01:25:35.890
<v Speaker 4>what a great cat.</v>

1851
01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:36.723
<v Speaker 4>And then he would just freak out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like fucking face and scratchy and run </v>

1852
01:25:41.731 --> 01:25:42.370
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1853
01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:43.990
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this cat fucked right.</v>

1854
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Probably got acid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody fucking massive.</v>

1855
01:25:47.081 --> 01:25:47.920
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1856
01:25:47.921 --> 01:25:48.754
<v Speaker 4>because it was one of these hippie </v>
<v Speaker 4>houses where people are moving through </v>

1857
01:25:51.101 --> 01:25:53.330
<v Speaker 4>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking hippies.</v>

1858
01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.680
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I ended up hooking up with this woman</v>

1859
01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.673
<v Speaker 4>and I remember one time we were in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>bed and we're having sex and the cat </v>

1860
01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:06.901
<v Speaker 4>walks in and he looks at me and he backs</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to my bookshelf and just show my love</v>

1861
01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:12.150
<v Speaker 4>for my well holding eye contact with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1862
01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.990
<v Speaker 4>that's disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1863
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.430
<v Speaker 4>I think he had a thing with this woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was.</v>

1864
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:17.421
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1865
01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:18.254
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just getting with her because he's </v>

1866
01:26:19.191 --> 01:26:20.360
<v Speaker 4>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he's spraying,</v>

1867
01:26:20.361 --> 01:26:21.470
<v Speaker 4>it's probably not fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1868
01:26:21.650 --> 01:26:22.770
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot.</v>

1869
01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:23.893
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to fix those cats because when </v>

1870
01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:28.880
<v Speaker 4>they walk in on you fucking they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get horny if freaks.</v>

1871
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially male cats that don't,</v>

1872
01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:33.080
<v Speaker 4>they don't get fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all spray.</v>

1873
01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:34.393
<v Speaker 4>All of them mean female cats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get into heat and they start </v>

1874
01:26:36.181 --> 01:26:41.060
<v Speaker 4>mowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sticking their ass up in the air.</v>

1875
01:26:41.170 --> 01:26:42.003
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told the story about my sexual </v>

1876
01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.520
<v Speaker 4>experience to see the animation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy did it that.</v>

1877
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:47.390
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

1878
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:48.320
<v Speaker 4>Who did it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which guy?</v>

1879
01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:50.360
<v Speaker 4>Name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

1880
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:54.020
<v Speaker 4>it's on youtube and it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So polly polly,</v>

1881
01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.040
<v Speaker 4>it's an animator in in Peru and he wrote</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

1882
01:26:58.041 --> 01:27:00.350
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not Peruvian but he's based there,</v>

1883
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:02.210
<v Speaker 4>but he wrote to me and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

1884
01:27:02.211 --> 01:27:04.500
<v Speaker 4>would you mind if I did an animation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>some store,</v>

1885
01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.290
<v Speaker 4>a story you tell in your podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1886
01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:06.921
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>

1887
01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:08.660
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need my permission.</v>

1888
01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:09.494
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he picked the one of me and you and </v>

1889
01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:13.034
<v Speaker 4>Duncan and I'm telling the story about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this cat and the pencil and the cats up </v>

1890
01:27:16.821 --> 01:27:17.990
<v Speaker 4>in the pencil and all this shit.</v>

1891
01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:19.131
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1892
01:27:19.131 --> 01:27:22.100
<v Speaker 4>you pick the one story like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really want the world.</v>

1893
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.180
<v Speaker 4>Like the Joe Rogan audience will get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My audience will get it,</v>

1894
01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:31.250
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know that like twitter </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe is gonna get it.</v>

1895
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:33.770
<v Speaker 4>So I feel bad because he put a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>work into it,</v>

1896
01:27:33.771 --> 01:27:36.140
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't really pushed to promote </v>
<v Speaker 4>it much.</v>

1897
01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:38.950
<v Speaker 4>But it's really what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think your,</v>

1898
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:42.440
<v Speaker 4>your fears are unfounded to think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the fuck the people don't have</v>

1899
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:44.000
<v Speaker 4>you come across.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're hilarious.</v>

1900
01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:45.650
<v Speaker 4>And the Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could find this thing.</v>

1901
01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.420
<v Speaker 4>It's called A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on my youtube channel.</v>

1902
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:51.303
<v Speaker 4>I remember the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something about if you just Google </v>

1903
01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:58.340
<v Speaker 4>Christopher Ryan fucks a cab with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pencil or does it?</v>

1904
01:27:58.370 --> 01:28:00.910
<v Speaker 4>I'd love to see what else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a catalyst and he,</v>

1905
01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:03.290
<v Speaker 4>before she got fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got to fix like right when she got</v>

1906
01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:03.620
<v Speaker 4>into heat.</v>

1907
01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:04.890
<v Speaker 4>But when you had pet her and she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1908
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:05.743
<v Speaker 4>lift her ass up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like as soon as you give her any </v>

1909
01:28:09.141 --> 01:28:13.280
<v Speaker 4>affection and then it'll be spanker they</v>
<v Speaker 4>love to get spanked to Jesus Christ.</v>

1910
01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:15.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a cat who would hold onto the sofa</v>

1911
01:28:15.351 --> 01:28:19.100
<v Speaker 4>and I'd spank or God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'd like fake spanker and she'd</v>

1912
01:28:19.101 --> 01:28:21.800
<v Speaker 4>fall off because she was already </v>
<v Speaker 4>compensating for it.</v>

1913
01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:24.573
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you were like beating her off by </v>

1914
01:28:25.701 --> 01:28:28.440
<v Speaker 4>spanking or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I basically write,</v>

1915
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:29.383
<v Speaker 4>I like to give animals pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And normally the way that expresses </v>

1916
01:28:33.531 --> 01:28:34.700
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in Spain,</v>

1917
01:28:34.701 --> 01:28:35.534
<v Speaker 4>in our apartment in span,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I built this whole cat world like I </v>

1918
01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:39.083
<v Speaker 4>built.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got this big piece of driftwood and I </v>

1919
01:28:41.061 --> 01:28:41.894
<v Speaker 4>wrapped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm climbing rope around it so they can </v>

1920
01:28:43.461 --> 01:28:44.294
<v Speaker 4>climb straight up this thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a series of shelves along the </v>

1921
01:28:47.241 --> 01:28:48.074
<v Speaker 4>ceiling so they jump around and they can</v>
<v Speaker 4>go all around the room and chase each </v>

1922
01:28:50.571 --> 01:28:52.400
<v Speaker 4>other and hang out up there.</v>

1923
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.233
<v Speaker 4>When you're having a party,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like up there just hanging out </v>

1924
01:28:54.741 --> 01:28:57.020
<v Speaker 4>watching people and because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1925
01:28:57.021 --> 01:28:58.530
<v Speaker 4>that's where they want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1926
01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.130
<v Speaker 4>And then on the terrorist I built this </v>
<v Speaker 4>big tree thing,</v>

1927
01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.093
<v Speaker 4>they go on and there's a hammock in it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the cats get in the hammock and </v>

1928
01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 4>swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I love seeing the animals happy,</v>

1929
01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:12.750
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe in a way my whole,</v>

1930
01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.613
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things I write are trying to make </v>

1931
01:29:14.791 --> 01:29:15.624
<v Speaker 4>people happy because what I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do is get people in their natural </v>

1932
01:29:17.941 --> 01:29:19.440
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm trying.</v>

1933
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:20.730
<v Speaker 4>This one I'm writing about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1934
01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:23.850
<v Speaker 4>And so with cats it's the same way I </v>
<v Speaker 4>want them to be.</v>

1935
01:29:23.851 --> 01:29:26.470
<v Speaker 4>I want them to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to create a jungle for them and a</v>

1936
01:29:26.471 --> 01:29:27.304
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's so cool because we had three </v>

1937
01:29:28.951 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 4>cats and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you build this world for them,</v>

1938
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 4>they leave you alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not like.</v>

1939
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:35.880
<v Speaker 4>People think cats are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1940
01:29:35.881 --> 01:29:37.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all pathetic.</v>

1941
01:29:37.111 --> 01:29:37.591
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1942
01:29:37.591 --> 01:29:41.160

1963
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:33.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm eight years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the seventies and a bridge party at</v>

<v Speaker 2>So there's no babysitter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They take a station wagon and love </v>
<v Speaker 2>American style,</v>

1966
01:30:42.511 --> 01:30:43.344
<v Speaker 2>the Brady bunch those days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anyone's old enough to remember that </v>

1967
01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:46.411
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

01:30:46.411 --> 01:30:47.270
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.233
<v Speaker 2>they put me in the basement in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family room and they say keep the door </v>

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1971
01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:56.850
<v Speaker 2>That means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it means the cat part.</v>

1972
01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:59.040
<v Speaker 2>So they've got the AC on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the door closed.</v>

1973
01:30:59.041 --> 01:31:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go down and watching TV and this is</v>

1974
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:03.623
<v Speaker 2>just like all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubbing her ass on my leg and just like </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1977
01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:16.050
<v Speaker 2>And I looked down and there's this </v>
<v Speaker 2>pencil on the table next to the sofa.</v>

1978
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:16.973
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

1980
01:31:21.091 --> 01:31:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this cat backs up on this.</v>

1981
01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:28.020
<v Speaker 2>So it starts fucking humping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reached me out the inside of her.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What happened was the pencil away </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was freaking me out and then </v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't recognize him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Not Matter.</v>

2026

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2027
01:33:48.581 --> 01:33:51.340
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about giving cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pleasure making animals.</v>

2028
01:33:51.341 --> 01:33:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Had a buddy of mine who used to jerk off</v>
<v Speaker 3>as rottweiler with his foot.</v>

2029
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.233
<v Speaker 3>He used to put his foot on his was dick </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would like rub it back and forth </v>

2030
01:33:58.391 --> 01:34:00.830
<v Speaker 3>and rottweiler would come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2031
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:05.230
<v Speaker 3>I told my girlfriend at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a long time ago and she was so mad.</v>

2032
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.370
<v Speaker 3>She was so disgusted like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking disgusting.</v>

2033
01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.660
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it disgusting?</v>

2034
01:34:10.661 --> 01:34:12.160
<v Speaker 3>The guys just beaten off his dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2035
01:34:12.161 --> 01:34:14.020
<v Speaker 3>the dog can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dog could do it.</v>

2036
01:34:14.021 --> 01:34:14.854
<v Speaker 3>He would do it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's like a friend talking like his </v>

2037
01:34:18.731 --> 01:34:21.130
<v Speaker 3>own balls pretty easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

2039
01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:24.730
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you needed more.</v>

2040
01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:27.790
<v Speaker 3>So my friend needs to beat them off with</v>
<v Speaker 3>his foot.</v>

2041
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:32.860
<v Speaker 3>His dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's like a female sex toy.</v>

2042
01:34:32.861 --> 01:34:35.380
<v Speaker 3>You can get the dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2044
01:34:37.661 --> 01:34:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Like a fleshlight for dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

2045
01:34:39.941 --> 01:34:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Keep them from helping your leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't they just make like a one of </v>

2057
01:35:12.351 --> 01:35:14.290
<v Speaker 3>them real dolls for a dog?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give it hair.</v>

2058
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Like the American Werewolf in London out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2059
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Something like that with a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't feel dirty.</v>

2060
01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Like he's got a flux of machine because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't put any,</v>

2061
01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:26.060
<v Speaker 3>any work whatsoever in the aesthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the dogs care?</v>

2062
01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:28.700
<v Speaker 3>They might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might feel better for them.</v>

2063
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:30.220
<v Speaker 3>They might get a little more excited if </v>
<v Speaker 3>fluidly.</v>

2064
01:35:30.221 --> 01:35:32.300
<v Speaker 3>A real dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could give it like a soundtrack.</v>

2065
01:35:32.301 --> 01:35:37.301
<v Speaker 3>A little while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just looking over shoulder please.</v>

2066
01:35:40.011 --> 01:35:41.290
<v Speaker 3>Please don't.</v>

2067
01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2068
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:48.350
<v Speaker 3>With the woman who jerked off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dolphin.</v>

2069
01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.253
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2070
01:35:49.670 --> 01:35:50.503
<v Speaker 3>what's fascinating about that story is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this woman was living with a young </v>

2071
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:57.110
<v Speaker 3>adolescent male dolphin in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>adolescent male.</v>

2072
01:35:57.111 --> 01:35:57.944
<v Speaker 3>Dolphin would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to get the dolphin to </v>

2073
01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:01.370
<v Speaker 3>talk in a flooded house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flooded house.</v>

2074
01:36:01.371 --> 01:36:02.204
<v Speaker 3>So she lived in a place where she would </v>
<v Speaker 3>like have waist high water everywhere </v>

2075
01:36:05.271 --> 01:36:07.400
<v Speaker 3>she went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the dolphin could swim freely through</v>

2076
01:36:07.401 --> 01:36:10.640
<v Speaker 3>the house and live with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the dolphin was horny all the time.</v>

2077
01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.300
<v Speaker 3>So he didn't want to do studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what she did was she beat him off and</v>

2078
01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:16.540
<v Speaker 3>when word got out that she beat off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphin,</v>

2079
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:20.520
<v Speaker 3>they canceled all the research is now </v>
<v Speaker 3>how I thought it.</v>

2080
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:22.160
<v Speaker 3>The research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2081
01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:24.150
<v Speaker 3>they got in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gunter,</v>

2082
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:27.920
<v Speaker 3>but recently because she talked about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently when she wrote a book about the</v>

2083
01:36:27.921 --> 01:36:28.754
<v Speaker 3>time I was working with John Lilly who </v>
<v Speaker 3>run to invent this sensory deprivation </v>

2084
01:36:32.211 --> 01:36:32.570
<v Speaker 3>tank.</v>

2085
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2086
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:33.743
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he had already been invented it </v>

2087
01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:35.353
<v Speaker 3>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on like one of the first </v>

2088
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:40.400
<v Speaker 3>iterations of it and he was also giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>assets dolphins.</v>

2089
01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:44.450
<v Speaker 3>So it might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of those things that led to</v>

2090
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:45.343
<v Speaker 3>them pulling the plug on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The research is either she was jerking </v>

2091
01:36:47.091 --> 01:36:49.520
<v Speaker 3>it off and they found out that they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>also.</v>

2092
01:36:49.521 --> 01:36:50.354
<v Speaker 3>I think the Defense Department was using</v>
<v Speaker 3>his research to train dolphins to kill </v>

2093
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:58.340
<v Speaker 3>in Vietnam and to plant bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide bombs and suicide bombers.</v>

2094
01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:00.620
<v Speaker 3>They would try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were training them to suicide bomb,</v>

2095
01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.980
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that they.</v>

2096
01:37:04.150 --> 01:37:06.440
<v Speaker 3>They felt like that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I guess.</v>

2097
01:37:06.441 --> 01:37:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Look man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were in war,</v>

2098
01:37:08.050 --> 01:37:10.640
<v Speaker 3>you were already deciding that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing people,</v>

2099
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:11.743
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of killing dolphins to kill </v>

2100
01:37:13.071 --> 01:37:13.904
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they didn't think of dolphins </v>

2101
01:37:16.761 --> 01:37:19.550
<v Speaker 3>the way we think of dolphins today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either like that.</v>

2102
01:37:19.690 --> 01:37:20.523
<v Speaker 3>That might be something that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military would still be interested in </v>

2103
01:37:22.071 --> 01:37:23.090
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2104
01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:25.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe they aren't doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just not telling us about it.</v>

2105
01:37:25.191 --> 01:37:27.920
<v Speaker 3>A lot of whales with all their sonar </v>
<v Speaker 3>testing.</v>

2106
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:28.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they do these intense sound </v>

2107
01:37:30.591 --> 01:37:35.591
<v Speaker 3>waves in the underwater and the whales </v>
<v Speaker 3>have very sensitive sound reception.</v>

2108
01:37:35.890 --> 01:37:36.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organize.</v>

2109
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:40.940
<v Speaker 3>So at fucking blast them and because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gives them like tinnitus or some shit,</v>

2110
01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:42.493
<v Speaker 3>like a rock band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lead singer of Ac dc can't do shows </v>

2111
01:37:45.111 --> 01:37:45.944
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pete Townsend really can't hear </v>

2112
01:37:48.651 --> 01:37:50.560
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pete Townsend's almost deaf too.</v>

2113
01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.420
<v Speaker 3>In depth for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2114
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:55.200
<v Speaker 3>the lead singer of AC DC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His ears are so fucked up.</v>

2115
01:37:55.201 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 3>He can't tour anymore.</v>

2116
01:37:57.060 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't go to concerts,</v>

2117
01:37:58.531 --> 01:37:59.280
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I.</v>

2118
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.040
<v Speaker 4>I've been to a few concerts recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I never.</v>

2119
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:02.874
<v Speaker 4>It's not a question of being old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear that getting older noise bothers </v>

2120
01:38:06.301 --> 01:38:07.134
<v Speaker 4>you more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I've always been annoyed by noise </v>

2121
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:10.643
<v Speaker 4>and especially where they're playing </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit so loud that it's distorting the </v>

2122
01:38:14.101 --> 01:38:16.400
<v Speaker 4>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like year.</v>

2123
01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.273
<v Speaker 4>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't sound good by being louder </v>

2124
01:38:19.981 --> 01:38:21.400
<v Speaker 4>is better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know.</v>

2125
01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.710
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2126
01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:24.510
<v Speaker 4>But there's a thing that people like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

2127
01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:28.410
<v Speaker 4>They like to know that they're really </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking party and man that's it.</v>

2128
01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:30.253
<v Speaker 4>Turn it up to 11 and I think those are </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that need to go to the </v>

2129
01:38:38.461 --> 01:38:39.880
<v Speaker 4>fucking gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heavy bag.</v>

2130
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.310
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2131
01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:42.233
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This keys back into me being a lazy </v>

2132
01:38:43.670 --> 01:38:46.370
<v Speaker 4>Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like moderate sound,</v>

2133
01:38:46.371 --> 01:38:48.210
<v Speaker 4>but I don't need it to all the way out.</v>

2134
01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.580
<v Speaker 4>Get something to beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fucks.</v>

2135
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>out to just see the joy.</v>

2141
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.630

<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

2210
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:49.990
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking epic,</v>

2211
01:41:49.991 --> 01:41:50.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2212
01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.660
<v Speaker 3>I think there's trump impressions right </v>
<v Speaker 3>up there.</v>

2213
01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really good.</v>

2214
01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:55.630
<v Speaker 3>It's really good and it's getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

2215
01:41:56.210 --> 01:41:59.230
<v Speaker 3>The more he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks more and more like him,</v>

2216
01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it say?</v>

2217
01:42:01.061 --> 01:42:01.894
<v Speaker 3>They're bad news for trump side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in the midst of a ratings </v>

2218
01:42:04.301 --> 01:42:05.740
<v Speaker 3>renaissance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it is,</v>

2219
01:42:05.741 --> 01:42:08.730
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2220
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:11.110
<v Speaker 3>the center live is like a show that goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>in cycles,</v>

2221
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:12.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have these cycles of greatness and </v>

2222
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:14.183
<v Speaker 3>then like to try to find themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe new people struggle a little </v>

2223
01:42:17.741 --> 01:42:19.270
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always something good there,</v>

2224
01:42:19.271 --> 01:42:23.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

2225
01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:26.170
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be insanely difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create a new show every week.</v>

2226
01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2227
01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:32.560
<v Speaker 3>dog eat dog environment and even like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look,</v>

2228
01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:35.770
<v Speaker 3>if you go back and look at videos from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the glory days,</v>

2229
01:42:35.771 --> 01:42:36.604
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Dan Akroyd days and John Belushi </v>

2230
01:42:38.351 --> 01:42:39.184
<v Speaker 3>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was still a lot of filler in </v>

2231
01:42:40.241 --> 01:42:40.450
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2232
01:42:40.450 --> 01:42:40.901
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2233
01:42:40.901 --> 01:42:43.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we remember the automatic and you know,</v>

2234
01:42:43.391 --> 01:42:44.590
<v Speaker 3>the good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great moments.</v>

2235
01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:46.780
<v Speaker 3>A Samurai John Belushi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sandra character.</v>

2236
01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't do that anymore.</v>

2237
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.610
<v Speaker 3>It'd be cultural appropriation that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't do.</v>

2238
01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:54.640
<v Speaker 3>You probably couldn't do the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were too wild and crazy guys.</v>

2239
01:42:54.641 --> 01:42:56.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were right.</v>

2240
01:42:56.830 --> 01:42:57.663
<v Speaker 3>They were white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were definitely foreign </v>

2241
01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.400
<v Speaker 3>because you do more at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you do bar out today?</v>

2242
01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:04.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was just a few years ago,</v>

2243
01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:07.270
<v Speaker 3>but it might be different if he tried it</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

2244
01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Incredibly racist and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2245
01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.600
<v Speaker 3>he's like an Orthodox Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>

2246
01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:16.450
<v Speaker 3>the comedian who does Bora.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is He really?</v>

2247
01:43:16.451 --> 01:43:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like a seriously religious,</v>

2248
01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honors this Shabat and all that kind of </v>

2249
01:43:22.121 --> 01:43:24.490
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serious Jewish practicing Jew.</v>

2250
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:29.790
<v Speaker 3>I forgot his real name is Ali g to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ali.</v>

2251
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Jesus' best work when he would interview</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and they didn't know who his leg.</v>

2252
01:43:34.810 --> 01:43:37.750
<v Speaker 3>He can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when he interviewed me,</v>

2253
01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:41.970
<v Speaker 3>he interviewed a Buzz Aldrin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explained humor to him.</v>

2254
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:43.813
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's explaining humor while he's in the </v>

2255
01:43:48.911 --> 01:43:50.830
<v Speaker 3>midst of a joke that he doesn't know is</v>

2256
01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:55.490
<v Speaker 4>for buzz or owned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2257
01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:58.100
<v Speaker 4>But you know who my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2258
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:01.310
<v Speaker 4>one of the few where he wasn't getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>on with Ralph Nader,</v>

2259
01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:04.640
<v Speaker 4>Ralph Nader just kind of went with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2260
01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 4>what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so allie is doing this whole thing where</v>

2261
01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:10.760
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about the environment </v>
<v Speaker 4>and global warming and he says,</v>

2262
01:44:10.761 --> 01:44:11.421
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2263
01:44:11.421 --> 01:44:16.010
<v Speaker 4>isn't a major cause of global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cow farts.</v>

2264
01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:18.260
<v Speaker 4>And so shouldn't we just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2265
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:21.740
<v Speaker 4>put balloons on cows and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets into this whole thing,</v>

2266
01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:22.574
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Ralph Nader is looking at them and </v>

2267
01:44:23.211 --> 01:44:27.320
<v Speaker 4>you can see when the balloons on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cows asses thing comes out.</v>

2268
01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:30.110
<v Speaker 4>Ralph Nader's like I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

2269
01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:34.250
<v Speaker 4>And so he just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he finished his talk and he says,</v>

2270
01:44:34.251 --> 01:44:34.821
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2271
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:35.654
<v Speaker 4>scientists have been working on that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's very hard to develop a valve </v>

2272
01:44:38.961 --> 01:44:40.870
<v Speaker 4>that perfectly fits a cow's ass hole.</v>

2273
01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:45.680
<v Speaker 4>And then it cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cuts.</v>

2274
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:48.020
<v Speaker 4>And then the next scene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like after commercial,</v>

2275
01:44:48.021 --> 01:44:48.854
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see algae and Ralph Nader wrapping </v>

2276
01:44:51.021 --> 01:44:52.240
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

2284
01:45:09.230 --> 01:45:10.063
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is stupid to do it this way.</v>

2294
01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:48.260
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>

2295
01:45:48.370 --> 01:45:51.760
<v Speaker 4>whenever someone's content gets played,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like anybody who owns this video,</v>

2296
01:45:51.850 --> 01:45:52.683
<v Speaker 4>we play their video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get pulled off of youtube and then </v>

2297
01:45:55.271 --> 01:45:58.210
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go to cut it out,</v>

2298
01:45:58.211 --> 01:45:59.440
<v Speaker 4>put it back up.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They want people to.</v>

2301
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:06.490
<v Speaker 4>But we've always tried to tell people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to that video.</v>

2302
01:46:06.491 --> 01:46:08.320
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're sending traffic their way.</v>

2303
01:46:08.321 --> 01:46:09.460
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's funny.</v>

2304
01:46:09.490 --> 01:46:11.140
<v Speaker 4>Go find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go find it in here.</v>

2305
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

2306
01:46:12.221 --> 01:46:13.750
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know Sacha Baron Cohen was </v>
<v Speaker 4>easy.</v>

2307
01:46:13.751 --> 01:46:16.450
<v Speaker 4>A practicing Orthodox Jew belief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

2308
01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:17.633
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

2309
01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:20.110
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting because you think of </v>
<v Speaker 4>comics is,</v>

2310
01:46:21.190 --> 01:46:22.720
<v Speaker 4>do you know other religious comics?</v>

2311
01:46:24.490 --> 01:46:27.700
<v Speaker 4>Because there's an irreverent and </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual irreverence.</v>

2312
01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:30.010
<v Speaker 4>There are a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are a few.</v>

2313
01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:33.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim Gaffigan's Catholic.</v>

2314
01:46:33.250 --> 01:46:35.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2315
01:46:35.741 --> 01:46:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a shtick.</v>

2316
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:40.480
<v Speaker 4>I think he's actually a practicing </v>
<v Speaker 4>Catholic.</v>

2317
01:46:41.230 --> 01:46:42.990
<v Speaker 4>How much of that is legit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2318
01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's sort of identity.</v>

2319
01:46:45.191 --> 01:46:46.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just.</v>

2320
01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:49.060
<v Speaker 4>I just mean like he's the family man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He definitely is.</v>

2321
01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:51.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>

2322
01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.160
<v Speaker 4>Is this him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sacha Baron Cohen says,</v>

2323
01:46:53.161 --> 01:46:53.994
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say I'm a religious man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm proud of my Jewish identity and </v>

2324
01:46:57.451 --> 01:46:58.284
<v Speaker 4>there are certain things I do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>customs I keep tries to keep kosher and </v>

2325
01:47:03.241 --> 01:47:06.210
<v Speaker 4>attend synagogue about twice a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He tries to keep kosher,</v>

2326
01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:08.910
<v Speaker 4>but he's not saying he's really wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>say he's a religious Jew,</v>

2327
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:11.690
<v Speaker 4>but he tries to keep kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>

2328
01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:12.853
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like he's halfway in one foot </v>

2329
01:47:14.911 --> 01:47:16.020
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one foot out.</v>

2330
01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:16.873
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta think about the movies he </v>

2331
01:47:17.941 --> 01:47:18.600
<v Speaker 4>makes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

2332
01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:20.880
<v Speaker 4>you can only be so religious and made </v>
<v Speaker 4>those movies.</v>

2333
01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:21.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2334
01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:23.720
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2335
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:26.010
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing about comics thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently.</v>

2336
01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:30.450
<v Speaker 4>A Saturday I was at j Dot Johansen's </v>
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

2337
01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:33.420
<v Speaker 4>He does this cajun cooking every </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christmas.</v>

2338
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:36.450
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was there and there was a guy,</v>

2339
01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:42.650
<v Speaker 4>a Haney Comic Lustiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alan Haney,</v>

2340
01:47:45.450 --> 01:47:48.590
<v Speaker 4>Havey Havey Havey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2341
01:47:48.810 --> 01:47:51.180
<v Speaker 4>who I recognize from mad men and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2342
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:53.400
<v Speaker 4>and then since I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him everywhere.</v>

2343
01:47:53.401 --> 01:47:54.234
<v Speaker 4>He's on that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a man in the high castle and all these </v>

2344
01:47:56.730 --> 01:47:57.720
<v Speaker 4>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

2345
01:47:57.721 --> 01:48:00.270
<v Speaker 4>so we're there and we're talking and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about this thing.</v>

2346
01:48:00.271 --> 01:48:02.340
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the stan hope by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

2347
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.233
<v Speaker 4>I didn't finish that cliffhanger thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if someone wants to listen to </v>

2348
01:48:07.201 --> 01:48:09.870
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go check those two episodes out.</v>

2349
01:48:09.871 --> 01:48:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Do you go to the names of the episode </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the cliff cliff hangers?</v>

2350
01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:12.893
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2351
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:16.020
<v Speaker 4>but it's very intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very intense.</v>

2352
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're talking about this and I said,</v>

2353
01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:21.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you guys seen this movie,</v>

2354
01:48:21.151 --> 01:48:21.984
<v Speaker 4>the aristocrats?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's really about how comics </v>

2355
01:48:24.421 --> 01:48:25.710
<v Speaker 4>think differently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2356
01:48:25.711 --> 01:48:28.080
<v Speaker 4>like how nothing is offensive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

2357
01:48:28.081 --> 01:48:28.500
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2358
01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.810
<v Speaker 4>that's a great movie and that really </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets to it and you know,</v>

2359
01:48:30.811 --> 01:48:31.644
<v Speaker 4>whatever the conversation continues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I go home and a couple of days </v>

2360
01:48:34.321 --> 01:48:35.154
<v Speaker 4>later I'm sitting there and I had a copy</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the aristocrats and I haven't seen </v>

2361
01:48:38.161 --> 01:48:39.570
<v Speaker 4>that since it came out and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to watch it.</v>

2362
01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:40.673
<v Speaker 4>So I watched the aristocrats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're both in the fucking movie and </v>

2363
01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:46.630
<v Speaker 4>neither one of them says anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2364
01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:48.073
<v Speaker 4>So it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this la thing where everything's </v>

2365
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:53.910
<v Speaker 4>the opposite of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of what I consider normal.</v>

2366
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:55.133
<v Speaker 4>So in la I thought about this a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was so shocking to me that </v>

2367
01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.360
<v Speaker 4>they were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

2368
01:49:00.361 --> 01:49:02.050
<v Speaker 4>it's a great film and then I want you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2369
01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:03.950
<v Speaker 4>there they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2370
01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.700
<v Speaker 4>How do you not say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2371
01:49:05.701 --> 01:49:08.310
<v Speaker 4>we're in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you not say that?</v>

2372
01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:13.850
<v Speaker 4>It can only be that in la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like name dropping is so uncool.</v>

2373
01:49:15.690 --> 01:49:20.330
<v Speaker 4>That cool becomes what you don't say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2374
01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.780
<v Speaker 4>that definitely could be it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>people see famous people all the time in</v>

2375
01:49:24.781 --> 01:49:26.030
<v Speaker 4>la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like if you're like,</v>

2376
01:49:26.031 --> 01:49:27.870
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he saw Joe Rogan in the supermarket.</v>

2377
01:49:27.871 --> 01:49:28.461
<v Speaker 4>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2378
01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:29.041
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2379
01:49:29.041 --> 01:49:29.874
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could also be that some people don't </v>

2380
01:49:31.201 --> 01:49:34.410
<v Speaker 4>like talking about their work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people,</v>

2381
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:35.303
<v Speaker 4>some people avoid talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>especially talking about the work of </v>

2382
01:49:37.930 --> 01:49:40.050
<v Speaker 4>standup when there did not talk to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>standup.</v>

2383
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:42.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I do that really?</v>

2384
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:43.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2385
01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:44.513
<v Speaker 4>So you would just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't mention that you were in </v>

2386
01:49:46.231 --> 01:49:46.950
<v Speaker 4>the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2387
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:48.200
<v Speaker 4>I get away with not mentioning</v>

2388
01:49:48.210 --> 01:49:51.810
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might just scared out of their cars.</v>

<v Speaker 1>questions because UFC just sold for some</v>

2403

<v Speaker 1>astronomical for billion dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is figure.</v>

2404
01:50:31.890 --> 01:50:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2405
01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:34.840
<v Speaker 1>so everybody wants to talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it like with the new owners?</v>

2406
01:50:34.841 --> 01:50:36.030
<v Speaker 1>What's the EU?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2407
01:50:36.031 --> 01:50:37.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta go gotta go.</v>

2408
01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.710
<v Speaker 1>You become like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that you're,</v>

2409
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:44.770
<v Speaker 1>you're instead of having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people like you're interviewing you</v>

2410
01:50:44.850 --> 01:50:45.430
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2411
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:48.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not coming out on TV or something.</v>

2412
01:50:48.670 --> 01:50:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2413
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:50.611
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2414
01:50:50.611 --> 01:50:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>my work detail in issues.</v>

2415
01:50:55.571 --> 01:51:00.571
<v Speaker 1>Like what's it like working with my new </v>
<v Speaker 1>bosses who gives a shit?</v>

2416
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:05.380
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you compartmentalize a lot?</v>

2417
01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:06.243
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there the UFC part of your life and </v>

2418
01:51:07.421 --> 01:51:10.690
<v Speaker 1>there's the standup part of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has to be the UFC because I don't</v>

2419
01:51:10.691 --> 01:51:11.800
<v Speaker 1>swear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I very,</v>

2420
01:51:11.801 --> 01:51:14.160
<v Speaker 1>very rarely like say shit or is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard?</v>

2421
01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:15.371
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2422
01:51:15.371 --> 01:51:16.600
<v Speaker 1>It's all about her heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2423
01:51:16.601 --> 01:51:17.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2424
01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's necessary.</v>

2425
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:20.143
<v Speaker 1>They don't like what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to keep [inaudible] you're used </v>

2426
01:51:23.111 --> 01:51:25.060
<v Speaker 1>to talking on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

2427
01:51:25.210 --> 01:51:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it bother you?</v>

2428
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Didn't think you meant that even </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult?</v>

2429
01:51:31.090 --> 01:51:31.923
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not difficult because it is a </v>

2430
01:51:33.041 --> 01:51:33.874
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different mindset because I'm </v>

2431
01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.670
<v Speaker 1>never trying to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2432
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:40.780
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when like Dennis Miller </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to host Monday night football?</v>

2433
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:41.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it for a little bit because he </v>

2434
01:51:43.891 --> 01:51:44.724
<v Speaker 1>was trying to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was cracking jokes intersect and I </v>

2435
01:51:46.961 --> 01:51:48.790
<v Speaker 1>remember remembering that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2436
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:49.793
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't even watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember people were like really </v>

2437
01:51:51.311 --> 01:51:54.400
<v Speaker 1>pissed at Dennis Miller and I thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and I was like,</v>

2438
01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:55.293
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that and I'm not gonna do </v>

2439
01:51:56.741 --> 01:51:58.360
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like he,</v>

2440
01:51:58.361 --> 01:51:59.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis is a joke writer.</v>

2441
01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:00.850
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>

2442
01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.730
<v Speaker 1>he's a joke teller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2443
01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I have bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2444
01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:07.300
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a different kind of comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first place,</v>

2445
01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:08.373
<v Speaker 1>but then on top of that it's like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's going on to me doesn't </v>

2446
01:52:12.491 --> 01:52:14.550
<v Speaker 1>require much of me.</v>

2447
01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:17.360
<v Speaker 1>What it requires is me to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2448
01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:18.423
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't require personality or </v>

2449
01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:21.553
<v Speaker 1>flay or senses of humor or a unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view other than unless I </v>

2450
01:52:25.481 --> 01:52:26.314
<v Speaker 1>recognize something like a pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's happening at a fight that allows </v>

2451
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:29.883
<v Speaker 1>the people at home to enjoy it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it allows the person who's fighting </v>

2452
01:52:34.421 --> 01:52:38.740
<v Speaker 1>the two people that are fighting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it represents them in an honorable way.</v>

2453
01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:39.893
<v Speaker 1>So that's my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm trying to do when I'm </v>

2454
01:52:41.441 --> 01:52:42.274
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to do my best to give </v>

2455
01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:47.690
<v Speaker 1>justice to what I'm seeing and to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great job with that.</v>

2456
01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into UFC.</v>

2457
01:52:49.851 --> 01:52:52.970
<v Speaker 1>I've started watching it since I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with you,</v>

2458
01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:53.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've gotten to know some of the </v>

2459
01:52:55.581 --> 01:52:58.710
<v Speaker 1>personalities and I've watched the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronda rousey thing and the,</v>

2460
01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:00.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

2461
01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Irish guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor.</v>

2462
01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:03.960
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2463
01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

2464
01:53:05.081 --> 01:53:09.290
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty compelling and I think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a very good job of that.</v>

2465
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Your ego isn't in play at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2466
01:53:12.951 --> 01:53:16.400
<v Speaker 1>it can't be just reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2467
01:53:16.401 --> 01:53:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I try as much as possible to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of it.</v>

2468
01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking because I want to.</v>

2469
01:53:21.051 --> 01:53:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm constantly trying to stay on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball,</v>

2470
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:25.490
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at my best I'm just doing it,</v>

2471
01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I have to be just tuned in,</v>

2472
01:53:28.791 --> 01:53:31.010
<v Speaker 1>well rested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fed,</v>

2473
01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.870
<v Speaker 1>hyped up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to go.</v>

2474
01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:33.733
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's a six hour thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I sit down for six hours and </v>

2475
01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:41.030
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always at least 10 fights.</v>

2476
01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.550
<v Speaker 1>It's usually 11 or 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do all?</v>

2477
01:53:43.590 --> 01:53:44.423
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of all of them bring you in for the </v>

2478
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:47.030
<v Speaker 1>last few?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2479
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.863
<v Speaker 1>actually like doing it that way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is I get warmed up so I do </v>

2480
01:53:50.661 --> 01:53:53.390
<v Speaker 1>like the first one because like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes fighting so crazy.</v>

2481
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:54.380
<v Speaker 1>You have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2482
01:53:54.381 --> 01:53:55.460
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fight going on,</v>

2483
01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:56.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're sitting in.</v>

2484
01:53:56.781 --> 01:54:00.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean even though I've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've called at least a thousand fights,</v>

2485
01:54:00.951 --> 01:54:04.360
<v Speaker 1>probably closer to 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many actual fights have</v>

2486
01:54:04.361 --> 01:54:06.710
<v Speaker 1>been in front of while doing comedy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary rather,</v>

2487
01:54:06.711 --> 01:54:07.544
<v Speaker 1>but it's at least a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's probably like 1500 or </v>

2488
01:54:09.681 --> 01:54:10.514
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even though that's the case to this </v>

2489
01:54:12.831 --> 01:54:14.180
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when one starts,</v>

2490
01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2491
01:54:16.281 --> 01:54:17.114
<v Speaker 1>this is the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's going on by the fifth </v>

2492
01:54:18.921 --> 01:54:19.754
<v Speaker 1>fight of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally in the groove and I'm just </v>

2493
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:24.500
<v Speaker 1>laser focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated on the action,</v>

2494
01:54:24.501 --> 01:54:25.334
<v Speaker 1>trying to pick the right words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to describe it in the right way </v>

2495
01:54:27.741 --> 01:54:32.741
<v Speaker 1>and trying to give that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give that perspective to someone at home</v>

2496
01:54:32.991 --> 01:54:35.130
<v Speaker 1>that might not be seeing something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be saying.</v>

2497
01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially all the.</v>

2498
01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:39.350
<v Speaker 1>The wrestling grappling techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big part of it.</v>

2499
01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:40.393
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are used to seeing boxing and </v>

2500
01:54:42.191 --> 01:54:44.360
<v Speaker 1>they dealt with an upper cut is or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book or whatever,</v>

2501
01:54:44.361 --> 01:54:45.920
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get on the ground,</v>

2502
01:54:45.921 --> 01:54:46.754
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're talking about the arm bar or </v>

2503
01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.570
<v Speaker 1>this and that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2504
01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.420
<v Speaker 1>that's the most difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you below the stage or.</v>

2505
01:54:53.490 --> 01:54:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>below you see what's going on.</v>

2506
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:58.280
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2507
01:54:58.281 --> 01:54:59.114
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes I don't see like if the </v>

2508
01:55:00.771 --> 01:55:02.870
<v Speaker 1>referee stands in front of me and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to look at monitoring.</v>

2509
01:55:03.150 --> 01:55:03.983
<v Speaker 1>So I have two monitors in front of me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and give me two completely different </v>

2510
01:55:05.991 --> 01:55:08.920
<v Speaker 1>angles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get splattered by swabbing blood,</v>

2511
01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:11.070
<v Speaker 1>blood splatter on maybe before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2512
01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:11.953
<v Speaker 1>I've got into my mouth before one guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking to me and his nose was </v>

<v Speaker 3>important aspects of it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>healthier that way.</v>

2553
01:56:47.370 --> 01:56:48.203
<v Speaker 3>The Flora.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something I researched for this </v>

2554
01:56:49.951 --> 01:56:54.951
<v Speaker 3>book that this section is a big problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't get the vaginal bath,</v>

2555
01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:57.353
<v Speaker 3>have a skin flora and also intestinal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave actually rubbed vaginal like </v>

2556
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:03.623
<v Speaker 3>whatever that jazz is on baby post birth</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have given us area and sections </v>

2557
01:57:07.531 --> 01:57:08.364
<v Speaker 3>just to sort of that on them because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't it gets colonized by whatever </v>

2558
01:57:11.401 --> 01:57:12.234
<v Speaker 3>is floating around in the air and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want what's floating in the air </v>

2559

<v Speaker 3>it is a crazy thing.</v>

2562
01:57:17.341 --> 01:57:19.170
<v Speaker 3>You know that there's a process and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

2563
01:57:19.171 --> 01:57:20.004
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think there was some details of that </v>

2564
01:57:21.091 --> 01:57:22.170
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can.</v>

2565

<v Speaker 3>It retains its 100 percent of the last </v>

2571
01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:38.353
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a circle.</v>

2581
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:07.620

<v Speaker 3>You know the weirdest one is a Hyena.</v>

2582
01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:09.930
<v Speaker 3>The hyena that gives birth out of that </v>

2586
01:58:18.450 --> 01:58:20.730
<v Speaker 3>they're bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's fucked up about them.</v>

2587
01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:21.923
<v Speaker 3>They have a baby out of that thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they ride the mail and try to fuck </v>

<v Speaker 3>them with that fake Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird animal.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We're so lucky we don't have been here </v>

2590

<v Speaker 3>since I saw you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you do over there?</v>

<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>

2593
01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:41.560
<v Speaker 3>and then I was in southern Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a 10 day safari.</v>

2594
01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:44.740
<v Speaker 4>Botswana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was cool.</v>

2598
01:58:50.931 --> 01:58:51.764
<v Speaker 4>It was just wild dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Safaris who do this sort of like a low </v>

2599
01:58:54.531 --> 01:58:55.364
<v Speaker 4>budget,</v>

2602
01:59:02.961 --> 01:59:03.794
<v Speaker 4>like see all of southern Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was dumb because you're just </v>

2603
01:59:07.311 --> 01:59:10.400
<v Speaker 4>sitting in a van most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of shots did you have to get?</v>

2604
01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:12.800
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get any shots for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2605
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:13.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2606
01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:16.670
<v Speaker 4>there's no yellow fever there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some malaria,</v>

2607
01:59:16.671 --> 01:59:20.780
<v Speaker 4>but I've been in lots of places with </v>
<v Speaker 4>malaria and I just avoid mosquitoes.</v>

2608
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:22.490
<v Speaker 4>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>

2615
01:59:33.190 --> 01:59:35.060

01:59:55.770 --> 01:59:56.603
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing it for years when I was </v>

2629
01:59:57.621 --> 02:00:01.070
<v Speaker 4>on the road backpack and in places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tropical places.</v>

2630
02:00:01.071 --> 02:00:01.904
<v Speaker 4>I was eating raw garlic every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really good for your </v>

2631
02:00:03.651 --> 02:00:06.740
<v Speaker 4>intestines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your intestinal flora and all that.</v>

2632
02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:11.120
<v Speaker 4>But your skin smells like garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start sweating it out right away.</v>

2633
02:00:11.150 --> 02:00:12.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I smell like garlic all the time.</v>

2634
02:00:12.381 --> 02:00:13.530
<v Speaker 4>People Complain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2635
02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I love the smell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it too,</v>

2636
02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:16.760
<v Speaker 4>but it's not good on your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2637
02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:17.810
<v Speaker 4>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2638
02:00:17.811 --> 02:00:20.930
<v Speaker 4>what what you do is you chop it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it,</v>

2639
02:00:20.931 --> 02:00:23.210
<v Speaker 4>throw it in your mouth and drink it down</v>
<v Speaker 4>with water.</v>

2640
02:00:23.211 --> 02:00:25.040
<v Speaker 4>You don't chew it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I chew chewing.</v>

2641
02:00:25.041 --> 02:00:27.350
<v Speaker 4>It's what gives you the breadth because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets in your teeth.</v>

2642
02:00:27.650 --> 02:00:32.510
<v Speaker 4>So if you take it like pills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll get the garlic belch when you get</v>

2643
02:00:32.511 --> 02:00:34.630
<v Speaker 4>the garlic skin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't get the garlic breath.</v>

2644
02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:35.570
<v Speaker 4>I would feel like come</v>

2645
02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>cheating because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2646
02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:38.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of a glutton for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable moments when you know </v>

2647
02:00:40.351 --> 02:00:41.184
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something good like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chomping down the garlic and you feel </v>

2648
02:00:43.711 --> 02:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>those juices hit your tongue and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2649
02:00:45.601 --> 02:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel out,</v>

2650
02:00:47.911 --> 02:00:52.911
<v Speaker 1>your nose starts opening up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mix it with some fresh ginger.</v>

2651
02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I just throw it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2652
02:00:54.271 --> 02:00:55.104
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean anytime there's any feeling at </v>

2653
02:00:57.361 --> 02:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>all of stomach disease disease where if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad,</v>

2654
02:01:01.861 --> 02:01:02.694
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I'm a little rundown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just choked down a bunch of cloves of </v>

2655
02:01:05.131 --> 02:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>garlic the other day I did it and it hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>me so hard.</v>

2656
02:01:08.221 --> 02:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I had to take a knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2657
02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>aw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as it was going down,</v>

2658
02:01:13.141 --> 02:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2659
02:01:14.190 --> 02:01:15.140
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could have stood up.</v>

2660
02:01:15.150 --> 02:01:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to sit down for dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes like wow,</v>

2661
02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>take a knee or praising the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goodness.</v>

2662
02:01:22.710 --> 02:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing to my insides?</v>

2663
02:01:25.110 --> 02:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I had a horrendous stomach virus right </v>
<v Speaker 1>around new years.</v>

2664
02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I went through my New Year's Eve show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced I was going to shit myself.</v>

2665
02:01:34.590 --> 02:01:35.423
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be a point in this show </v>

2666
02:01:36.901 --> 02:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>where I'm just going to have to shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

2667
02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:40.910
<v Speaker 1>And I thought about it all day before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

2668
02:01:40.911 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't eat anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything all day.</v>

2669
02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Like from the moment I woke up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment I went to bed.</v>

2670
02:01:46.221 --> 02:01:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was having broken fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrant experiences in the toilet.</v>

2671
02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:51.281
<v Speaker 1>Liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2672
02:01:51.281 --> 02:01:55.040
<v Speaker 1>We were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is all this coming from?</v>

2673
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

2674
02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I was saying,</v>

2675
02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was below anatomy.</v>

2676
02:02:01.191 --> 02:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Something inside of me was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever it was was terrible.</v>

2677
02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:06.073
<v Speaker 1>I had these farts that were they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they smelled like fermented fruit in </v>

2678
02:02:11.271 --> 02:02:12.104
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like death mixed with this fermented </v>

2679
02:02:14.751 --> 02:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>sulfur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2680
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:19.340
<v Speaker 1>like the most rotten meat you could ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut.</v>

2681
02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Like if you opened up like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fridgerator and the power had gone off</v>

2682
02:02:22.641 --> 02:02:23.474
<v Speaker 1>while you were on vacation and came back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was some hamburger meat that </v>

2683
02:02:25.791 --> 02:02:29.240
<v Speaker 1>was rotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It smelled like that and like,</v>

2684
02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>like sulfur and like a sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a vinegary,</v>

2685
02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>almost like a fermented sort of a smell </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2686
02:02:39.651 --> 02:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>It was getting belches were you getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold?</v>

2687
02:02:43.650 --> 02:02:46.700
<v Speaker 1>It was all going on in some of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach because I wasn't eating much and</v>

2688
02:02:46.701 --> 02:02:48.800
<v Speaker 1>it was something that went around </v>
<v Speaker 1>through my whole house.</v>

2689
02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my littlest daughter got.</v>

2690
02:02:51.130 --> 02:02:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't know what she was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

2691
02:02:52.761 --> 02:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>but she was just constantly complaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>about her stomach being really awful for</v>

2692
02:02:56.301 --> 02:02:57.134
<v Speaker 1>like a whole week we were skiing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aspen and that's when it kicked in and </v>

2693
02:03:00.561 --> 02:03:03.080
<v Speaker 1>when I got back I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

2694
02:03:03.081 --> 02:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>like this is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you.</v>

2695
02:03:06.590 --> 02:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had an event on stage now?</v>

2696
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Like a wet fart or something or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no I haven't,</v>

2697
02:03:11.661 --> 02:03:14.240
<v Speaker 1>but interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new law that just got.</v>

2698
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be proposed.</v>

2699
02:03:15.621 --> 02:03:19.610
<v Speaker 1>A new rule got proposed for the unified </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of mixed martial arts where if you</v>

2700
02:03:19.611 --> 02:03:21.230
<v Speaker 1>shit yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stopped the fight,</v>

2701
02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:25.340
<v Speaker 1>which has happened before because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit themselves,</v>

2702
02:03:25.410 --> 02:03:28.970
<v Speaker 1>like during the middle of a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like loss of sphincter control.</v>

2703
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you got to go like sometimes </v>

2704
02:03:31.551 --> 02:03:32.384
<v Speaker 1>it's diarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes kick you in the fucking gut </v>

2705
02:03:34.281 --> 02:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>and just blast it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The back,</v>

2706
02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:36.613
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy named Michael </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who was a very good fighter </v>

2707
02:03:38.841 --> 02:03:43.100
<v Speaker 1>and he was fighting biennials Douche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

2708
02:03:43.101 --> 02:03:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the fight was.</v>

2709
02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:45.493
<v Speaker 1>And Benito diary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a because I remember is a big </v>

2710
02:03:46.731 --> 02:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>victory for him because he choked </v>
<v Speaker 1>biennials Dario out,</v>

2711
02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:53.570
<v Speaker 1>which was a giant because Dario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like super respected Jujitsu,</v>

2712
02:03:53.571 --> 02:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>black belt and Michael Chester as he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the octagon,</v>

2713
02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:57.620
<v Speaker 1>looked over and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2714
02:03:57.710 --> 02:04:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I might shit my pants because I might </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit my pants.</v>

2715
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:01.371
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2716
02:04:01.371 --> 02:04:02.270
<v Speaker 1>While the fights going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2717
02:04:02.271 --> 02:04:03.470
<v Speaker 1>seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2718
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>took my headphones off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2719
02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:05.540
<v Speaker 1>seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2720
02:04:05.541 --> 02:04:06.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to shit my pants.</v>

2721
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:08.120
<v Speaker 1>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2722
02:04:08.121 --> 02:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I know I sound like I'm holding this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of my head.</v>

2723
02:04:10.491 --> 02:04:11.324
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely shouldn't bring it up </v>

2724
02:04:12.231 --> 02:04:15.770
<v Speaker 1>unless it becomes an issue because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want the public to dwell on that.</v>

2725
02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I want them to enjoy this great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he got through without shitting</v>

2726
02:04:18.771 --> 02:04:19.604
<v Speaker 1>himself and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2727
02:04:19.610 --> 02:04:21.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked him after like off Mike,</v>

2728
02:04:21.531 --> 02:04:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you almost treat yourself?</v>

2729
02:04:22.491 --> 02:04:23.324
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2730
02:04:23.690 --> 02:04:24.471
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came out here.</v>

2731
02:04:24.471 --> 02:04:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I was convinced I was going to shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

2732
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:27.163
<v Speaker 1>I used to get like before I would go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a TV show or do a big public speaking </v>

2733
02:04:31.521 --> 02:04:33.590
<v Speaker 1>thing where they're going to be a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people there.</v>

2734
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:34.603
<v Speaker 1>I would like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes before I was supposed to go </v>

2735
02:04:37.441 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd</v>

2736
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:39.480
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to take a dump.</v>

2737
02:04:39.570 --> 02:04:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Like I need to do it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've taken a few dumps here.</v>

2738
02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more relaxed now.</v>

2739
02:04:45.570 --> 02:04:48.000
<v Speaker 3>It's what it's for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's a,</v>

2740
02:04:48.001 --> 02:04:49.240
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2741
02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:51.420
<v Speaker 3>fight or flight thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think animals get that too.</v>

2742
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:52.141
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2743
02:04:52.141 --> 02:04:54.180
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get my shit together.</v>

2744
02:04:54.181 --> 02:04:56.950
<v Speaker 3>Literally get it out of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm like,</v>

2745
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:58.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know there was.</v>

2746
02:04:58.410 --> 02:05:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also your body does not want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to waste any resources dealing with that</v>

2747
02:05:02.690 --> 02:05:05.570
<v Speaker 3>because it feels like there's like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe about to take price.</v>

2748
02:05:05.970 --> 02:05:06.803
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of these two bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these giant bears and it was in that </v>

2749
02:05:10.711 --> 02:05:12.930
<v Speaker 3>movie grizzly man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're crazy dude,</v>

2750
02:05:12.931 --> 02:05:13.764
<v Speaker 3>that song movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these two bears are fighting and </v>

2751
02:05:18.091 --> 02:05:21.390
<v Speaker 3>while they're fighting they start </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitting because their bodies just like,</v>

2752
02:05:21.391 --> 02:05:22.410
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever this says,</v>

2753
02:05:22.411 --> 02:05:23.520
<v Speaker 3>get it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it out.</v>

2754
02:05:23.710 --> 02:05:25.530
<v Speaker 3>We're going to war here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not practicing.</v>

2755
02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2756
02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:27.113
<v Speaker 3>no thought whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And no resources drawn away from the </v>

2757
02:05:30.181 --> 02:05:33.300
<v Speaker 3>muscles to process the food because have</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever done that?</v>

2758
02:05:33.301 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 3>Like eating a big meal and try to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2759
02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I never tried to work out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you did,</v>

2760
02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:42.570
<v Speaker 3>you got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No energy,</v>

2761
02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:44.970
<v Speaker 3>no energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating because it's like,</v>

2762
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:47.970
<v Speaker 3>like it's almost like if you were a pie </v>
<v Speaker 3>chart,</v>

2763
02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:51.480
<v Speaker 3>you could see there's a segment of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>chart that is now missing.</v>

2764
02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:54.150
<v Speaker 3>You can kind of do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can kind of work out,</v>

2765
02:05:54.450 --> 02:05:57.600
<v Speaker 3>but you definitely can't run a marathon </v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything crazy.</v>

2766
02:05:57.601 --> 02:05:58.141
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2767
02:05:58.141 --> 02:05:58.974
<v Speaker 3>if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be hurting all the fucking Wim </v>

2768
02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:01.720
<v Speaker 3>Hoff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you've been on your show a bunch of </v>

2770
02:06:03.481 --> 02:06:04.314
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hung out with him for like a week and </v>

2771
02:06:05.281 --> 02:06:09.480
<v Speaker 3>the Pyrenees and went up to his place in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holland and like sort of became friends.</v>

2772
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:10.663
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an example of what I'm talking </v>

2773

<v Speaker 3>I want to know these people,</v>

2774
02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:15.120

2775
02:06:15.121 --> 02:06:15.601

2778
02:06:18.021 --> 02:06:20.130

2782
02:06:24.661 --> 02:06:27.060
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't a big flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

2783
02:06:27.450 --> 02:06:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to him about it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's running all these marathons in</v>

2784
02:06:30.211 --> 02:06:33.520
<v Speaker 3>the fucking desert with no water and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Arctic and you know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he runs marathons.</v>

2787
02:06:38.401 --> 02:06:40.380
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't run because I hate running.</v>

2788
02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2789
02:06:41.521 --> 02:06:42.354
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you run a marathon if you don't </v>

2790
02:06:43.441 --> 02:06:44.100
<v Speaker 3>train?</v>

2791
02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:44.491
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2792
02:06:44.491 --> 02:06:47.280
<v Speaker 3>it's just the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2793
02:06:47.281 --> 02:06:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran a five k and I was ready to die,</v>

2794
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:52.343
<v Speaker 3>run up the fucking driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I about her brother and I don't run and </v>

2795
02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:57.840
<v Speaker 3>I ran a five k and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2796
02:06:57.841 --> 02:06:59.550
<v Speaker 3>this is actually difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2797
02:06:59.551 --> 02:07:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm in great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2798
02:07:00.591 --> 02:07:01.560
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be able to do this.</v>

2799
02:07:01.561 --> 02:07:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I work out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2800
02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:03.714
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to go on this run is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be just a thing I do because </v>

2801
02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:09.690
<v Speaker 3>we're not used to using those muscles in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

2802
02:07:09.691 --> 02:07:10.524
<v Speaker 3>Or was it was was his cardiopulmonary </v>
<v Speaker 3>waffle covered with peanut butter and </v>

2803
02:07:15.571 --> 02:07:18.030
<v Speaker 3>then covered with maple syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave myself an excuse.</v>

2804
02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:19.063
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to run this crazy race car </v>

2805
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:21.623
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my body's just not used to eating </v>

2806
02:07:23.611 --> 02:07:24.444
<v Speaker 3>that nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think it had shut down production </v>

2807
02:07:27.181 --> 02:07:28.014
<v Speaker 3>of a lot of key ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was definitely that feeling like </v>

2808
02:07:31.730 --> 02:07:32.563
<v Speaker 3>when I was running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could feel like offices from them </v>

2809
02:07:35.550 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 3>waffle coming</v>

2810
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:37.650
<v Speaker 4>up my throat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can taste it,</v>

2811
02:07:37.670 --> 02:07:40.180
<v Speaker 4>kick it in the peanut butter and syrup </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

2812
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:43.780
<v Speaker 4>So much sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's all just,</v>

2813
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your feet,</v>

2814
02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:47.830
<v Speaker 4>your feet aren't used to running on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was on concrete.</v>

2815
02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.460
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is weird in the shocks </v>
<v Speaker 4>on your knees and your ankles.</v>

2816
02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:52.840
<v Speaker 4>You ever read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>born to run?</v>

2817
02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:54.370
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2818
02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:57.770
<v Speaker 4>but I do know the premise of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris and Doug Dogo.</v>

2819
02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:01.540
<v Speaker 4>It's about the way shoes running shoes </v>
<v Speaker 4>are developed and yeah,</v>

2820
02:08:01.541 --> 02:08:02.374
<v Speaker 4>and how our bodies are designed to run </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the balls of her feet and he goes </v>

2821
02:08:05.231 --> 02:08:10.110
<v Speaker 4>down in the lives with the Tarahumara </v>
<v Speaker 4>Indians in Mexico and the bank,</v>

2822
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:10.953
<v Speaker 4>they'll Kobe where I was in 1988,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was back there with those Indians </v>

2823
02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:15.873
<v Speaker 4>and they run into like really thin shoes</v>
<v Speaker 4>or barefoot barefoot or they make these </v>

2824
02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:21.530
<v Speaker 4>sandals out of the tire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2825
02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:23.860
<v Speaker 4>and it's just strapped on their foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a thing.</v>

2826
02:08:24.550 --> 02:08:26.110
<v Speaker 4>And they run forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2827
02:08:26.111 --> 02:08:26.944
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how the body's meant and I mean </v>

2828
02:08:28.541 --> 02:08:29.374
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're meant to use the foot as this </v>

2829
02:08:30.071 --> 02:08:31.360
<v Speaker 4>amazing shock absorber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2830
02:08:31.361 --> 02:08:33.610
<v Speaker 4>you land on the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the frame it was him.</v>

2831
02:08:33.810 --> 02:08:35.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what the calf muscles for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2832
02:08:35.770 --> 02:08:38.180
<v Speaker 4>And also the arch and there are all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these bones.</v>

2833
02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2834
02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:42.430
<v Speaker 4>Crazy short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the birth thing,</v>

2835
02:08:42.431 --> 02:08:43.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2836
02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:45.750
<v Speaker 1>thing yesterday.</v>

2837
02:08:45.751 --> 02:08:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's supposed to be replacing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that barefoot feeling,</v>

2838
02:08:48.661 --> 02:08:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really expensive sock.</v>

2839
02:08:50.211 --> 02:08:52.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like 80 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a sock,</v>

2840
02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but kind of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's made,</v>

2841
02:08:53.371 --> 02:08:55.050
<v Speaker 1>it shows at the end of the video shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's made of.</v>

2842
02:08:55.051 --> 02:08:55.884
<v Speaker 1>It's got some sort of spray polymer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like 15 times stronger than </v>

2843
02:08:58.801 --> 02:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2844
02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So you can like do rock climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tightrope walking or running outside and</v>

2845
02:09:04.191 --> 02:09:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just as a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like silk.</v>

2846
02:09:06.601 --> 02:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>It's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels just like a sock.</v>

2847
02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty interested in it.</v>

2848
02:09:09.921 --> 02:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how legit it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just get it pretty new.</v>

2849
02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:13.673
<v Speaker 1>I work out barefoot most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work out barefoot when I do </v>

2850
02:09:16.831 --> 02:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>workout,</v>

2851
02:09:17.971 --> 02:09:19.150
<v Speaker 1>barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I do Jujitsu,</v>

2852
02:09:19.230 --> 02:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>workout barefoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I lift weights,</v>

2853
02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:22.193
<v Speaker 1>I do almost everything barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally I'll do like an elliptical </v>

2854
02:09:24.001 --> 02:09:26.220
<v Speaker 1>machine or something like that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes on,</v>

2855
02:09:26.730 --> 02:09:29.910
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like when you are barefoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I do yoga barefoot,</v>

2856
02:09:29.911 --> 02:09:32.120
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when you're barefoot you get</v>

2857
02:09:32.121 --> 02:09:34.730
<v Speaker 1>to feel your toes are like digging into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

2858
02:09:34.750 --> 02:09:35.583
<v Speaker 1>The rolling.</v>

2859
02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:39.100
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it makes a big difference in</v>

2860
02:09:39.101 --> 02:09:42.280
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the nervous system terminates </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the sole of the feet.</v>

2861
02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:46.500
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Chinese medicine there's a lot of um,</v>

2862
02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:50.680
<v Speaker 4>attention paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reflexology is about how,</v>

2863
02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:52.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how real it is,</v>

2864
02:09:52.961 --> 02:09:53.794
<v Speaker 4>but it is real that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the nervous system terminates </v>

2865
02:09:56.771 --> 02:09:59.290
<v Speaker 4>at the soles of the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why foot massage feels so good.</v>

2866
02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:00.573
<v Speaker 4>And so the theory is with this barefoot </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit is that by having that experience </v>

2867
02:10:04.961 --> 02:10:05.794
<v Speaker 4>you're describing where your toes are </v>
<v Speaker 4>digging in and you're feeling your </v>

2868
02:10:07.511 --> 02:10:10.390
<v Speaker 4>weight being shifting in different parts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your foot.</v>

2869
02:10:10.391 --> 02:10:15.340
<v Speaker 4>Having that part of your body alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inactive is really good for your overall</v>

2870
02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:18.910
<v Speaker 4>psychological health and nervous health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that makes sense?</v>

2871
02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:19.960
<v Speaker 4>Does make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2872
02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.370
<v Speaker 4>It just feels good to do and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2873
02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:26.100
<v Speaker 4>you feel good for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2874
02:10:26.110 --> 02:10:30.520
<v Speaker 4>You know the word evolve too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To have them feel good because it's good</v>

2875
02:10:30.521 --> 02:10:31.354
<v Speaker 4>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brings us back to beaten off or fucking </v>

2876
02:10:33.621 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 4>one of those</v>

2877
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.020
<v Speaker 3>dog things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drinking off a dog with A.</v>

2878
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if we should call that company </v>
<v Speaker 3>and ask questions and they say like,</v>

2879
02:10:40.041 --> 02:10:41.040
<v Speaker 3>what kind of dog do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2880
02:10:41.041 --> 02:10:44.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2881
02:10:44.690 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 3>this nefarious intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like watch dogs.</v>

2882
02:10:47.931 --> 02:10:48.764
<v Speaker 3>Fuck robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just for dogs that wonder by my </v>

2883
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:58.250
<v Speaker 3>friend Joe when I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Spagnolo and he had a.</v>

2884
02:10:59.090 --> 02:10:59.923
<v Speaker 3>He had a dog that was just like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>ornery little dog and his dog had a </v>

2885
02:11:03.471 --> 02:11:04.304
<v Speaker 3>stuffed animal that it would fuck and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would just bite this stuffed animal and </v>

2886
02:11:10.461 --> 02:11:12.620
<v Speaker 3>fuck the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'd come over his house.</v>

2887
02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:13.873
<v Speaker 3>Joe's bags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd go over his house and his dog </v>

2888
02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:18.380
<v Speaker 3>would be fucking the shit out of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuffed animal.</v>

2889
02:11:18.381 --> 02:11:19.050
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2890
02:11:19.050 --> 02:11:20.750
<v Speaker 3>How'd you'd clean it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2891
02:11:20.751 --> 02:11:21.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't even go near that thing.</v>

2892
02:11:21.921 --> 02:11:22.754
<v Speaker 3>That dog was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would get ferocious if you tried to </v>

2893
02:11:26.841 --> 02:11:30.260
<v Speaker 3>get near his stuffed animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a little tiny ass dog too.</v>

2894
02:11:30.261 --> 02:11:31.094
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like your friend with the </v>

2895
02:11:32.301 --> 02:11:33.500
<v Speaker 3>restraining order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2896
02:11:33.590 --> 02:11:35.120
<v Speaker 3>Love is love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2897
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:38.600
<v Speaker 3>there's no way around it to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that dog was obsessed.</v>

2898
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:39.583
<v Speaker 3>That was his world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His world is like biting the stuffed </v>

2899
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:43.090
<v Speaker 3>animal and just plug into have.</v>

2900
02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody asked me to raise an issue with</v>

2901
02:11:48.921 --> 02:11:50.160
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2902
02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:51.373
<v Speaker 3>apparently you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're under the impression that </v>

2903
02:11:53.181 --> 02:11:56.090
<v Speaker 3>everyone died at 30 and prehistory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>

2904
02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2905
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:59.840
<v Speaker 3>I joke around about that all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that lifespans were incredibly low.</v>

2906
02:11:59.841 --> 02:12:02.030
<v Speaker 3>A long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lived to be like 30,</v>

2907
02:12:02.031 --> 02:12:03.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hyperbole for the most part.</v>

2908
02:12:03.951 --> 02:12:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

2909
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:06.830
<v Speaker 3>I know people did leave love live </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer,</v>

2910
02:12:07.190 --> 02:12:08.023
<v Speaker 3>but the age that people died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the average age was much lower than it </v>

2911
02:12:10.461 --> 02:12:12.710
<v Speaker 3>is today just because lots of babies </v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

2912
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:13.910
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2913
02:12:13.930 --> 02:12:14.763
<v Speaker 3>it's a mathematical average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But species by design by has evolved to </v>

2914
02:12:19.821 --> 02:12:20.654
<v Speaker 3>live into our sixties and seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter gatherers who get through the </v>

2915
02:12:23.661 --> 02:12:26.060
<v Speaker 3>first few years where there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>risk.</v>

2916
02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:29.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's a huge thing also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all rounded out math thing.</v>

2917
02:12:29.991 --> 02:12:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2918
02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:31.393
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was under the impression that </v>

2919
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:36.920
<v Speaker 3>people just got diet of violence and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of diseases by the time they were in</v>

2920
02:12:36.921 --> 02:12:37.580
<v Speaker 3>their thirties.</v>

2921
02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:41.120
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the diseases that we suffer from</v>

2922
02:12:41.121 --> 02:12:46.080
<v Speaker 3>are the result of agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you look at all the major killers of,</v>

2923
02:12:46.110 --> 02:12:50.840
<v Speaker 3>of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swine flew from pigs or chicken pox from</v>

2924
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:55.050
<v Speaker 3>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously Avian Flus come domesticated.</v>

2925
02:12:55.170 --> 02:12:57.020
<v Speaker 3>And Jamie would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he posted up there?</v>

2926
02:12:57.170 --> 02:12:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Human lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nearly constant for 2000 years.</v>

2927
02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like ultimate lights fan.</v>

2928
02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:05.360
<v Speaker 3>But when I was talking about most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these diseases and violence,</v>

2929
02:13:06.170 --> 02:13:06.921
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2930
02:13:06.921 --> 02:13:10.100
<v Speaker 3>the violence thing is overrepresented if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2931
02:13:10.130 --> 02:13:13.070
<v Speaker 3>unless you live in Mongolia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you read the.</v>

2932
02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:13.881
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

2933
02:13:13.881 --> 02:13:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Seventy five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if that looks free.</v>

2934
02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:17.640
<v Speaker 3>History is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2935
02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2936
02:13:18.230 --> 02:13:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life expectancy for men in 19.</v>

2937
02:13:20.151 --> 02:13:21.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven was 45 years.</v>

2938
02:13:22.630 --> 02:13:25.310
<v Speaker 3>Forty five years by 1957,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it rose to 66,</v>

2939
02:13:25.610 --> 02:13:26.443
<v Speaker 3>2007 to reach 75.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unlike the most recent increase in life </v>

2940
02:13:30.690 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 3>expectancy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is attributed</v>

2941
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:35.490
<v Speaker 1>largely to a decline in half of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leading causes of death,</v>

2942
02:13:35.491 --> 02:13:37.800
<v Speaker 1>including heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homicide and influenza.</v>

2943
02:13:38.070 --> 02:13:40.290
<v Speaker 1>The increase in life expectancy between </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 Oh,</v>

2944
02:13:40.291 --> 02:13:43.080
<v Speaker 1>seven and 2007 with largely due to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreasing,</v>

2945
02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:46.740
<v Speaker 1>decreasing infant mortality rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like nine point nine,</v>

2946
02:13:46.741 --> 02:13:48.090
<v Speaker 1>nine percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2947
02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:52.980
<v Speaker 1>So what that is like is like the wage </v>
<v Speaker 1>gap,</v>

2948
02:13:53.850 --> 02:13:55.760
<v Speaker 1>the gender wage gap issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2949
02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:56.873
<v Speaker 1>Where a lot of people say they love to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote that thing that say that men make </v>

2950
02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:04.680
<v Speaker 1>so much more money than women that women</v>
<v Speaker 1>make eighty cents to the dollar,</v>

2951
02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:06.280
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing different jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2952
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:07.710
<v Speaker 1>So like you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

2953
02:14:07.711 --> 02:14:09.210
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an injustice going on.</v>

2954
02:14:09.211 --> 02:14:12.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe there is some sexism,</v>

2955
02:14:12.151 --> 02:14:14.430
<v Speaker 1>but this is not what they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about when they're saying this.</v>

2956
02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:17.970
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about different jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The men are at higher risk,</v>

2957
02:14:17.971 --> 02:14:18.804
<v Speaker 1>they die more often on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men like when they almost exclusively </v>

2958
02:14:21.901 --> 02:14:25.650
<v Speaker 1>populated the community of minors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lumber jacks and shit like that,</v>

2959
02:14:25.651 --> 02:14:26.484
<v Speaker 1>where people get hit by trees and women </v>
<v Speaker 1>take time off when they have kids and </v>

2960
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:33.030
<v Speaker 1>they also work less hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're less crazy.</v>

2961
02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Some men will fucking work themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

2962
02:14:35.341 --> 02:14:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Were very few women will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2963
02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:37.773
<v Speaker 2>Take it to that list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly are plenty of examples of men </v>

2964
02:14:40.361 --> 02:14:43.780
<v Speaker 2>and women doing exactly the same job and</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are getting paid less.</v>

2965
02:14:43.870 --> 02:14:44.703
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it must have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not statistically </v>

2966
02:14:46.301 --> 02:14:48.050
<v Speaker 2>significantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what you're talking.</v>

2967
02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:51.880
<v Speaker 1>They attribute that from the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When women get less,</v>

2968
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:55.060
<v Speaker 1>they think that one thing to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered when you look at that is that</v>

2969
02:14:55.330 --> 02:14:56.163
<v Speaker 1>women might not be as aggressive when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're negotiating a starting salary </v>

2970
02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:00.453
<v Speaker 1>and that men may be more confident and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cock shore of their worth more cocky </v>

2971
02:15:04.361 --> 02:15:05.194
<v Speaker 1>with how they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2972
02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:06.230
<v Speaker 1>who knows though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2973
02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:07.773
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was under the impression that </v>

2974
02:15:09.401 --> 02:15:10.510
<v Speaker 1>people did die.</v>

2975
02:15:10.650 --> 02:15:11.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2976
02:15:11.011 --> 02:15:12.810
<v Speaker 2>most people are under that impression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2977
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spoken,</v>

2978
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:15.383
<v Speaker 2>given talks at medical schools and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these doctors think that </v>

2979
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:21.920
<v Speaker 2>everyone died at 35 to 35 year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>results and they're like,</v>

2980
02:15:21.930 --> 02:15:24.630
<v Speaker 2>and it works its way into medicine where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2981
02:15:24.631 --> 02:15:25.141
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2982
02:15:25.141 --> 02:15:25.974
<v Speaker 2>the reason you have chronic back pain is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the human body was not evolved to </v>

2983
02:15:29.041 --> 02:15:29.874
<v Speaker 2>live beyond 35,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so of course you have wear and tear </v>

2984
02:15:32.731 --> 02:15:33.564
<v Speaker 2>and things like that's totally false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human bodies evolved to live into </v>

2985
02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:39.840
<v Speaker 2>the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a statistical thing.</v>

2986
02:15:39.841 --> 02:15:42.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like if Bill Gates moves into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood,</v>

2987
02:15:42.001 --> 02:15:44.810
<v Speaker 2>suddenly everyone's average annual </v>
<v Speaker 2>salary is million,</v>

2988
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:46.500
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of millions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2989
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:50.340
<v Speaker 2>So if you count all these infants who </v>
<v Speaker 2>died in prehistory,</v>

2990
02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:53.160
<v Speaker 2>many of whom by the way died from </v>
<v Speaker 2>infanticide.</v>

2991
02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Like twins normally are not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

2992
02:15:56.670 --> 02:15:57.503
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weaker one is left in the woods to </v>

2993
02:15:59.611 --> 02:16:00.440
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

2994
02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any sort of deform and mal formality,</v>

2995
02:16:03.921 --> 02:16:05.430
<v Speaker 2>we just leave them in the woods by </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2996
02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:07.880
<v Speaker 2>What a cruel way to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2997
02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's dark man.</v>

2998
02:16:09.931 --> 02:16:12.600
<v Speaker 2>They would leave him to wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up,</v>

2999
02:16:12.601 --> 02:16:14.550
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leave your baby in a basket.</v>

3000
02:16:14.551 --> 02:16:17.000
<v Speaker 2>And run away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

3001
02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:18.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of,</v>

3002
02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.580
<v Speaker 2>a lot of infanticide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3003
02:16:20.581 --> 02:16:21.630
<v Speaker 2>in our world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it,</v>

3004
02:16:21.631 --> 02:16:22.530
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3005
02:16:22.630 --> 02:16:23.463
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because of the times were harder </v>

3006
02:16:24.031 --> 02:16:24.864
<v Speaker 2>than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was more accepted that you were </v>

3007
02:16:25.651 --> 02:16:28.050
<v Speaker 2>going to have to do some terrible things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you didn't want to do.</v>

3008
02:16:28.110 --> 02:16:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3009
02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a kid's</v>

3010
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:35.100
<v Speaker 4>born physically fucked up in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3011
02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:36.813
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna have the resources and </v>

3012
02:16:38.621 --> 02:16:39.454
<v Speaker 4>that kid's not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that person's not going to grow up to </v>

3013
02:16:41.710 --> 02:16:44.800
<v Speaker 4>contribute to the group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so generally,</v>

3014
02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:49.000
<v Speaker 4>and also there's a different sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life and death,</v>

3015
02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:52.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're death is much more a daily</v>

3016
02:16:52.151 --> 02:16:54.340
<v Speaker 4>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that big a deal.</v>

3017
02:16:54.730 --> 02:16:55.563
<v Speaker 4>So we're all going to die there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was reading about a tribe in the </v>

3018
02:16:57.911 --> 02:16:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3019
02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:04.510
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the name of the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when someone gets too old to keep up</v>

3020
02:17:04.511 --> 02:17:08.170
<v Speaker 4>with the group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone has chosen randomly,</v>

3021
02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:11.650
<v Speaker 4>like they have a lottery or pick the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shortest straw or whatever it is.</v>

3022
02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:13.293
<v Speaker 4>And their job is to come up behind this </v>
<v Speaker 4>old person and hit him in the back of </v>

3023
02:17:17.111 --> 02:17:18.220
<v Speaker 4>the head with a hatchet.</v>

3024
02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

3025
02:17:20.550 --> 02:17:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And no one wants to do it.</v>

3026
02:17:22.621 --> 02:17:25.800
<v Speaker 4>It really sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everyone agrees it has to be done.</v>

3027
02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:30.860
<v Speaker 4>And it's the least cruel option that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've come up</v>

3028
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:33.470
<v Speaker 1>real careful to do to keep signing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that job.</v>

3029
02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

3030
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Papa Joe,</v>

3031
02:17:40.161 --> 02:17:44.090
<v Speaker 1>you've killed nine old ladies this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bitches gone over.</v>

3032
02:17:44.650 --> 02:17:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just let her stop.</v>

3033
02:17:46.550 --> 02:17:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

3034
02:17:48.650 --> 02:17:50.790
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird gig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway.</v>

3035
02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:54.030
<v Speaker 4>No human being has ever been old at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>age of four.</v>

3036
02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:54.873
<v Speaker 4>Look at this</v>

3037
02:17:54.980 --> 02:17:55.813
<v Speaker 1>heartbreaking pictures of parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving their children in China's </v>

3038
02:17:58.371 --> 02:18:00.550
<v Speaker 1>notorious baby hatches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

3039
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:01.850
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3040
02:18:01.851 --> 02:18:03.770
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably girls.</v>

3041
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:04.663
<v Speaker 1>The moment of despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As parents cling to their children for </v>

3042
02:18:07.161 --> 02:18:11.870
<v Speaker 1>one last time before abandoning them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China's so called baby hatches,</v>

3043
02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:15.380
<v Speaker 1>the father kisses his child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her face hidden in a blanket.</v>

3044
02:18:15.381 --> 02:18:16.214
<v Speaker 1>The mother holds her hooded baby has </v>
<v Speaker 1>their shadows are cast upon the last </v>

3045
02:18:19.371 --> 02:18:23.000
<v Speaker 1>door they will pass through together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another collapses to the ground,</v>

3046
02:18:23.001 --> 02:18:24.860
<v Speaker 1>reaching out to touch her son for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last time.</v>

3047
02:18:24.861 --> 02:18:28.010
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3048
02:18:28.011 --> 02:18:29.810
<v Speaker 1>the baby is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says in quotes,</v>

3049
02:18:29.811 --> 02:18:31.940
<v Speaker 1>my baby cannot take care of itself when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it grows up.</v>

3050
02:18:31.941 --> 02:18:34.970
<v Speaker 1>One woman cries explaining that her </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant has down syndrome.</v>

3051
02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:36.433
<v Speaker 1>I just want my baby to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She tells the information times news </v>

3052
02:18:39.021 --> 02:18:40.880
<v Speaker 1>based in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say that.</v>

3053
02:18:40.970 --> 02:18:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Guang huge owl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had an accompanying female friendly.</v>

3054
02:18:45.970 --> 02:18:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Both in tears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

3055
02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:50.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this has been happening forever.</v>

3056
02:18:50.541 --> 02:18:52.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have safe baby drop</v>

3057
02:18:52.570 --> 02:18:53.403
<v Speaker 1>Bob's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every hospital has a sign that it's a </v>

3058
02:18:55.361 --> 02:18:56.920
<v Speaker 1>safe baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drop off.</v>

3059
02:18:58.030 --> 02:18:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Take that off the screen or</v>

3060
02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:00.953
<v Speaker 4>and in medieval Europe it was so common </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they had these little boxes that </v>

3061
02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:11.880
<v Speaker 4>rotated and so you could leave your baby</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just spin the box.</v>

3062
02:19:11.881 --> 02:19:13.590
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one would ever see,</v>

3063
02:19:13.591 --> 02:19:15.660
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See who was dropping it off.</v>

3064
02:19:15.690 --> 02:19:17.630
<v Speaker 4>It was anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

3065
02:19:17.670 --> 02:19:18.503
<v Speaker 4>Very common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They called a foundling hospitals and </v>

3066
02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:23.400
<v Speaker 4>over 90 percent of the babies left there</v>
<v Speaker 4>died bad</v>

3067
02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:27.490
<v Speaker 1>boy in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had with.</v>

3068
02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:29.780
<v Speaker 1>What are they called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angel makers?</v>

3069
02:19:30.670 --> 02:19:32.740
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is through the beginning of the</v>

3070
02:19:32.741 --> 02:19:33.574
<v Speaker 2>20th century up to World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a nanny that you hired with the </v>

3071
02:19:37.511 --> 02:19:39.730
<v Speaker 2>understanding that your baby was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to die,</v>

3072
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:43.040
<v Speaker 1>so it was like a babysitter who's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill your baby?</v>

3073
02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3074
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:45.703
<v Speaker 1>so you would hire this nanny because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your kid had down syndrome or some sort </v>

3075
02:19:48.021 --> 02:19:51.500
<v Speaker 1>of a disease or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it was born out of wedlock,</v>

3076
02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3077
02:19:53.121 --> 02:19:55.460
<v Speaker 1>The nanny would kill the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3078
02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:56.323
<v Speaker 1>They called them angel makers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that infanticide was </v>

3079
02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:00.153
<v Speaker 1>historically significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's significant in the death of the </v>

3080
02:20:02.841 --> 02:20:05.120
<v Speaker 1>population that that was so common.</v>

3081
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:07.243
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean today we have abortion and I </v>

3082
02:20:08.721 --> 02:20:09.890
<v Speaker 2>don't want to get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3083
02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:13.490
<v Speaker 2>heavy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like now if a baby's inconvenient or</v>

3084
02:20:13.491 --> 02:20:15.830
<v Speaker 2>there's a disease that's detected or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3085
02:20:15.890 --> 02:20:17.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut it off at the past,</v>

3086
02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:19.430
<v Speaker 2>you cut it off at the pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In those days there wasn't.</v>

3087
02:20:19.431 --> 02:20:21.800
<v Speaker 2>So it was sort of postnatal abortion </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>

3088
02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I feel like abortion is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects were</v>

3089
02:20:24.900 --> 02:20:28.920
<v Speaker 1>ideally upon breaching the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a tension in the room.</v>

3090
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I've just felt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apologize for it.</v>

3091
02:20:31.111 --> 02:20:32.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

3092
02:20:32.521 --> 02:20:35.910
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing is both sides are.</v>

3093
02:20:35.911 --> 02:20:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3094
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:38.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 100 percent,</v>

3095
02:20:38.041 --> 02:20:38.874
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3096
02:20:39.090 --> 02:20:41.310
<v Speaker 1>That's 100 percent the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3097
02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:43.680
<v Speaker 1>And there are a lot of issues like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3098
02:20:43.681 --> 02:20:44.514
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming at you and get crazy and </v>

3099
02:20:47.641 --> 02:20:50.900
<v Speaker 1>they'll pick a side and it's death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this and it's that and it's,</v>

3100
02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:52.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a woman's choice to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

3101
02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:54.840
<v Speaker 1>you're both right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're both right.</v>

3102
02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Like I got in an argument once with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian about it and he,</v>

3103
02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:02.760
<v Speaker 1>it was about Richard Dawkins was talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a,</v>

3104
02:21:02.761 --> 02:21:05.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on twitter that an embryo,</v>

3105
02:21:05.701 --> 02:21:06.534
<v Speaker 1>human embryo is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost no different than a pig </v>

3106
02:21:09.451 --> 02:21:10.284
<v Speaker 1>embryo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was making this about at six </v>

3107
02:21:13.231 --> 02:21:14.160
<v Speaker 1>weeks of life or whatever.</v>

3108
02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:15.300
<v Speaker 1>It would be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

3109
02:21:15.301 --> 02:21:17.460
<v Speaker 1>very early age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess not even,</v>

3110
02:21:17.461 --> 02:21:18.660
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't even be an embryo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3111
02:21:18.690 --> 02:21:20.270
<v Speaker 1>What would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still an embryo,</v>

3112
02:21:20.470 --> 02:21:21.960
<v Speaker 1>an embryo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then right,</v>

3113
02:21:21.961 --> 02:21:22.794
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so an embryo is the earliest stages and </v>

3114
02:21:24.181 --> 02:21:26.880
<v Speaker 1>he was comparing it to a pig and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3115
02:21:26.970 --> 02:21:27.803
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how crazy that is a ridiculous </v>

3116
02:21:28.711 --> 02:21:30.540
<v Speaker 1>thing to say because it's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a pig,</v>

3117
02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:31.793
<v Speaker 1>but if you leave it alone it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a person so you know it's going to </v>

3118
02:21:33.721 --> 02:21:34.560
<v Speaker 1>grow up to be a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

3119
02:21:34.561 --> 02:21:36.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying that it's no different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a pig.</v>

3120
02:21:36.871 --> 02:21:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's totally disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean this comedian,</v>

3121
02:21:39.751 --> 02:21:40.800
<v Speaker 1>we were arguing and he started calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

3122
02:21:40.801 --> 02:21:43.010
<v Speaker 1>you a right winger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like saying that I was,</v>

3123
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:44.190
<v Speaker 1>that I was writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3124
02:21:44.191 --> 02:21:45.024
<v Speaker 1>I am not right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are definitely killing a person </v>

3125
02:21:47.730 --> 02:21:49.260
<v Speaker 1>that's about to be born.</v>

3126
02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing.</v>

3127
02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:53.070
<v Speaker 1>You're cutting it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you cut off at three cells or three</v>

3128
02:21:53.071 --> 02:21:54.330
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

3129
02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3130
02:21:55.850 --> 02:21:56.730
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

3131
02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:57.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes.</v>

3132
02:21:57.950 --> 02:22:00.450
<v Speaker 1>It becomes much more like a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks more like a baby.</v>

3133
02:22:00.451 --> 02:22:03.660
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more intensive and a procedure,</v>

3134
02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:04.793
<v Speaker 1>but once the process is started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've decided at various stage of the </v>

3135
02:22:08.371 --> 02:22:10.680
<v Speaker 1>way that it becomes okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3136
02:22:10.681 --> 02:22:13.440
<v Speaker 1>like late term abortions are frowned </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon by almost everybody.</v>

3137
02:22:13.441 --> 02:22:14.274
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get into the fucking the last </v>

3138
02:22:16.470 --> 02:22:17.730
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks of a baby's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really.</v>

3139
02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Or before it gets birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody.</v>

3140
02:22:19.860 --> 02:22:20.693
<v Speaker 1>Very few people are going to agree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just suck out the baby with a </v>

3141
02:22:22.591 --> 02:22:25.230
<v Speaker 1>vacuum when it's nine months old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3142
02:22:25.231 --> 02:22:26.910
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a little intense,</v>

3143
02:22:26.930 --> 02:22:27.763
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost everybody agrees that's a little </v>

3144
02:22:28.621 --> 02:22:32.040
<v Speaker 1>intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that we all have some sort</v>

3145
02:22:32.041 --> 02:22:34.530
<v Speaker 1>of a reasonable cutoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who believes in abortion,</v>

3146
02:22:34.770 --> 02:22:38.190
<v Speaker 1>we have some sort of a reasonable cutoff</v>
<v Speaker 1>will were accepted when it's a bundle of</v>

3147
02:22:38.191 --> 02:22:39.150
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's.</v>

3148
02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:41.070
<v Speaker 1>When it looks like a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when is it?</v>

3149
02:22:41.071 --> 02:22:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when's it okay.</v>

3150
02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:43.113
<v Speaker 1>And that's all I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you should or shouldn't </v>

3151
02:22:44.791 --> 02:22:47.130
<v Speaker 1>be able to do it and it's definitely not</v>
<v Speaker 1>my choice.</v>

3152
02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a body that makes baby.</v>

3153
02:22:49.390 --> 02:22:52.180
<v Speaker 2>And do you think it starts at conception</v>
<v Speaker 2>or jerking off?</v>

3154
02:22:52.181 --> 02:22:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Killing millions of.</v>

3155
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Because jerking off doesn't ever make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that connection,</v>

3156
02:22:56.441 --> 02:22:58.150
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a viable.</v>

3157
02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:00.370
<v Speaker 1>So it is conception process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

3158
02:23:00.750 --> 02:23:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't necessarily think life </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts at conception.</v>

3159
02:23:03.071 --> 02:23:03.904
<v Speaker 1>I mean I literally have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if someone can prove like if you </v>

3160
02:23:07.601 --> 02:23:09.700
<v Speaker 1>had a Turkey tester that pops up when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pregnant,</v>

3161
02:23:09.701 --> 02:23:11.200
<v Speaker 1>like the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

3162
02:23:11.201 --> 02:23:13.500
<v Speaker 1>we got one and you can just push that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucker down.</v>

3163
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:14.343
<v Speaker 1>That egg would shoot out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fertilized egg would shoot out of </v>

3164
02:23:17.261 --> 02:23:18.820
<v Speaker 1>your pussy and then that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrap.</v>

3165
02:23:19.330 --> 02:23:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I got no problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3166
02:23:20.681 --> 02:23:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a problem with any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do.</v>

3167
02:23:22.830 --> 02:23:23.663
<v Speaker 1>I think intellectually I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I have a problem with it </v>

3168
02:23:26.351 --> 02:23:29.740
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I submit that I don't have a vagina,</v>

3169
02:23:29.741 --> 02:23:31.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't have ovaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a womb.</v>

3170
02:23:31.690 --> 02:23:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an opinion and that's it.</v>

3171
02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:36.813
<v Speaker 1>There's no way I should be able to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes or no when I see it as this weird </v>

3172
02:23:39.371 --> 02:23:40.204
<v Speaker 1>sort of a situation where we've figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to terminate life inside the </v>

3173
02:23:44.561 --> 02:23:47.260
<v Speaker 1>body where we can't see it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't come out and said,</v>

3174
02:23:47.261 --> 02:23:48.850
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi Daddy.</v>

3175
02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:51.850
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't done that yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we could hit the brakes.</v>

3176
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>

3177
02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

3178
02:23:53.980 --> 02:23:56.710
<v Speaker 1>We figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that there's.</v>

3179
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think it's wrong or </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3180
02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:01.380
<v Speaker 1>but it is a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3181
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:02.323
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing and people require that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak of this thing in the way they </v>

3182
02:24:05.501 --> 02:24:08.920
<v Speaker 1>speak of this thing and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are fucking ready to Duke.</v>

3183
02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:10.650
<v Speaker 1>They're ready to duke it out with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3184
02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

3185
02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:15.830
<v Speaker 2>because the differentiation is the pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

3186
02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:17.253
<v Speaker 2>People are saying it's not a life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other people are saying you're </v>

3187
02:24:20.291 --> 02:24:23.580
<v Speaker 2>killing a living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A person and I'm,</v>

3188
02:24:23.650 --> 02:24:25.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm in there where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3189
02:24:25.031 --> 02:24:28.960
<v Speaker 2>you are killing something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a person now yet.</v>

3190
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:31.650
<v Speaker 2>So I agree with both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3191
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:32.583
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fundamentally I agree with what you </v>

3192
02:24:35.021 --> 02:24:35.854
<v Speaker 2>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is it's really none of my fucking </v>

3193
02:24:37.361 --> 02:24:38.194
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not my body and no woman can tell </v>

3194
02:24:40.421 --> 02:24:41.254
<v Speaker 2>me whether you get a vasectomy or not or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prostate exam or whatever the fuck </v>

3195
02:24:44.261 --> 02:24:45.094
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just passed a law in Arkansas or </v>

3196
02:24:47.041 --> 02:24:47.874
<v Speaker 2>somewhere that husbands need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>informed before woman can have an </v>

3197
02:24:50.801 --> 02:24:54.100
<v Speaker 2>abortion and a husband can stop it even </v>
<v Speaker 2>if she's been raped.</v>

3198
02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:59.380
<v Speaker 1>That's medieval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ownership person.</v>

3199
02:24:59.580 --> 02:25:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A husband or a wife.</v>

3200
02:25:01.170 --> 02:25:02.003
<v Speaker 1>Being able to tell the other one what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can or can't do with a medical </v>

3201
02:25:04.561 --> 02:25:05.700
<v Speaker 1>procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's illegal.</v>

3202
02:25:06.090 --> 02:25:06.923
<v Speaker 1>That becomes like an owner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That definitely becomes an ownership </v>

3203
02:25:08.371 --> 02:25:09.204
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if your wife told you you couldn't </v>

3204
02:25:09.781 --> 02:25:12.060
<v Speaker 1>get a vasectomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not allow it,</v>

3205
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:14.910

<v Speaker 1>I will not allow you to eat meat either.</v>

3206

<v Speaker 1>I will not allow you to have ice cream </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3208
02:25:18.650 --> 02:25:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Like all of a sudden she decides what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to eat out.</v>

3209
02:25:21.370 --> 02:25:22.890
<v Speaker 1>It will not allow you to keep that </v>
<v Speaker 1>haircut.</v>

3210
02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:24.040

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3216
02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:41.590
<v Speaker 2>under ownership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she allows the same sort of situation</v>

3217
02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:43.940
<v Speaker 2>like guy makes her do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3218
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.903
<v Speaker 2>I've known people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their husbands have made them get </v>

3219
02:25:47.171 --> 02:25:49.830

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3220
02:25:49.890 --> 02:25:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3222
02:25:51.970 --> 02:25:54.700
<v Speaker 2>I want you to do this for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the big tits.</v>

3223
02:25:54.850 --> 02:25:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the lips,</v>

3224
02:25:56.250 --> 02:25:59.050
<v Speaker 2>lips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lips to do something by your nose.</v>

3225
02:25:59.051 --> 02:26:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't like your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bothered me.</v>

3226
02:26:00.850 --> 02:26:01.790
<v Speaker 2>You'd be prettier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

3227
02:26:01.850 --> 02:26:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird,</v>

3228
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:04.690
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fix your notes.</v>

3229
02:26:04.691 --> 02:26:07.690
<v Speaker 2>And then there are those people who like</v>
<v Speaker 2>who like fatties,</v>

3230
02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:08.810
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the,</v>

3231
02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:12.760
<v Speaker 2>they feed the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of their eroticism to feed you</v>

3232
02:26:12.761 --> 02:26:15.770
<v Speaker 2>as much as possible so you get as fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I love you and getting,</v>

3233
02:26:15.771 --> 02:26:16.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not cool.</v>

3234
02:26:17.170 --> 02:26:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking weird man.</v>

3235
02:26:20.690 --> 02:26:21.523
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think hunter gatherers are </v>

3236
02:26:22.691 --> 02:26:24.250
<v Speaker 2>kinky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3237
02:26:24.330 --> 02:26:25.630
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing.</v>

3238
02:26:25.631 --> 02:26:30.631
<v Speaker 2>I think kink is a response to a fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up environment.</v>

3239
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:36.040
<v Speaker 2>So I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this weird pressure.</v>

3240
02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:39.220
<v Speaker 2>It's conflict between the impulse and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's allowed.</v>

3241
02:26:39.221 --> 02:26:41.410
<v Speaker 2>So it comes out in this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>distorted way.</v>

3242
02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:43.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that makes total sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3243
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:45.550
<v Speaker 2>hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>

3244
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:48.940
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence of Kink,</v>

3245
02:26:49.060 --> 02:26:50.920
<v Speaker 2>tarred to get latex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's face it,</v>

3246
02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:51.933
<v Speaker 2>the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although that's where it comes from </v>

3247
02:26:52.901 --> 02:26:55.240
<v Speaker 2>originally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever met Wade Davis,</v>

3248
02:26:55.241 --> 02:26:56.074
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3249
02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:58.960
<v Speaker 2>you should meet that guy who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>

<v Speaker 2>podcast a long time ago about this </v>

3269
02:27:48.461 --> 02:27:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Eskimo Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old guy in the family said,</v>

3270
02:27:51.641 --> 02:27:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Grandpa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3271
02:27:52.571 --> 02:27:56.830
<v Speaker 2>we get to take away the keys to the snow</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine because you can't see so well,</v>

3272
02:27:57.340 --> 02:27:58.480
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you guys.</v>

3273
02:27:58.481 --> 02:28:01.930
<v Speaker 2>In that night he went out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was winter in the Arctic somewhere.</v>

3274
02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:02.883
<v Speaker 2>He took a shit and he fashioned a blade </v>
<v Speaker 2>from his shit out of the snow and well </v>

3275
02:28:08.140 --> 02:28:08.973
<v Speaker 2>he killed the dogs and he made a harness</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the dog's skin and a little sled </v>

3276
02:28:13.421 --> 02:28:14.254
<v Speaker 2>out of the dog's ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he like tied in three or four </v>

3277
02:28:18.041 --> 02:28:21.560
<v Speaker 2>other dogs and then he fucking took a </v>
<v Speaker 2>took off across Tundra.</v>

3278
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a way David's story.</v>

3279
02:28:23.721 --> 02:28:24.580

<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

3280
02:28:24.610 --> 02:28:28.180
<v Speaker 3>So he made a knife out of his own chef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He froze his night.</v>

3281
02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:29.533
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he forms the blade and then he took </v>

3282
02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:33.103
<v Speaker 3>some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He freezes and then he takes them spit </v>

3283
02:28:35.301 --> 02:28:36.134
<v Speaker 3>and he rubs it along the edge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently that's what gives it the </v>

3284
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:39.900
<v Speaker 3>razor sharpness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3285
02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:43.160
