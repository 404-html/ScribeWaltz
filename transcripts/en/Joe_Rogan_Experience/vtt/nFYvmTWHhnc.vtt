00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back.</v>

3
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>John Doe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening baby?</v>

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It's good to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to see you,</v>

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about Chris </v>

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Cornell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We uh,</v>

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>found out last night at the comedy store</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he died and then this morning and </v>

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>found out that he hung himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fuck.</v>

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to even comprehend.</v>

10
00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:32.230
<v Speaker 1>How do you comprehend that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm living in a parallel universe.</v>

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how could someone like,</v>

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy on the outside looking in like</v>

13
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:41.941
<v Speaker 1>I like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd like that guy was one of the </v>

14
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.671
<v Speaker 1>best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how does a guy like that even want </v>

15
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>to kill himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does the lead singer of soundgarden.</v>

16
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.270
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just really kind of reveal.</v>

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.840
<v Speaker 1>So the complexities of human life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what you're saying.</v>

18
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>To have a guy that is at the pinnacle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his skill,</v>

19
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>the Pinnacle of fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pinnacle of money,</v>

20
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>and for him to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

21
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Not gonna do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:10.081
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what was going on in his </v>

23
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:10.081
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

24
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if he was on medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he had some sort of issue health </v>

25
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

26
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never speculate,</v>

27
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:17.170
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

28
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

29
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't even comprehend it.</v>

30
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the really hard things </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start talking about suicide for</v>

32
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>people that for someone like me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

33
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had suicidal thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

34
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go from that to somebody that </v>

35
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>not only has the thoughts but then goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead and executes it,</v>

36
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to comprehend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I've met people that have done it </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

38
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I've met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have added a few friends that have </v>

39
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have never understood it.</v>

40
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know them.</v>

41
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got their own unique mindset</v>

42
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>what's really crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

44
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I read this statistic the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>about suicide,</v>

45
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>that people in poor neighborhoods are </v>
<v Speaker 1>far less likely to kill themselves.</v>

46
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>People that are in the struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually believed that because they're</v>

48
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>fighting for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>and someone that's already got </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and then there,</v>

50
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>then they end up with no drive with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal and nothing left to achieve and so </v>

51
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:23.061
<v Speaker 1>then all the sudden they're just staring</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the mirror without anywhere else to </v>

52
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:23.061
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not talking about Chris Cornell </v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular,</v>

54
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:31.281
<v Speaker 1>but for some people I know one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that happens is that when they </v>

55
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>become very successful and they're still</v>
<v Speaker 1>not happy,</v>

56
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>then they get hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just feel like,</v>

57
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>well I have everything and yet I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking miserable.</v>

58
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a nice big house.</v>

59
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I drive this fancy car and I still am </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>

60
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no hope like this life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless.</v>

61
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what to say to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say to be honest </v>

62
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you hear you hear that,</v>

63
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you just don't even know what to say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

64
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that,</v>

65
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>why I don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like struggle.</v>

66
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important.</v>

67
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I know there's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about having something </v>

68
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 2>that you're striving for some goal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just said,</v>

69
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 2>when you own all those goals had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieved and now you're sitting there at</v>

70
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>the top of the mountain and you now you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel happy.</v>

71
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just pick up a fucking Hobbie man.</v>

72
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Find something you suck at and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at it.</v>

73
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems so simplistic,</v>

74
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.560
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

75
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I are,</v>

77
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>we shared this a very important part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives,</v>

78
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>which is a intense exercise indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

79
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to your instagram almost every day </v>

80
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.830
<v Speaker 2>to look at your watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

81
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.511
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Jockos instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking timex watch </v>

82
00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>advertisement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all at ironman watch at 4:30</v>

83
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 2>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the occasional 3:30.</v>

84
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker is up at 3:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

85
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.820
<v Speaker 2>and you working out like this is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harry gorilla arm at a Timex ironman </v>

86
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 2>triathlon watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what's up man.</v>

87
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 2>That's what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

88
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 2>just fucking doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting out there and struggling.</v>

89
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 2>And then once you do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

90
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.850
<v Speaker 2>like a friend of mine said that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

92
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I was saying something about you come on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>until he dies.</v>

96
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important.</v>

97
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.100
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

98
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.200
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's symbolic of what we're talking </v>

99
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.200
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

100
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not fun to look at your watch every</v>

101
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you fucking do it every day.</v>

102
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what's important.</v>

103
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually,</v>

104
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 2>early on I had someone say something </v>
<v Speaker 2>along the lines of,</v>

105
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 2>on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on instagram or on twitter,</v>

106
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

107
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:36.030
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to post another </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture you're watching.</v>

108
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfollow me,</v>

109
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 2>just don't follow me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no big deal.</v>

110
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

111
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 2>and now it is kind of turned into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something where I'm doing it everyday </v>

112
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 2>regardless of anything else in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

113
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like looking at your watch.</v>

114
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 2>I want to know when I get up at seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think I'm getting up early.</v>

115
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 2>You've been up for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You already done work now.</v>

116
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

117
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a lot of ways.</v>

118
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 2>It is symbolic of what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

119
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 2>It's the struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

120
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:04.910
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't complain about and I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>make this point too.</v>

122
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.910
<v Speaker 2>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a single mom somewhere in the valley </v>

123
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 2>here that's working three jobs that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting up at 3:30</v>

124
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:18.931
<v Speaker 2>in the morning so she can go work as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>waitress somewhere before she's got her </v>

125
00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 2>other day job that she's got to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through so she can feed her kids.</v>

126
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I get up almost as a luxury at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

127
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a retired guy from the,</v>

128
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 2>from the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can kind of get up whenever I want.</v>

129
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I get up early as a luxury sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also get up because that's who </v>

130
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:40.201
<v Speaker 2>And I get up because it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a way to maintain discipline in </v>

132
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:43.441
<v Speaker 2>life for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kit that stone out and sharpen that </v>

133
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:46.531
<v Speaker 2>blade every morning show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the grind that sharpens the acs.</v>

134
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Indeed just no other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way.</v>

135
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to say that this would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have saved Chris Cornell or anybody else</v>

136
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 2>that did it.</v>

137
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean for some people out there </v>

138
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 2>that aren't feeling good man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just fucking struggled more,</v>

139
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 2>you get over that struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel better.</v>

140
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:05.531
<v Speaker 2>It sounds so simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I swear by it I felt shitty myself </v>

141
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 2>and then force myself to workout and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then after I get out of there,</v>

142
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm like 100 percent fucking 40 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantee and you know,</v>

143
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 2>actually I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

144
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Tim Ferris come on my podcast and </v>

145
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.860
<v Speaker 2>when he came on he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

146
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.371
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm the right kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests for your podcast because you </v>

147
00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:23.811
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my podcast is like about war and death </v>

148
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 2>and killing and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

149
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:28.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tim's are about being better and stuff </v>

150
00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:28.991
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's easy to raise your voice.</v>

151
00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Tim.</v>

152
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Tim's Tim's podcast is about improving </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and mine was about war and </v>

153
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 2>genocide and horrible things and he said</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

154
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

155
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I come on the podcast but you know,</v>

156
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm not the right type of guest or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

157
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

158
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 2>and I wrote back to him and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

159
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been through some dark stuff in </v>

160
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.531
<v Speaker 2>your life because he wrote a blog post </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago about him being suicidal and </v>

161
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 2>him contemplating and planning commit </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide.</v>

162
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 2>This is Tim Ferriss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he really?</v>

163
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went through a full motions.</v>

164
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Got Typical Tim ferriss methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he do?</v>

165
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:04.331
<v Speaker 2>He went to the library and got a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of books on killing yourself and </v>

166
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 2>then did the research on how he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do it and planned it all.</v>

167
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 2>And then when was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long ago he was going,</v>

168
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:11.230
<v Speaker 2>he was like just done with college and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

169
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is he 35 or something.</v>

170
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's he's 15 years ago and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was under all this pressure,</v>

171
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:21.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an ivy league guy and he was </v>

172
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.761
<v Speaker 2>trying to finish school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it wasn't working out and it </v>

173
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:24.761
<v Speaker 2>was just problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he started saying to myself,</v>

174
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how am I getting out of this?</v>

175
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one way to get out of it.</v>

176
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 2>And luckily he didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he came on,</v>

177
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:35.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we talked about and what he </v>

178
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:35.051
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 2>as he was making recommendations from </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

180
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 2>from a guy who's been there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

181
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trapped in your,</v>

182
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 2>in your mind and you're starting to feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>

183
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.830
<v Speaker 2>go do something physical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get in your body,</v>

184
00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:48.831
<v Speaker 2>you get out of your mind the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying it when you're feeling </v>

185
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:48.831
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're feeling down,</v>

186
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 2>go out and swing a kettle ball around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you will feel better.</v>

187
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just too much.</v>

188
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.610
<v Speaker 2>For some people especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just experiencing way too much </v>

189
00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 2>pressure and that pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times it's just a,</v>

190
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.600
<v Speaker 2>an imbalanced and perspective and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it's in like a,</v>

191
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom wants,</v>

192
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.980
<v Speaker 2>her daughter does gymnastics with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter and we were talking about um,</v>

193
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 2>kids killing themselves where she used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live.</v>

194
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.690
<v Speaker 2>She still live in one of the really </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy tech areas outside of San </v>

195
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Francisco and a bunch of kids that went </v>
<v Speaker 2>to school with her daughter that were </v>

196
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.430
<v Speaker 2>like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16.</v>

197
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.260
<v Speaker 2>We're jumping off bridges and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was a,</v>

198
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an epidemic and they were trying to</v>

199
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:30.671
<v Speaker 2>figure out what the fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're literally calling it </v>

200
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Affluenza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That these affluent kids and their </v>

201
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:34.820
<v Speaker 2>families are literally worth a billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>

202
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:35.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

203
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 2>everybody's super rich and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>having this insane pressure.</v>

204
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.410
<v Speaker 2>It like before high school and in high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school to be an Ivy League schools and </v>

205
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:44.780
<v Speaker 2>to get four point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

206
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 2>and they're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not having any fun and they're </v>

207
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 2>not experienced in life and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have any hope.</v>

208
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:55.331
<v Speaker 2>And their parents are all on fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>pills and they're just killing </v>

209
00:08:55.331 --> 00:08:55.331
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you said,</v>

210
00:08:55.331 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 2>it really is a piece of perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you think about,</v>

211
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.140
<v Speaker 2>think about some when you watched one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your buddies go down the downward </v>

212
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.140
<v Speaker 2>spiral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not the suicide,</v>

213
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 2>but whether it's drug addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times some female,</v>

214
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.260
<v Speaker 2>the girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ex wife,</v>

215
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:10.120
<v Speaker 2>we'll just take them on the downward </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiral and there's there,</v>

216
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 2>they can't get out of it.</v>

217
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 2>And if they were to step back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were,</v>

218
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.590
<v Speaker 2>if it was you and your buddy watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of your other friends go down this </v>

219
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.590
<v Speaker 2>path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

220
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.590
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he's doing that.</v>

221
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're in that spiral,</v>

222
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 2>people get caught in that and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

223
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 2>They can't get the perspective of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like from the outside.</v>

224
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for people to break momentum </v>
<v Speaker 2>to momentum.</v>

225
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Momentum or momentum.</v>

226
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Momentum is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Momentum.</v>

227
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.420
<v Speaker 2>When I get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I get on a good groove of </v>

228
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.151
<v Speaker 2>working out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel it like after I'm done working </v>

229
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:38.151
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

230
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to get in there again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to work out again.</v>

231
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:44.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the good momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's that bad momentum like </v>

232
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.210
<v Speaker 2>you get injured or something like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't do anything for a couple </v>

233
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.970
<v Speaker 2>of weeks and then to try to get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickstart,</v>

234
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:49.360
<v Speaker 2>that meant motor up the end.</v>

235
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:55.090
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've caught some flack for saying that </v>

236
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:59.801
<v Speaker 2>there was these big science experiments </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something in the and they said that </v>

237
00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:02.760
<v Speaker 2>willpower dissipates throughout the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the more decisions you have to make,</v>

238
00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:05.850
<v Speaker 2>the weaker you get throughout the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's bs.</v>

239
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I agree with what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is when you wake up in the </v>

240
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:10.940
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd get a good workout.</v>

241
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 2>You don't lose willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually build it.</v>

242
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:13.890
<v Speaker 2>You feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel stronger,</v>

243
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 2>and then at lunchtime you you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

244
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the pizza and where's the </v>

245
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 2>donuts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

246
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 2>at lunchtime you already worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel good.</v>

247
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

248
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 2>where's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the steak?</v>

249
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:26.031
<v Speaker 2>Where's the protein?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that carries throughout the day as </v>

250
00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:27.870
<v Speaker 2>opposed to exactly what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is when you sleep in,</v>

251
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you skip your workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden the donuts are starting </v>

252
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.781
<v Speaker 2>to look pretty good and then the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing you know it's pizza and then we </v>

253
00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:35.781
<v Speaker 2>get home at night.</v>

254
00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:39.140
<v Speaker 2>You're just watching TV and that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue on for days and then days </v>

255
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.981
<v Speaker 2>turned into weeks and then the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing you know you're fat and out of </v>

256
00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:42.981
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

257
00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they did do that study,</v>

258
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:48.621
<v Speaker 2>like really I want to know what those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were eating because that's a big </v>

259
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:52.101
<v Speaker 2>factor too because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are eating shit food and </v>

260
00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 2>then by the end of the day your body's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a crisis,</v>

261
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Speaker 2>you're body's just processing all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

262
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people asked me that too.</v>

263
00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

264
00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 2>how much do you sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

265
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I could ask all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go to bed around 11.</v>

266
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up around 4:30</v>

267
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:02.640
<v Speaker 2>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's five and a half hours.</v>

268
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I sleep more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I go to bed at 10,</v>

269
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

270
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:06.450
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

271
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I stay up later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when the person says to me,</v>

272
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel horrible.</v>

274
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 2>How can I feel better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I.</v>

275
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.010
<v Speaker 2>my first question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

276
00:11:13.011 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 2>what are you eating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you eating?</v>

277
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're eating cheetos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate chip cookies for lunch,</v>

278
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you're going to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

279
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 2>And I don't care if you slept 12 hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night before.</v>

280
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

281
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're eating a big like bullshit</v>

282
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 2>lunch filled with nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your body's got to process all that</v>

283
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the end of the day,</v>

284
00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to lose your willpower.</v>

285
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 2>So like when 5:00,</v>
<v Speaker 2>6:00</v>

286
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:35.730
<v Speaker 2>rolls around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be tired.</v>

287
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.490
<v Speaker 2>But if you have a healthy lunch and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you're,</v>

288
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:44.491
<v Speaker 2>you're properly fueled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you also have positive people </v>

289
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:47.871
<v Speaker 2>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's motivated by the end of the </v>

290
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:47.871
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel good.</v>

291
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing Jujitsu with a bunch of </v>

292
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:51.260
<v Speaker 2>other people that are doing Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's enjoying it.</v>

293
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 2>You're looking forward to that 6:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

294
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get out of work.</v>

295
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 2>You fucking pumped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

296
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.780
<v Speaker 2>What you do when you get out of work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're filling up with water and trying </v>

297
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.961
<v Speaker 2>to get some electrolytes in you because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're going to get out there </v>

298
00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:06.151
<v Speaker 2>on the mats and you got to sweat it out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing you've got to do too is </v>

299
00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 2>when you get done with work and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>grind and you didn't get.</v>

300
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 2>You ate crappy food and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened happened and you got yelled at </v>

301
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 2>by your boss or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're real easy decision has to be</v>

302
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go try it tonight.</v>

303
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Those the night you got to train because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is going to kick you back onto </v>

304
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:20.400
<v Speaker 2>track real quick.</v>

305
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.820
<v Speaker 2>When you get in there and you see your </v>
<v Speaker 2>boys and they're getting ready to tear </v>

306
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.851
<v Speaker 2>you up on the mats and that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get you on track as opposed to going </v>

307
00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:27.550
<v Speaker 2>home and watching TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't gonna do anything for you.</v>

308
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it's not anything,</v>

309
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.350
<v Speaker 2>whenever the fuck you thing is just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do it.</v>

310
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Just force yourself to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you feel like shit because you </v>

311
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.121
<v Speaker 2>ate lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your lunch was filled with </v>

312
00:12:39.121 --> 00:12:39.121
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then,</v>

313
00:12:39.121 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 2>hey dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't eat shitty lunch tomorrow,</v>

314
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.830
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try a nice salad,</v>

315
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 2>a salad with some salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see how you feel.</v>

316
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

317
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I feel way better today at 6:00.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duh.</v>

318
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now your decision making will be better.</v>

319
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Like people don't understand how </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant it is.</v>

320
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Like all these little decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

321
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.910
<v Speaker 2>those are the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the path for the rest of your </v>

322
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.910
<v Speaker 2>existence on earth.</v>

323
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.850
<v Speaker 2>And if you decide to go to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheetos,</v>

324
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 2>chocolate chip cookie route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

325
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:06.850
<v Speaker 2>If you're just making a shit path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're carving your fucking path through</v>

326
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:09.780
<v Speaker 2>broken rocks and glass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not the way to go.</v>

327
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.790
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the life change decision isn't one big </v>

328
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Speaker 2>decision that you make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all these little tiny decisions.</v>

329
00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:16.350
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.210
<v Speaker 2>having a salad instead of cheetos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

331
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.500
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is on a daily basis.</v>

332
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.950
<v Speaker 2>And if you think about that and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just make the right decision on those </v>

333
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 2>little things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where,</v>

334
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.640
<v Speaker 2>that's where the change is reaching your</v>
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator.</v>

335
00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 2>You see the cocacola right next to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

336
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 2>just like to grab that water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do it and no,</v>

337
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do it and you'd be like,</v>

338
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 2>I fucking did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grabbed the water.</v>

339
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>water doesn't taste good compared to </v>

340
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:42.810
<v Speaker 2>coca cola.</v>

341
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 2>If your body is craving that heroin of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Coca Cola,</v>

342
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:50.550
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is if you were out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the desert and you saw a cold bottle of </v>

343
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:55.141
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be so excited for that </v>

344
00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:55.141
<v Speaker 2>water blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

345
00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:55.570
<v Speaker 2>it would be the most delicious thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

346
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 2>When you're at a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

347
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:57.910
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to eliminate,</v>

348
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.230
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want a soda.</v>

349
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want some.</v>

350
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Some mouth pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you've ever been truly thirsty </v>

351
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.491
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the desert and you haven't had </v>

352
00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:08.491
<v Speaker 2>water or you didn't bring enough water </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're really thirsty,</v>

353
00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:12.370
<v Speaker 2>you see coke isn't even appealing at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that nice nasty you can get to fill.</v>

354
00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:17.371
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get in that mode where you've been </v>

355
00:14:17.371 --> 00:14:17.371
<v Speaker 2>truly thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've been before.</v>

356
00:14:17.371 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not like I was going to die,</v>

357
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:22.890
<v Speaker 2>but I've been close to getting some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a heat stroke scenario happening and,</v>

358
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.870
<v Speaker 2>and then got to extreme pump the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink the water,</v>

359
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 2>and that's the most beautiful thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

360
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.120
<v Speaker 2>And you don't have water and you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet more so even if you get it from a </v>

361
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 2>stream and then pumping it through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>filter and you know,</v>

362
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.530
<v Speaker 2>just getting it right out of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

363
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

364
00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to have folks where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think people are supposed to struggle.</v>

365
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:45.180
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a part of us that longs for the </v>

366
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.911
<v Speaker 2>old times when we were just some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>primitive monkey people running away </v>

367
00:14:47.911 --> 00:14:48.940
<v Speaker 2>from animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that.</v>

368
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.950
<v Speaker 2>That's still in our DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no doubt that you have an </v>

369
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:53.950
<v Speaker 2>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why we play sports,</v>

370
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to play sports because you want </v>

371
00:14:57.701 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 2>to compete with people and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look at the rise of the UFC.</v>

372
00:14:57.711 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the most primal sport you</v>

373
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:01.790
<v Speaker 2>can possibly come up with is I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight you.</v>

374
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're going to do in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why is that so popular?</v>

375
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 2>We still have that instinct that we want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

376
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 2>We want to fight and we want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle.</v>

377
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:09.250
<v Speaker 2>We want to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

378
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Dana White and I have talked about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many times that it transcends every </v>

379
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like cricket is so giant in England,</v>

380
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then India,</v>

381
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.170
<v Speaker 2>try putting that shit on TV in America </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be like,</v>

382
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 2>good pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get that fucking stupid paddle game on </v>

383
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

384
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or conversely,</v>

385
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 2>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you played baseball to some country that</v>

386
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:31.400
<v Speaker 2>doesn't accept baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

387
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:33.440
<v Speaker 2>what is this nonsense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's takes forever.</v>

388
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Knowing the real sport of MMA like is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

389
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is unquestionably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sport and there are rules,</v>

390
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 2>but it transcends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's happening.</v>

391
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.960
<v Speaker 2>You might not understand the ground that</v>
<v Speaker 2>much when,</v>

392
00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:51.961
<v Speaker 2>when submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you see a guy turning red </v>

393
00:15:51.961 --> 00:15:53.110
<v Speaker 2>because the other guys behind him </v>
<v Speaker 2>choking the fucking life out of them,</v>

394
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:53.870
<v Speaker 2>you get it.</v>

395
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.640
<v Speaker 2>You see what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You understand it.</v>

396
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.900
<v Speaker 2>That's another cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ever,</v>

397
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.760
<v Speaker 2>you ever teach kids Jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

398
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.090
<v Speaker 2>It's so awesome to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to put this guy down and that's</v>

399
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.340
<v Speaker 2>all you need to say that they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

400
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 2>And then you give them a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

401
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.470
<v Speaker 2>little tastes of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you grabbed their legs and push </v>

402
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.371
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll fall down and that's all you </v>

403
00:16:15.371 --> 00:16:17.291
<v Speaker 2>need to tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there'll be basically doing </v>

404
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:18.380
<v Speaker 2>double leg take downs instinctively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's savage.</v>

405
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.850
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is beautiful.</v>

406
00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:20.790
<v Speaker 2>But you can't do that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.000
<v Speaker 2>with a regular sport like baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

408
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 2>What you're going to do is you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have this guy throw the ball to three</v>

409
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Speaker 2>times every time you swing up to Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that goes to him and he was,</v>

410
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 2>how's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

411
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also,</v>

412
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 2>there's something feels good about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>choking somebody,</v>

413
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

414
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 2>there's something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even if you're not hurting him,</v>

415
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just feels good is it feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're supposed to do it.</v>

416
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

417
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:50.330
<v Speaker 2>I think anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think anybody that tries it and gets </v>

418
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.951
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why that's why did you choose </v>

419
00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:53.951
<v Speaker 2>getting so popular because you take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>random person on the street,</v>

420
00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>

421
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 2>10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years old,</v>

422
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.820
<v Speaker 2>40 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put them on and you say,</v>

423
00:16:58.821 --> 00:17:03.821
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get them this other person in </v>

424
00:17:03.821 --> 00:17:03.821
<v Speaker 2>this position right here and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>their arm around,</v>

425
00:17:03.821 --> 00:17:08.020
<v Speaker 2>you get your arm around their neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kill them or you can accept that</v>

426
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:11.450
<v Speaker 2>you can accept their tap and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>have mercy on them.</v>

427
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.150
<v Speaker 2>That's a powerful feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

428
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.080
<v Speaker 2>We know what other things that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful about it is the two guys can be</v>

429
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 2>friends and practice killing each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not even hurt each other like,</v>

430
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.290
<v Speaker 2>like I'm sure you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

431
00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:28.291
<v Speaker 2>you've recognized that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel better working out with </v>

432
00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:28.291
<v Speaker 2>black belts.</v>

433
00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:32.110
<v Speaker 2>I feel safer for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Training with guys that are like super </v>

434
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.880
<v Speaker 2>high level than I do with even guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like an athletic white belt.</v>

435
00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 2>It might spazz out and accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>headbutted me.</v>

436
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I could ask that question all</v>

437
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:38.520
<v Speaker 2>the time too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>

438
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.590
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

439
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:41.930
<v Speaker 2>am I too old to start your Juto I'm 52 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

440
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm 49 years old and what I tell them </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

441
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.220
<v Speaker 2>you're not too old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely not too old,</v>

442
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 2>but you need to be smart and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>smartest you need to make is choosing</v>

443
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.740
<v Speaker 3>your training partners and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to train.</v>

444
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:57.741
<v Speaker 3>If you're a 52 year old guy that's never</v>
<v Speaker 3>trained before and you're a white belt </v>

445
00:17:57.741 --> 00:18:01.551
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to get on the mat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person you don't want to train with </v>

446
00:18:01.551 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 3>is the other white belt that's 22 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>old that's on steroids,</v>

447
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 3>that's going to go psycho and he's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

448
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.180
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just doesn't know how to control his </v>

449
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:11.180
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the black belt,</v>

450
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.270
<v Speaker 3>the black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the percentage chance of you being hurt </v>

451
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.780
<v Speaker 3>by a black belt if you're a white belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>

452
00:18:14.781 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying is nearly zero,</v>

453
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.960
<v Speaker 3>nearly zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero</v>

454
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.180
<v Speaker 1>if it's a legit blackbelt yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

455
00:18:20.181 --> 00:18:25.181
<v Speaker 1>I teach my kids class sometimes my kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a mixed martial arts class and the</v>

456
00:18:25.401 --> 00:18:30.401
<v Speaker 1>instructor asked me to come in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate one particular type of move </v>

457
00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:33.471
<v Speaker 1>the other day and so I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I demonstrated it and we were talking </v>

458
00:18:33.471 --> 00:18:35.780
<v Speaker 1>about some different positions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>important for kids to recognize like how</v>

459
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:38.480
<v Speaker 1>to make sure you don't get like kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>were given up their back where they were</v>

460
00:18:38.481 --> 00:18:43.481
<v Speaker 1>trying to pass guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to pass guard and they </v>

461
00:18:43.481 --> 00:18:45.941
<v Speaker 1>were pushing down and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never want to turn your shoulder </v>

462
00:18:45.941 --> 00:18:45.941
<v Speaker 1>like that because I had explained to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them the arm drag.</v>

463
00:18:45.941 --> 00:18:50.741
<v Speaker 1>So I'm explaining to these kids to arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>drag and you see the little brain </v>

464
00:18:50.741 --> 00:18:53.871
<v Speaker 1>spinning man and you see them practicing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on each other and they're laughing and </v>

465
00:18:53.871 --> 00:18:54.160
<v Speaker 1>they're girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

466
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.550
<v Speaker 1>So you're watching these eight year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls having the best time,</v>

467
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.760
<v Speaker 1>like choking each other and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and going through these motions.</v>

468
00:19:01.761 --> 00:19:05.390
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's fucking awesome man.</v>

469
00:19:05.391 --> 00:19:07.310
<v Speaker 1>These kids do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's getting hurt.</v>

470
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 1>They're having a great time with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and it's just this primal release </v>

471
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.600
<v Speaker 1>like let's get all that shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then you can</v>

472
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.530
<v Speaker 3>be civil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

473
00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:19.550
<v Speaker 3>well even if there's no Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>instruction involved and there's no mats</v>

474
00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:23.240
<v Speaker 3>around and you take two kids and you put</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in the yard,</v>

475
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.610
<v Speaker 3>eventually they're going to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling with each other.</v>

476
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.190
<v Speaker 3>Boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

477
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.220
<v Speaker 3>boys for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

478
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at a party</v>

479
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.840
<v Speaker 1>once with my kids and these two boys </v>
<v Speaker 1>started going at it and it neither one </v>

480
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.020
<v Speaker 1>of them at any training you could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just natural.</v>

481
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting their hips low and that </v>

482
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.411
<v Speaker 1>trying to push each other and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out and neither one of them </v>

483
00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:46.691
<v Speaker 1>knew what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of wanted to go up and start </v>

484
00:19:46.691 --> 00:19:46.691
<v Speaker 1>coaching them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're just playing in the grass.</v>

485
00:19:46.691 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

486
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:47.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

487
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.530
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating to see just natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>human instincts.</v>

488
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the other thing I've noticed </v>

489
00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.540
<v Speaker 3>in teaching kids Jujitsu is the kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are a little bit more cerebral,</v>

490
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.540
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

491
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.590
<v Speaker 3>the parents will think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

492
00:20:00.591 --> 00:20:01.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my son,</v>

493
00:20:01.281 --> 00:20:02.510
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of a nerd.</v>

494
00:20:02.511 --> 00:20:04.430
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of a smart kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's going to like this,</v>

495
00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:09.110
<v Speaker 3>but the opposite is actually true very </v>
<v Speaker 3>often where the kid that's cerebral,</v>

496
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.170
<v Speaker 3>he'll recognize as soon as you show them</v>
<v Speaker 3>three things,</v>

497
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.630
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wheels are turning.</v>

498
00:20:13.631 --> 00:20:14.740
<v Speaker 3>He's going to wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

499
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.740
<v Speaker 3>this is a skill I can learn and if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know this that and the other guy doesn't</v>

500
00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:20.150
<v Speaker 3>know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be able to beat him.</v>

501
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.920
<v Speaker 3>And so cerebral kids often get into it </v>
<v Speaker 3>even more than,</v>

502
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.710
<v Speaker 3>than some kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just kind of a natural bruiser Oh</v>

503
00:20:27.711 --> 00:20:32.711
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu is </v>

504
00:20:32.711 --> 00:20:32.711
<v Speaker 3>filled with nerds.</v>

505
00:20:32.711 --> 00:20:34.460
<v Speaker 3>They're all nerds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're assassin nerds.</v>

506
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.140
<v Speaker 3>It's really kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

507
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.590
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're,</v>

508
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.600
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not being facetious when you use </v>

509
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:42.920
<v Speaker 3>the word assassin nerds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

510
00:20:42.921 --> 00:20:43.730
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

511
00:20:43.731 --> 00:20:48.731
<v Speaker 3>if you go back before you knew Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I knew you did before I knew </v>

512
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all was a big navy shield,</v>

513
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 3>200 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those kids,</v>

514
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:56.140
<v Speaker 3>that's 145 pounds would absolutely have </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed me if we've got new fight,</v>

515
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take my back,</v>

516
00:20:57.041 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 3>put me to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

517
00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:58.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>

518
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put up an okay fight and hit him one </v>

519
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 3>time in the side of the head and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in on my back and put me to sleep.</v>

520
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.190
<v Speaker 3>That's the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nerd assassins coming at you strong.</v>

521
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

522
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.930
<v Speaker 3>It's a complex game of kinetic chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

523
00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:16.420
<v Speaker 3>it's more complex than chess because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

524
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:21.421
<v Speaker 3>in chess you've got these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces and they're restricted in their </v>

525
00:21:21.421 --> 00:21:21.421
<v Speaker 3>movements.</v>

526
00:21:21.421 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu's not restricted in its </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

527
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:27.361
<v Speaker 3>And every transition has so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different possibilities and so many </v>

528
00:21:27.361 --> 00:21:28.120
<v Speaker 3>different setups are so many different </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

529
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:32.470
<v Speaker 3>You get led one way and then just to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to defend so that they can establish</v>

530
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:37.471
<v Speaker 3>the second position and they get you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend that so they can establish a </v>

531
00:21:37.471 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 3>third position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

532
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 3>and that part of it is is what I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>really for me,</v>

533
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:47.131
<v Speaker 3>transferred from Jujitsu to not only to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the battlefield but to life as well </v>

534
00:21:47.131 --> 00:21:51.421
<v Speaker 3>because the big thing in Jujitsu from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective is that you don't go </v>

535
00:21:51.421 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 3>strength against strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

536
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.280
<v Speaker 3>If I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm trying to choke you,</v>

537
00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't try and choke you overtly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't just grab your neck.</v>

538
00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:02.551
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work on your arm and I put pressure </v>

539
00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:02.551
<v Speaker 3>over here and I pass your guard and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eventually,</v>

540
00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:03.730
<v Speaker 3>while you're thinking about something </v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

541
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:08.850
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when I grabbed your neck or </v>

542
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:08.850
<v Speaker 3>that's when I grabbed her arm and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I think on the battlefield.</v>

543
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

544
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 3>you just don't attack hardened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions of the enemy and in life,</v>

545
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're trying to be a leader,</v>

546
00:22:14.471 --> 00:22:15.820
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to step up and lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

547
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:21.300
<v Speaker 3>If you don't just come down and bark </v>
<v Speaker 3>orders at people because that's not as </v>

548
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.051
<v Speaker 3>effective as maneuvering and adjusting </v>
<v Speaker 3>your position and getting in a better </v>

549
00:22:25.241 --> 00:22:29.200
<v Speaker 3>position and then getting that person to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you what you want instead of trying</v>

550
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:30.310
<v Speaker 3>to take it from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

551
00:22:30.311 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a really important lesson for </v>
<v Speaker 3>parenthood.</v>

552
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't just tell kids what to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

553
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Just do it because I told you to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

554
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:43.111
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be a hooker and that </v>

555
00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:46.210
<v Speaker 3>applies not only to kids at your hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent applies to kids,</v>

556
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:51.350
<v Speaker 3>but it applies to adults as well and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is people need to understand why </v>

557
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.350
<v Speaker 3>they're doing what they're doing and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

558
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 3>if I want you to go take down some </v>
<v Speaker 3>building and capture some bad guy,</v>

559
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

560
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.690
<v Speaker 3>hey joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to go take down this </v>

561
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.690
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>

562
00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Once you capture the bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the guys I want you to take </v>

563
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.470
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the route I want you to take in.</v>

564
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.131
<v Speaker 3>Here's the methodology I want you to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the clearance because then when I </v>

565
00:23:05.131 --> 00:23:05.230
<v Speaker 3>send you to go do that mission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not your mission,</v>

566
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.240
<v Speaker 3>it's my mission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came up with the plan.</v>

567
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.770
<v Speaker 3>You didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you might be.</v>

568
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:14.100
<v Speaker 3>You might have thought there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better way to do it or you might have </v>

569
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.100
<v Speaker 3>had a different idea of how to get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>

570
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.550
<v Speaker 3>and now when you go out there and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>meet some kind of resistance,</v>

571
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:20.551
<v Speaker 3>whether it's an obstacle you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>expect or whether it's some scenario </v>

572
00:23:20.551 --> 00:23:20.950
<v Speaker 3>that you didn't foresee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of you trying to overcome it,</v>

573
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:22.430
<v Speaker 3>you just blame me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just looked at Jocko,</v>

574
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.220
<v Speaker 3>came up with a stupid plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here we are.</v>

575
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:24.820
<v Speaker 3>It's failing.</v>

576
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going back.</v>

577
00:23:26.081 --> 00:23:27.160
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to carry out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mission.</v>

578
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey joe,</v>

579
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.740
<v Speaker 3>here's what I want you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go figure out the best way to do it and </v>

580
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.951
<v Speaker 3>now you come up with a plan and now you </v>
<v Speaker 3>make up all the methodology of how </v>

581
00:23:37.951 --> 00:23:41.551
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get it done and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide who you're going to take with </v>

582
00:23:41.551 --> 00:23:41.551
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's your plan.</v>

583
00:23:41.551 --> 00:23:45.150
<v Speaker 3>You own that plant and when you go out </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the field and you meet a little </v>

584
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:45.150
<v Speaker 3>resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess what you do?</v>

585
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find a way around it.</v>

586
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to overcome</v>

587
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:51.280
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to overcome that obstacle and </v>

588
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.591
<v Speaker 2>to make it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's another piece of leadership </v>

589
00:23:52.591 --> 00:23:52.670
<v Speaker 2>and it's the exact same thing with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you tell your kid,</v>

590
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you know you will get good grades in </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

591
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.310
<v Speaker 2>that means nothing to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you explain to them,</v>

592
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love for you to get good grades </v>

593
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:03.490
<v Speaker 2>and here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to open opportunities for you</v>

594
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.511
<v Speaker 2>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to allow you to be able to </v>

595
00:24:07.511 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 2>outsmart people because you can have </v>
<v Speaker 2>more knowledge than them and then you're</v>

596
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:09.500
<v Speaker 2>gonna be able to end up making more </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

597
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 2>which is actually gonna give you more </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom in the long run.</v>

598
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Instead of doing a job that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do.</v>

599
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:18.490
<v Speaker 2>You explain all those things to a kid is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a lot more successful than </v>

600
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:18.490
<v Speaker 2>just do what I told you.</v>

601
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Get good grades because I said so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

602
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:24.941
<v Speaker 2>when you do these conferences where when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you speak it at a businesses and they </v>

603
00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:29.190
<v Speaker 2>bring you in to sort of have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership meeting,</v>

604
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call them?</v>

605
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their leadership seminars,</v>

606
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.910
<v Speaker 2>seminars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you have these seminars or </v>

607
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:36.910
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

608
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 2>some of the principles that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed when you talk about.</v>

609
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

610
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's another,</v>

611
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:44.501
<v Speaker 2>another big piece of this is that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>just ideas about interacting with human </v>

612
00:24:44.501 --> 00:24:45.530
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't change.</v>

613
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a little variance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whether you're dealing with kids or </v>

614
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.591
<v Speaker 2>whether you're dealing with adults and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're dealing with business </v>

615
00:24:53.591 --> 00:24:55.511
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're dealing with soldiers on </v>

616
00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:55.511
<v Speaker 2>the battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leadership principles,</v>

617
00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:59.621
<v Speaker 2>they don't change and therefore you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're trying to get people to </v>

618
00:24:59.621 --> 00:25:04.031
<v Speaker 2>go out and capture and kill a bad guy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're trying to get them to </v>

619
00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:07.360
<v Speaker 2>build some product and sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the principal's leadership don't change.</v>

620
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.330
<v Speaker 2>You're still trying to get a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally independent people.</v>

621
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the myths we have to </v>

622
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:16.360
<v Speaker 2>overcome a lot because everyone thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

623
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.060
<v Speaker 2>in the military have just like a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just not true.</v>

624
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in the military is free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people,</v>

625
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 2>they're people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're free thinking people and they're</v>

626
00:25:21.651 --> 00:25:26.651
<v Speaker 2>gonna come up with own ideas they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna have with their own agendas and </v>

627
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:28.751
<v Speaker 2>they're going to think of ways to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that they think are better than </v>

628
00:25:28.751 --> 00:25:31.811
<v Speaker 2>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're gonna have all these </v>

629
00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:33.041
<v Speaker 2>independent free thinkers and you got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them onboard with the same plan to </v>

630
00:25:33.041 --> 00:25:36.690
<v Speaker 2>you to go out and execute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it doesn't matter if you're on </v>

631
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:36.690
<v Speaker 2>the battlefield or in business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>

632
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:41.740
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're trying to get done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the leadership principles don't </v>

633
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:41.740
<v Speaker 2>change that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

634
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 2>that's as a person who's never been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the military.</v>

635
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:45.650
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the fascinating aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it works is like how,</v>

636
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.160
<v Speaker 2>how do you get all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to follow through on a plan and </v>

637
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.300
<v Speaker 2>who are the leaders and why did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders have the right ideas and who </v>

638
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.620
<v Speaker 2>educates them as to how the have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right idea to having the right ideas.</v>

639
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I know that a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about where the military is </v>

640
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.761
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Tim Kennedy re enlisted and he the </v>

641
00:26:06.761 --> 00:26:06.761
<v Speaker 2>lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

642
00:26:06.761 --> 00:26:08.390
<v Speaker 2>he resisted because he believes that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>military has support now and look,</v>

643
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Tim Kennedy's believes he was put on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this earth to kill bad guys and that's </v>

644
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.570
<v Speaker 2>what he wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I agree with Tim Kennedy.</v>

645
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I think I agree with them too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

646
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Obviously he enjoys it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not fucking around me.</v>

647
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.320
<v Speaker 2>He went back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he put his money where his mouth is and </v>

648
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.570
<v Speaker 2>in his eyes that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

649
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.980
<v Speaker 2>this is the way that it should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>

650
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.340
<v Speaker 2>that you should give the military the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance to do their job.</v>

651
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.650
<v Speaker 2>That's their idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then other people believe that there</v>

652
00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 2>should be much more civilian oversight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they should be much more,</v>

653
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.190
<v Speaker 2>much more checks and balances before </v>
<v Speaker 2>things get done.</v>

654
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.110
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

655
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 3>is a big debate that's going on today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

656
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:48.060
<v Speaker 3>I think there's two different things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you just talked about.</v>

657
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 3>That is what the military gets told to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do and how they do it.</v>

658
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.510
<v Speaker 3>And those are two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

659
00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.300
<v Speaker 3>I think that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you absolutely,</v>

660
00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:02.301
<v Speaker 3>the civilians should control and do </v>
<v Speaker 3>control the military by the way they do </v>

661
00:27:02.301 --> 00:27:06.531
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The civilians are undercut or the </v>

662
00:27:06.531 --> 00:27:07.200
<v Speaker 3>military is under controlled civilians </v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet once you say,</v>

663
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:08.760
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we want to have happen,</v>

664
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:14.510
<v Speaker 3>you need to let the military </v>
<v Speaker 3>professionals figure out how they're </v>

665
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.510
<v Speaker 3>going to go and make it happen.</v>

666
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

667
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.660
<v Speaker 4>that's where it gets tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

668
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.720
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're in like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that was explained to me by a </v>

669
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.370
<v Speaker 4>friend who's navy seal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was saying that when something needs </v>

670
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.521
<v Speaker 4>to get done and you have all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are telling you how you can </v>

671
00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.210
<v Speaker 4>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you can't do it,</v>

672
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:36.350
<v Speaker 4>that people that are not in experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 4>combat and don't understand what,</v>

673
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:41.630
<v Speaker 4>what could or could not go sideways like</v>
<v Speaker 4>to put more problems in place or to put </v>

674
00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:47.131
<v Speaker 4>more checks and balances in place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually going to put these </v>

675
00:27:47.131 --> 00:27:47.131
<v Speaker 4>people in</v>

676
00:27:47.131 --> 00:27:47.780
<v Speaker 3>danger that that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>

677
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you let the civilians decide what it </v>

678
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.441
<v Speaker 3>is that needs to be accomplished and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then the military leaders decide how </v>

679
00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:59.000
<v Speaker 3>they're going to go ahead and make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen and I mean it goes back to,</v>

680
00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.370
<v Speaker 3>goes back to Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

681
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:05.380
<v Speaker 3>there was too much civilian oversight of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was happening in Vietnam and the </v>

682
00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.440
<v Speaker 3>military leaders were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't really have the,</v>

683
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.600
<v Speaker 3>the wherewithal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even the wherewithal.</v>

684
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:16.630
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have the free reign to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and try and make things happen the </v>

685
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.630
<v Speaker 3>way they want to do and it ended up in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big quagmire.</v>

686
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam seems like to me,</v>

687
00:28:18.381 --> 00:28:21.110
<v Speaker 3>from an outsider to be one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up wars ever,</v>

688
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:21.950
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

689
00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:27.060
<v Speaker 4>It didn't totally make sense that it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening and then now we know that the </v>

690
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.021
<v Speaker 4>Gulf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Gulf of Tonkin was very likely a </v>

691
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:34.171
<v Speaker 4>false flag and that there was some sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of motivation to get there in the first </v>

692
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:37.291
<v Speaker 4>place and then you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>guerrilla warfare for the first time </v>

693
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:40.201
<v Speaker 4>ever in US history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they didn't exactly know how to </v>

694
00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:40.201
<v Speaker 4>handle this.</v>

695
00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:41.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't and we didn't adapt very well.</v>

696
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:47.110
<v Speaker 3>To what was happening on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is always going to be problematic </v>

697
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.380
<v Speaker 3>if you have closed minded people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military,</v>

698
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:53.440
<v Speaker 3>if people are closed mind that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to be able to move forward </v>

699
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:53.440
<v Speaker 3>against,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

700
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.140
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the battlefield changes and the </v>

701
00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:57.140
<v Speaker 3>battlefield changes all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

702
00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:57.140
<v Speaker 3>you can look at Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq,</v>

703
00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.650
<v Speaker 3>the battlefield change drastically from </v>
<v Speaker 3>this big conventional force that we went</v>

704
00:29:00.651 --> 00:29:02.870
<v Speaker 3>up there to fight against Saddam's big </v>
<v Speaker 3>army.</v>

705
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once that fell apart,</v>

706
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.160
<v Speaker 3>then what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now all of a sudden we were facing </v>

707
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.081
<v Speaker 3>gorillas again and an insurgency and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>took us several years to change our </v>

708
00:29:11.081 --> 00:29:12.440
<v Speaker 3>strategy from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't even know what to do.</v>

709
00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:13.540
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

710
00:29:13.541 --> 00:29:14.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we do?</v>

711
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:19.070
<v Speaker 3>There's all these people running around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we do with these all these </v>

712
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.070
<v Speaker 3>people running around and how do we get </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people under control and,</v>

713
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.140
<v Speaker 3>and the civilians want us here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

714
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:26.200
<v Speaker 3>and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we don't do the right thing now the </v>

715
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.200
<v Speaker 3>civilians don't want us here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we need to do?</v>

716
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.860
<v Speaker 3>So it took us some time to adjust our </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy in Iraq.</v>

717
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:33.220
<v Speaker 3>And Luckily we had some good leaders </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that went ahead and made those </v>

718
00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:33.220
<v Speaker 3>changes.</v>

719
00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:37.450
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it also that when when you're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>war and the strategy and not the </v>

720
00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.870
<v Speaker 4>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the is very clear,</v>

721
00:29:38.871 --> 00:29:41.120
<v Speaker 4>like if you fight against Hitler's army </v>
<v Speaker 4>in World War Two,</v>

722
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 4>but this is very</v>

723
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 3>clear that you're dealing with an evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>force.</v>

724
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in Vietnam it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

725
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Speaker 3>why are we here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's going on?</v>

726
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Communism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happening?</v>

727
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely challenging,</v>

728
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:58.110
<v Speaker 3>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that that is why I've talked about </v>

729
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.540
<v Speaker 3>this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

730
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 3>if America or any nation is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to war,</v>

731
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 3>you have to decide that this is the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>important thing in the world.</v>

732
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 3>You have to end the wills that I talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

733
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:11.080
<v Speaker 3>that you have to have to execute this </v>
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>

734
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.740
<v Speaker 3>You gotta have you gotTa have the will </v>
<v Speaker 3>to kill people.</v>

735
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.780
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say this all the time,</v>

736
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:19.630
<v Speaker 3>no one wants to hear it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>ugly and horrible,</v>

737
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 3>but when you say you're gonna kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in war,</v>

738
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 3>you're not just going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly killed just the bad guys.</v>

739
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.690
<v Speaker 3>Civilians are going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a nightmare.</v>

740
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

741
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awful,</v>

742
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 3>and if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

743
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:35.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to war and we're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to kill the bad guys,</v>

744
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not gonna happen in war is too </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex.</v>

745
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.390
<v Speaker 3>It's just not going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be saying like,</v>

746
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go and fight in the UFC and</v>

747
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:43.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to happen.</v>

748
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get bruised up,</v>

749
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:47.890
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get dinged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the same thing in war.</v>

750
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 3>So you have to have the will to kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

751
00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Of course it's easy to have the will to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill the bad guys,</v>

752
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.900
<v Speaker 3>but then you have to accept the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that some innocent people are going to </v>

753
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:01.501
<v Speaker 3>die and that is going to be awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then on the other side of the coin </v>

754
00:31:01.501 --> 00:31:02.770
<v Speaker 3>is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to send people to war,</v>

755
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:07.890
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans are going to die and there's </v>

756
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:07.890
<v Speaker 3>nothing you can do about it.</v>

757
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.460
<v Speaker 3>You have to accept that fact and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

758
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:14.410
<v Speaker 3>that's why Vietnam was just the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy and in many respects,</v>

759
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:16.350
<v Speaker 3>because we were killing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilians.</v>

760
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:21.380
<v Speaker 3>We were losing a lot of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we weren't progressing the way we </v>

761
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:21.380
<v Speaker 3>needed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a nightmare.</v>

762
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.370
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about transparency?</v>

763
00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:29.371
<v Speaker 3>Like when the Bush administration </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't let them take photographs of </v>

764
00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:33.160
<v Speaker 3>coffins and send them home like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were really upset because there's</v>

765
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:34.570
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

766
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:39.571
<v Speaker 3>America should know that there's a cost </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this and they should know that </v>

767
00:31:39.571 --> 00:31:43.771
<v Speaker 3>there's consequences to these actions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were saying that these </v>

768
00:31:43.771 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 3>consequences and knowing about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences could lesson morale,</v>

769
00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:48.340
<v Speaker 3>could lessen support back at home when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they really need it,</v>

770
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:53.341
<v Speaker 3>and the people didn't really need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know this is what they need to know is </v>

771
00:31:53.341 --> 00:31:53.341
<v Speaker 3>we're on the right track and we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

772
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.710
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whether it's the right decision to </v>

773
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.471
<v Speaker 3>keep the Americans and their beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>bubble that they live in and let them </v>

774
00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:04.621
<v Speaker 3>know that this war is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to see the brave </v>

775
00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Americans coming home that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrificed their lives.</v>

776
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.440
<v Speaker 3>And interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you remember,</v>

777
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Tara,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the battle of when World War II and</v>

778
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.410
<v Speaker 3>for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we were,</v>

779
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.870
<v Speaker 3>we needed money to run world war two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of money,</v>

780
00:32:16.871 --> 00:32:21.871
<v Speaker 3>war bonds and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we were kind of falling behind and </v>

781
00:32:21.871 --> 00:32:24.961
<v Speaker 3>we needed some money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the first times that they </v>

782
00:32:24.961 --> 00:32:28.600
<v Speaker 3>released a lot of pictures of American </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead Americans was,</v>

783
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.690
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the battle of Tarawa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was all these Americans </v>

784
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:34.930
<v Speaker 3>washing up on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean marines that had drowned,</v>

785
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.700
<v Speaker 3>got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was awful.</v>

786
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.930
<v Speaker 3>But they did it for a reason.</v>

787
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.230
<v Speaker 3>They did it to show like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

788
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.000
<v Speaker 3>this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is happening.</v>

789
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.220
<v Speaker 3>We need to put pitch in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need money,</v>

790
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.710
<v Speaker 3>we need to save,</v>
<v Speaker 3>save,</v>

791
00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 3>meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>save a oil,</v>

792
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.680
<v Speaker 3>don't use your cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all need to get in for the big win,</v>

793
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the opposite of what we're </v>

794
00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:56.920
<v Speaker 3>talking about when they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

795
00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.671
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to take pictures of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of native Americans that are being </v>

796
00:33:00.671 --> 00:33:00.671
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

797
00:33:00.671 --> 00:33:04.720
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there should be some level of </v>

798
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 3>transparency there when you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>America should see what is happening,</v>

799
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:08.390
<v Speaker 3>what is the cost?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's real easy for Americans to,</v>

800
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.600
<v Speaker 3>to sit there and allow these young kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go overseas and fight and die or be </v>

801
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.510
<v Speaker 3>wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gravely wounded,</v>

802
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.620
<v Speaker 3>and just to shut those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just ignore them because I'm,</v>

803
00:33:17.621 --> 00:33:19.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't care because I'm over here in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mall.</v>

804
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should,</v>

805
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:21.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should not only,</v>

806
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:26.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should not only show pictures </v>

807
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 3>of the coffins that are coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe we should explore and show the</v>

808
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:33.281
<v Speaker 3>lives that those men sacrificed and who </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were and what they did and what </v>

809
00:33:33.281 --> 00:33:36.611
<v Speaker 3>their families are like and their wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kids and mom and dad that they left </v>

810
00:33:36.611 --> 00:33:36.620
<v Speaker 3>behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they gave up.</v>

811
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.170
<v Speaker 3>And why did they give it up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they believed in freedom.</v>

812
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.810
<v Speaker 3>And so now we just going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

813
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.020
<v Speaker 3>that's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

814
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:43.220
<v Speaker 3>it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you need to,</v>

815
00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:45.650
<v Speaker 3>you need to know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of strange,</v>

816
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:50.651
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think about how little access </v>

817
00:33:50.651 --> 00:33:50.651
<v Speaker 3>to information people really had back in</v>
<v Speaker 3>world war two,</v>

818
00:33:50.651 --> 00:33:54.611
<v Speaker 3>they were counting on the news and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were counting on newspapers and now </v>

819
00:33:54.611 --> 00:33:57.641
<v Speaker 3>today we have massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive access to information </v>

820
00:33:57.641 --> 00:33:58.940
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yet you get less of it when it comes</v>

821
00:33:58.941 --> 00:34:00.230
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

822
00:34:00.231 --> 00:34:01.820
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in some ways you get more of it.</v>

823
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:04.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously when there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incident that happens overseas,</v>

824
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:09.250
<v Speaker 3>you can find out about it on twitter as </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast as you can find out about it </v>

825
00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:09.250
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

826
00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:10.760
<v Speaker 3>waiting for a real nice horse to come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

827
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
<v Speaker 3>But you don't get anything that's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically distributed by the US </v>

828
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 3>government to let you know the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of war and say,</v>

829
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Hey folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need your support.</v>

830
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:25.090
<v Speaker 3>This is what's really going down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are American citizens and this is </v>

831
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:25.090
<v Speaker 3>what's happening to them over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

832
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.500
<v Speaker 3>And then the same thing could be said </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

833
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.560
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes civilians are going to get </v>

834
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:32.930
<v Speaker 3>killed and what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we do?</v>

835
00:34:32.931 --> 00:34:37.931
<v Speaker 3>Then do we brush that under the rug and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we just show the Americans getting </v>

836
00:34:37.931 --> 00:34:41.501
<v Speaker 3>killed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do you universally show what's </v>

837
00:34:41.501 --> 00:34:41.750
<v Speaker 3>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What war is men wore is jacked up.</v>

838
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>war is not glorious.</v>

839
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.120
<v Speaker 3>It is not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is,</v>

840
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 3>it is a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible event.</v>

841
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.790
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should expose it and I think</v>

842
00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:57.791
<v Speaker 3>you should expose it at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a high level so that people </v>

843
00:34:57.791 --> 00:34:57.791
<v Speaker 3>understand what we're getting into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

844
00:34:57.791 --> 00:35:02.550
<v Speaker 3>and as horrible as war is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's many times throughout history </v>

845
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.760
<v Speaker 3>where war is the absolute in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

846
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:09.850
<v Speaker 3>the right thing to do and we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a choice and we need to do something </v>

847
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:10.460
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when horrible things are happening.</v>

848
00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:11.690
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

849
00:35:11.691 --> 00:35:12.830
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

850
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.470
<v Speaker 3>on my podcast I talk about like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

851
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I talk about war and death and horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>genocide and,</v>

852
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:23.190
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's gotten a lot of traction is </v>

853
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.740
<v Speaker 3>because I'm talking about things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are otherwise being ignored.</v>

854
00:35:24.741 --> 00:35:28.880
<v Speaker 3>And I think people do want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people do want to understand war</v>

855
00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:33.881
<v Speaker 3>to deeper level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that way when they hear a politician </v>

856
00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:33.881
<v Speaker 3>to up there saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

857
00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 3>we should go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can at least save themselves.</v>

858
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.740
<v Speaker 3>I know what I know what he's talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

859
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 3>And he's not just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

860
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:44.541
<v Speaker 3>we're going to wave the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going gonna send some soldiers </v>

861
00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:46.491
<v Speaker 3>over there and they're kick ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come home and we're </v>

862
00:35:46.491 --> 00:35:46.491
<v Speaker 3>gonna high five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what war is.</v>

863
00:35:46.491 --> 00:35:48.420
<v Speaker 3>And let's not ever forget that.</v>

864
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:53.420
<v Speaker 3>That's not what war is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>War is a man and another man on a </v>

865
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 3>battlefield surrounded by people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilians,</v>

866
00:35:55.951 --> 00:36:00.951
<v Speaker 3>and they're trying to kill each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a blood bath and we shouldn't </v>

867
00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:01.800
<v Speaker 3>forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is it necessary?</v>

868
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:03.570
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It absolutely is.</v>

869
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:08.750
<v Speaker 3>It absolutely is necessary sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we better way our our minds heavily </v>

870
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.610
<v Speaker 3>before we make that decision to go and </v>
<v Speaker 3>execute.</v>

871
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about the evolution of </v>

872
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.861
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you think about how much safer it is </v>

873
00:36:18.861 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 3>today versus how it was thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

874
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever foresee a time where war </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't exist?</v>

875
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

876
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.720
<v Speaker 3>people joke with me a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>robot wars and and robots being able to </v>

877
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:34.731
<v Speaker 3>accomplish wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually believed that thing will </v>

878
00:36:34.731 --> 00:36:37.491
<v Speaker 3>come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've got drones right now that </v>

879
00:36:37.491 --> 00:36:39.780
<v Speaker 3>that are very capable and pretty soon </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have land warfare robots that will</v>

880
00:36:39.781 --> 00:36:44.781
<v Speaker 3>be able to go in and clear buildings and</v>
<v Speaker 3>make things happen and then we'll the </v>

881
00:36:44.781 --> 00:36:48.000
<v Speaker 3>enemy then have robots that will fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>our robots at some point.</v>

882
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then at some point will that elevate</v>

883
00:36:51.211 --> 00:36:53.310
<v Speaker 3>to a point where we're not dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical robots anymore,</v>

884
00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:58.311
<v Speaker 3>but just the software behind the robots </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now it's just a big sort of cyber </v>

885
00:36:58.311 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 3>warfare that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems conceivable to me now joe,</v>

886
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:08.060
<v Speaker 3>don't mistake me for some kind of like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris intellectual over here or </v>

887
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:12.090
<v Speaker 3>that I'm going to sit here and explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you what the future of warfare from a</v>

888
00:37:12.091 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 3>technical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from my,</v>

889
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.780
<v Speaker 3>from my rudimentary thought process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could it not elevate to a point where we</v>

890
00:37:18.781 --> 00:37:23.781
<v Speaker 3>have robots fighting robots and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>that eventually escalates to a point </v>

891
00:37:23.781 --> 00:37:23.800
<v Speaker 3>where it's some kind of cyber warfare </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

892
00:37:23.801 --> 00:37:26.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just information based and that</v>

893
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 3>does make sense to me that that could </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

894
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense to me too.</v>

895
00:37:30.001 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you see those Boston </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamic robots.</v>

896
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen those are all things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kick them over,</v>

897
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:36.810
<v Speaker 3>they bounced back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run up hills.</v>

898
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:40.380
<v Speaker 3>They can run like 60 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The freaks.</v>

899
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's really what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>now is just.</v>

900
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows where they're going to be 10 </v>

901
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:48.500
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're going to be solar powered</v>

902
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.450
<v Speaker 3>the live out there with no food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

903
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.170
<v Speaker 3>it'll be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

904
00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:54.900
<v Speaker 3>And then then where we go with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>robots,</v>

905
00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:59.930
<v Speaker 3>fight people for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably people that don't know any </v>

906
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.990
<v Speaker 3>people that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that don't have good robots yet </v>

907
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.390
<v Speaker 3>and that's not going to be fun for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people without robots.</v>

908
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we'll see where it goes from there.</v>

909
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's just a surrender </v>

910
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:12.130
<v Speaker 3>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

911
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:12.130
<v Speaker 3>If you got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

912
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:16.020
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If let's say America has these robots </v>

913
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.681
<v Speaker 3>that can just come in with ruthless </v>
<v Speaker 3>precision and take out bad guys and you </v>

914
00:38:18.931 --> 00:38:23.931
<v Speaker 3>know you're going to be at their mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking science fiction be </v>

915
00:38:23.931 --> 00:38:28.170
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like China develops robots that take </v>

916
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:28.170
<v Speaker 3>over New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at this guy.</v>

917
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking as one of these buses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>robots.</v>

918
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.160
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird,</v>

919
00:38:32.161 --> 00:38:33.810
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To see them moving around.</v>

920
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what's interesting,</v>

921
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some other ones</v>

922
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:41.160
<v Speaker 1>like you don't need them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put all this effort into making it </v>

923
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 1>actually walk instead of have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

924
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:46.740
<v Speaker 1>wheels or tracks or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wheels or tracks with a little pods </v>

925
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 1>that could get over things would be they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want this to look like for a person.</v>

926
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:53.401
<v Speaker 1>For some reason a human shape is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the most effective structure</v>

927
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Speaker 1>for fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even real for us.</v>

928
00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

929
00:38:58.451 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Apparently that's one of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>our backs are so fucked up.</v>

930
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:07.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't even talk us into standing up </v>

931
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:07.620
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

932
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:07.620
<v Speaker 1>can pick up 10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

933
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm better than that.</v>

934
00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this robot someday though.</v>

935
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

936
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.080
<v Speaker 1>we like things that look like us for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason.</v>

937
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:22.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we liked the idea that this thing is </v>

938
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.190
<v Speaker 1>going to look like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

939
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

940
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.660
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to and it should </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not the best.</v>

941
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:27.661
<v Speaker 1>And the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real combat robots probably won't </v>

942
00:39:27.661 --> 00:39:28.210
<v Speaker 1>look like they won't be bipedal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

943
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.910
<v Speaker 1>They won't be bipedal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll probably have a little treads or</v>

944
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:34.020
<v Speaker 1>something and just haul ass at 60 miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour with the machine guns.</v>

945
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:35.880
<v Speaker 1>They'll have many legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a.</v>

946
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that one that was like a </v>

947
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 1>cheetah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>

948
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:44.150
<v Speaker 1>some crazy one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Cheetah and it runs at some </v>

949
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.410
<v Speaker 1>fucking ridiculous speed and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>

950
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.440
<v Speaker 1>They had one that was on a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this the Cheetah one again?</v>

951
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:54.810
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously not the best galloping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best structure because you </v>

952
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:59.881
<v Speaker 1>have to make this thing up and run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with wheels on it or treads or </v>

953
00:39:59.881 --> 00:40:00.160
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a tank.</v>

954
00:40:00.161 --> 00:40:01.630
<v Speaker 1>A tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

955
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.110
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder like for getting over logs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that,</v>

956
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:10.111
<v Speaker 1>if there's any sort of benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also have those ones that leap up </v>

957
00:40:10.111 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 1>in the air and they can go over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go over the top of walls and shit.</v>

958
00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you need is some kind of </v>

959
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.080
<v Speaker 1>legs that can pop out if they need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

960
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should just design this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and take a look.</v>

961
00:40:16.751 --> 00:40:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one of the wheels.</v>

962
00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you guys got get the best of both.</v>

963
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking terrifying.</v>

964
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.720
<v Speaker 1>That was got front legs and back wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

965
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.740
<v Speaker 1>They're not fucking playing games and </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't google buy them in that Google </v>

966
00:40:31.961 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 1>skynet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we should be careful of.</v>

967
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Google is powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

968
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Their big announcement they made this </v>
<v Speaker 1>week about their google io at assistant </v>

969
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.430
<v Speaker 1>ai stuff is pretty crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a bunch of information so I</v>

970
00:40:45.431 --> 00:40:50.431
<v Speaker 1>can't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look it up because we're getting </v>

971
00:40:50.431 --> 00:40:52.711
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like the Google theory type </v>

972
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:52.711
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

973
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:52.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

974
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:52.711
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is for the new pixel phone.</v>

975
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

976
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:58.500
<v Speaker 1>What does it was launched an extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>announcements on top of that to what's </v>

977
00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:58.500
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be significant.</v>

978
00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that thing?</v>

979
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Jump over a fucking look at this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

980
00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:02.230
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

981
00:41:02.231 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 1>You Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that thing.</v>

982
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.230
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without even knowing it,</v>

983
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I was saying wheels is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go back,</v>

984
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.850
<v Speaker 1>rewind that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch it.</v>

985
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Go over the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He jumps over a wall.</v>

986
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.090
<v Speaker 1>We'll a little bit before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

987
00:41:16.091 --> 00:41:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch with this fucking thing.</v>

988
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Can do man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After it does this,</v>

989
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.240
<v Speaker 1>it goes down these stairs and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to.</v>

990
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets to this wall like a hurdle and </v>

991
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.720
<v Speaker 1>it fucking bounces over this hurdle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's nothing.</v>

992
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.340
<v Speaker 1>There's snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>

993
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:35.341
<v Speaker 1>Grass doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't break one of those stupid </v>

994
00:41:35.341 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 1>wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

995
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:37.640
<v Speaker 1>what are those wheels made out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shoot one of those wheels,</v>

996
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I think fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at it.</v>

997
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Bounces right over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

998
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Tucks its legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks terrifying and they put it </v>

999
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 1>covered in like some creepy fucking fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

1000
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Like an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1001
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd put sensors on it,</v>

1002
00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 1>a thermal sensors and night vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensors and you wouldn't be able to get </v>

1003
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 1>away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:56.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's something you down and kill you.</v>

1005
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean just think about that technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then add that tesla technology for </v>

1006
00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.400
<v Speaker 1>self driving cars and knows where all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cars are and everything.</v>

1007
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:10.510
<v Speaker 1>We're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just a few years away from </v>

1008
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.510
<v Speaker 1>something very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre.</v>

1009
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of look forward to it.</v>

1010
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Bring on the robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the flight or I'll go down to a </v>

1011
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.520
<v Speaker 1>blaze of glory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:22.820
<v Speaker 1>That's ripping out battery chords and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to take their lives.</v>

1013
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator,</v>

1014
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:29.921
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because when the Google </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant can see and understand the </v>

1015
00:42:29.921 --> 00:42:29.921
<v Speaker 1>world around you,</v>

1016
00:42:29.921 --> 00:42:34.420
<v Speaker 5>they built that like google the Google </v>
<v Speaker 5>Lens thing that used to be existing and </v>

1017
00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.231
<v Speaker 5>they took it away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of just built that thing you </v>

1018
00:42:38.231 --> 00:42:38.231
<v Speaker 5>tried,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1019
00:42:38.231 --> 00:42:41.880
<v Speaker 5>you mean Google Glass Lens is that thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that translates the world,</v>

1020
00:42:41.881 --> 00:42:43.450
<v Speaker 5>that translates languages?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did.</v>

1021
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:48.700
<v Speaker 5>They just kind of put all that data into</v>
<v Speaker 5>this and so now it's on that phone and </v>

1022
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.250
<v Speaker 5>everyone will have it that has the new </v>
<v Speaker 5>pixel.</v>

1023
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.690
<v Speaker 5>And so what does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's doing a bunch.</v>

1024
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.920
<v Speaker 5>As far as I know right now it's a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 5>of ai information.</v>

1025
00:42:54.921 --> 00:42:58.250
<v Speaker 5>So it's looking at barcodes and qr codes</v>
<v Speaker 5>all over the place and it's,</v>

1026
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.970
<v Speaker 5>you don't even have to have a really </v>
<v Speaker 5>high,</v>

1027
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.870
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a good version of it.</v>

1028
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:04.700
<v Speaker 5>You can do it from far away and they can</v>
<v Speaker 5>read it.</v>

1029
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:10.120
<v Speaker 5>It can be really low.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A pixilated not saying they're right </v>

1030
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:10.120
<v Speaker 5>where I'm losing the word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1031
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:11.840
<v Speaker 5>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>low resolution.</v>

1032
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:16.841
<v Speaker 5>You can have a low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can pick it up from faraway to off </v>

1033
00:43:16.841 --> 00:43:16.841
<v Speaker 5>the TV.</v>

1034
00:43:16.841 --> 00:43:17.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This gas was bark.</v>

1035
00:43:17.901 --> 00:43:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need to read barcodes?</v>

1036
00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1037
00:43:21.261 --> 00:43:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I know one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the new pixel supposed to do,</v>

1038
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:25.600
<v Speaker 1>like say if you have like this Stevia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you went,</v>

1039
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:26.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get this,</v>

1040
00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a little barcode.</v>

1041
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.680
<v Speaker 1>You put your phone up to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you a link on Amazon and you can </v>

1042
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:32.680
<v Speaker 1>one click it just like.</v>

1043
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.510
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's one good thing that it does </v>

1044
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.510
<v Speaker 5>for the barcodes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1045
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:40.800
<v Speaker 5>it can compare prices in stores.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's saying automatically whether it's </v>

1046
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:40.800
<v Speaker 5>using Amazon and they'll block that</v>

1047
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.610
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically we're moving into the </v>

1048
00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:47.470
<v Speaker 1>ultimate age of consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a step up in instantaneous,</v>

1049
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:52.930
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous purchasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like as far as like reading the </v>

1050
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 1>world around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else is it doing?</v>

1051
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1052
00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:56.830
<v Speaker 5>I think you'd have to hold it up to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1053
00:43:56.831 --> 00:43:59.590
<v Speaker 5>So right here it says you can aim it at </v>
<v Speaker 5>a flower and it will,</v>

1054
00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.820
<v Speaker 5>and it will identify the species.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can pull up a band's music or videos</v>

1055
00:44:03.821 --> 00:44:05.620
<v Speaker 5>by pointing the lens at a concert </v>
<v Speaker 5>poster.</v>

1056
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.200
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like right now there's something that</v>

1057
00:44:08.201 --> 00:44:13.201
<v Speaker 5>popped up Annapolis Fund recently that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't really know because it's </v>

1058
00:44:13.201 --> 00:44:13.201
<v Speaker 5>hard to see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if I type in your name,</v>

1059
00:44:13.201 --> 00:44:15.670
<v Speaker 5>joe gets underlined,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you click that,</v>

1060
00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.700
<v Speaker 5>a whole bunch of information pops up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>leads to like all of your things on </v>

1061
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.580
<v Speaker 5>apple music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It leads to your webpage.</v>

1062
00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:23.620
<v Speaker 5>It's like a little serious assistant </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1063
00:44:23.621 --> 00:44:28.621
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it hasn't been advertised and it's not </v>

1064
00:44:28.621 --> 00:44:28.621
<v Speaker 5>really doesn't work for every person </v>
<v Speaker 5>name.</v>

1065
00:44:28.621 --> 00:44:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Like it might not work for Jocko willink</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it will work for Joe Rogan and it </v>

1066
00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.370
<v Speaker 5>might in the future if they update it or</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who needs to update it.</v>

1067
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.560
<v Speaker 5>But that's Kinda cool too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is an updated version of that I </v>

1068
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:39.560
<v Speaker 5>believe,</v>

1069
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:46.300
<v Speaker 2>just to bring this conversation back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we were the further we go in this </v>

1070
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.570
<v Speaker 2>direction of technology being in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of our lives,</v>

1071
00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:54.660
<v Speaker 2>the further away we get from having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle with things and the bigger hole</v>

1072
00:44:56.351 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be in the hole that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense and I sense which is if you're not</v>

1073
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
<v Speaker 2>struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not working you for not </v>

1074
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.531
<v Speaker 2>fighting for something that's just going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go further and further into the past </v>

1075
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:11.911
<v Speaker 2>and further and further down and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to have that hole to fill up </v>

1076
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:11.911
<v Speaker 2>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:13.750
<v Speaker 2>The physical body needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has requirements.</v>

1078
00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 2>That is stress requirements and if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always did the way I talk about it's </v>

1079
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 2>like a battery</v>

1080
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.490
<v Speaker 4>and like almost like not a conventional </v>
<v Speaker 4>better the way we think of as,</v>

1081
00:45:21.491 --> 00:45:25.390
<v Speaker 4>but almost like a storage vessel for </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy and then if you don't do anything</v>

1082
00:45:25.391 --> 00:45:30.391
<v Speaker 4>with that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of oozes over the side and </v>

1083
00:45:30.391 --> 00:45:32.971
<v Speaker 4>fucking battery acid crust.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The outside of it like it gets all </v>

1084
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:35.290
<v Speaker 4>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you just keep pumping out energy,</v>

1085
00:45:35.291 --> 00:45:40.291
<v Speaker 4>you keep doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It maintained some sort of homeostasis </v>

1086
00:45:40.291 --> 00:45:41.030
<v Speaker 4>and maintain some sort of a balance </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

1087
00:45:41.031 --> 00:45:43.080
<v Speaker 4>It had maintained some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1088
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:48.190
<v Speaker 4>a operational happiness like w where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>body's not fighting against itself </v>

1089
00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:53.850
<v Speaker 4>because I think that a lot of people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>bodies are just fighting against them </v>

1090
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:54.370
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of like the way that decisions</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are making,</v>

1091
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.100
<v Speaker 4>it's a big of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big part of it is it's just not taking</v>

1092
00:45:57.101 --> 00:46:02.101
<v Speaker 4>care of their meat vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's getting all this confusing </v>

1093
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:02.101
<v Speaker 4>messages from the flesh.</v>

1094
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we see that everyday when you </v>

1095
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 2>walk around America and you see people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just,</v>

1096
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.820
<v Speaker 2>you wonder how much longer they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to survive.</v>

1097
00:46:11.821 --> 00:46:15.480
<v Speaker 2>And what happens if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a fire and they have to run,</v>

1098
00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to make it around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner to go to Disneyland.</v>

1099
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's on a scooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

1100
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:27.170
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have a friend that works at </v>

1101
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Disneyland and he was telling me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started working there 10 years ago.</v>

1102
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.650
<v Speaker 2>It was rare to see someone on a scooter </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now they're all on scooters and then</v>

1103
00:46:32.651 --> 00:46:35.790
<v Speaker 2>not on scooters because they got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>broken leg or they're old.</v>

1104
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:41.060
<v Speaker 2>They're on scooters because they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>eaten themselves into this unmanageable </v>

1105
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:41.060
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1106
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even five years ago,</v>

1107
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.040
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to eat yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable shape,</v>

1108
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:46.680
<v Speaker 2>you had to walk to the grocery store to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>

1109
00:46:46.681 --> 00:46:51.390
<v Speaker 2>which was at least some form of movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now you just one click on Amazon and</v>

1110
00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:56.220
<v Speaker 2>you got the the cheetos in ultra large </v>
<v Speaker 2>size showing up at your front door.</v>

1111
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.890
<v Speaker 2>Two hours and they're gonna come in at </v>
<v Speaker 2>drone soon.</v>

1112
00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1113
00:46:59.791 --> 00:47:02.280
<v Speaker 2>you can just be like cheetos and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll.</v>

1114
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:07.370
<v Speaker 2>It'll put you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other things that you will probably </v>

1115
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.370
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want you to what?</v>

1116
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:10.761
<v Speaker 2>You probably want two liters of coke and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably want some marshmallows to </v>

1117
00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:10.761
<v Speaker 2>go with that and there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two hours.</v>

1118
00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:11.910
<v Speaker 2>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just killing yourself.</v>

1119
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.210
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when is this gonna end?</v>

1120
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I wonder when they're going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out a way to compensate for </v>

1121
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.450
<v Speaker 2>all the shit.</v>

1122
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.930
<v Speaker 4>Just some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pill that figures out,</v>

1123
00:47:23.931 --> 00:47:28.931
<v Speaker 4>or even crisper I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to this radio lab </v>

1124
00:47:28.931 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 4>podcast where they're updating crispr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do you know what Crispr</v>

1125
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1126
00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:35.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a new tool that they have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're using to modify genes and they,</v>

1127
00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:42.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've only figured it out over the </v>

1128
00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:43.960
<v Speaker 1>last few years and apparently they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>already started doing work on non-viable</v>

1129
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:46.750
<v Speaker 1>fetuses in China with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>

1130
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Who knows whether they want by the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that,</v>

1131
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:54.210
<v Speaker 1>my thought is the guy telling you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably some fucking fake person by </v>

1132
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:57.481
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time it actually gets to the </v>

1133
00:47:57.481 --> 00:47:59.491
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what kind of crazy </v>

1134
00:47:59.491 --> 00:47:59.491
<v Speaker 1>advancements they're making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1135
00:47:59.491 --> 00:48:01.360
<v Speaker 1>behind the Iron Curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is there an iron curtain anymore?</v>

1136
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's China and there's definitely </v>

1137
00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 1>some things going on in China for sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing some dark shit with people</v>

1138
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:12.331
<v Speaker 1>in this goddamn technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they think that they're not only </v>

1139
00:48:12.331 --> 00:48:13.840
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to use this gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>editing tool,</v>

1140
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to be able to implant </v>
<v Speaker 1>this gene editing tool into our genetics</v>

1141
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 1>so that your own genes start doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>work of Crispr for you,</v>

1142
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:24.770
<v Speaker 1>so things like they're.</v>

1143
00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.310
<v Speaker 1>They think that it's going to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place of antibiotics,</v>

1144
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 1>they think it's going to be able to edit</v>
<v Speaker 1>out things like Alzheimer's,</v>

1145
00:48:30.581 --> 00:48:32.320
<v Speaker 1>like whatever the gene is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's.</v>

1146
00:48:32.321 --> 00:48:35.260
<v Speaker 1>They'll be able to edit that out so </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's will no longer exist.</v>

1147
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:41.050
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really strange because people are going </v>

1148
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:41.050
<v Speaker 1>to have to make decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1149
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.940
<v Speaker 1>and I think this stuff is going to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly once it like.</v>

1150
00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Once we turn the corner and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's going to come fast.</v>

1151
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to come real fast.</v>

1152
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some weird mutations</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happen in there too.</v>

1153
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be people that look </v>

1154
00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:56.341
<v Speaker 1>like the hulk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be going to be people </v>

1155
00:48:56.341 --> 00:48:58.681
<v Speaker 1>that have won it in two heads and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be all jacked up and they're </v>

1156
00:48:58.681 --> 00:48:58.681
<v Speaker 1>going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we knew?</v>

1157
00:48:58.681 --> 00:49:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that didn't like you got that.</v>

1158
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1159
00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Tiawana crispr job was Chris Hill is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1160
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.180
<v Speaker 1>it's some sort of a gene editing tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the actual mechanism behind</v>

1161
00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:11.110
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

1162
00:49:11.111 --> 00:49:16.111
<v Speaker 1>I've only listened to people talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and read things on it and then how </v>

1163
00:49:16.111 --> 00:49:19.531
<v Speaker 1>far away is immortality from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want you to eliminate all </v>

1164
00:49:19.531 --> 00:49:19.660
<v Speaker 1>these different diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1165
00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:24.661
<v Speaker 1>I think like 100 years and I always </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought if you could just clone your </v>

1166
00:49:24.661 --> 00:49:26.560
<v Speaker 1>body and then you let your body grow to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be 20 years old,</v>

1167
00:49:26.561 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Speaker 1>then you just take your brain out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it inside that new body,</v>

1168
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:35.080
<v Speaker 1>then you're good to go because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be even creepier than </v>

1169
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.311
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're gonna be able to turn </v>

1170
00:49:38.311 --> 00:49:38.710
<v Speaker 1>back the clock because I think that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about like cellular aging,</v>

1171
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1172
00:49:39.161 --> 00:49:44.161
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's not reproduce every cell in </v>

1173
00:49:44.161 --> 00:49:47.251
<v Speaker 1>your body except for your neurons </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduces like somewhere between every </v>

1174
00:49:47.251 --> 00:49:48.250
<v Speaker 1>three to seven years or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1175
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your neurons are the only things that </v>

1176
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you keep for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the whole life.</v>

1177
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:55.860
<v Speaker 1>And so what they're thinking is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like as time goes on and your,</v>

1178
00:49:56.090 --> 00:50:01.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cells reproduce shittier and </v>

1179
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Shittier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your telomeres shrink.</v>

1180
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1181
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:05.350
<v Speaker 1>they'll be able to flip that around so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as time goes on,</v>

1182
00:50:05.351 --> 00:50:10.351
<v Speaker 1>you'll be like Benjamin buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll start getting younger and </v>

1183
00:50:10.351 --> 00:50:12.841
<v Speaker 1>younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will be really weird if they fuck </v>

1184
00:50:12.841 --> 00:50:12.841
<v Speaker 1>it up and you start turning into a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1185
00:50:12.841 --> 00:50:14.560
<v Speaker 1>you're like some 50 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden you're like,</v>

1186
00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:15.640
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 12 again.</v>

1187
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next year I'm going to be 11.</v>

1188
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:23.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if it goes backwards and that </v>

1189
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:23.500
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they can literally halt it,</v>

1190
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:28.200
<v Speaker 1>like if they can take you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like say if you're a 40 year </v>

1191
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:28.200
<v Speaker 1>woman and</v>

1192
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.110
<v Speaker 2>they put you on a 20 year program and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1193
00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:35.111
<v Speaker 2>well in 20 years instead of being 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be 20 and this is how </v>

1194
00:50:35.111 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Speaker 2>it's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next year you're going to be 39 next.</v>

1195
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:40.150
<v Speaker 2>That's totally conceivable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's totally conceivable.</v>

1196
00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Totally 100 percent conceivable </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1197
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:46.300
<v Speaker 2>And likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1198
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Then then that a mortality thing isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>that far away.</v>

1199
00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:54.161
<v Speaker 2>Then the only thing that's gonna fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>you up as accidents and murder and shit </v>

1200
00:50:54.161 --> 00:50:57.941
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mr Rhodes is life become more </v>

1201
00:50:57.941 --> 00:50:57.941
<v Speaker 2>precious than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because now you're thinking,</v>

1202
00:50:57.941 --> 00:51:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go skydiving because I </v>

1203
00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:01.900
<v Speaker 2>could actually live for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years if I don't screw this up.</v>

1204
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I think more likely you're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot more par corp and those assholes </v>

1205
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.150
<v Speaker 2>that are doing back flips off the Grand </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canyon.</v>

1206
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Like that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to see more,</v>

1207
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:16.210
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people that are wanting to feel </v>

1208
00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:16.700
<v Speaker 2>alive by taking crazy risks.</v>

1209
00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Those Russian dudes though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1210
00:51:19.701 --> 00:51:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I had James Kingston on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's that crazy asshole from England.</v>

1211
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Great Kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's.</v>

1212
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 2>He's does back flips on the top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking buildings and Dubai and shit.</v>

1213
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing,</v>

1214
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:30.790
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.320
<v Speaker 2>You posted one of those the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said something like,</v>

1216
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:34.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you wrote it,</v>

1217
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:39.761
<v Speaker 2>but you said something like my </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentiments exactly that is jacked up.</v>

1218
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.060
<v Speaker 2>It was one just a couple of days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys released it.</v>

1219
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:46.340
<v Speaker 2>They were on the Golden Gate Bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even watch it.</v>

1220
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you see Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even watch it though,</v>

1221
00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:50.600
<v Speaker 2>like daredevils were on the Golden Gate </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bridge,</v>

1222
00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:54.830
<v Speaker 2>but you see them on the very top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>golden gate bridge doing some silly shit</v>

1223
00:51:54.831 --> 00:51:59.831
<v Speaker 2>hanging off the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I did some dumb stuff when I was </v>

1224
00:52:00.201 --> 00:52:02.120
<v Speaker 2>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did some rock climbing without ropes.</v>

1225
00:52:02.121 --> 00:52:07.121
<v Speaker 2>Not not any Alex honnold stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know where I would definitely </v>

1226
00:52:07.121 --> 00:52:07.121
<v Speaker 2>get injured if I fell.</v>

1227
00:52:07.121 --> 00:52:09.560
<v Speaker 2>That was just being young and stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time we were.</v>

1228
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I was on a ship out in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>navy ship out in the middle of the ocean</v>

1229
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:16.610
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a seal platoon somewhere and me</v>

1230
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:21.611
<v Speaker 2>and one of my buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were doing pull ups off the side of </v>

1231
00:52:21.611 --> 00:52:22.140
<v Speaker 2>the ship at night on a little cable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>

1232
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:24.620
<v Speaker 2>That cable breaks or if we slip off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall,</v>

1233
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:29.680
<v Speaker 2>you're 100 percent going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we were doing it anyways because we </v>

1234
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:29.680
<v Speaker 2>were just young and stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1235
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Want to feel that juice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The juice prewar you know,</v>

1236
00:52:33.171 --> 00:52:38.171
<v Speaker 2>there's no war going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we prove to our buddies that we </v>

1237
00:52:38.171 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 2>are brave and bad ass or you do stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1238
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.500
<v Speaker 2>dumb stuff hanging off the side of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ship on a cable.</v>

1239
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:50.570
<v Speaker 2>What does that rush like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be a crazy rush.</v>

1240
00:52:50.571 --> 00:52:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And knowing that you can't let go.</v>

1241
00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:57.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what do you do when your whatever 23</v>

1242
00:52:57.111 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something that like particularly</v>

1243
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:04.960
<v Speaker 2>in the human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something that resonates about </v>

1244
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.420
<v Speaker 2>hanging from something by your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's one of the scariest ones.</v>

1245
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Like Kingston is on this gigantic crane </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's hanging onto the crane with his</v>

1246
00:53:12.171 --> 00:53:17.171
<v Speaker 2>hands and then he does it with one hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hanging in there and he's fucking </v>

1247
00:53:17.171 --> 00:53:18.210
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of feet up and if he falls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just.</v>

1248
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:21.720
<v Speaker 2>He just a water balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1249
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason like balancing scary,</v>

1250
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 2>but hanging is really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the opposite.</v>

1251
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Balances Scarier than hanging.</v>

1252
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather hang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel pretty,</v>

1253
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.990
<v Speaker 2>pretty good hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't do a lot of chips.</v>

1254
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel good about the balancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think I could trip and fall.</v>

1255
00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the life expectancy of Kingston?</v>

1256
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:44.790

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1258
00:53:45.721 --> 00:53:47.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to know that.</v>

1259
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:50.720
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really weird and really calm.</v>

1260
00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.640

<v Speaker 2>couple thousand feet in the fucking air.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what's weird about it.</v>

1277
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:45.490
<v Speaker 2>how he built into this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he start at 20 feet and then he went</v>

1278
00:54:45.491 --> 00:54:47.350
<v Speaker 2>to 30 feet and then he got more </v>
<v Speaker 2>confident?</v>

1279
00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's a weird guy because you meet them.</v>

1282
00:54:55.181 --> 00:55:00.181
<v Speaker 2>You're expecting like I'm gonna talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this meth doubt psychopath who just </v>

1283
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:02.590
<v Speaker 2>wants to just get a juice rush all day </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

1284
00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:05.920

<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>

1285
00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.140
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't make any sense.</v>

1286
00:55:08.141 --> 00:55:10.270
<v Speaker 2>But where did it start for him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1287
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a normal family.</v>

1288
00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Seems healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1289
00:55:14.081 --> 00:55:15.600
<v Speaker 2>he just likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pulled out a weird,</v>

1290
00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.460
<v Speaker 2>weird Alex Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had alex honnold.</v>

1291
00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1292
00:55:20.381 --> 00:55:21.590
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family,</v>

1293
00:55:21.591 --> 00:55:24.160
<v Speaker 2>we go up to Yosemite and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we are familiar,</v>

1294
00:55:24.161 --> 00:55:26.230
<v Speaker 2>but you can see how he kind of edged </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

1295
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you start climbing and you got ropes</v>

1296
00:55:27.821 --> 00:55:29.200
<v Speaker 2>and then you get really good at it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're like,</v>

1297
00:55:29.201 --> 00:55:34.201
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can probably make it to there without </v>

1298
00:55:34.201 --> 00:55:35.641
<v Speaker 2>a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then next thing you know you're </v>

1299
00:55:35.641 --> 00:55:36.781
<v Speaker 2>probably make it there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing you know you're </v>

1300
00:55:36.781 --> 00:55:37.690
<v Speaker 2>climbing El Capitan with no rope or </v>
<v Speaker 2>halftone with no rope,</v>

1301
00:55:37.691 --> 00:55:39.360
<v Speaker 2>which is completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know somebody.</v>

1302
00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely insane to even think about </v>

1303
00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.011
<v Speaker 2>that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does some insane stuff where you're </v>

1304
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:47.090
<v Speaker 2>going backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're at a reverse degrees,</v>

1305
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:52.630
<v Speaker 2>15 degrees the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like any climbs up at to go above it and</v>

1306
00:55:52.631 --> 00:55:55.370
<v Speaker 2>he's got no ropes and he's just hang on </v>
<v Speaker 2>with hands.</v>

1307
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:57.220
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck dude?</v>

1308
00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:00.250
<v Speaker 2>He was telling us a story about one time</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's halfway up the mountain.</v>

1309
00:56:00.251 --> 00:56:05.251
<v Speaker 2>He realized he forgot his powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he ran into some other people that </v>

1310
00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:05.560
<v Speaker 2>were up there that were on ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1311
00:56:05.561 --> 00:56:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I borrow your powder?</v>

1312
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1313
00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah bro,</v>

1314
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.560
<v Speaker 2>pack powder bag at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain.</v>

1315
00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard him talking about it,</v>

1316
00:56:15.281 --> 00:56:20.281
<v Speaker 2>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him it's not a big deal because he </v>

1317
00:56:20.281 --> 00:56:24.341
<v Speaker 2>knows how strong he is and he knows what</v>
<v Speaker 2>his limitations are so it doesn't for </v>

1318
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:24.341
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1319
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:27.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's comfortable with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1320
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:32.340
<v Speaker 1>He's comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone walking on a balance </v>

1321
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.381
<v Speaker 1>beam that does it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be comfortable with it </v>

1322
00:56:34.381 --> 00:56:34.381
<v Speaker 1>and he's climbing stuff all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's more company.</v>

1323
00:56:34.381 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's still hard to get a grip on though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get a grip.</v>

1324
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was hosting fear factor,</v>

1325
00:56:37.751 --> 00:56:42.751
<v Speaker 1>we had this one thing that we did where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we had people hanging from a pole that </v>

1326
00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:48.541
<v Speaker 1>was suspended over this water and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>shocking how slow like the least,</v>

1327
00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:55.760
<v Speaker 1>the little amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the small amount of time that men in </v>

1328
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.741
<v Speaker 1>particular could hang from a pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were like a minute and these </v>

1329
00:56:58.741 --> 00:57:00.160
<v Speaker 1>guys were dropping into the water and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1330
00:57:00.161 --> 00:57:02.500
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like women want it regular.</v>

1331
00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:07.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women want it because they have have </v>

1332
00:57:07.501 --> 00:57:09.990
<v Speaker 1>lighter bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though their hands might be </v>

1333
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:09.990
<v Speaker 1>weaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1334
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:14.080
<v Speaker 1>and one guy was fucking Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like this football player </v>

1335
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:14.080
<v Speaker 1>looking dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't make it man.</v>

1336
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:16.000
<v Speaker 1>He was like a minute and 15 in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plop it into the water.</v>

1337
00:57:16.001 --> 00:57:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

1338
00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy in my field training class </v>

1339
00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:24.580
<v Speaker 1>that was a big giant monster guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't complete the obstacle course.</v>

1340
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:25.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1341
00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.640
<v Speaker 1>too many of clients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strength is too much,</v>

1342
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:32.670
<v Speaker 1>too much mass behind you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking small limbs or small digits to </v>

1343
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:35.710
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also too much of your heart has</v>

1344
00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.930
<v Speaker 1>to pump too much blood through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue.</v>

1345
00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:41.470
<v Speaker 1>There's like a point of diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>returns when it comes to size,</v>

1346
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:46.760
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that you saw </v>

1347
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.871
<v Speaker 1>when you see Cain Velasquez fight guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain Valasquez has always been in that </v>

1348
00:57:48.871 --> 00:57:50.890
<v Speaker 1>sweet spot of about 2:40</v>
<v Speaker 1>2:40</v>

1349
00:57:50.891 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 1>to me is about as big as you want to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the guys over to 40 men,</v>

1350
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.620
<v Speaker 1>they might fuck you up in the first few </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

1351
00:57:56.621 --> 00:58:01.621
<v Speaker 1>but he take them into that fourth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth minute of the first round and </v>

1352
00:58:01.621 --> 00:58:02.650
<v Speaker 1>they're huffing and puffing and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second round they're getting their asses</v>

1353
00:58:02.651 --> 00:58:07.651
<v Speaker 1>kicked and the Cain Velasquez storm was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one of the more fascinating things </v>

1354
00:58:07.841 --> 00:58:12.841
<v Speaker 1>to watch in all my years of the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was a heavyweight that had </v>

1355
00:58:12.841 --> 00:58:14.920
<v Speaker 1>the cardio of a lightweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was again,</v>

1356
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:16.240
<v Speaker 1>240 pounds.</v>

1357
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well marbled 240 pounds.</v>

1358
00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.150
<v Speaker 1>He's not like he was a lean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1359
00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.110
<v Speaker 1>he had some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always looks a little bit.</v>

1360
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:27.120
<v Speaker 1>He had a lot of Mexican food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some rice and beans eaten.</v>

1361
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Lunch would be like for real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you like one of the elite </v>

1362
00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.861
<v Speaker 1>heavyweights ever and he's sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fucking 10 tacos and shit and you </v>

1363
00:58:34.861 --> 00:58:39.061
<v Speaker 1>know that's a talent to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having that kind of sustained energy is </v>

1364
00:58:39.061 --> 00:58:43.040
<v Speaker 1>a talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like some guys are super flexible </v>

1365
00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.900
<v Speaker 1>and some guys are super strong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive and some guys just have that </v>

1366
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.110
<v Speaker 1>they can to have that range and what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

1367
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Medium twitch muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1368
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.780
<v Speaker 1>It's medium twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow twitch.</v>

1369
00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:53.740
<v Speaker 1>You will know that twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I'm a marathoner,</v>

1370
00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:58.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's fast twitch which is </v>

1371
00:58:58.790 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 1>almond Olympic weightlifter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in recent years they've said there's</v>

1372
00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:03.871
<v Speaker 1>actually something in the middle twitch </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I'm strong but I can go for a </v>

1373
00:59:03.871 --> 00:59:03.871
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

1374
00:59:03.871 --> 00:59:08.010
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about that but it makes </v>

1375
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:08.110
<v Speaker 1>sense and that's what I got like Kainos </v>
<v Speaker 1>because cane like you said,</v>

1376
00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean for him to be able to get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and go five rounds pushing away,</v>

1377
00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.480
<v Speaker 1>pushing around another guy that weighs </v>
<v Speaker 1>260 pounds.</v>

1378
00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's beast mode right there.</v>

1379
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:20.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on with Kane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing is going on his </v>

1380
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 1>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has incredible genetics and they,</v>

1381
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:24.170
<v Speaker 1>they like Bob Cook would tell me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cain would be out for months,</v>

1382
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:29.350
<v Speaker 1>like get an injury and come back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's outwork everybody like it just </v>

1383
00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:32.530
<v Speaker 1>insane cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's also that his base was so </v>

1384
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:35.660
<v Speaker 1>rock solid that his attache for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>months is everybody else's,</v>

1385
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peak condition and what's one of the </v>

1386
00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:40.720
<v Speaker 1>reasons why he was able to overwhelm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people,</v>

1387
00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.890
<v Speaker 1>but also like when you see cain execute </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1388
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:45.440
<v Speaker 1>he's never straining like Cain.</v>

1389
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Everything is perfect technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no like there's no like grunting</v>

1390
00:59:49.731 --> 00:59:54.731
<v Speaker 1>and forcing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no like crazy look on his face </v>

1391
00:59:54.731 --> 00:59:58.781
<v Speaker 1>and like the windmill punches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is clean and crisp and it's </v>

1392
00:59:58.781 --> 01:00:03.311
<v Speaker 1>all like very efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vishal movies and machine and obviously </v>

1393
01:00:03.311 --> 01:00:05.600
<v Speaker 1>that comes from training the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is that training hard to hard?</v>

1394
01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Has he been trying to or is that why </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's all dinged up then?</v>

1395
01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some flights because of injuries.</v>

1396
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Well there's also the mind like his mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so strong that he's able to overcome </v>

1397
01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:16.970
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes like elite athletes,</v>

1398
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:21.971
<v Speaker 1>especially fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't distinguish between what is </v>

1399
01:00:21.971 --> 01:00:21.971
<v Speaker 1>just like dings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody gets dinged up,</v>

1400
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.640
<v Speaker 1>but something that's a significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury like,</v>

1401
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to compromise in the </v>

1402
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>structure of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you keep pushing it,</v>

1403
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you're going to blow this knee out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fuck this disk up,</v>

1404
01:00:31.911 --> 01:00:36.911
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the caines had a gang of surgeries </v>

1405
01:00:36.911 --> 01:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>now shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees back and now you know,</v>

1406
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:43.931
<v Speaker 1>he's been out for quite a while with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this most recent back issues and it </v>

1407
01:00:43.931 --> 01:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>sucks because in my opinion it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and Fader,</v>

1408
01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the two greatest heavyweights </v>

1409
01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>

1410
01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same similar body style.</v>

1411
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty to 40.</v>

1412
01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Well marbled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feta,</v>

1414
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>feta or at its peak had like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate dad bod.</v>

1415
01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>He had like a dad that used to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>rugby,</v>

1416
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck guys up.</v>

1417
01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>They'd post those videos though of him </v>
<v Speaker 1>training in Russia,</v>

1418
01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.060
<v Speaker 1>running with his buddies and swinging </v>
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells and yeah,</v>

1419
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>this guy works hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1420
01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just probably ate shitty food.</v>

1421
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>You had just tons of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1422
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:19.190
<v Speaker 1>But it's also like their methodology is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just different.</v>

1423
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old school with his methods,</v>

1424
01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:27.581
<v Speaker 1>like he was doing kettle bells but way </v>
<v Speaker 1>before crossfit or came to America.</v>

1425
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

1426
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>there's an old school pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find a jamie back when </v>

1427
01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.451
<v Speaker 1>he was jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he got smaller as his career went </v>

1428
01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:41.381
<v Speaker 1>on because he stopped doing strength and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning as his body got older and </v>

1429
01:01:41.381 --> 01:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>for focused more on skill work.</v>

1430
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>But there's this ancient picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not ancient,</v>

1431
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:50.291
<v Speaker 1>but this is a picture of him standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>there shirtless around a bunch of </v>

1432
01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Kettlebell Kettlebell lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2001 or something like that,</v>

1433
01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:58.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing that I think that he </v>

1434
01:01:58.931 --> 01:01:58.931
<v Speaker 1>really had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he had a good,</v>

1435
01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>his skill in my mind was that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

1436
01:02:01.461 --> 01:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Grapplers a really good striker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

1437
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>the way he mixed them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would see him just like hit somebody</v>

1438
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:08.990
<v Speaker 1>in the face and then judo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw them into an arm,</v>

1439
01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>lock them or choke them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all just so smooth.</v>

1440
01:02:12.231 --> 01:02:17.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone knew what to defend</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they defended one thing they </v>

1441
01:02:17.231 --> 01:02:17.231
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they defended it,</v>

1442
01:02:17.231 --> 01:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1443
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling,</v>

1444
01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:23.021
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting punched in the face if </v>

1445
01:02:23.021 --> 01:02:23.021
<v Speaker 1>they do</v>

1446
01:02:23.021 --> 01:02:23.021
<v Speaker 2>defendant upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were getting taken down.</v>

1447
01:02:23.021 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was something special man.</v>

1448
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.520
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was something special for quite a </v>

1449
01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:28.520
<v Speaker 2>long time to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1450
01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody can keep going </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer than like,</v>

1451
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.240
<v Speaker 2>just like a time that you can compete at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest level.</v>

1452
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Some folks think it's about eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine years.</v>

1453
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:37.110
<v Speaker 2>They're like an ad after eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine years.</v>

1454
01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 2>The highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nobody's body holds up,</v>

1455
01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.040
<v Speaker 2>it just all falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1456
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:44.220
<v Speaker 2>as much as I'm talking good about fate </v>
<v Speaker 2>or in his style and everything,</v>

1457
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.570
<v Speaker 2>let's face it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the best about Fei door was his</v>

1458
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.860
<v Speaker 2>attitude when he would just come in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there with no emotions raised his hand,</v>

1459
01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:54.060
<v Speaker 2>dead face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1460
01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:56.310
<v Speaker 2>they'd introduce him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just raised his hand and he'd destroy</v>

1461
01:02:56.311 --> 01:02:59.220
<v Speaker 2>someone and he would have the same space</v>
<v Speaker 2>like before he fought,</v>

1462
01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:02.400
<v Speaker 2>just had total absence of emotion.</v>

1463
01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:05.040
<v Speaker 2>That was to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I always thought.</v>

1464
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right up there at the top of my </v>

1465
01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:10.100
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the picture.</v>

1466
01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just jacked standing around a bunch of </v>

1467
01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 2>fucking iron cannonballs with handles on</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1468
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 2>And those aren't some little kittle </v>
<v Speaker 2>bills either.</v>

1469
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that picture alone must've sold </v>

1470
01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.091
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars with kettlebells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People saw that picture and they're </v>

1471
01:03:26.091 --> 01:03:26.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get some at.</v>

1472
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:28.870
<v Speaker 2>But he also was very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1473
01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.880
<v Speaker 2>that's his brother actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very smart with his training </v>

1474
01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:33.880
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1475
01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.120
<v Speaker 2>he spent some time in Holland for him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his brother,</v>

1476
01:03:36.121 --> 01:03:38.220
<v Speaker 2>like way back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the picture of his brother now and get a</v>

1477
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.190
<v Speaker 2>picture of Alexander and he just got out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of jail.</v>

1478
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he's gonna fight again.</v>

1479
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:45.210
<v Speaker 2>His brother was a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1480
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.720
<v Speaker 2>he's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the uh,</v>

1481
01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.650
<v Speaker 2>there's something about Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1482
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.680
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are different kinds of white </v>

1483
01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:54.680
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They totally different.</v>

1484
01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.190
<v Speaker 2>They just did so much different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1485
01:03:56.191 --> 01:03:57.630
<v Speaker 2>it's the hard upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>

1486
01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1487
01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diamonds made out of pressure.</v>

1488
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:06.990
<v Speaker 2>And the other guy that comes to mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're thinking about old school </v>

1489
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:08.280
<v Speaker 2>fighters that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just his skill set,</v>

1490
01:04:08.281 --> 01:04:13.281
<v Speaker 2>which was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sakharova [inaudible] the way soccer </v>

1491
01:04:13.281 --> 01:04:13.281
<v Speaker 2>Robert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His craziness.</v>

1492
01:04:13.281 --> 01:04:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just to go in there and just have </v>

1493
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.520
<v Speaker 2>that incredibly playful attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also chain smoked and drank through this</v>

1494
01:04:20.521 --> 01:04:23.010
<v Speaker 2>entire camp chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smoked and drank.</v>

1495
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.860
<v Speaker 2>I went out with him in Japan after one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his fights one time.</v>

1496
01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.540
<v Speaker 2>What did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just getting after it.</v>

1497
01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.200
<v Speaker 2>But that attitude of not giving a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>

1498
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:36.630
<v Speaker 2>that's what worked so well for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the.</v>

1499
01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Inside the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1500
01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Well I know we see this all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>with fighters.</v>

1501
01:04:39.451 --> 01:04:42.000
<v Speaker 2>We with anybody that is going to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>out on the fringe like that,</v>

1502
01:04:42.001 --> 01:04:44.520
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>offset.</v>

1503
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:45.690
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another,</v>

1504
01:04:45.691 --> 01:04:47.910
<v Speaker 2>there's for every action there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>equal and opposite reaction.</v>

1505
01:04:47.911 --> 01:04:52.911
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get a guy that's living that far </v>

1506
01:04:52.911 --> 01:04:52.911
<v Speaker 2>on the edge like soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert was that,</v>

1507
01:04:52.911 --> 01:04:54.410
<v Speaker 2>that edge just doesn't stop when he gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the kids.</v>

1508
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just going and going to get after it.</v>

1509
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.430
<v Speaker 2>He had some horrible losses though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got,</v>

1510
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.500
<v Speaker 2>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1511
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.460
<v Speaker 2>used in an exploited worse than anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1512
01:05:08.461 --> 01:05:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1513
01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:14.070
<v Speaker 2>worse than any other fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one has been exploited and put into </v>

1514
01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:16.110
<v Speaker 2>those horrible flights where he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't out.</v>

1515
01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:17.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just outmatched.</v>

1516
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 2>He was old,</v>

1517
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:23.160
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't trained right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they would just put them in there </v>

1518
01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:23.160
<v Speaker 1>and just let them get destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1519
01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>his knees were mad so he would wrap his </v>
<v Speaker 1>knees up like a mummy.</v>

1520
01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were horrible.</v>

1521
01:05:28.871 --> 01:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>And you knew that that was a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury.</v>

1522
01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1523
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>like he couldn't move so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His knees were all wrapped up and fucked</v>

1524
01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>up and then they put them in there with </v>
<v Speaker 1>vandelay and vandelay knocked him out.</v>

1525
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:38.920
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times?</v>

1526
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brutal chaos,</v>

1527
01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I think at least twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think of it's two or three</v>

1528
01:05:43.241 --> 01:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1529
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>and then Melvin manhoef who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was soccer,</v>

1530
01:05:48.221 --> 01:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>kicking them because you get soccer kick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pride and stomp.</v>

1531
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had some really tough fights.</v>

1532
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>He's apparently doing a grappling super </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight now.</v>

1533
01:05:56.831 --> 01:05:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he's grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grappled Benzo.</v>

1534
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1535
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:06.030
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of what I was actually </v>

1536
01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:06.760
<v Speaker 1>thinking of Shinya Aoki is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grapple with Gary Tonin.</v>

1537
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be.</v>

1538
01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1539
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.730
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have a straight up </v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling.</v>

1540
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrett can fuck them up.</v>

1541
01:06:11.291 --> 01:06:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I okies good man.</v>

1542
01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:18.451
<v Speaker 1>Especially now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a big difference between guys </v>

1543
01:06:18.451 --> 01:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>who are good in mma and guys who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at like straight up grandpa and the</v>

1544
01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 1>training vids of Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like he's just trained all the,</v>

1545
01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:25.540
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all he does.</v>

1546
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:27.370
<v Speaker 1>He's completely obsessed with Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1547
01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's doing rope climbs and he's </v>

1548
01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:32.460
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all he does.</v>

1549
01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:35.890
<v Speaker 1>So he's also being coached by John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donner and he's a part of that Henzel </v>

1550
01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Gracie crew in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that Donna,</v>

1551
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:39.420
<v Speaker 1>her death squad man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk about a,</v>

1552
01:06:39.421 --> 01:06:42.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real like wizard of Jujitsu.</v>

1553
01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Donna her understand his instagram posts</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some of the very best instagram posts</v>

1554
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.430
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

1555
01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I got to follow him then.</v>

1556
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got it man.</v>

1557
01:06:50.411 --> 01:06:53.590
<v Speaker 1>His breakdowns of certain techniques and</v>
<v Speaker 1>matches and what went well,</v>

1558
01:06:53.591 --> 01:06:55.930
<v Speaker 1>what went wrong and what's required of </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes and,</v>

1559
01:06:56.290 --> 01:07:01.290
<v Speaker 1>and how to excel and the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between an athlete and competition </v>

1560
01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:04.831
<v Speaker 1>versus a difference in training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one was the most recent things </v>

1561
01:07:04.831 --> 01:07:07.710
<v Speaker 1>about putting yourself in bad positions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and working on your weaknesses as </v>

1562
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:09.580
<v Speaker 1>opposed to just continuing to push your </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengths.</v>

1563
01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one though.</v>

1564
01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>The fighters that are good in training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not good at in their cage </v>

1565
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:17.620
<v Speaker 1>and there's other fighters that are kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of get beat up and training,</v>

1566
01:07:17.621 --> 01:07:18.730
<v Speaker 1>but then when they get in the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1567
01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:23.850
<v Speaker 1>They rise to the occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to see that a bunch with a bunch </v>

1568
01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:23.890
<v Speaker 1>of different fighters over the years </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I trained with and you'd say,</v>

1569
01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>this guy is going to do okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they'd get in,</v>

1570
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.840
<v Speaker 1>they'd get in the cage and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just turn it on.</v>

1571
01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:33.840
<v Speaker 1>They elevate themselves and then some </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that are crushing everyone during </v>

1572
01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:33.840
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get in the cage,</v>

1573
01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC fight night or whatever,</v>

1574
01:07:35.831 --> 01:07:37.210
<v Speaker 1>and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just can't.</v>

1575
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:42.540
<v Speaker 1>They can't get it done that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they're crushing people in </v>

1576
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:42.540
<v Speaker 1>the draining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1577
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:42.540
<v Speaker 1>There's so many factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1578
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:47.491
<v Speaker 1>And I think some of them are also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to overcome adversity and with </v>

1579
01:07:47.491 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 1>really talented guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really have to overcome that</v>

1580
01:07:49.511 --> 01:07:52.150
<v Speaker 1>much adversity because they were good </v>
<v Speaker 1>really quickly.</v>

1581
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Like guys who had massive physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages.</v>

1582
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And then for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1583
01:07:56.910 --> 01:08:01.910
<v Speaker 1>once they faced other people that also </v>
<v Speaker 1>have physical advantages but were </v>

1584
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.910
<v Speaker 1>tougher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just go.</v>

1585
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It just fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wilt.</v>

1586
01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so common.</v>

1587
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get that in.</v>

1588
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And we got some guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy at the gym right now who's </v>

1589
01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:13.580
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just a,</v>

1590
01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.220
<v Speaker 1>he's a mutant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a mutant.</v>

1591
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Like he's so</v>

1592
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.780
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>

1594
01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:24.200
<v Speaker 3>on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's on all fours and he's,</v>

1595
01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:28.490
<v Speaker 3>he fights at one 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on all fours and he picks me up with</v>

1596
01:08:28.491 --> 01:08:32.170
<v Speaker 3>one hand with one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>picks me up and slams me and gets across</v>

1597
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.220
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh five.</v>

1602
01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:43.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>typical picture on the one hand,</v>

1603
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.870
<v Speaker 3>one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not with his back,</v>

1604
01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:47.720
<v Speaker 3>but like with his arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see him,</v>

1605
01:08:47.721 --> 01:08:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Taylor Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch out for him.</v>

1606
01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:51.140
<v Speaker 3>What is this background?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrestled,</v>

1607
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:52.020
<v Speaker 3>he wrestled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he it.</v>

1608
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:53.160
<v Speaker 3>But this is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know,</v>

1609
01:08:53.161 --> 01:08:58.161
<v Speaker 3>we know this right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's wrestlers that are great </v>

1610
01:08:58.161 --> 01:09:00.401
<v Speaker 3>wrestlers and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're okay at Jujitsu but they </v>

1611
01:09:00.401 --> 01:09:01.160
<v Speaker 3>can't quite make that transition and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're strikings okay.</v>

1612
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.100
<v Speaker 3>But they can't quite make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>transition for whatever reason,</v>

1613
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:09.130
<v Speaker 3>whatever gift he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He saw the other day we were training </v>

1614
01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:11.240
<v Speaker 3>and he's been training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a few months ago.</v>

1615
01:09:11.241 --> 01:09:12.950
<v Speaker 3>He's been training for like six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1616
01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.820
<v Speaker 3>And he dives for a commuter on me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1617
01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:20.270
<v Speaker 3>I move and get out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we keep training,</v>

1618
01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.320
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we get done.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1621
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:25.090
<v Speaker 3>I can't lock anything up on your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't like I can't,</v>

1622
01:09:25.091 --> 01:09:27.380
<v Speaker 3>I can't get any finishes on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1623
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.640
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been training for six months.</v>

1624
01:09:31.641 --> 01:09:36.641
<v Speaker 3>There's guys who have been training here</v>
<v Speaker 3>for 10 years that have never even </v>

1625
01:09:36.641 --> 01:09:37.850
<v Speaker 3>attempted a submission on me and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to submit me with mile,</v>

1626
01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:39.590
<v Speaker 3>move the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1627
01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about it.</v>

1628
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:42.950
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1629
01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:47.980
<v Speaker 3>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is with him is he's an </v>

1630
01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:49.070
<v Speaker 3>incredible athlete and he's got that </v>
<v Speaker 3>work ethic too,</v>

1631
01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:54.190
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's competed at a high level and </v>

1632
01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:54.190
<v Speaker 3>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1633
01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:54.190
<v Speaker 3>he's an all American wrestler.</v>

1634
01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I think d two though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1635
01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.620
<v Speaker 3>nonetheless he savage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1636
01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Pe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the ability to compete.</v>

1637
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:00.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting ability.</v>

1638
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Like some people just don't have it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they wore the.</v>

1639
01:10:02.871 --> 01:10:07.871
<v Speaker 3>It's not even that they don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lack the mental skills to overcome </v>

1640
01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:09.570
<v Speaker 3>pressure filled obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:14.770
<v Speaker 3>And you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's some people that step up </v>

1642
01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 3>when that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And can you train to do that?</v>

1643
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I think you can think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can.</v>

1644
01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:20.780
<v Speaker 3>Do you inoculate yourself to the stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the mind.</v>

1645
01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:26.020
<v Speaker 3>So like you like the idea that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitfalls and the mind are </v>

1646
01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:26.120
<v Speaker 3>insurmountable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's ridiculous.</v>

1647
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:28.340
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be more surmountable or </v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1648
01:10:28.341 --> 01:10:29.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1649
01:10:29.691 --> 01:10:34.691
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more passable than physical problems </v>

1650
01:10:34.691 --> 01:10:38.621
<v Speaker 3>because like physical problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're 140 pounds and the guys </v>

1651
01:10:38.621 --> 01:10:41.651
<v Speaker 3>240 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're both equally talented and both </v>

1652
01:10:41.651 --> 01:10:41.870
<v Speaker 3>equally driven.</v>

1653
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

1654
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.720
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1655
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that being said,</v>

1656
01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:48.170
<v Speaker 3>it is similar to what we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>

1657
01:10:48.171 --> 01:10:50.180
<v Speaker 3>which is when you have somebody that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught in their own mind,</v>

1658
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.100
<v Speaker 3>they can't get the perspective to step </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1659
01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.090
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1660
01:10:53.091 --> 01:10:55.730
<v Speaker 3>just calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of freak out about.</v>

1661
01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.260
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if I lose it?</v>

1662
01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.660
<v Speaker 3>She loses no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll get around.</v>

1663
01:10:59.661 --> 01:11:00.650
<v Speaker 3>It will train more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no big deal.</v>

1664
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.960
<v Speaker 3>They can't get over that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you do get people that get </v>

1665
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:06.050
<v Speaker 3>trapped in their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean there's all kinds of fighters</v>

1666
01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:07.790
<v Speaker 3>that have gone through that never came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>

1667
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a really important quote.</v>

1668
01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:10.580
<v Speaker 3>If you win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you win.</v>

1669
01:11:10.581 --> 01:11:11.810
<v Speaker 3>If you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn.</v>

1670
01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.970
<v Speaker 3>And so you always win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you really</v>

1671
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 1>can think about it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I remember pretty much every </v>

1672
01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>time I've ever been humiliated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mat,</v>

1673
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 1>every time I've ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really manhandled and tapped,</v>

1674
01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember them very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also remember like every time I </v>

1675
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>rolled with like a real high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>Blackville and got my ass handed to me,</v>

1676
01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:33.570
<v Speaker 1>my training jumped up a notch because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1677
01:11:33.571 --> 01:11:34.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1678
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.610
<v Speaker 1>that expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rub,</v>

1679
01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.590
<v Speaker 1>like you train with someone who's way </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and you know,</v>

1680
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:38.790
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1681
01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:41.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a whatever I thought was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high frequency.</v>

1682
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are operating like </v>
<v Speaker 1>several hundred rpms faster than that.</v>

1683
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.170
<v Speaker 1>And I just hadn't encountered them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1684
01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:51.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think that to be around that is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1685
01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:55.160
<v Speaker 1>If you ever trained with a guy that like</v>
<v Speaker 1>trains in a small town and uh,</v>

1686
01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 1>all the people in the town is like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a purple belt coaches and they,</v>

1687
01:11:58.910 --> 01:12:03.910
<v Speaker 1>they have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain rpm that they all </v>

1688
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.910
<v Speaker 1>operate in.</v>

1689
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And if you come in and you're used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking San Diego assassin,</v>

1690
01:12:06.901 --> 01:12:08.460
<v Speaker 1>rpm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they like,</v>

1691
01:12:08.461 --> 01:12:11.250
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this guy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just not used to it.</v>

1692
01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.280
<v Speaker 1>They have or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you come from a place like that </v>

1693
01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:16.590
<v Speaker 1>and you try to train it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence or something like that,</v>

1694
01:12:16.591 --> 01:12:20.210
<v Speaker 1>like you're dealing with you jumping </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a fucking pit of killers like,</v>

1695
01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.450
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1696
01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:23.580
<v Speaker 1>that old expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron sharpens iron.</v>

1697
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Who could not be more true when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Jujitsu.</v>

1698
01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt.</v>

1699
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:32.541
<v Speaker 1>The better people you train with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better you're going to get and </v>

1700
01:12:32.541 --> 01:12:32.541
<v Speaker 1>you've got to seek those people out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1701
01:12:32.541 --> 01:12:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you got to not mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1702
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:35.410
<v Speaker 1>that Guy Taylor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm talking about do,</v>

1703
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:39.030
<v Speaker 1>do I like getting my ass kicked by a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been training for six months.</v>

1704
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

1705
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I hate it Taylor.</v>

1706
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:47.030
<v Speaker 1>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call them out every time and I talk </v>

1707
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.461
<v Speaker 1>smack to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't talk a bunch of smack talking </v>

1708
01:12:49.461 --> 01:12:49.461
<v Speaker 1>smack to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1709
01:12:49.461 --> 01:12:49.461
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up young buck,</v>

1710
01:12:49.461 --> 01:12:50.210
<v Speaker 1>you want to come get some of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday?</v>

1711
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to train with him because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's that strong need.</v>

1712
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm training with Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm training with Jeff Glover.</v>

1713
01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I train with those guys too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the young buck that wants to get </v>

1714
01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:00.620
<v Speaker 1>after it a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1715
01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:05.361
<v Speaker 1>we'll also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about freak wrestling </v>

1716
01:13:05.361 --> 01:13:05.361
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just.</v>

1717
01:13:05.361 --> 01:13:05.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've,</v>

1718
01:13:05.751 --> 01:13:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I've rolled with restaurants before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1719
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:08.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you are.</v>

1720
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.390
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people and then like,</v>

1721
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:15.090
<v Speaker 1>like chimp chimp person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1722
01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:20.230
<v Speaker 1>they have like when your body is used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the time you're an early kid </v>

1723
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:23.870
<v Speaker 1>throwing bodies around like your tendon </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and your ability to manipulate </v>

1724
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:26.130
<v Speaker 1>bodies is a very different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>

1725
01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might not translate to a 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>yard dash or or sprint or you know,</v>

1726
01:13:31.291 --> 01:13:34.710
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's the physical ability to move</v>

1727
01:13:34.711 --> 01:13:37.320
<v Speaker 1>bodies is very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1728
01:13:37.321 --> 01:13:41.580
<v Speaker 1>and you always have to be careful too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's been plenty of wrestlers</v>

1729
01:13:41.581 --> 01:13:46.581
<v Speaker 1>along the way that don't do well in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

1730
01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 1>they're great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're strong,</v>

1731
01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.740
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's a mental thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have some limited factor in</v>

1732
01:13:52.741 --> 01:13:55.440
<v Speaker 1>their brain where they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just can't quite open their mind to</v>

1733
01:13:55.441 --> 01:14:00.441
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't quite open their mind to </v>

1734
01:14:00.441 --> 01:14:02.121
<v Speaker 1>striking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't get out of that wrestler </v>

1735
01:14:02.121 --> 01:14:02.121
<v Speaker 1>mentality of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

1736
01:14:02.121 --> 01:14:07.101
<v Speaker 1>I have to go as hard as I can right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't go as hard as you can </v>

1737
01:14:07.101 --> 01:14:08.070
<v Speaker 1>run out for the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will run out of gas.</v>

1738
01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Especially with striking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're.</v>

1739
01:14:09.871 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>If you're boxing and with people and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think</v>

1740
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:17.040
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to go in and do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to run into somebody who </v>

1741
01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.561
<v Speaker 2>actually knows how to box and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to come home with headaches every </v>

1742
01:14:19.561 --> 01:14:19.561
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get very discouraged.</v>

1743
01:14:19.561 --> 01:14:20.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of who you're training </v>
<v Speaker 2>with too,</v>

1744
01:14:20.771 --> 01:14:25.771
<v Speaker 2>like as far as your trainer is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's who's coaching you and what </v>

1745
01:14:25.771 --> 01:14:28.891
<v Speaker 2>methodology are they using and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what mindset are they trying to impart </v>

1746
01:14:28.891 --> 01:14:30.940
<v Speaker 2>on you as far as like skill development </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many people out there</v>

1747
01:14:30.941 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 2>that just don't have like a real clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>

1748
01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:39.871
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't have a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of like I want to work on </v>

1749
01:14:39.871 --> 01:14:43.810
<v Speaker 2>footwork in avoiding certain shots and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to move in better.</v>

1750
01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:46.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead they're just trying to win every</v>

1751
01:14:46.151 --> 01:14:51.151
<v Speaker 2>round or they're trying to push hard and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then do you not get to the next level,</v>

1752
01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:54.850
<v Speaker 2>which in my mind when we get past the </v>
<v Speaker 2>athleticism,</v>

1753
01:14:54.851 --> 01:14:59.851
<v Speaker 2>we get past the mental overcoming of </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges and then in my opinion,</v>

1754
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:05.100
<v Speaker 2>you get to the next level which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity and that's when you get to </v>

1755
01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1756
01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Jonny Bones Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing things that they're kind </v>

1757
01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:13.510
<v Speaker 2>of making up and they're making them up </v>
<v Speaker 2>live as they go.</v>

1758
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:15.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think that to me is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1759
01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:16.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we kind of,</v>

1760
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I think we saw with Bj Penn back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

1761
01:15:18.461 --> 01:15:20.860
<v Speaker 2>he was creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think fate or did it where he was,</v>

1762
01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:23.650
<v Speaker 2>he was doing creative things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think to me that's,</v>

1763
01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:28.890
<v Speaker 2>that's where you go that one level </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher is when you add the creative </v>

1764
01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:33.031
<v Speaker 2>element to a guy that can take a and B </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make f out of those things somehow.</v>

1765
01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you watch those guys,</v>

1766
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.380
<v Speaker 2>there's something about watching a Jon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones or fate or a prime time Bj Penn.</v>

1767
01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:46.410
<v Speaker 2>It elevates you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You watch someone do somethIng special </v>

1768
01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:46.450
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just walk out of there,</v>

1769
01:15:46.451 --> 01:15:51.451
<v Speaker 2>you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I can run faster than I could </v>

1770
01:15:51.451 --> 01:15:51.451
<v Speaker 2>before I saw that fight.</v>

1771
01:15:51.451 --> 01:15:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I know I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could lift more weights.</v>

1772
01:15:52.301 --> 01:15:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I know I could do something better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just people.</v>

1773
01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:00.480
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a huge thing that one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasons why people enjoy watching </v>

1774
01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.110
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in particular combat sports.</v>

1775
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.560
<v Speaker 2>When people do something amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you feel like amazing things </v>

1776
01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.450
<v Speaker 2>are possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1777
01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have limitations on that too because </v>

1778
01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:16.000
<v Speaker 2>personally I'll watch somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1779
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.640
<v Speaker 2>some random fighter or whatever and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1780
01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:19.930
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could probably do that.</v>

1781
01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.470
<v Speaker 2>You knoW what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1782
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good fighter,</v>

1783
01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:24.400
<v Speaker 2>but I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good at jujitsu.</v>

1784
01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:25.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good striker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>

1785
01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:28.540
<v Speaker 2>And then occasionally see a guy and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1786
01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1787
01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I could not do what that guy can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just makes me,</v>

1788
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:34.110
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1789
01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's humbling.</v>

1790
01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.220
<v Speaker 2>It's humbling.</v>

1791
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I was wanting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1792
01:16:37.091 --> 01:16:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Jack Black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack Black.</v>

1793
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I was watching Jack Black the other day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I look at Jack Black.</v>

1794
01:16:43.211 --> 01:16:45.430
<v Speaker 2>I look at some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at some actor,</v>

1795
01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at brad pitt and I go,</v>

1796
01:16:48.551 --> 01:16:49.540
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's brad pitt do?</v>

1797
01:16:49.541 --> 01:16:51.790
<v Speaker 2>And I could do what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking on the movie screen,</v>

1798
01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:53.470
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm underestimating this.</v>

1799
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I'm thinking.</v>

1800
01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1801
01:16:55.361 --> 01:17:00.361
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also I was watching Jack Black and </v>

1802
01:17:00.361 --> 01:17:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Jack Black was singing and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

1803
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Jack black's doing right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect and prompts to you.</v>

1804
01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:06.710
<v Speaker 2>The homeboys got pipes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1805
01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>got pipes And I looked at the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look</v>

1806
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.760
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1807
01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:15.470
<v Speaker 1>at jonny bones jones and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have done what he just did.</v>

1808
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.380
<v Speaker 1>I look at ge at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at mcgregor and I go,</v>

1809
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you know what he's got?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some little spark that I don't </v>

1810
01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:23.530
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a flare.</v>

1811
01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1812
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:27.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a flare that mcgregor has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's half of what he does.</v>

1813
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's unbelievably talented.</v>

1814
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:35.140
<v Speaker 1>He's got ridiculous power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also this flare about him </v>

1815
01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:38.980
<v Speaker 1>when he fucking walks in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're flinging his arms and then he </v>

1816
01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:39.830
<v Speaker 1>stands there and farm his opponent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes like that.</v>

1817
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:41.660
<v Speaker 1>There's some about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1818
01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:46.160
<v Speaker 1>the fucking audaciousness of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1819
01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:51.161
<v Speaker 1>he's just so ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really impressed me when he </v>

1820
01:17:51.161 --> 01:17:52.570
<v Speaker 1>came back and beat nate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really impressed.</v>

1821
01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a very close fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put,</v>

1822
01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't have to watch it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually don't watch fights more than </v>

1823
01:17:58.700 --> 01:17:58.970
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know it was very,</v>

1824
01:17:58.971 --> 01:17:59.660
<v Speaker 1>very close.</v>

1825
01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.720
<v Speaker 1>They could have won that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1826
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I thought so too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't.</v>

1827
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.670
<v Speaker 1>And even just as close as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was impressed and that was,</v>

1828
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:12.671
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most impressive feats I've </v>

1829
01:18:12.671 --> 01:18:14.951
<v Speaker 1>seen as far as that mental game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about to come back and </v>

1830
01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:14.951
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1831
01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it this time that he </v>

1832
01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:19.380
<v Speaker 1>even wanted to come back 70 again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was at one 70,</v>

1833
01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second time.</v>

1834
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:23.060
<v Speaker 1>It was very Impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1835
01:18:23.061 --> 01:18:28.061
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't know that he had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty bad staph infection just a few </v>

1836
01:18:28.061 --> 01:18:31.091
<v Speaker 1>weeks before the first fight and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>on some serious antibiotics and that's </v>

1837
01:18:31.091 --> 01:18:31.940
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why he was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>drained.</v>

1838
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Like people are calling you gassed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you've never taken antibiotics </v>

1839
01:18:36.970 --> 01:18:40.301
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how fucking horrible it </v>

1840
01:18:40.301 --> 01:18:40.301
<v Speaker 1>is on your gas tank.</v>

1841
01:18:40.301 --> 01:18:41.810
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the weirdest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can be in great shape.</v>

1842
01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.840
<v Speaker 1>You get on a run of antibiotics and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body's just you gotta fucking thimble </v>

1843
01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.570
<v Speaker 1>gas tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing left.</v>

1844
01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.670
<v Speaker 1>You've got no energy for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

1845
01:18:49.671 --> 01:18:51.170
<v Speaker 1>You just can't push yourself through </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1846
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think that played a factor in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1847
01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing about mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never had a fucking peep about it.</v>

1848
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:59.920
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for me talkIng about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people wouldn't even know that.</v>

1849
01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad mother fucker and I don't </v>

1850
01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:07.301
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean they said he signed the </v>

1851
01:19:07.301 --> 01:19:07.301
<v Speaker 1>floyd mayweather deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1852
01:19:07.301 --> 01:19:07.800
<v Speaker 1>He signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did that happen?</v>

1853
01:19:07.801 --> 01:19:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It didn't happen yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1854
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:11.450
<v Speaker 1>he has sIgned floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has not signed.</v>

1855
01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>They're negotiating the naloxone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1856
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Pure boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1857
01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:17.140
<v Speaker 1>So the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1858
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:22.150
<v Speaker 1>people click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe he's going to go full </v>

1859
01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:24.110
<v Speaker 1>bernard hopkins just fucking clench and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit him in the clench and tie him up and</v>

1860
01:19:24.111 --> 01:19:24.740
<v Speaker 1>rough them up.</v>

1861
01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.320
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lean on his neck,</v>

1862
01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fIght dirty,</v>

1863
01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:30.710
<v Speaker 1>let them take points away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a shit logo,</v>

1864
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:35.800
<v Speaker 1>get disqualified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't stand in the middle of the ring </v>

1865
01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:35.960
<v Speaker 1>and try to fuck and shuck and jive with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1866
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:39.470
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not knocking a lot of people out.</v>

1867
01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:44.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good fight in terms of like to </v>

1868
01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:44.940
<v Speaker 1>see what the fuck happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1869
01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.240
<v Speaker 1>How much money is that gonna make he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna make a fuck.</v>

1870
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna make that he estimated.</v>

1871
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's true between 75 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000</v>

1872
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:58.040
<v Speaker 1>on a and then who knows how much floyd's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make somewhere in that range to</v>

1873
01:19:58.041 --> 01:19:59.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably more.</v>

1874
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:02.540
<v Speaker 1>But I think that it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested.</v>

1875
01:20:02.541 --> 01:20:03.950
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd's 40,</v>

1876
01:20:03.951 --> 01:20:08.951
<v Speaker 1>almost 41.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd's maybe the best defensive boxer </v>

1877
01:20:08.951 --> 01:20:09.120
<v Speaker 1>that's ever walked the face of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

1878
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my.</v>

1879
01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go back to willy pap,</v>

1880
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:15.600
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the guys from the old days and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure loma chanko today,</v>

1881
01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:20.810
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of overall performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>against elite fighters over the course </v>

1882
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:27.231
<v Speaker 1>of his career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy's only been tagged hard like </v>

1883
01:20:27.231 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 1>five or six times ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking freak and hard work.</v>

1884
01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1885
01:20:29.890 --> 01:20:31.650
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at him,</v>

1886
01:20:31.651 --> 01:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>he's throwing money around driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>bentleys,</v>

1887
01:20:33.841 --> 01:20:37.590
<v Speaker 1>but that fucking guy will get on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strip and he'll be running miles at 3:00</v>

1888
01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:39.290
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He opens up hIs gym,</v>

1889
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:40.020
<v Speaker 1>3:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

1890
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:42.010
<v Speaker 1>just does 15 rounds of the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

1891
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.800
<v Speaker 1>he works hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1892
01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he works that hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1893
01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:47.840
<v Speaker 1>That'll be an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

1894
01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it goes down.</v>

1895
01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.040
<v Speaker 1>He might get as connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kid his ass handed to him,</v>

1896
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:54.060
<v Speaker 1>but he might not.</v>

1897
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.790
<v Speaker 1>He might tack floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if he can.</v>

1898
01:20:57.030 --> 01:21:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Connor is very good at closing distance </v>
<v Speaker 1>and snapping off like lead shots.</v>

1899
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one of the things that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did with nate and he's a southpaw.</v>

1900
01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:10.410
<v Speaker 1>If he can just snap off one or two clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots and make an interesting,</v>

1901
01:21:10.411 --> 01:21:12.300
<v Speaker 1>it'll be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he can.</v>

1902
01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straight box.</v>

1903
01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on to judge without,</v>

1904
01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.670
<v Speaker 1>without knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without soon.</v>

1905
01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And if they do do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to do it somewhere</v>

1906
01:21:23.161 --> 01:21:25.290
<v Speaker 1>around september.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the idea.</v>

1907
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's he doing with the ufc?</v>

1908
01:21:28.391 --> 01:21:29.460
<v Speaker 1>But until then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1909
01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the lightweight division is on </v>

1910
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.330
<v Speaker 1>hostage right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being held hostage interim </v>

1911
01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.520
<v Speaker 1>something or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to do that.</v>

1912
01:21:38.521 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 1>But fucking habib.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norma got sick trying to make the weight</v>

1913
01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:42.870
<v Speaker 1>and didn't make the way.</v>

1914
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:45.030
<v Speaker 1>What happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony ferguson and habib.</v>

1915
01:21:45.031 --> 01:21:46.590
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to fight in a bebes </v>
<v Speaker 1>liver.</v>

1916
01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1917
01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.800
<v Speaker 1>he's cuttIng too much weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys,</v>

1918
01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:51.660
<v Speaker 1>they get too fucking big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1919
01:21:51.661 --> 01:21:54.480
<v Speaker 1>they get up to 190 and they try to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to 1:55</v>

1920
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:57.030
<v Speaker 1>and he couldn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was he walking around at one point?</v>

1921
01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>

1922
01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he really weighed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

1923
01:22:02.071 --> 01:22:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1924
01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Habib's grappling is so super high </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1925
01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:11.120
<v Speaker 1>I want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see that fight so bad </v>

1926
01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:11.250
<v Speaker 1>because tony ferguson is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>savage.</v>

1927
01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:15.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a straight savage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so him versus habib,</v>

1928
01:22:15.190 --> 01:22:18.120
<v Speaker 1>like I watched that fight with him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>edson barboza again the other day,</v>

1929

1930
01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:29.091
<v Speaker 1>amazing fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the guy I want to see fight </v>

1931
01:22:29.091 --> 01:22:30.810
<v Speaker 1>a guy who's one of the only guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>undefeated at the top level of the game,</v>

1932
01:22:30.811 --> 01:22:31.530
<v Speaker 1>which is habib.</v>

1933
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:36.560
<v Speaker 1>He said only god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a top contender that's </v>

1934
01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:36.800
<v Speaker 1>undefeated and it's smashed everybody in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of it.</v>

1935
01:22:36.801 --> 01:22:38.460
<v Speaker 1>How much longer until he can fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1936
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if you'll ever be able to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:55</v>

1937
01:22:41.011 --> 01:22:42.510
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

1938
01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what kind of damage was done </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his body and these rapid,</v>

1939
01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.880
<v Speaker 1>rapid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible weight cuts.</v>

1940
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1941
01:22:49.501 --> 01:22:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know his medical history,</v>

1942
01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:56.811
<v Speaker 1>his medical history or medical issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know before the Michael Johnson </v>

1943
01:22:56.811 --> 01:22:57.300
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently he had a similar problem.</v>

1944
01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:00.690
<v Speaker 1>He made the weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it was real touch and go,</v>

1945
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:03.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do that.</v>

1946
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:05.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to cut your calories back.</v>

1947
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:08.560
<v Speaker 1>You mean you want to suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut your calories back,</v>

1948
01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 1>do a lot of fucking running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop some body weight.</v>

1949
01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.640
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to and it can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1950
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:17.670
<v Speaker 1>It can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it because rapid </v>

1951
01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>dehydration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fucking die.</v>

1952
01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Someone's going to die in the ufc is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pass some new weight cutting rules </v>

1953
01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.780
<v Speaker 1>and new weight classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like.</v>

1954
01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:28.150
<v Speaker 1>This is from andy foster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy fosters the guy who runs California</v>

1955
01:23:28.151 --> 01:23:32.170
<v Speaker 1>as a state athletic commission and he is</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a fucking animal.</v>

1956
01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Any foster is one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys in terms of like commission.</v>

1957
01:23:36.701 --> 01:23:40.120
<v Speaker 1>The guys who run commissions in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like one of the most proactive,</v>

1958
01:23:40.121 --> 01:23:42.640
<v Speaker 1>one of the most knowledgeable and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very best,</v>

1959
01:23:42.641 --> 01:23:47.641
<v Speaker 1>maybe the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so on the ball and so he's pushed </v>

1960
01:23:47.641 --> 01:23:50.200
<v Speaker 1>hard for these new weight classes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these new weight cutting regulations and</v>

1961
01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:52.960
<v Speaker 1>such a fucking smart thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's.</v>

1962
01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:56.640
<v Speaker 1>That guy's awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the 25 weight class.</v>

1963
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Even the one 95.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weight class 10,</v>

1964
01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.520
<v Speaker 1>they should skip 70 and do 10 every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every two.</v>

1965
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five,</v>

1966
01:24:04.631 --> 01:24:05.440
<v Speaker 1>45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty five,</v>

1967
01:24:05.441 --> 01:24:05.980
<v Speaker 1>65.</v>

1968
01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Just go 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every 10 is good.</v>

1969
01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.220
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes sense.</v>

1970
01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:14.540
<v Speaker 1>When you got to like 70 and then you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got 85 and they get 85 and two.</v>

1971
01:24:14.621 --> 01:24:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's too many.</v>

1972
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:21.060
<v Speaker 1>That's too many pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean gsp versus what were they going </v>

1973
01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:21.310
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gsp versus bisping?</v>

1974
01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to explain this to people </v>

1975
01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:26.460
<v Speaker 1>because I've been in the room and stood </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to those guys.</v>

1976
01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Busy being is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

1977
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:29.420
<v Speaker 1>big man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

1978
01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:34.570
<v Speaker 1>The gsp is a normal sized guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how that fight was going to </v>

1979
01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:36.250
<v Speaker 1>be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1980
01:24:36.251 --> 01:24:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Also bisping is currently active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gsp took years off.</v>

1981
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Bisping is capable of fighting at 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says.</v>

1982
01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Bisping said he could make 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1983
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if he wins at one 81,</v>

1984
01:24:50.801 --> 01:24:55.801
<v Speaker 1>85,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has thought about fighting either at </v>

1985
01:24:55.801 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 1>one 70 or at 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>

1986
01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:57.960
<v Speaker 1>He's a big dude straw.</v>

1987
01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I've trained with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big strong.</v>

1988
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:01.690
<v Speaker 1>He's what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six two,</v>

1989
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:02.970
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>bisping.</v>

1990
01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.930
<v Speaker 1>He's tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's big.</v>

1991
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:07.450
<v Speaker 1>He's got a fucking incredible cardio for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1992
01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:08.770
<v Speaker 1>He's a hard worker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1993
01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy is a perfect example of just </v>

1994
01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:16.381
<v Speaker 1>like the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bulldog mindset and just refusing </v>

1995
01:25:16.381 --> 01:25:20.350
<v Speaker 1>and now looking at is the chair and he </v>

1998
01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 1>something crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the whole way classes in a flux and </v>

2004
01:25:44.851 --> 01:25:47.041
<v Speaker 1>there's a funny meme of a [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bisping said that he's his knees hurt </v>

2005
01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:51.250
<v Speaker 1>because they said that the ufc said they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want them to fight you el ramiro because</v>

2006
01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:53.560
<v Speaker 1>the gsp fight is off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2007
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:54.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually my knees hurt.</v>

2008
01:25:54.851 --> 01:25:56.590
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could wait for gsp.</v>

2009
01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.020
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really train right now.</v>

2010
01:25:59.021 --> 01:26:04.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to sit back and take a </v>

2011
01:26:04.021 --> 01:26:04.021
<v Speaker 1>little break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a funny meme,</v>

2012
01:26:04.021 --> 01:26:06.740
<v Speaker 1>gsp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>michael bisping in the hospital bed that</v>

2013
01:26:06.741 --> 01:26:09.620
<v Speaker 1>says bisping be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just sit here and wait for gsp.</v>

2014
01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Yoel savage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>

2015
01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.850
<v Speaker 1>But that really bummed me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When tim kennedy asked him,</v>

2016
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:18.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was cheating.</v>

2017
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't have happened.</v>

2018
01:26:19.521 --> 01:26:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Was cheating and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was horrible.</v>

2019
01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Tim did a little bit of cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fight too.</v>

2020
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.310
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grabbed his gloves.</v>

2021
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:30.790
<v Speaker 1>He's grabbed the inside of the glove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punched him in the face a couple times </v>

2022
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.790
<v Speaker 1>while I was holding urls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glove,</v>

2023
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:33.980
<v Speaker 1>but do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people show that in slow motion.</v>

2024
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:37.250
<v Speaker 1>But what they don't understand is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing slow motion,</v>

2025
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:41.090
<v Speaker 1>like it looks like he's holding onto it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile and punching in real life.</v>

2026
01:26:41.091 --> 01:26:42.950
<v Speaker 1>It was less than a second or maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

2027
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:48.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably just chaos and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbing something just throwing shit </v>

2028
01:26:48.591 --> 01:26:51.620
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he actually knew that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had his glove consciously.</v>

2029
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:55.340
<v Speaker 1>The gloves make a really big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge grappling.</v>

2030
01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to train with them.</v>

2031
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:58.920
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to fight with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2032
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.200
<v Speaker 1>secure and chokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2033
01:27:00.201 --> 01:27:02.420
<v Speaker 1>even damien maia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see him get rear naked,</v>

2034
01:27:02.421 --> 01:27:04.610
<v Speaker 1>choke with a hand on top of the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like old school,</v>

2035
01:27:04.611 --> 01:27:06.620
<v Speaker 1>ken shamrock style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he'll,</v>

2036
01:27:06.650 --> 01:27:11.650
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he can't get the hand back </v>

2037
01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:13.181
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just can't get it and people start </v>

2038
01:27:13.181 --> 01:27:16.511
<v Speaker 1>grabbing new idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Team people are grabbing the inside of </v>

2039
01:27:16.511 --> 01:27:16.511
<v Speaker 1>that glove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

2040
01:27:16.511 --> 01:27:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot harder to finish stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have gloves on.</v>

2041
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people finish with it.</v>

2042
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Josh thompson used to grab his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>glove,</v>

2043
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.890
<v Speaker 1>which you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get deep in there.</v>

2044
01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I saw him choke somebody out with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2045
01:27:26.781 --> 01:27:28.040
<v Speaker 1>woo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>

2046
01:27:28.041 --> 01:27:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I think you can grab your own glove and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes a nice handle if you can slip</v>

2047
01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:33.170
<v Speaker 1>your fingers in there to train with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2048
01:27:33.171 --> 01:27:34.730
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to fight with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have,</v>

2049
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:39.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how hard it is to choke </v>

2050
01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:40.220
<v Speaker 1>people when you have those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially those gloves.</v>

2051
01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:43.640
<v Speaker 1>A big pat of ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even marcello garcia was having a really</v>

2052
01:27:43.641 --> 01:27:46.640
<v Speaker 1>hard time with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he had his one loan mma fight,</v>

2053
01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:49.040
<v Speaker 1>he had this dude's back and he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish them in.</v>

2054
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is because of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make a big difference?</v>

2055
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.410
<v Speaker 1>They really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should wear gloves.</v>

2056
01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree with you.</v>

2057
01:27:56.450 --> 01:28:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I think fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could kick somebody in the shin </v>

2058
01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:01.490
<v Speaker 1>to the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can shoot somebody in the face,</v>

2059
01:28:01.491 --> 01:28:06.491
<v Speaker 1>but you can't knuckle in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be so helpful for all </v>

2060
01:28:06.491 --> 01:28:09.491
<v Speaker 1>the head trauma that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they took off the gloves and you add </v>

2061
01:28:09.491 --> 01:28:11.090
<v Speaker 1>either strike with an open palm or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to pay the price because I might hit</v>

2062
01:28:11.091 --> 01:28:16.091
<v Speaker 1>you twice before I broke my hand and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be grappling with you and </v>

2063
01:28:16.091 --> 01:28:16.091
<v Speaker 1>trying to take her down.</v>

2064
01:28:16.091 --> 01:28:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if someone just ducks their head </v>

2065
01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.020
<v Speaker 1>down and you hit them with a straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch to the forehead,</v>

2066
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:24.320
<v Speaker 1>you are very likely to break your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'd be able to wrap your</v>

2067
01:28:24.321 --> 01:28:25.970
<v Speaker 1>hands either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

2068
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:27.310
<v Speaker 1>That would be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be.</v>

2069
01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:32.320
<v Speaker 1>You should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should have a cop on and a </v>

2070
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.680
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece and shorts and I really think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

2071
01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people like,</v>

2072
01:28:35.151 --> 01:28:36.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking idiot.</v>

2073
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:38.220
<v Speaker 1>You're a barbarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to cover the globe.</v>

2074
01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:38.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

2075
01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.520
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're less of a barbarian.</v>

2076
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:45.790
<v Speaker 1>You make yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make yourself more able to hit </v>

2077
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:48.200
<v Speaker 1>someone and you don't really help them </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

2078
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Like it's harder to hit someone bare </v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckle.</v>

2079
01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

2080
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:55.970
<v Speaker 1>it's more realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish they would make that change and I</v>

2081
01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.000
<v Speaker 1>wish that would change everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you can elbow somebody but you </v>

2082
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:01.000
<v Speaker 1>can't bare knuckle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2083
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Your knuckles are way more vulnerable.</v>

2084
01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Like gets way harder to to get that off </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you wrap it up.</v>

2085
01:29:06.601 --> 01:29:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Then you make it like a cast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wrap it up and you get some.</v>

2086
01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>You'll look like a nice stiff </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>

2087
01:29:12.421 --> 01:29:13.980
<v Speaker 2>We rips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Risk isn't going anywhere.</v>

2088
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Buckling and flexing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you punched someone,</v>

2089
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:18.940
<v Speaker 2>it's hard core when they wrap up those </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

2090
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even like holding pads for guys </v>

2091
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:23.990
<v Speaker 2>when we're backstage getting ready to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take there.</v>

2092
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Did they just turn it up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'll never make that change.</v>

2094
01:29:27.181 --> 01:29:32.181
<v Speaker 2>I don't saY I don't think it should and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for really for the head trauma </v>

2095
01:29:32.181 --> 01:29:35.811
<v Speaker 2>of the people that are fighting is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really needed for sure the head </v>

2096
01:29:35.811 --> 01:29:39.450
<v Speaker 2>all those times and it's not good for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2097
01:29:39.451 --> 01:29:44.451
<v Speaker 2>it's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And agaIn that goes back to the </v>

2098
01:29:44.451 --> 01:29:44.451
<v Speaker 2>grappling thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we see more submissions.</v>

2099
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be way easier to catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>people with stuff like it'd be way </v>

2100
01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.300
<v Speaker 2>easier to secure good teens and chokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just you,</v>

2101
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.240
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have all these restrIctions</v>

2102
01:29:54.241 --> 01:29:57.330
<v Speaker 2>of having something on your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your hands need to be able to articulate</v>

2103
01:29:57.331 --> 01:30:02.331
<v Speaker 2>and move to secure certain grips and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd see you'd see a lot more </v>

2104
01:30:02.331 --> 01:30:06.771
<v Speaker 2>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's too bad they don't make </v>

2105
01:30:06.771 --> 01:30:06.771
<v Speaker 2>that change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be better for everyone.</v>

2106
01:30:06.771 --> 01:30:06.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2107
01:30:06.771 --> 01:30:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first started working </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the ufc,</v>

2108
01:30:08.701 --> 01:30:13.701
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have to wear gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vituro was one of the first guys to </v>

2109
01:30:13.701 --> 01:30:16.221
<v Speaker 2>wear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm victorian tank tank was one of the </v>

2110
01:30:16.221 --> 01:30:18.141
<v Speaker 2>first guys ever to wear gloves and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wore those gloves that he was wearing </v>

2111
01:30:18.141 --> 01:30:19.980
<v Speaker 2>were like old school century martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>

2112
01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:23.370
<v Speaker 2>chuck norris gloves like nobody had even</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought to wear those.</v>

2113
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I think tank was like the innovator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the innovator for sure.</v>

2114
01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.050

<v Speaker 2>The first time ufc 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had seen anything like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>shoes.</v>

2138
01:31:12.401 --> 01:31:17.401
<v Speaker 2>I remember that he was wearing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling shoes because all these wacky </v>

2139
01:31:17.401 --> 01:31:18.990
<v Speaker 2>rules back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting to see like from</v>

2140
01:31:18.991 --> 01:31:23.991
<v Speaker 2>1993 to 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far fighting has changed and how </v>

2141
01:31:24.181 --> 01:31:29.181
<v Speaker 2>much we know about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say that fighting in 1992 was </v>

2142
01:31:31.201 --> 01:31:33.130
<v Speaker 2>theoretical and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

2143
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we also have been a now a country at war</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever,</v>

2149
01:31:48.481 --> 01:31:53.481
<v Speaker 2>15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of our guys been going overseas </v>

<v Speaker 2>So we know what works.</v>

2151
01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:55.620
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no big question anymore.</v>

2152
01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

2153
01:31:56.850 --> 01:32:01.850
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2156
01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty obvious.</v>

2157
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:07.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He here's another thing like like wing </v>

<v Speaker 2>that'll work.</v>

2160
01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.480
<v Speaker 2>If the guy doesn't know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing and you chain punch them,</v>

2161
01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.830
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

2162
01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Hit somebody 17 times in the head are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not expecting that.</v>

2163
01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.960
<v Speaker 2>He's never trained before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not good.</v>

2164
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to get that off on someone</v>

2165
01:32:19.721 --> 01:32:22.660
<v Speaker 2>who actually knows what they're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2166
01:32:22.661 --> 01:32:27.661
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me get that off on a high school </v>

2167
01:32:27.661 --> 01:32:27.661
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>

2168
01:32:27.661 --> 01:32:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going flying into your head on </v>

2169
01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:30.770
<v Speaker 2>the curb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2170
01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:31.450
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems to me that like.</v>

2171
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that video?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is becoming a huge issue in China </v>

2172
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:40.110
<v Speaker 2>as a chinese tai chi master tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight an mma fighter and just got a </v>

2173
01:32:40.110 --> 01:32:43.240
<v Speaker 2>glitter rated in 10 seconds and this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>has had to hide.</v>

2174
01:32:43.450 --> 01:32:48.450
<v Speaker 2>This chinese mma fighters had to go into</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiding because people are offended that </v>

2175
01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:51.790
<v Speaker 2>he battered this tai chee master and </v>
<v Speaker 2>made their country look bad because it's</v>

2176
01:32:51.791 --> 01:32:56.791
<v Speaker 2>making their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their traditional martial art look </v>

2177
01:32:56.791 --> 01:32:57.170
<v Speaker 2>ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a.</v>

2178
01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.430
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>

2179
01:32:59.610 --> 01:33:04.610
<v Speaker 2>we can watch this real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know why the fuck this guy </v>

2180
01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:04.720
<v Speaker 2>didn't understand what was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen when they fought.</v>

2181
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:09.780
<v Speaker 2>They sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they actually believe what </v>

2182
01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:11.140
<v Speaker 2>they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so brutal though.</v>

2183
01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:14.140
<v Speaker 2>This chee guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really bizarre is tight.</v>

2184
01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:17.710
<v Speaker 2>She's not really a physical fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial art.</v>

2185
01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:21.360
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be somethIng that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of like a meditative yoga.</v>

2186
01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:23.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like a yoga deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be grateful.</v>

2187
01:33:23.741 --> 01:33:25.600
<v Speaker 2>I had one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my buddIes,</v>

2188
01:33:25.630 --> 01:33:27.970
<v Speaker 2>a black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy named jeff higgs,</v>

2189
01:33:27.971 --> 01:33:32.110
<v Speaker 2>old school jujitsu guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he got told by a thai guy,</v>

2190
01:33:32.710 --> 01:33:33.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't take me down.</v>

2191
01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my buddy see that.</v>

2192
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that guy just got obliterated and</v>

2193
01:33:40.331 --> 01:33:44.320
<v Speaker 2>the only way you can ever actually know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what would happen if someone punches you</v>

2194
01:33:44.321 --> 01:33:47.800
<v Speaker 2>in the face is to train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way if you just have these ideas in</v>

2195
01:33:47.801 --> 01:33:49.180
<v Speaker 2>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to stand in front of them.</v>

2196
01:33:49.181 --> 01:33:52.120
<v Speaker 2>This guy just oozing blood all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and he's getting up.</v>

2197
01:33:52.121 --> 01:33:55.750
<v Speaker 2>He's battered his nose shattered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wobbly.</v>

2198
01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess first time it's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>punched.</v>

2199
01:33:57.690 --> 01:34:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the mma guy should have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he had a little bit more foresight.</v>

2200
01:34:03.401 --> 01:34:08.401
<v Speaker 2>and what was gonna happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should've come out and you're like </v>

2201
01:34:08.401 --> 01:34:08.401
<v Speaker 2>really done the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2202
01:34:08.401 --> 01:34:12.661
<v Speaker 2>respect and then the bow and then all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff and then after defeated him </v>

2203
01:34:12.661 --> 01:34:15.411
<v Speaker 2>should have helped him if he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he maybe that would have helped him </v>

2204
01:34:15.411 --> 01:34:16.060
<v Speaker 2>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a political standpoint.</v>

2205
01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Yeah,</v>

2206
01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:20.310
<v Speaker 2>he can wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2207
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:25.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that this is something </v>

2208
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:27.061
<v Speaker 2>that they need to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really do because there's too many </v>

2209
01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:27.670
<v Speaker 2>people out there that are just buying </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this foolish shit.</v>

2210
01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:28.630
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Quito people say cI and all that.</v>

01:35:21.371 --> 01:35:25.720
<v Speaker 2>that the guy actually believed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the type of mental illness it is.</v>

2238
01:35:26.931 --> 01:35:28.100
<v Speaker 2>BuT I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2240
01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:31.850
<v Speaker 2>It's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to bring that up right now,</v>

2241
01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:37.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's so often on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a couple people that are now.</v>

2242
01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Every time I talk about jujitsu at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like flat earth,</v>

2243
01:35:39.771 --> 01:35:41.030
<v Speaker 2>flat earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe it.</v>

2244
01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:44.210
<v Speaker 2>People believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get fucking shit every day from people</v>

2245
01:35:44.211 --> 01:35:47.360
<v Speaker 2>that are flatter with supporters that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are mad at me for exposing.</v>

2246
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:49.220
<v Speaker 2>They just want to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

2247
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:52.090
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a weird thing with,</v>

2248
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:57.160
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the main guys who send a flat </v>

2249
01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.861
<v Speaker 2>earth makes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a whole vIdeo about how jujitsu </v>

2250
01:35:59.861 --> 01:36:02.141
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work and it's about wing chung </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't there like one of his biggest </v>

2251
01:36:02.141 --> 01:36:02.141
<v Speaker 2>videos on this page?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2252
01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:07.700
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is something about people </v>

2253
01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:10.961
<v Speaker 2>wanting to believe that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mysteries and secrets that there's some </v>

2254
01:36:10.961 --> 01:36:11.230
<v Speaker 2>secret power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2255
01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:12.410
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2256
01:36:12.411 --> 01:36:17.411
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you could just center </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and a college wrestler can't </v>

2257
01:36:17.411 --> 01:36:20.831
<v Speaker 2>take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of my new thIngs that I tell </v>

2258
01:36:20.831 --> 01:36:20.900
<v Speaker 2>people with youtube because I used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

2259
01:36:20.901 --> 01:36:23.070
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu is magic because it kind of is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2260
01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.210
<v Speaker 2>when you know jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do things that are almost magic.</v>

2261
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:28.040
<v Speaker 2>But then when you're teaching somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time,</v>

2262
01:36:28.041 --> 01:36:28.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2263
01:36:28.551 --> 01:36:30.050
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not magic.</v>

2264
01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:35.170
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always shown when somebody the other </v>

2265
01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:35.170
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2266
01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:37.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elbow escape or something from the </v>

2267
01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:37.720
<v Speaker 2>mount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy's like,</v>

2268
01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:37.720
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2269
01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:37.720
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2270
01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.370
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to do because he keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling my arm away,</v>

2271
01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.520
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2272
01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fight urine.</v>

2273
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:45.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you have to fight against the other</v>

2274
01:36:45.501 --> 01:36:50.501
<v Speaker 2>person to another human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Just told him what to do and I told </v>

2275
01:36:50.501 --> 01:36:50.501
<v Speaker 2>you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got to fight for it.</v>

2276
01:36:50.501 --> 01:36:51.500
<v Speaker 2>You've got to figure out how to get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right position.</v>

2277
01:36:52.130 --> 01:36:55.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not magic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is weird that people that,</v>

2278
01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:55.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2279
01:36:55.661 --> 01:36:59.130
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for something to believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>in I guess,</v>

2280
01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:01.770
<v Speaker 2>and maybe they just want a contrarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints,</v>

2281
01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:03.740
<v Speaker 2>so that's why they picked saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth is flat.</v>

2282
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think it's,</v>

2283
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:08.960
<v Speaker 2>it's sorta the same thing with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting shortcoming from going down this</v>

2284
01:37:08.961 --> 01:37:09.690
<v Speaker 2>road right now.</v>

2285
01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I just want to walk away and of podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out.</v>

2286
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:15.440
<v Speaker 2>people love shortcuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love,</v>

2287
01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:20.120
<v Speaker 2>they love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like throwing out the entire paradigm of</v>

2288
01:37:20.121 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 2>modern civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all based on a lie.</v>

2289
01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.410
<v Speaker 2>We're not on a globe worn a flat disc </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

2290
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Universe spins around us like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2291
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:34.190
<v Speaker 2>people that just like to argue is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe just people that like to argue and</v>

2292
01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.440
<v Speaker 2>have a country that could be some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them for sure.</v>

2293
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:38.450
<v Speaker 2>That could be some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some of them,</v>

2294
01:37:38.451 --> 01:37:43.451
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just that there are people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that straight up just straight up </v>

2295
01:37:43.451 --> 01:37:46.470

<v Speaker 1>killed themselves in.</v>

2310
01:38:13.891 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>The comment was flying by and it shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>you again,</v>

2311
01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:22.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're talking about the human mind </v>

2312
01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:26.121
<v Speaker 1>is just so complicated and complex that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's grasping for something to believe </v>

2313
01:38:26.121 --> 01:38:27.210
<v Speaker 1>in and some people aren't gonna believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in anything.</v>

2314
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2315
01:38:28.621 --> 01:38:33.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that guy richie </v>

2316
01:38:33.621 --> 01:38:35.091
<v Speaker 1>brought up the other day about your book</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme ownership and It's one thing </v>

2317
01:38:35.091 --> 01:38:38.361
<v Speaker 1>that I think you and I are both really </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on is the way the brain works </v>

2318
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:44.390
<v Speaker 1>and the way the mind works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things that I </v>

2319
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:45.990
<v Speaker 1>think that you reinforce with these big </v>
<v Speaker 1>photos of your watch every day.</v>

2320
01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:51.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like the mind works in very </v>
<v Speaker 1>peculiar ways and you can and it's kind </v>

2321
01:38:51.721 --> 01:38:54.480
<v Speaker 1>of pliable and you could force it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>

2322
01:38:54.481 --> 01:38:56.580
<v Speaker 1>productive ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

2323
01:38:56.581 --> 01:39:01.581
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can express yourself in these very </v>

2324
01:39:01.581 --> 01:39:03.320
<v Speaker 1>positive productive ways and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2325
01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:07.620
<v Speaker 1>in carve those grooves of productivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of advancement.</v>

2326
01:39:07.710 --> 01:39:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what you're talking about it.</v>

2327
01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:15.150
<v Speaker 1>we just talked about the moonies and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology where people are trying to </v>

2328
01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:16.080
<v Speaker 1>do mind control and when I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind control,</v>

2329
01:39:16.081 --> 01:39:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about controlling your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

2330
01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make yourself exactly what </v>

2331
01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:22.740
<v Speaker 1>you're just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make yourself and force yourself</v>

2332
01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:25.950
<v Speaker 1>to do things and once you get in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>groove and get in that habit,</v>

2333
01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.060
<v Speaker 1>it becomes part of you and that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are and why not be that person.</v>

2334
01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Then the other person that's not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive things.</v>

2335
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people like people like to also </v>

2336
01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:38.970
<v Speaker 1>pretend that the way they're doing it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right way,</v>

2337
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be open to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some other method that's </v>

2338
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe more productive and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful who?</v>

2339
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the downfall.</v>

2340
01:39:46.511 --> 01:39:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

2341
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2342
01:39:48.741 --> 01:39:53.741
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the reasons why </v>

2343
01:39:53.741 --> 01:39:55.851
<v Speaker 1>your show is so popular and why people </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to you because you,</v>

2344
01:39:56.411 --> 01:39:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen to other people,</v>

2345
01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:02.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People listen to you because you listen </v>

2346
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:02.820
<v Speaker 1>to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You listen to what they have to say.</v>

2347
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:02.820
<v Speaker 1>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2348
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hadn't heard that before and you.</v>

2349
01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm the same way when somebody tells me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2350
01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:09.600
<v Speaker 1>this is what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't say,</v>

2351
01:40:09.601 --> 01:40:10.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>

2352
01:40:10.501 --> 01:40:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I believe something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2353
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:13.980
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting viewpoint.</v>

2354
01:40:14.010 --> 01:40:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always want to try to see things from </v>

2355
01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:19.010
<v Speaker 1>other people's perspective and it's hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the brain wants to go,</v>

2356
01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:20.760
<v Speaker 1>fuck this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

2357
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.170
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2358
01:40:22.190 --> 01:40:22.920
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2359
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:27.950
<v Speaker 1>this guy's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you always got to like pause and </v>

2360
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.950
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

2361
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2362
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:31.521
<v Speaker 1>I hate to bring this back up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that could easily be what's also </v>

2363
01:40:31.521 --> 01:40:33.861
<v Speaker 1>going on with the flat earth thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have this idea in their </v>

2364
01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:33.861
<v Speaker 1>head and then someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2365
01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:36.030
<v Speaker 1>there's no photos of the earth other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than composites.</v>

2366
01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:40.020
<v Speaker 1>If there really was around earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to see a hole and you go,</v>

2367
01:40:40.021 --> 01:40:45.021
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually there's a photo taken every 10 </v>

2368
01:40:45.021 --> 01:40:45.021
<v Speaker 1>minutes from 22,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles away,</v>

2369
01:40:45.021 --> 01:40:45.430
<v Speaker 1>have the full earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

2370
01:40:45.690 --> 01:40:47.140
<v Speaker 1>well that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2371
01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:52.190
<v Speaker 1>that's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get into this thing and they </v>

2372
01:40:52.190 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>get into this thing because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to ever and pause and</v>

2373
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.010
<v Speaker 2>look at the way they're thinking versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way other people were thinking,</v>

2374
01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:02.020
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did I get myself in a fucking trap here </v>

2375
01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:03.730
<v Speaker 2>that I get myself into an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>trap where I'm supporting an idea that's</v>

2376
01:41:03.731 --> 01:41:08.731
<v Speaker 2>not true and now I'm reinforcing that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my head and I'm fucking tightening up </v>

2377
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:13.120
<v Speaker 2>all my my borders and trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a way to not let new ideas in and to</v>

2378
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:18.270
<v Speaker 2>to reinforce my old ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know your podcast with Jordan </v>

2379
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Peterson the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of brought that up,</v>

2380
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:22.801
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anyone hasn't listened to that </v>

2381
01:41:22.801 --> 01:41:22.801
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

2382
01:41:22.801 --> 01:41:23.170
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be one of the best podcasts</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've ever heard.</v>

2383
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.200
<v Speaker 2>He's a mindblower unbelievable podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's talking about the fact that </v>

2384
01:41:28.271 --> 01:41:29.770
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>

2385
01:41:29.771 --> 01:41:34.771
<v Speaker 2>if they accept those new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden what they've done with </v>

2386
01:41:34.771 --> 01:41:35.320
<v Speaker 2>their life for the past 20 years gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown out the window.</v>

2387
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's got to be really hard and </v>

2388
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.350
<v Speaker 2>immediately when I was listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2389
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2390
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:45.061
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened in the nineties </v>

2391
01:41:45.061 --> 01:41:45.070
<v Speaker 2>when somebody that had been studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>some traditional martial art,</v>

2392
01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:47.440
<v Speaker 2>god bless them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were doing the best they could,</v>

2393
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:52.830
<v Speaker 2>but when all of a sudden something blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt in jujitsu could come in there and </v>

2394
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.870
<v Speaker 2>roll them up and choke them out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing they could do about it</v>

2395
01:41:53.110 --> 01:41:55.030
<v Speaker 2>and they either had to do one of two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2396
01:41:55.090 --> 01:41:56.710
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2397
01:41:57.250 --> 01:42:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start training this other </v>
<v Speaker 2>new thing that I don't understand or </v>

2398
01:42:02.250 --> 01:42:02.850
<v Speaker 2>block it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>WhIch was very hard to do with jujitsu.</v>

2399
01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the good thing about mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>and about ufc is it was like,</v>

2400
01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can deny it all you want,</v>

2401
01:42:08.471 --> 01:42:09.940
<v Speaker 2>but you have to face this guy on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mat.</v>

2402
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:12.070
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you do that,</v>

2403
01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:17.100
<v Speaker 2>you're goIng to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas with all these kind of </v>

2404
01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:18.460
<v Speaker 2>intellectual arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times it's just I say you say,</v>

2405
01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I say you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you tell me,</v>

2406
01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.680
<v Speaker 2>if I'm telling you that every picture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth is whatever,</v>

2407
01:42:23.681 --> 01:42:28.681
<v Speaker 2>cgi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I'm going to hold and </v>

2408
01:42:28.681 --> 01:42:31.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to let it go and how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to prove to me otherwise in every </v>

2409
01:42:31.201 --> 01:42:31.201
<v Speaker 2>single picture you showed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say no,</v>

2410
01:42:31.201 --> 01:42:32.080
<v Speaker 2>that cgi and you show me another </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

2411
01:42:32.081 --> 01:42:34.300
<v Speaker 2>And I say to her that cgi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're never going to get anywhere.</v>

2412
01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:39.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not arguing with you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to tap just to turtle</v>

2413
01:42:39.401 --> 01:42:44.401
<v Speaker 2>up in a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to go through three of those men </v>

2414
01:42:44.401 --> 01:42:45.040
<v Speaker 2>because I started out with taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was.</v>

2415
01:42:45.190 --> 01:42:50.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good martial art for </v>

2416
01:42:50.190 --> 01:42:50.190
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

2417
01:42:50.190 --> 01:42:51.040
<v Speaker 2>It's got a by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got too many holes in it,</v>

2418
01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:53.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great martial art for </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing kicks.</v>

2419
01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:59.040
<v Speaker 2>And when I went from that to kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized how easy it was to get </v>

2420
01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.160
<v Speaker 2>punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2421
01:43:00.161 --> 01:43:05.161
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then I started really studying </v>

2422
01:43:05.161 --> 01:43:05.161
<v Speaker 2>boxing and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2423
01:43:05.161 --> 01:43:05.820
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ideas of like,</v>

2424
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:08.440
<v Speaker 2>how well I can fight or so </v>
<v Speaker 2>overestimated.</v>

2425
01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not nearly as good at taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good at fighting.</v>

2426
01:43:13.150 --> 01:43:15.250
<v Speaker 2>And then I started doing more tie and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2427
01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.870
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking leg kicks,</v>

2428
01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg kicks and knees to the body.</v>

2429
01:43:20.291 --> 01:43:21.310
<v Speaker 2>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2430
01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:23.170
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much I can.</v>

2431
01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:27.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm so fucked now Because I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got really good at something that kind</v>

2432
01:43:27.681 --> 01:43:32.681
<v Speaker 2>of sucks on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then from there jujitsu where I was </v>

2433
01:43:32.681 --> 01:43:33.970
<v Speaker 2>just getting raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2434
01:43:33.971 --> 01:43:36.910
<v Speaker 2>at least with kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could throw kicks,</v>

2435
01:43:36.911 --> 01:43:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I could move around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could try not to get my legs kicked,</v>

2436
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I could try to like be more mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I was going into Jujitsu as a </v>

2437
01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:49.801
<v Speaker 2>white belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just getting fucking mall to what </v>

2438
01:43:49.801 --> 01:43:49.801
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had accepted.</v>

2439
01:43:49.801 --> 01:43:51.770
<v Speaker 2>And then so I literally stopped doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else and they said,</v>

2440
01:43:51.771 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2441
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:54.020
<v Speaker 4>I've got to get Better at this in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>

2442
01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.940
<v Speaker 3>You can't even start like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh white.</v>

2443
01:43:57.941 --> 01:44:02.941
<v Speaker 3>But some of us never train jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>before is it has a zero percent chance </v>

2444
01:44:02.941 --> 01:44:04.950
<v Speaker 3>of beating a guy that's a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has zero,</v>

2445
01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.790
<v Speaker 3>zero percent chance that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>goIng to go down.</v>

2446
01:44:07.210 --> 01:44:11.190
<v Speaker 3>If you take somebody that doesn't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to fight against a boxer there,</v>

2447
01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:16.200
<v Speaker 3>there is a puncher's chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a punch or she's not </v>

2448
01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:16.930
<v Speaker 3>probably not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a crazy chance.</v>

2449
01:44:16.931 --> 01:44:21.931
<v Speaker 3>But it could end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least the the person that hasn't </v>

2450
01:44:21.931 --> 01:44:25.651
<v Speaker 3>boxed before has some semblance of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of what to do.</v>

2451
01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Block the punches from hitting me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>try and punch the other guy.</v>

2452
01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you don't know Jujitsu,</v>

2453
01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:33.040
<v Speaker 3>you don't even understand what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

2454
01:44:33.110 --> 01:44:34.300
<v Speaker 3>You're completely lost.</v>

2455
01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:39.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's certain positions like if </v>

2456
01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:40.841
<v Speaker 4>you get your Back taking or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that where you're almost 100 </v>

2457
01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:40.841
<v Speaker 4>percent dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2458
01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:45.301
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that there's parallels to </v>

2459
01:44:45.301 --> 01:44:47.381
<v Speaker 4>that in life because if you look at life</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you look at the way you're behaving </v>

2460
01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:50.921
<v Speaker 4>and the way you're thinking and the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>you choose to accept Ideas and the way </v>

2461
01:44:50.921 --> 01:44:54.800
<v Speaker 4>that you choose to view the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're so rigid in your ideology that</v>

2462
01:44:54.801 --> 01:44:59.801
<v Speaker 4>you're unwilling to accept any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>new information and new data or any sort</v>

2463
01:45:00.831 --> 01:45:05.780
<v Speaker 4>of contrary data or information like </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who's telling you something that</v>

2464
01:45:05.781 --> 01:45:07.180
<v Speaker 4>you don't agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>

2465
01:45:07.190 --> 01:45:07.820
<v Speaker 4>you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2466
01:45:07.821 --> 01:45:08.630
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2467
01:45:08.631 --> 01:45:13.631
<v Speaker 4>well what's your perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of Just agreeing or disagreeing </v>

2468
01:45:13.631 --> 01:45:13.850
<v Speaker 4>with them and arguing and going to war </v>
<v Speaker 4>with them,</v>

2469
01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.410
<v Speaker 4>try to take it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try to go,</v>

2470
01:45:15.411 --> 01:45:20.411
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what is this guy saying that has </v>

2471
01:45:20.411 --> 01:45:20.411
<v Speaker 4>merit?</v>

2472
01:45:20.411 --> 01:45:20.411
<v Speaker 4>Where's this guy coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if I.</v>

2473
01:45:20.411 --> 01:45:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Even if I totally disagree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2474
01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.940
<v Speaker 4>What makes him think this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where?</v>

2475
01:45:22.941 --> 01:45:27.941
<v Speaker 4>What's going on in your head that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that we should take everyone's </v>

2476
01:45:27.941 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 4>money and distriButed equally across the</v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

2477
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:32.840
<v Speaker 4>Like there's people that believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that everyone who's ever been successful</v>

2478
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:37.930
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another got through stealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then what we need to do is take all </v>

2479
01:45:37.930 --> 01:45:38.240
<v Speaker 4>the money in the country and </v>
<v Speaker 4>redistribute all this.</v>

2480
01:45:38.241 --> 01:45:41.390
<v Speaker 4>Well so everybody gets $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2481
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:43.910
<v Speaker 4>well why do you think this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool?</v>

2482
01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know.</v>

2483
01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:49.771
<v Speaker 4>You know I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might argue with it or I might see </v>

2484
01:45:49.771 --> 01:45:51.290
<v Speaker 4>your point or I might think that if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>did do this,</v>

2485
01:45:51.291 --> 01:45:53.030
<v Speaker 4>but you still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you did this right now,</v>

2486
01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.950
<v Speaker 4>this is what I think if you did this </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

2487
01:45:55.070 --> 01:46:00.070
<v Speaker 4>if you took all the money from all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>billionaires and all these fucking rich </v>

2488
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:01.100
<v Speaker 4>tycoons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of them and took all theIr money and</v>

2489
01:46:01.101 --> 01:46:04.220
<v Speaker 4>distributed it equally amongst everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the country,</v>

2490
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:09.370
<v Speaker 4>how long would it take if you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed normal capitalism to flourish </v>

2491
01:46:09.370 --> 01:46:10.940
<v Speaker 4>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long would it take before the levels</v>

2492
01:46:10.941 --> 01:46:12.230
<v Speaker 4>went right back to where they are?</v>

2493
01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:14.260
<v Speaker 4>Would it be 10 years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would it be 20?</v>

2494
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:14.900
<v Speaker 4>How long would it take</v>

2495
01:46:15.010 --> 01:46:20.010
<v Speaker 3>belong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way I explained that concept to my </v>

2496
01:46:20.010 --> 01:46:20.090
<v Speaker 3>children was I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2497
01:46:20.091 --> 01:46:22.280
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what communism is,</v>

2498
01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:23.630
<v Speaker 3>because this is what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2499
01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:24.560
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's.</v>

2500
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:27.560
<v Speaker 3>My kids are really hard workers and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do well in school,</v>

2501
01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.760
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2502
01:46:28.761 --> 01:46:30.740
<v Speaker 3>you study hard for your test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2503
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you get a nInety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95 on your test and then what happens </v>

2504
01:46:36.010 --> 01:46:39.230
<v Speaker 3>with communism is there's another kid in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your class who's the dumbest kid,</v>

2505
01:46:39.231 --> 01:46:40.150
<v Speaker 3>billy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2506
01:46:40.151 --> 01:46:41.510
<v Speaker 3>billy's getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2507
01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:46.560
<v Speaker 3>a third now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we're gonna do is you're going </v>

2508
01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:49.101
<v Speaker 3>to take the test and then we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take whatever points from you and given </v>

2509
01:46:49.101 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 3>to Billy so that you both get a d and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's</v>

2510
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.320
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what communism missing.</v>

2511
01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Now if I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that can insPire you to work any </v>

2512
01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:58.470
<v Speaker 2>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer's obviously no,</v>

2513
01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:00.780
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get a d no matter what.</v>

2514
01:47:01.010 --> 01:47:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Is it going to inspire billy to work any</v>
<v Speaker 2>harder?</v>

2515
01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:04.860
<v Speaker 2>The answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not,</v>

2516
01:47:04.861 --> 01:47:09.861
<v Speaker 2>but he's not going to work any harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we have is no one working and </v>

2517
01:47:09.861 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens in communism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2518
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:15.020
<v Speaker 2>you're all just level set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're all gonna get the same thing and </v>

2519
01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:15.020
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's failed everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tried.</v>

2520
01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the right idea for just the way</v>

2521
01:47:18.331 --> 01:47:21.810
<v Speaker 2>the human reward system works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the right idea for motivation.</v>

2522
01:47:21.811 --> 01:47:26.811
<v Speaker 2>It's not a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right idea for like the only way things </v>

2523
01:47:26.811 --> 01:47:27.860
<v Speaker 2>get done and the only way you get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>laptop or a Big skyscraper,</v>

2524
01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:29.130
<v Speaker 2>someone has to profit from it.</v>

2525
01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.350
<v Speaker 2>They have to get something out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

2526
01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:36.410
<v Speaker 2>someone has to make that haPpen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone has to be driven to want that </v>

2527
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:40.281
<v Speaker 2>laptop and to want that skyscraper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody got a want to make that and </v>

2528
01:47:40.281 --> 01:47:41.250
<v Speaker 2>you're right for them to want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be some reward.</v>

2529
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:46.550
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be some of being driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>is you gotta have something to show for </v>

2530
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:50.271
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we gotta be really careful that the </v>

2531
01:47:50.271 --> 01:47:52.110
<v Speaker 2>amount of wealth that you spread around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you spread it all around,</v>

2532
01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:54.720
<v Speaker 2>you're going to end up with no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to achieve anything.</v>

2533
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I hear bernie sanders talk and he </v>

2534
01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:01.020
<v Speaker 2>seems like a really nice guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like he really has his mind in the</v>

2535
01:48:01.021 --> 01:48:02.730
<v Speaker 2>right place in his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the right place,</v>

2536
01:48:02.731 --> 01:48:05.940
<v Speaker 2>and this idea of democratic socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See him talking to people.</v>

2537
01:48:05.941 --> 01:48:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2538
01:48:06.301 --> 01:48:08.100
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely better than being </v>
<v Speaker 2>greedy.</v>

2539
01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:11.010
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely better than being </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupted by the banks.</v>

2540
01:48:11.011 --> 01:48:14.160
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely better than being </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupted by wall street and given these</v>

2541
01:48:14.161 --> 01:48:19.161
<v Speaker 2>bullshit phony speeches for hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars in fucking over people </v>

2542
01:48:19.161 --> 01:48:21.120
<v Speaker 2>for profit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does that shit.</v>

2543
01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:24.150
<v Speaker 2>But does socialism really work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to work.</v>

2544
01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:29.180
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to like work in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>humAn motivation doesn't even work for </v>

2545
01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:32.700
<v Speaker 2>bernIe sanders who has multiple homes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy's got multiple ones.</v>

2546
01:48:32.701 --> 01:48:37.701
<v Speaker 2>You just bought our house for $800,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does he open that up to?</v>

2547
01:48:38.041 --> 01:48:39.870
<v Speaker 2>The public to come and stay in his house</v>
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>

2548
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

2549
01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:42.810
<v Speaker 2>So it it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sold out.</v>

2550
01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:46.350
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different thing at garden.</v>

2551
01:48:46.351 --> 01:48:48.420
<v Speaker 2>This money surfing the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.650
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>

2553
01:48:49.651 --> 01:48:54.651
<v Speaker 2>You did it and that money and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go out and buy that second home </v>

2554
01:48:54.651 --> 01:48:54.651
<v Speaker 2>on a lake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

2555
01:48:54.651 --> 01:48:55.290
<v Speaker 2>good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bernie,</v>

2556
01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:59.820
<v Speaker 2>but don't try and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it like that's like,</v>

2557
01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:03.210
<v Speaker 2>like that's okay to take everyone else's</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2558
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:06.450
<v Speaker 2>They will do to everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not to me it doesn't work.</v>

2559
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The concept of income inequality is </v>

2560
01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:11.480
<v Speaker 2>always strange because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2561
01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:11.680
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you should,</v>

2562
01:49:11.681 --> 01:49:15.720
<v Speaker 2>you make the same amount of money for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>job that doesn't have the same amount of</v>

2563
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:17.130
<v Speaker 2>importance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If again,</v>

2564
01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:20.070
<v Speaker 2>let's just go aHead and straight up </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer for you know.</v>

2565
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:21.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't.</v>

2566
01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:24.870
<v Speaker 2>If you got paid after 10 years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical school,</v>

2567
01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:30.110
<v Speaker 2>the same that you get paid to drive a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bus after you busted your ass and worked</v>

2568
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:32.910
<v Speaker 2>hard and had to study and do all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff to go to medical school and by the</v>

2569
01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:37.911
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you built up a bunch of debt trying to </v>

2570
01:49:37.911 --> 01:49:39.621
<v Speaker 2>go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you just become a bus driver </v>

2571
01:49:39.621 --> 01:49:40.610
<v Speaker 2>for innovation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can be financial relationship.</v>

2572
01:49:40.650 --> 01:49:41.840
<v Speaker 2>We hope when we.</v>

2573
01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:46.860
<v Speaker 2>You got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to be careful that,</v>

2574
01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:51.550
<v Speaker 2>and of course there are people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimately need help in the west.</v>

2575
01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:56.551
<v Speaker 2>There's people with with disabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people with mental problems and </v>

2576
01:49:56.551 --> 01:50:01.081
<v Speaker 2>we've got to be compassionate and take </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of those people to the best of our </v>

2577
01:50:01.081 --> 01:50:02.290
<v Speaker 2>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we definitely watch out for,</v>

2578
01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:07.380
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's steal everything from the people </v>

2579
01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:07.380
<v Speaker 2>that worked hard and give it to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that didn't.</v>

2580
01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't seem like a good idea.</v>

2581
01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 2>It seems contrary to what we know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>human motivation.</v>

2582
01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Basic human instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2583
01:50:14.351 --> 01:50:19.351
<v Speaker 2>and then where do you stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you stop legitimately like </v>

2584
01:50:19.351 --> 01:50:22.330
<v Speaker 2>worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we could distribute all them </v>

2585
01:50:22.330 --> 01:50:24.990
<v Speaker 2>money and wealth that we've built in </v>
<v Speaker 2>american distributed over the whole </v>

2586
01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:24.990
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2587
01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I think a better concept is figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 2>why there are pockets of extreme poverty</v>

2588
01:50:28.661 --> 01:50:33.661
<v Speaker 2>and how to mitigate those pockets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty that have just been generation </v>

2589
01:50:33.661 --> 01:50:34.300
<v Speaker 2>after generation in certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods.</v>

2590
01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:37.570
<v Speaker 2>It just been extreme poverty and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that grow up there,</v>

2591
01:50:37.571 --> 01:50:42.571
<v Speaker 2>that's what they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sort of almost programmed Into </v>

2592
01:50:42.571 --> 01:50:42.571
<v Speaker 2>it because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're seeing it around them.</v>

2593
01:50:42.571 --> 01:50:47.011
<v Speaker 2>That is the paradigm that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they accept and it's very self limiting </v>

2594
01:50:47.651 --> 01:50:52.651
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't see anybody escape where you </v>

2595
01:50:52.651 --> 01:50:52.651
<v Speaker 2>see very few people escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very.</v>

2596
01:50:52.651 --> 01:50:53.740
<v Speaker 2>You feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2597
01:50:53.741 --> 01:50:55.780
<v Speaker 2>resistance is futile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you do?</v>

2598
01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:56.730
<v Speaker 2>You know there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>

2599
01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the details of this,</v>

2600
01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:03.850
<v Speaker 2>but there was a native american tribe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and somebody I'm sure we'll will tell me</v>

2601
01:51:03.851 --> 01:51:06.250
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a native american tribe in</v>

2602
01:51:06.251 --> 01:51:11.251
<v Speaker 2>northern California that when all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>native american tribes got designated as</v>

2603
01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:13.300
<v Speaker 2>native american tribes and they got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2604
01:51:13.301 --> 01:51:16.450
<v Speaker 2>here's what you're going to get and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is your tribe and this is these guys.</v>

2605
01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:17.830
<v Speaker 2>FoR whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get it.</v>

2606
01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:21.070
<v Speaker 2>They didn't get designated as a native </v>
<v Speaker 2>american tribe.</v>

2607
01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:23.830
<v Speaker 2>They just got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got passed over.</v>

2608
01:51:23.890 --> 01:51:28.890
<v Speaker 2>No one noticed them and now all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>members of that tribe like completely </v>

2609
01:51:28.890 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 2>dominate dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ron,</v>

2610
01:51:29.171 --> 01:51:30.070
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Financially,</v>

2611
01:51:30.071 --> 01:51:31.420
<v Speaker 2>they own everything up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2612
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:32.650
<v Speaker 2>they kind of kicked ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2613
01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:38.460
<v Speaker 2>And it's Because they had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of times when when </v>

2614
01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:40.300
<v Speaker 2>people just get given stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a very,</v>

2615
01:51:40.301 --> 01:51:42.310
<v Speaker 2>very difficult for them to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2616
01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:44.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go out and work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2617
01:51:45.010 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 2>am I going to bus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2618
01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:51.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a classic example of hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I going to bust my ass at mcdonald's </v>

2619
01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:51.940
<v Speaker 2>for eight bucks an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 hours a week or whatever,</v>

2620
01:51:51.941 --> 01:51:53.590
<v Speaker 2>thIrty hours a week for nine bucks an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>

2621
01:51:53.591 --> 01:51:58.591
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work that hard doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or am I just going to take my welfare </v>

2622
01:51:58.591 --> 01:51:58.591
<v Speaker 2>check?</v>

2623
01:51:58.591 --> 01:52:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Which is equal to or almost equal to for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting around doing nothing.</v>

2624
01:52:01.730 --> 01:52:04.210
<v Speaker 2>But that's not a hard questIon to answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>for many,</v>

2625
01:52:04.211 --> 01:52:04.960
<v Speaker 2>many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2626
01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sit around and do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had to be careful that it's hard.</v>

2627
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is hard.</v>

2628
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:15.430
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a natural inclination that people </v>

2629
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:16.180
<v Speaker 2>have to do the least amount to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just be as comfortable as possible or</v>

2630
01:52:16.181 --> 01:52:18.070
<v Speaker 2>as lazy as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2631
01:52:18.071 --> 01:52:23.071
<v Speaker 2>I think your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your statement that you always say </v>

2632
01:52:23.071 --> 01:52:24.910
<v Speaker 2>dicicco discipline equals freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People should have that shit tattooed on</v>

2633
01:52:24.911 --> 01:52:26.170
<v Speaker 2>their thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2634
01:52:26.171 --> 01:52:27.850
<v Speaker 2>you should look at that when you get up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning,</v>

2635
01:52:27.851 --> 01:52:32.410
<v Speaker 2>you put your underwear on like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit is so important because if you</v>

2636
01:52:32.411 --> 01:52:37.411
<v Speaker 2>do have discipline and if you do go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and get the things done that you </v>

2637
01:52:37.411 --> 01:52:40.390
<v Speaker 2>need to get done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have freedom and you feel better and</v>

2638
01:52:40.391 --> 01:52:45.391
<v Speaker 2>you feel relaxed because you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that balloon hoverIng </v>

2639
01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 2>over you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that balloon</v>

2640
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:51.250
<v Speaker 1>of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just knowing that you're not doing your </v>

2641
01:52:51.250 --> 01:52:55.241
<v Speaker 1>best knowing that you're not out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>hustling and if you just get a free </v>

2642
01:52:55.241 --> 01:52:58.100
<v Speaker 1>check every month and they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go out there and kick ass,</v>

2643
01:52:58.101 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of get by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy that doesn't.</v>

2644
01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not conducive to lighting that fire</v>

2645
01:53:03.381 --> 01:53:05.030
<v Speaker 1>under your ass that you need to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

2646
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:10.510
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to point this out for I think </v>

2647
01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:10.520
<v Speaker 1>the second or third time today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no sociologist,</v>

2648
01:53:10.521 --> 01:53:15.521
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not some big guy that understands </v>

2649
01:53:15.521 --> 01:53:15.830
<v Speaker 1>the mechanisms of the welfare state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

2650
01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going off of what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I think,</v>

2651
01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:19.790
<v Speaker 1>which is similar to what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2652
01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:22.430
<v Speaker 1>if I was just getting a check for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything,</v>

2653
01:53:22.490 --> 01:53:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't feel good aBout it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2654
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't feel good about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that there are people </v>

2655
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:30.050
<v Speaker 1>that go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2656
01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:32.270
<v Speaker 1>if I can get free money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take the free money.</v>

2657
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:37.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a concept of universal basic </v>

2658
01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:39.401
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of interesting though </v>

2659
01:53:39.401 --> 01:53:41.270
<v Speaker 1>because this idea is that once we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>automation and once we get an artificial</v>

2660
01:53:41.271 --> 01:53:45.650
<v Speaker 1>intelligence that there's going to be so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many Jobs that don't exist anymore,</v>

2661
01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:50.090
<v Speaker 1>that we've got to figure out what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all these people and the idea is if</v>

2662
01:53:50.091 --> 01:53:52.130
<v Speaker 1>you just have your basic needs taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of,</v>

2663
01:53:52.150 --> 01:53:55.250
<v Speaker 1>like not enough so that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually thrive,</v>

2664
01:53:55.580 --> 01:54:00.580
<v Speaker 1>But just we have food and shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people would then pursue their </v>

2665
01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:05.111
<v Speaker 1>actual love and what they're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate about and would it be the </v>

2666
01:54:05.111 --> 01:54:05.111
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2667
01:54:05.111 --> 01:54:07.010
<v Speaker 1>there's tests they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing on it now.</v>

2668
01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:10.490
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to find out would the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same amount of people be successful,</v>

2669
01:54:10.491 --> 01:54:15.491
<v Speaker 1>would more be successful or would less </v>
<v Speaker 1>like how many people would pursue their </v>

2670
01:54:15.491 --> 01:54:17.000
<v Speaker 1>dream if they knew they didn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about starving to death,</v>

2671
01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:18.940
<v Speaker 1>they just got money every month they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>

2672
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:23.990
<v Speaker 1>they knew where they were going to sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat and then they could just go and </v>

2673
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:23.990
<v Speaker 1>do whatever the fuck they want to do.</v>

2674
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Or would that just squash motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2675
01:54:27.610 --> 01:54:29.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the answer is.</v>

2676
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd say what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2677
01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's squashed as motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>

2678
01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Would it for you if you got a check </v>
<v Speaker 1>every month for like 12 grand or 12 </v>

2679
01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:38.900
<v Speaker 1>grand for the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

2680
01:54:38.901 --> 01:54:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you give people like a thousand bucks</v>

2681
01:54:41.601 --> 01:54:44.000
<v Speaker 1>a year or a thousand bucks a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousand bucks a month.</v>

2682
01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe double that.</v>

2683
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Just enough that you could just get by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2684
01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:50.030
<v Speaker 1>you're not boiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two questions.</v>

2685
01:54:50.150 --> 01:54:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course would add what I take free </v>

2686
01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:55.150
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2687
01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Would I feel good about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2688
01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does that money come from?</v>

2689
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does it come from?</v>

2690
01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the thing that I also </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained to my kids is that,</v>

2691
01:54:59.901 --> 01:55:00.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you,</v>

2692
01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:04.310
<v Speaker 1>every time the government gives a dollar</v>
<v Speaker 1>to somebody,</v>

2693
01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:06.800
<v Speaker 1>they took that dollar from somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2694
01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2695
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:09.380
<v Speaker 1>and It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2696
01:55:09.381 --> 01:55:10.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the reality of it.</v>

2697
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is like where like </v>

2698
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:17.810
<v Speaker 1>when a guy like bernie madoff or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy wall street character,</v>

2699
01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:20.390
<v Speaker 1>when they just moved some money around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make money,</v>

2700
01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:21.670
<v Speaker 1>lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2701
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:24.500
<v Speaker 1>how much you get out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where's that coming from?</v>

2702
01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Whose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose money was that?</v>

2703
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's that guy?</v>

2704
01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Where's that going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has it.</v>

2705
01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:30.620
<v Speaker 1>How does it exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2706
01:55:30.621 --> 01:55:32.180
<v Speaker 1>bernie's a bad example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2707
01:55:32.181 --> 01:55:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Because he was stealing everyone's for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best example.</v>

2708
01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2709
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:36.380
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you that.</v>

2710
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:39.290
<v Speaker 1>That uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

2711
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:44.280
<v Speaker 1>those people are formulating companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and funding companies</v>

2712
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.830
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to grow and build and </v>
<v Speaker 2>create things.</v>

2713
01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:48.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that money,</v>

2714
01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.710
<v Speaker 2>it moved somewhere and it ends up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2715
01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:52.260
<v Speaker 2>investing in a company and building a </v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

2716
01:55:52.261 --> 01:55:53.130
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

2717
01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:54.780
<v Speaker 2>that's what America is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2718
01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to build things,</v>

2719
01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:58.350
<v Speaker 2>trying to make things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2720
01:55:58.410 --> 01:56:03.410
<v Speaker 2>taking risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what is going to happen though </v>

2721
01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:03.780
<v Speaker 2>when all these fucking robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the uh,</v>

2722
01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:07.620
<v Speaker 2>the automatic driving cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trucks because that's a huge,</v>

2723
01:56:07.650 --> 01:56:08.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to vegas,</v>

2724
01:56:09.210 --> 01:56:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this when I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegas and you go to the buffet and </v>

2725
01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:15.120
<v Speaker 2>there's like 10 billion pounds of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that food comes from vegas.</v>

2726
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:18.780
<v Speaker 2>All gets trucked in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at some point all those trucks can be</v>

2727
01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:21.330
<v Speaker 2>driven by robots and that's not too far </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future at all.</v>

2728
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I think they're already doing it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia already have automated trucks </v>

2729
01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:26.830
<v Speaker 2>in Australia that are driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2730
01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:28.050
<v Speaker 2>shipping things around.</v>

2731
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:33.800
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get real weird between that and genetic </v>

2732
01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:36.380
<v Speaker 2>engineering and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we've been talking about.</v>

2733
01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:39.120
<v Speaker 2>This kid could get really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think again,</v>

2734
01:56:39.150 --> 01:56:41.730
<v Speaker 2>going back to the original conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>we started off with today,</v>

2735
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I think the weirder it gets in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>further we get away from primal sort of </v>

2736
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:49.260
<v Speaker 2>existence of hunting down food and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting against other tribes.</v>

2737
01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I think the further we get away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2738
01:56:51.210 --> 01:56:53.820
<v Speaker 2>the more we're going to have to reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to it and ground ourselves to it.</v>

2739
01:56:54.330 --> 01:56:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the very least,</v>

2740
01:56:55.381 --> 01:56:58.770
<v Speaker 2>the more you're going to have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with whatever requirements your body and</v>

2741
01:56:58.771 --> 01:57:03.771
<v Speaker 2>your mind have for difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have requirements for </v>

2742
01:57:03.771 --> 01:57:05.980
<v Speaker 2>struggle and difficulty because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body is set up to it.</v>

2743
01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:11.690
<v Speaker 2>I think Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically we have certain </v>

2744
01:57:11.690 --> 01:57:14.121
<v Speaker 2>expectations for difficulty and when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't uncover those oryx encounter those</v>

2745
01:57:14.701 --> 01:57:15.510
<v Speaker 2>expectations.</v>

2746
01:57:15.690 --> 01:57:20.690
<v Speaker 2>I think people find like a real lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning and in this lack of stress and </v>

2747
01:57:20.690 --> 01:57:25.611
<v Speaker 2>this piece and that's why we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to reach Back to this physicality </v>

2748
01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:27.170
<v Speaker 2>at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a good.</v>

2749
01:57:27.171 --> 01:57:28.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not just physicality or like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

2750
01:57:28.621 --> 01:57:31.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a mental struggle too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to achieve things.</v>

2751
01:57:31.411 --> 01:57:33.780
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's trying to be competitive,</v>

2752
01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:36.600
<v Speaker 2>if I'm just sitting there and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a job anymore and I just get,</v>

2753
01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:37.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,000</v>

2754
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:42.770
<v Speaker 2>bucks a month and that's enough for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay my food and pay my rent and I'm </v>

2755
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.770
<v Speaker 2>just going to sit there and play video </v>
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>

2756
01:57:43.110 --> 01:57:46.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence I would want to live in.</v>

2757
01:57:46.411 --> 01:57:51.411
<v Speaker 2>Might not even just be physical too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just in overcoming and </v>

2758
01:57:51.411 --> 01:57:52.650
<v Speaker 2>enduring and figuring things out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even writing a book,</v>

2759
01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're feeling like you just.</v>

2760
01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:59.660
<v Speaker 2>You have a new book out the way of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior kid and I'm sure the feeling </v>

2761
01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:02.901
<v Speaker 2>that you get when you write a book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>completion completed is I fucking did </v>

2762
01:58:02.901 --> 01:58:03.330
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made that happen.</v>

2763
01:58:03.331 --> 01:58:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get through all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

2764
01:58:05.101 --> 01:58:06.570
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of times I didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to write,</v>

2765
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:11.750
<v Speaker 2>but I got through it and here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a satisfaction of accomplishing </v>

2766
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:15.981
<v Speaker 2>goals and overcoming obstacles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and if they don't have to be </v>

2767
01:58:15.981 --> 01:58:17.820
<v Speaker 2>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's mental requirements that</v>

2768
01:58:17.821 --> 01:58:18.870
<v Speaker 2>we have as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2769
01:58:18.871 --> 01:58:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I think when people aren't mentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged,</v>

2770
01:58:20.671 --> 01:58:25.671
<v Speaker 2>they just start to fade and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not looking for the physical and the </v>

2771
01:58:25.671 --> 01:58:27.420
<v Speaker 2>mental challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to start to fade.</v>

2772
01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:30.000
<v Speaker 2>So you goTta be careful that why'd you </v>
<v Speaker 2>write this book?</v>

2773
01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a kid's book way of the warrior </v>

2774
01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:38.870
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I wrote it is because </v>

2775
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:41.360
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the things that we're talking about </v>

2776
01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're happening even to kids.</v>

2777
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:43.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2778
01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Ipads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>iphones,</v>

2779
01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:50.400
<v Speaker 3>they're sucked into technology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing completely wrong with </v>

2780
01:58:50.501 --> 01:58:55.501
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they get sucked into technology </v>

2781
01:58:55.501 --> 01:58:55.501
<v Speaker 3>and they don't ever come out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got issues.</v>

2782
01:58:55.501 --> 01:58:57.670
<v Speaker 3>And being a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you remember,</v>

2783
01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:00.220
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being a kid is hard.</v>

2784
01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Being a kid is hard and in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular book there's a kid,</v>

2785
01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:07.570
<v Speaker 3>his name is mark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in fifth grade.</v>

2786
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:11.560
<v Speaker 3>he's got kind of the typical issues that</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fifth grader has.</v>

2787
01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:16.800
<v Speaker 3>He can't do any pull ups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in gym class when they're doing pull </v>

2788
01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:20.401
<v Speaker 3>ups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's getting made fun of he's doesn't </v>

2789
01:59:20.401 --> 01:59:23.401
<v Speaker 3>know is timestables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you should absolutely know in </v>

2790
01:59:23.401 --> 01:59:23.401
<v Speaker 3>fifth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he doesn't know him,</v>

2791
01:59:23.401 --> 01:59:26.821
<v Speaker 3>so he's thinks he's stupid now he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know how to swim because he </v>

2792
01:59:26.821 --> 01:59:30.100
<v Speaker 3>never learned and he's when they go on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the field trip to the,</v>

2793
01:59:30.150 --> 01:59:31.810
<v Speaker 3>to the lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't know how to swim.</v>

2794
01:59:31.810 --> 01:59:33.400
<v Speaker 3>So everyone's having a good tIme and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>

2795
01:59:33.401 --> 01:59:38.401
<v Speaker 3>And eventually they call them out on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and finally is getting picked on by the </v>

2796
01:59:38.401 --> 01:59:38.500
<v Speaker 3>big bully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenny williamson,</v>

2797
01:59:39.050 --> 01:59:40.150
<v Speaker 3>fucking kenny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenny,</v>

2798
01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:44.160
<v Speaker 3>kenny williamson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it lasted.</v>

2799
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:46.780
<v Speaker 3>The book starts off last day of school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>

2800
01:59:46.781 --> 01:59:49.480
<v Speaker 3>All these problems come to a head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's all bummed out,</v>

2801
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:52.990
<v Speaker 3>cryIng behind the library,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes home and when he gets home,</v>

2802
01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:58.230
<v Speaker 3>his mom reminds him that his uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle jake is coming to stay with him </v>

2803
01:59:58.230 --> 02:00:02.340
<v Speaker 3>for the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uncle jake is a guy that was a seal </v>

2804
02:00:02.340 --> 02:00:07.260
<v Speaker 3>in the seal teams and he's just got out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the seal teams and he's going to go </v>

2805
02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:10.711
<v Speaker 3>to college in the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's going to spend the summer with </v>

2806
02:00:10.711 --> 02:00:13.220
<v Speaker 3>his sister and his nephew mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

2807
02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the navy seal shows up.</v>

2808
02:00:15.761 --> 02:00:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Uncle jake shows up and he sees his </v>
<v Speaker 3>little nephew and he says,</v>

2809
02:00:18.670 --> 02:00:19.120
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2810
02:00:19.190 --> 02:00:21.350
<v Speaker 3>either actually staying in the same room</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he says,</v>

2811
02:00:21.351 --> 02:00:22.240
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what going to do tomorrow.</v>

2812
02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:25.000
<v Speaker 3>You want to go play some ball with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go for a swim?</v>

2813
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:26.740
<v Speaker 3>And the kid says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2814
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to play ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun and,</v>

2815
02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:31.630
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know how to swim and don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really breaks down,</v>

2816
02:00:31.690 --> 02:00:33.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting picked on the whole nine yards.</v>

2817
02:00:33.701 --> 02:00:35.680
<v Speaker 3>And his uncle says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2818
02:00:35.681 --> 02:00:37.420
<v Speaker 3>so you can't swim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know your times tables,</v>

2819
02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.460
<v Speaker 3>you can't do any pull ups and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting picked on.</v>

2820
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.330
<v Speaker 3>We can change all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We Just have to get a plan,</v>

2821
02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.660
<v Speaker 3>put it together and make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it puts them on the workout program,</v>

2822
02:00:46.930 --> 02:00:49.270
<v Speaker 3>teaches them how to study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>teaches them how to swim,</v>

2823
02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:54.560
<v Speaker 3>teaches them jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was only that easy and what's </v>

2824
02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:00.550
<v Speaker 3>what's good is it's not as hard as </v>
<v Speaker 3>people think.</v>

2825
02:01:00.551 --> 02:01:05.551
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why the Book's </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting strong reaction because there's </v>

2826
02:01:05.551 --> 02:01:07.000
<v Speaker 3>actually pragmatic methods in there on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

2827
02:01:07.001 --> 02:01:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I went through all this stuff.</v>

2828
02:01:08.350 --> 02:01:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Not knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not knowing timetables.</v>

2829
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:12.510
<v Speaker 3>I went through that with my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My oldest daughter didn't know her times</v>

2830
02:01:12.511 --> 02:01:14.980
<v Speaker 3>tables and what she thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's stupid.</v>

2831
02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:17.350
<v Speaker 3>She thought I'm stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know my times tables.</v>

2832
02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Other kids know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know him.</v>

2833
02:01:18.670 --> 02:01:19.630
<v Speaker 3>And I said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2834
02:01:19.631 --> 02:01:20.990
<v Speaker 3>she's crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2835
02:01:20.991 --> 02:01:22.870
<v Speaker 3>this isn't whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third or fourth grade crying,</v>

2836
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.460
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm stupid.</v>

2837
02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think you're stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know my times tables.</v>

2838
02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.500
<v Speaker 3>How much have you studied them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't studied them.</v>

2839
02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:35.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you think you're going to know </v>

2840
02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:35.980
<v Speaker 3>him if you haven't studied them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean studying?</v>

2841
02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:35.980
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make flashcards.</v>

2842
02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:37.670
<v Speaker 3>An hour later she knows her times </v>
<v Speaker 3>tables.</v>

2843
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:41.330
<v Speaker 3>It's that and so I actually go through </v>
<v Speaker 3>that method in the book.</v>

2844
02:01:42.110 --> 02:01:43.670
<v Speaker 3>How do you learn how to fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting picked on.</v>

2845
02:01:43.671 --> 02:01:44.390
<v Speaker 3>How do you learn how to fight?</v>

2846
02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:49.540
<v Speaker 3>You go down to your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your Jujitsu school and you started </v>

2847
02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:49.580
<v Speaker 3>learning to jitsu and you and I both </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2848
02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:52.460
<v Speaker 3>if you know jujitsu in a great school </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight in sixth grade,</v>

2849
02:01:52.670 --> 02:01:55.340
<v Speaker 3>you're goIng to win a 100 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2850
02:01:55.610 --> 02:01:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you learn,</v>

2851
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:58.970
<v Speaker 3>do you learn that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Learn how to swim,</v>

2852
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.020
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you do that in?</v>

2853
02:02:00.021 --> 02:02:01.820
<v Speaker 3>His big thing is he's afraid of water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2854
02:02:01.821 --> 02:02:03.980
<v Speaker 3>why are you afraid of the water?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you overcome that fear?</v>

2855
02:02:03.981 --> 02:02:06.440
<v Speaker 3>How do you overcome fear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to inoculate yourself to it.</v>

2856
02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:09.200
<v Speaker 3>You start off wading in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you don't your head.</v>

2857
02:02:09.201 --> 02:02:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Then you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2858
02:02:10.191 --> 02:02:12.530
<v Speaker 3>then you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you lay down and you feel the water</v>

2859
02:02:12.531 --> 02:02:17.531
<v Speaker 3>all over your body and then eventually </v>
<v Speaker 3>you step in and then eventually you </v>

2860
02:02:17.531 --> 02:02:19.991
<v Speaker 3>start to dog paddle and then eventually </v>
<v Speaker 3>you start to swim and then eventually </v>

2861
02:02:19.991 --> 02:02:19.991
<v Speaker 3>jumped off the bridge.</v>

2862
02:02:19.991 --> 02:02:23.860
<v Speaker 3>so these are real things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you overcome fear and that </v>

2863
02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:23.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one I got from my,</v>

2864
02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:27.200
<v Speaker 3>my middle daughter who wanted to be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the school play,</v>

2865
02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:32.920
<v Speaker 3>but she got stage fright and so she </v>
<v Speaker 3>would freak out every time she would </v>

2866
02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.550
<v Speaker 3>have to go in front of a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

2867
02:02:34.551 --> 02:02:36.800
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to inoculate you to being in</v>

2868
02:02:36.801 --> 02:02:41.801
<v Speaker 3>front of people first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to sing in front of me and </v>

2869
02:02:41.801 --> 02:02:42.590
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to sing in front of me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mom,</v>

2870
02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:47.680
<v Speaker 3>and then you're going to sung in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of me and mom and your brothers and </v>

2871
02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:49.901
<v Speaker 3>sisters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're going to sing in front </v>

2872
02:02:49.901 --> 02:02:49.901
<v Speaker 3>of you know our friends that are Gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come over.</v>

2873
02:02:49.901 --> 02:02:53.071
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be 10 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're going to sing in front </v>

2874
02:02:53.071 --> 02:02:54.731
<v Speaker 3>of you know all of the people that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know at a block party and then you're </v>

2875
02:02:54.731 --> 02:02:54.731
<v Speaker 3>going to get out and you're gonna do </v>
<v Speaker 3>your rehearsal,</v>

2876
02:02:54.731 --> 02:02:57.080
<v Speaker 3>and she did it and she got a knock </v>
<v Speaker 3>related and I'll tell you right now,</v>

2877
02:02:57.081 --> 02:03:02.081
<v Speaker 3>she's not afraid of anything that girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's the saMe thing that that </v>

2878
02:03:02.081 --> 02:03:03.350
<v Speaker 3>he goes through in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overcoming his fear of water.</v>

2879
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:05.240
<v Speaker 3>He inoculates too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets used to it,</v>

2880
02:03:05.241 --> 02:03:09.170
<v Speaker 3>and then finally the final step is you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go right that you can't overcome</v>

2881
02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:11.380
<v Speaker 3>every part of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

2882
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:13.550
<v Speaker 3>There's always gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be someone known in doIng something that</v>

2883
02:03:13.551 --> 02:03:18.551
<v Speaker 3>you've never done before and then what </v>
<v Speaker 3>do you do when you prepared as much as </v>

2884
02:03:18.551 --> 02:03:21.341
<v Speaker 3>you can?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've done all the training that </v>

2885
02:03:21.341 --> 02:03:23.381
<v Speaker 3>you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you've got to step up and you got </v>

2886
02:03:23.381 --> 02:03:23.381
<v Speaker 3>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what the book's about.</v>

2887
02:03:23.381 --> 02:03:27.460
<v Speaker 3>And I wrote it so that kids can apply </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things that I learned both in the </v>

2888
02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:29.570
<v Speaker 3>seal teams and in raising my own kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can apply into to their life.</v>

2889
02:03:29.571 --> 02:03:34.571
<v Speaker 3>And the reaction's been great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been great to see all these kids </v>

2890
02:03:34.571 --> 02:03:36.941
<v Speaker 3>reading it and all the great feedback of</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids doing pushups and pull ups and and </v>

2891
02:03:36.941 --> 02:03:38.860
<v Speaker 3>training and going down and starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu and making flashcards.</v>

2892
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:40.790
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is awesome.</v>

2893
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:42.740
<v Speaker 3>And then one of the cool things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a kid is,</v>

2894
02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:44.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

2895
02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:49.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a struggle in that you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really achieved any success yet in </v>

2896
02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:52.901
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you don't realize is that </v>

2897
02:03:52.901 --> 02:03:55.510
<v Speaker 3>you've got all these possibilities to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get good at stuff like once you become </v>

2898
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:57.980
<v Speaker 3>really good at something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the real problems is people don't</v>

2899
02:03:57.981 --> 02:04:00.660
<v Speaker 3>like to get out of their comfort zone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to become a beginner again though.</v>

2900
02:04:00.970 --> 02:04:05.970
<v Speaker 3>And it's one of the beautiful things </v>
<v Speaker 3>about life is humbling yourself with </v>

2901
02:04:05.970 --> 02:04:08.230
<v Speaker 3>something new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humbling yourself and learning stuff and</v>

2902
02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:10.280
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have that lesson yet,</v>

2903
02:04:10.281 --> 02:04:13.520
<v Speaker 3>so everything is terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once they do learn it,</v>

2904
02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:15.980
<v Speaker 3>if you could teach a kid how to get good</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one thing,</v>

2905
02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:21.220
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things that led me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get good at standup comedy and all the </v>

2906
02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.970
<v Speaker 3>other things that I did is that I got </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at martial arts young.</v>

2907
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:24.260
<v Speaker 3>So I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2908
02:04:24.261 --> 02:04:26.660
<v Speaker 3>I sucked when I first started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember sucking,</v>

2909
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:31.810
<v Speaker 3>but I remember I kept working and I get </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at it because I focused and I put </v>

2910
02:04:31.810 --> 02:04:35.891
<v Speaker 3>the time in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well if I just do that without anything </v>

2911
02:04:35.891 --> 02:04:36.470
<v Speaker 3>else you've learned that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make a path,</v>

2912
02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 3>you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be done.</v>

2913
02:04:37.981 --> 02:04:38.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2914
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of one of the main points of</v>

2915
02:04:40.411 --> 02:04:45.411
<v Speaker 3>the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when the kid finally does his 10 </v>

2916
02:04:45.411 --> 02:04:45.720
<v Speaker 3>pull ups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was his goal and his uncle says,</v>

2917
02:04:45.721 --> 02:04:47.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you understand what this is about?</v>

2918
02:04:47.850 --> 02:04:49.050
<v Speaker 3>And tHis kid says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2919
02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:49.680
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about,</v>

2920
02:04:49.681 --> 02:04:50.730
<v Speaker 3>I can do pull ups now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

2921
02:04:50.731 --> 02:04:55.731
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is about everything about </v>

2922
02:04:55.731 --> 02:04:55.731
<v Speaker 3>everything that you want to do in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to work for you,</v>

2923
02:04:55.731 --> 02:04:56.580
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna have to come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>plan,</v>

2924
02:04:56.581 --> 02:04:59.880
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline to execute that plan and when</v>

2925
02:04:59.881 --> 02:05:04.881
<v Speaker 3>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be able to achieve what </v>

2926
02:05:04.881 --> 02:05:04.881
<v Speaker 3>you want to achieve.</v>

2927
02:05:04.881 --> 02:05:05.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hard work and discipline is what's going</v>

2928
02:05:05.851 --> 02:05:10.851
<v Speaker 3>to get you there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And probably a lot of kids don't have </v>

2929
02:05:10.851 --> 02:05:10.851
<v Speaker 3>anybody in front of them like jocko to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell them.</v>

2930
02:05:10.851 --> 02:05:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what,</v>

2931
02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:13.440
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in this book,</v>

2932
02:05:13.441 --> 02:05:18.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle jake is the character and he </v>

2933
02:05:18.441 --> 02:05:21.111
<v Speaker 3>actually addresses that in the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the book because uncle jake leafs and </v>

2934
02:05:21.111 --> 02:05:21.111
<v Speaker 3>the kid says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2935
02:05:21.111 --> 02:05:22.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be around anymore.</v>

2936
02:05:22.531 --> 02:05:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Who's gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's gonna lead me?</v>

2937
02:05:23.971 --> 02:05:25.620
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to help me train?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

2938
02:05:25.621 --> 02:05:28.200
<v Speaker 3>you didn't need me then and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>need me.</v>

2939
02:05:28.201 --> 02:05:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Now you know what you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's going to take hard work.</v>

2940
02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:33.090
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that I did in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

2941
02:05:33.091 --> 02:05:36.420
<v Speaker 3>which is I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played around with the idea,</v>

2942
02:05:36.421 --> 02:05:41.421
<v Speaker 3>but his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kid's dad is not really present and,</v>

2943
02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:47.120
<v Speaker 3>and the reason I did that is because a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of kids these days don't have a data</v>

2944
02:05:47.121 --> 02:05:49.200
<v Speaker 3>round and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing he says about his dad,</v>

2945
02:05:49.201 --> 02:05:52.500
<v Speaker 3>I put one line in there about his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

2946
02:05:52.501 --> 02:05:57.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says my dad's gone a lot for his job </v>

2947
02:05:57.501 --> 02:05:57.501
<v Speaker 3>and stuff that that's the only line.</v>

2948
02:05:57.501 --> 02:06:00.930
<v Speaker 3>So you Have an idea that the kid knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his dad knows that he's out there,</v>

2949
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:02.880
<v Speaker 3>he's working or doing whatever he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

2950
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:06.180
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of kids out there that</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a dad,</v>

2951
02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:11.240
<v Speaker 3>they don't have an uncle jake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was another reason why but </v>

2952
02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:13.740
<v Speaker 3>wrote the book because kids need to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>and learn.</v>

2953
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:15.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you wouldn't have done martial arts,</v>

2954
02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:16.110
<v Speaker 3>who would have told you that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2955
02:06:16.111 --> 02:06:18.630
<v Speaker 3>if you work hard and you train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get good at this.</v>

2956
02:06:18.750 --> 02:06:23.750
<v Speaker 3>That would've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you would've done that with martial </v>

2957
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:25.431
<v Speaker 3>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't done it with stand up </v>

2958
02:06:25.431 --> 02:06:26.541
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't have done it with the rest </v>

2959
02:06:26.541 --> 02:06:26.541
<v Speaker 3>of your career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have said,</v>

2960
02:06:26.541 --> 02:06:29.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would've gotten on the stage the </v>

2961
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:29.330
<v Speaker 3>first time for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2962
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:30.000
<v Speaker 3>for standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't have made anyone laugh.</v>

2963
02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:32.550
<v Speaker 3>You would have walked off set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suck and gone and got the job,</v>

2964
02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:34.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>down at down at 7:11</v>

2965
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:35.880
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2966
02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:37.200
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you,</v>

2967
02:06:37.210 --> 02:06:38.250
<v Speaker 3>if somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>

2968
02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:40.200
<v Speaker 3>of course you suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just started.</v>

2969
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Of course you suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you don't know your times </v>

2970
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:45.470
<v Speaker 3>tables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would you know him?</v>

2971
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't bond with that information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you're not good at standup </v>

2972
02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just did it for the first time.</v>

2973
02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:53.350
<v Speaker 3>You got to learn how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you're not good at standup </v>

2974
02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:53.610
<v Speaker 3>fighting taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've never done It before,</v>

2975
02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:56.490
<v Speaker 3>so you got to learn these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to put in the work.</v>

2976
02:06:56.610 --> 02:06:58.200
<v Speaker 3>You learn that lesson through martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>arts.</v>

2977
02:06:58.201 --> 02:06:59.580
<v Speaker 3>A lot of kids don't get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>

2978
02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:04.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to give them that opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 3>to learn that with this book and even </v>

2979
02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.940
<v Speaker 3>for people that aren't kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go do something you're not good at.</v>

2980
02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:08.130
<v Speaker 3>It's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

2981
02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Just try something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick up a new hobby,</v>

2982
02:07:10.231 --> 02:07:13.190
<v Speaker 3>pickup a new discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try learning how to play chess.</v>

2983
02:07:13.230 --> 02:07:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Try to just do something you suck at and</v>
<v Speaker 3>let let your mind feel what it's like to</v>

2984
02:07:18.391 --> 02:07:20.760
<v Speaker 3>be at the beginning stages of </v>
<v Speaker 3>improvement.</v>

2985
02:07:20.761 --> 02:07:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very invigorating.</v>

2986
02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean factually that's good for your </v>

2987
02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:28.420
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2988
02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:29.760
<v Speaker 3>they say you're supposed to learn new </v>
<v Speaker 3>languages,</v>

2989
02:07:29.761 --> 02:07:31.560
<v Speaker 3>learned to play chess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn to play guitar,</v>

2990
02:07:31.770 --> 02:07:36.770
<v Speaker 3>read new books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to do that stuff your </v>

2991
02:07:36.770 --> 02:07:36.770
<v Speaker 3>whole life to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what contInues to keep.</v>

2992
02:07:36.770 --> 02:07:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Just like your body falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't exercise it,</v>

2993
02:07:39.371 --> 02:07:41.350
<v Speaker 3>your mind falls apart if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise it as well.</v>

2994
02:07:41.470 --> 02:07:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely feel that if I don't do </v>

2995
02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.470
<v Speaker 3>anything new for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel stagnant,</v>

2996
02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:51.560
<v Speaker 4>but when I start doing something new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially something that I'm not good </v>

2997
02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:51.560
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I start thinking about it a lot.</v>

2998
02:07:51.930 --> 02:07:54.240
<v Speaker 4>I started obsessing about it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get invigorated.</v>

2999
02:07:54.241 --> 02:07:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I get excited about going there.</v>

3000
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we.</v>

3001
02:07:56.610 --> 02:07:59.220
<v Speaker 3>And we saw the same thing like when our </v>
<v Speaker 3>first book came out.</v>

3002
02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:01.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a leadership book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3003
02:08:01.230 --> 02:08:02.220
<v Speaker 3>and everyone thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3004
02:08:02.221 --> 02:08:07.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's another leadership book and then </v>

3005
02:08:07.221 --> 02:08:07.221
<v Speaker 3>when you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people go,</v>

3006
02:08:07.221 --> 02:08:07.221
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>

3007
02:08:07.221 --> 02:08:09.480
<v Speaker 3>this is like a new thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3008
02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:11.700
<v Speaker 3>it's a new thought I haven't seen before</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'd have these.</v>

3009
02:08:12.130 --> 02:08:15.480
<v Speaker 3>We have these things that we do where we</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring people in.</v>

3010
02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Like it's usually we go out and work </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a company,</v>

3011
02:08:17.490 --> 02:08:19.860
<v Speaker 3>we go out with one company and we go out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we work with a company,</v>

3012
02:08:20.130 --> 02:08:25.130
<v Speaker 3>but we found that there were some </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller companies or people that </v>

3013
02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:25.130
<v Speaker 3>couldn't afford to bring us in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we said,</v>

3014
02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:26.280
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do about that?</v>

3015
02:08:26.670 --> 02:08:30.570
<v Speaker 3>So we made this thing up called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>muster where we open it up to the public</v>

3016
02:08:30.571 --> 02:08:35.571
<v Speaker 3>to come and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come and spend two days going through </v>

3017
02:08:35.941 --> 02:08:38.640
<v Speaker 3>all these principles and it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you're talking about.</v>

3018
02:08:38.641 --> 02:08:41.250
<v Speaker 3>THey say it's a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's new thought.</v>

3019
02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:43.830
<v Speaker 3>It's thinking about suffering from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different light.</v>

3020
02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:46.530
<v Speaker 3>People that had been in leadership </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions for five years,</v>

3021
02:08:46.531 --> 02:08:47.490
<v Speaker 3>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 years,</v>

3022
02:08:47.550 --> 02:08:48.360
<v Speaker 3>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3023
02:08:48.361 --> 02:08:53.361
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can apply this new methodology that I </v>

3024
02:08:53.361 --> 02:08:53.361
<v Speaker 3>haven't seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't thought about before,</v>

3025
02:08:53.361 --> 02:08:56.400
<v Speaker 3>so they'll continue to grow and learn is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so important across the board.</v>

3026
02:08:56.670 --> 02:08:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3027
02:08:56.970 --> 02:09:01.970
<v Speaker 4>Stepping outside of your comfort zone is</v>
<v Speaker 4>just one of the most important things </v>

3028
02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:02.190
<v Speaker 4>for a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For whatever reason.</v>

3029
02:09:02.610 --> 02:09:03.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>

3030
02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:04.830
<v Speaker 4>but I know what works.</v>

3031
02:09:04.850 --> 02:09:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

3032
02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:08.650
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3033
02:09:08.651 --> 02:09:09.490
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to.</v>

3034
02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:12.310
<v Speaker 4>I've got a bunch of shit that I do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I suck at right now.</v>

3035
02:09:12.690 --> 02:09:14.080
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so important,</v>

3036
02:09:14.081 --> 02:09:15.970
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just started running really recently,</v>

3037
02:09:15.971 --> 02:09:20.971
<v Speaker 4>like within the last couple of months </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've noticed that you've been posting </v>

3038
02:09:20.971 --> 02:09:20.971
<v Speaker 4>about that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suck at it and I'm fuck,</v>

02:09:21.490 --> 02:09:23.590
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're getting a lot better.</v>

3041
02:09:23.591 --> 02:09:25.240
<v Speaker 4>A lot quicker though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3042
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:30.270
<v Speaker 4>Like your endurance jumps up quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like within a few weeks I was able to </v>

3043
02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:32.200
<v Speaker 4>like way past areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3044
02:09:32.201 --> 02:09:33.080
<v Speaker 4>I've got this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3045
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:37.090
<v Speaker 4>this trail that's about two point seven </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles through the hills,</v>

3046
02:09:37.091 --> 02:09:41.680
<v Speaker 4>like real steep hills and there are some</v>
<v Speaker 4>spots where I was just fucking dying and</v>

3047
02:09:41.681 --> 02:09:46.681
<v Speaker 4>now I can get through them and I can get</v>
<v Speaker 4>through them and get to the top and I'm </v>

3048
02:09:46.681 --> 02:09:48.140
<v Speaker 4>still dying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm dying less time in yourself too.</v>

3049
02:09:48.210 --> 02:09:50.750
<v Speaker 4>So I'm trying to make the times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3050
02:09:51.130 --> 02:09:51.970
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3051
02:09:51.971 --> 02:09:56.971
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just started wearing a heart rate </v>

3052
02:09:56.971 --> 02:09:56.971
<v Speaker 4>watch to which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3053
02:09:56.971 --> 02:09:57.250
<v Speaker 4>I'll let my heart rate get down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't like when I,</v>

3054
02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:57.940
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3055
02:09:57.970 --> 02:10:00.310
<v Speaker 4>when I have to take a break on these </v>
<v Speaker 4>hill sprints,</v>

3056
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:03.520
<v Speaker 4>I'll get my heart rate down to 1:40</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'll start going again.</v>

3057
02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:08.500
<v Speaker 3>People asked me that too because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get bored,</v>

3058
02:10:08.530 --> 02:10:13.530
<v Speaker 3>when you get bored of working out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also when you reach your physical </v>

3059
02:10:13.530 --> 02:10:15.070
<v Speaker 3>limitations rights or you will reach </v>
<v Speaker 3>your physical limitations on something,</v>

3060
02:10:15.190 --> 02:10:20.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're going to get down to a six </v>

3061
02:10:20.190 --> 02:10:20.190
<v Speaker 3>minute mile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

3062
02:10:20.190 --> 02:10:21.820
<v Speaker 3>And then for you to take it past the six</v>
<v Speaker 3>minute mile,</v>

3063
02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:24.130
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to like stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting kettle bells,</v>

3064
02:10:24.131 --> 02:10:25.570
<v Speaker 3>get all skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3065
02:10:25.690 --> 02:10:30.070
<v Speaker 3>you'd go to a point where you are now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be your sole focus and I know,</v>

3066
02:10:30.250 --> 02:10:31.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing you wouldn't want to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3067
02:10:31.931 --> 02:10:34.550
<v Speaker 3>I know I wouldn't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so for me,</v>

3068
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm always jumping around from Canada </v>
<v Speaker 3>from goal to goal,</v>

3069
02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:38.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll,</v>

3070
02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:40.250
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll be doing pull ups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy pulse,</v>

3071
02:10:40.630 --> 02:10:41.150
<v Speaker 3>pulse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulse.</v>

3072
02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:44.720
<v Speaker 3>So I was trying to get up my max pull </v>
<v Speaker 3>ups and then I get to a point where,</v>

3073
02:10:44.721 --> 02:10:46.790
<v Speaker 3>okay now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3074
02:10:46.930 --> 02:10:50.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to take every bit of focus in</v>

3075
02:10:50.121 --> 02:10:54.320
<v Speaker 3>my life to get to from from 58,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull ups to 62.</v>

3076
02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:58.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm cool with 52 and now I'm going to</v>

3077
02:10:58.971 --> 02:11:01.340
<v Speaker 3>start working on my dead lift or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to start training jujitsu more.</v>

3097
02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:36.470
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say it because not everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>can can make that happen and people live</v>

<v Speaker 3>and it may be a set of rings.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well not really.</v>

3105
02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:55.010

<v Speaker 3>ceiling.</v>

02:14:10.410 --> 02:14:12.630
<v Speaker 2>But if you think about how much time you</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend on the mat,</v>

3165
02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:16.020
<v Speaker 2>if I would have been playing basketball </v>
<v Speaker 2>or playing soccer,</v>

3166
02:14:16.021 --> 02:14:17.330
<v Speaker 2>I'd still get the same worse.</v>

3167
02:14:17.530 --> 02:14:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Probably worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively injury free and this is not a</v>

3168
02:14:21.811 --> 02:14:22.890
<v Speaker 2>bad tweak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

3169
02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:23.910
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll tweak.</v>

3170
02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing that I try to impart on</v>

3171
02:14:25.621 --> 02:14:30.621
<v Speaker 2>people too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like strength and conditioning </v>

3172
02:14:30.621 --> 02:14:30.621
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly strength training.</v>

3173
02:14:30.621 --> 02:14:33.240
<v Speaker 2>It protects the joints for sure and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and a lot of other issues.</v>

3174
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I think that is why I have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively knock on wood injury free </v>

3175
02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:44.660
<v Speaker 2>because two reasons I work out all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and I never take any significant </v>

3176
02:14:44.941 --> 02:14:47.200
<v Speaker 2>amount of time off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never say I'm not going to work out or</v>

3177
02:14:47.201 --> 02:14:52.201
<v Speaker 2>I never just fall into a hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through months or even two weeks </v>

3178
02:14:52.201 --> 02:14:55.320
<v Speaker 2>or even five days for me to for me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>not work out for five days.</v>

3179
02:14:55.321 --> 02:14:57.000
<v Speaker 2>There was some kind of like something </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

3180
02:14:57.001 --> 02:15:02.001
<v Speaker 2>I was like majorly sick or I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I'm traveling I'll still get it </v>

3181
02:15:02.001 --> 02:15:02.001
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

3182
02:15:02.001 --> 02:15:06.290
<v Speaker 2>But I think that that consistency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body just is used to it and you </v>

3183
02:15:06.290 --> 02:15:09.891
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get hurt as often and you're </v>

3184
02:15:09.891 --> 02:15:09.891
<v Speaker 2>like a hardcore metal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>eighties at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very little.</v>

02:17:09.691 --> 02:17:11.470
<v Speaker 3>I found a tournament in New York in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>19 eighties.</v>

3234
02:17:11.471 --> 02:17:14.880

3240
02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:35.251

<v Speaker 3>because I was into this kind of music </v>

3241
02:17:35.251 --> 02:17:37.921
<v Speaker 3>and dancing hardcore shows and metal </v>

<v Speaker 3>people's reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a couple of people that </v>

3279
02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:23.910
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3280
02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:27.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a real let down for you to </v>

3281
02:19:27.271 --> 02:19:27.271
<v Speaker 3>bring them on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you hear his story,</v>

3282
02:19:27.271 --> 02:19:28.580
<v Speaker 3>you listen to the whole podcast mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a guy who,</v>

3283
02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:33.230
<v Speaker 3>who you can hear it in his voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like his,</v>

3284
02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:38.290
<v Speaker 3>his hardest broken over some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that he's been through in his </v>

3285
02:19:38.290 --> 02:19:38.290
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Losing his father.</v>

3286
02:19:38.290 --> 02:19:39.740
<v Speaker 3>And his father was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a heroin addict.</v>

3287
02:19:39.741 --> 02:19:42.800
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his father died,</v>

3288
02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:47.420
<v Speaker 3>burned alive in a dumpster as he lit a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire to try and keep himself warm.</v>

3289
02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's died.</v>

3290
02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm buried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His mom.</v>

3291
02:19:51.201 --> 02:19:51.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3292
02:19:51.651 --> 02:19:55.100
<v Speaker 3>it's just a tragic story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is that the,</v>

3293
02:19:55.430 --> 02:19:57.590
<v Speaker 3>even though I had very few people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

3294
02:19:57.591 --> 02:19:58.070
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

3295
02:19:58.071 --> 02:19:59.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't have.</v>

3296
02:19:59.330 --> 02:20:00.560
<v Speaker 3>He swore literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3297
02:20:00.561 --> 02:20:04.010
<v Speaker 3>he swore a bunch on the podcast that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate or whatever.</v>

3298
02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:07.190
<v Speaker 3>And then I was really that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was kind of,</v>

3299
02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:07.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3300
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:09.920
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of too bad to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear someone say that,</v>

3301
02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:13.040
<v Speaker 3>that they would have that viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was really cool,</v>

3302
02:20:13.041 --> 02:20:15.320
<v Speaker 3>it was all these other people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very straight laced,</v>

3303
02:20:15.350 --> 02:20:19.730
<v Speaker 3>kind of kind of middle road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>american people that listen to podcasts.</v>

3304
02:20:19.731 --> 02:20:20.300
<v Speaker 3>We're lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3305
02:20:20.301 --> 02:20:22.820
<v Speaker 3>thanks for having that guy on what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart,</v>

3306
02:20:22.821 --> 02:20:27.821
<v Speaker 3>what a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's good for me to know about that </v>

3307
02:20:27.821 --> 02:20:31.241
<v Speaker 3>stuff and it's good for to hear someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been through the depths of drug </v>

3308
02:20:31.461 --> 02:20:34.760
<v Speaker 3>addiction and hell come back out of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and do all right.</v>

3309
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:36.230
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

3310
02:20:36.231 --> 02:20:41.231
<v Speaker 3>from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that my interaction with those </v>

3311
02:20:41.601 --> 02:20:43.850
<v Speaker 3>kinds of people when I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I certainly had,</v>

3312
02:20:43.851 --> 02:20:44.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a young kid,</v>

3313
02:20:44.871 --> 02:20:47.570
<v Speaker 3>go into New York and boston going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardcore shows and all that.</v>

3314
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:51.740
<v Speaker 3>It'll let me see part of the world that </v>
<v Speaker 3>most people don't really see.</v>

3315
02:20:51.770 --> 02:20:53.590
<v Speaker 3>And so when I got in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got.</v>

3316
02:20:53.591 --> 02:20:58.591
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of used to dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that people aren't used to </v>

3317
02:20:58.591 --> 02:20:58.700
<v Speaker 3>dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it helped me out a lot.</v>

3318
02:20:58.790 --> 02:21:02.630
<v Speaker 3>So is it a hard managing expectations </v>
<v Speaker 3>once you don't mean how many?</v>

3319
02:21:02.631 --> 02:21:04.970
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have like 75 episodes up already?</v>

3320
02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

3321
02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Last time you here you had zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it though.</v>

3322
02:21:11.050 --> 02:21:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Getting after it and it's a lot of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast is a lot different than yours </v>

3323
02:21:16.050 --> 02:21:20.201
<v Speaker 3>because I'm going deep on some subject </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm actually going to like I have </v>

3324
02:21:20.201 --> 02:21:24.131
<v Speaker 3>to study and prepare for and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>interacting with another person most of </v>

3325
02:21:24.131 --> 02:21:28.541
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time I'm interacting with </v>

3326
02:21:28.541 --> 02:21:28.541
<v Speaker 3>history so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's harder for me to prepare.</v>

3327
02:21:28.541 --> 02:21:30.800
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you've been preparing for this</v>

3328
02:21:30.801 --> 02:21:32.270
<v Speaker 3>podcast for 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3329
02:21:32.271 --> 02:21:37.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been mentally preparIng for </v>

3330
02:21:37.271 --> 02:21:37.271
<v Speaker 3>getting your experiences in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>

3331
02:21:37.271 --> 02:21:39.380
<v Speaker 3>But I have to like dive into stuff and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it is hard.</v>

3332
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:40.160
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

3333
02:21:40.310 --> 02:21:42.470
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point is yes,</v>

3334
02:21:42.471 --> 02:21:44.630
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me to do a podcast a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to read it.</v>

3335
02:21:44.631 --> 02:21:48.290
<v Speaker 3>But is it hard to manage expectations?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was getting after like.</v>

3336
02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Because once you establish like a fan </v>
<v Speaker 3>base,</v>

3337
02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:57.340
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they have this idea in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>head of what the podcast should be to </v>

3338
02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:58.280
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what they want out of it,</v>

3339
02:21:58.460 --> 02:22:03.460
<v Speaker 3>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can express that they don't like </v>

3340
02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:03.460
<v Speaker 3>where you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3341
02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that you brought this </v>
<v Speaker 3>harley guy on,</v>

3342
02:22:04.131 --> 02:22:09.131
<v Speaker 3>this guy's not what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like straight laced military guys who </v>

3343
02:22:09.131 --> 02:22:10.010
<v Speaker 3>don't swear this guy's a fucking nutty </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3344
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:13.280
<v Speaker 3>Jumps around on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

3345
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:18.910
<v Speaker 3>my answer to that is no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you why from the beginning</v>

3346
02:22:20.210 --> 02:22:23.390
<v Speaker 3>of say know when you said it was you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was you and tim ferris,</v>

3347
02:22:23.420 --> 02:22:28.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both you guys said you should do a </v>

3348
02:22:28.420 --> 02:22:28.420
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3349
02:22:28.420 --> 02:22:28.420
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3350
02:22:28.420 --> 02:22:28.420
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

3351
02:22:28.420 --> 02:22:29.700
<v Speaker 1>your podcast with tim ferriss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my all time favorite podcasts.</v>

3352
02:22:30.090 --> 02:22:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my.</v>

3353
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was cooking,</v>

3354
02:22:32.761 --> 02:22:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to my kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3355
02:22:34.021 --> 02:22:36.450
<v Speaker 1>jesus fucking christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good podcast.</v>

3356
02:22:36.451 --> 02:22:38.130
<v Speaker 1>It was intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3357
02:22:38.131 --> 02:22:43.131
<v Speaker 1>and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so deep and intense and I was </v>

3358
02:22:43.131 --> 02:22:43.131
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotta talk to this dude.</v>

3359
02:22:43.131 --> 02:22:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I got to get you one because I had known</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like from peripherally dean's fights</v>

3360
02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:50.460
<v Speaker 1>and I'd seen you around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know who you were.</v>

3361
02:22:50.730 --> 02:22:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Didn'T know your story until tim had </v>
<v Speaker 1>john.</v>

3362
02:22:52.970 --> 02:22:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In it.</v>

3363
02:22:54.620 --> 02:22:57.020
<v Speaker 3>And so you know tim again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>

3364
02:22:57.050 --> 02:22:58.460
<v Speaker 3>when he pressed stop on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

3365
02:22:58.550 --> 02:23:01.190
<v Speaker 3>on the recorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said you should have your own podcast</v>

3366
02:23:01.191 --> 02:23:06.191
<v Speaker 3>and then you told me in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the podcast you should have your own </v>

3367
02:23:06.191 --> 02:23:08.621
<v Speaker 3>podcast and obviously when you two guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>are telling me I should have my own </v>

3368
02:23:08.621 --> 02:23:08.960
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm being a complete idiot not to listen</v>

3369
02:23:08.961 --> 02:23:09.200
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

3370
02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Well you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a huge success,</v>

3371
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:13.460
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when people listen.</v>

3372
02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Everyone listened to joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to me about everything.</v>

3373
02:23:17.930 --> 02:23:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Be selective often wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as I've done it that</v>

3374
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:28.270
<v Speaker 3>I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I want to do and if people</v>

3375
02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:33.140
<v Speaker 3>don't like it that that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay with someone saying,</v>

3376
02:23:33.141 --> 02:23:33.740
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

3377
02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:35.450
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know I did.</v>

3378
02:23:35.451 --> 02:23:38.810
<v Speaker 3>So I've done some episodes that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

3379
02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:41.240
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked about the mee lai massacre.</v>

3380
02:23:41.390 --> 02:23:42.860
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the meal,</v>

3381
02:23:42.861 --> 02:23:43.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3382
02:23:43.971 --> 02:23:46.970
<v Speaker 3>people talk about these atrocities that </v>
<v Speaker 3>americans commit all the time.</v>

3383
02:23:47.570 --> 02:23:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Americans don't actually commit </v>
<v Speaker 3>atrocities all the time,</v>

3384
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:55.090
<v Speaker 3>but we have committed some heinous </v>
<v Speaker 3>atrocities in this one is well </v>

3385
02:23:55.090 --> 02:23:57.380
<v Speaker 3>documented Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mili massacre.</v>

3386
02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:02.800
<v Speaker 3>It was a company of soldiers going into </v>
<v Speaker 3>a village and they raped,</v>

3387
02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:07.430
<v Speaker 3>murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed around 500 people.</v>

3388
02:24:07.610 --> 02:24:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Just cold blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

3389
02:24:09.650 --> 02:24:11.270
<v Speaker 3>it's heinous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>

3390
02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Probably the hardest podcasts that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>done because I'm a patriotic guy and </v>

3391
02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:19.220
<v Speaker 3>here I am talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3392
02:24:19.310 --> 02:24:24.310
<v Speaker 3>american soldiers doing heinous acts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent people and,</v>

3393
02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:26.120
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've done that.</v>

3394
02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a podcast aBout the genocide in </v>

3395
02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Rwanda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

3396
02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:33.500
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know anything about that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribes,</v>

3397
02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:36.240
<v Speaker 3>and it's very hard for americans to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand this.</v>

3398
02:24:36.350 --> 02:24:39.290
<v Speaker 3>The difference between these two tribes </v>
<v Speaker 3>is nothing.</v>

3399
02:24:39.470 --> 02:24:41.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just two tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They speAk the same language.</v>

3400
02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:44.090
<v Speaker 3>They have the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look the same.</v>

3401
02:24:44.660 --> 02:24:46.550
<v Speaker 3>They have the same religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

3402
02:24:46.551 --> 02:24:49.820
<v Speaker 3>the religion was catholicism because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd been converted to catholicism.</v>

3403
02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went on a rampage and the hutus,</v>

3404
02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:57.010
<v Speaker 3>which was one tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>murdered 800,000</v>

3405
02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:00.440
<v Speaker 3>tutsis in 100 days with machetes with </v>
<v Speaker 3>machetes.</v>

3406
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:06.910
<v Speaker 3>So I've covered these dark and horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>things on my podcast and,</v>

3407
02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:12.830
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't even know really 100 percent</v>

3408
02:25:12.831 --> 02:25:17.831
<v Speaker 3>why other than this thought in the back </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my mind that I've always had,</v>

3409
02:25:17.961 --> 02:25:22.961
<v Speaker 3>which is that you have to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the darkness of the world in </v>

3410
02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:26.530
<v Speaker 3>order to appreciate the good in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3411
02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:31.740
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it was really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hear you talking to Jordan Peterson </v>

3412
02:25:31.740 --> 02:25:33.430
<v Speaker 3>because he covered that part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3413
02:25:33.431 --> 02:25:34.150
<v Speaker 3>he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3414
02:25:34.210 --> 02:25:39.210
<v Speaker 3>man is got a dark side and you won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a good person unless you </v>

3415
02:25:39.210 --> 02:25:40.020
<v Speaker 3>understand your dark side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3416
02:25:40.130 --> 02:25:44.050
<v Speaker 3>and it's interesting for me because </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson is clearly have a highly</v>

3417
02:25:44.051 --> 02:25:47.860
<v Speaker 3>intellectual and academic guy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>not right.</v>

3418
02:25:47.861 --> 02:25:49.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a nug,</v>

3419
02:25:49.211 --> 02:25:54.211
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I joined the military after high school </v>

3420
02:25:54.211 --> 02:25:54.370
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet so many of the things he says,</v>

3421
02:25:54.371 --> 02:25:55.360
<v Speaker 3>when he says them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

3422
02:25:55.361 --> 02:26:00.361
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's the same thing I stumbled </v>

3423
02:26:00.361 --> 02:26:01.861
<v Speaker 3>upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came across that reading the the </v>

3424
02:26:01.861 --> 02:26:02.210
<v Speaker 3>french philosopher or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's where he comes in.</v>

3425
02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:07.260
<v Speaker 3>I came across it in life and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting to me when I hear him </v>

3426
02:26:07.271 --> 02:26:07.780
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3427
02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:11.230
<v Speaker 3>there's darkness in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's evil in the world and we have to</v>

3428
02:26:11.231 --> 02:26:12.180
<v Speaker 3>face that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3429
02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:14.110
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as I heard him saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the podcast,</v>

3430
02:26:14.111 --> 02:26:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3431
02:26:14.471 --> 02:26:14.760
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

3432
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:19.870
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think and I can't give you</v>
<v Speaker 3>the philosophical basis for it like he </v>

3433
02:26:19.870 --> 02:26:24.091
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can tell you what I've lived </v>

3434
02:26:24.091 --> 02:26:25.681
<v Speaker 3>through and I can tell you that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand the fact that there's </v>

3435
02:26:25.681 --> 02:26:28.540
<v Speaker 3>darkness in the world and that people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beIngs are capable of evil things.</v>

3436
02:26:29.410 --> 02:26:32.430
<v Speaker 3>If you don't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to understand the,</v>

3437
02:26:32.490 --> 02:26:33.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first of all,</v>

3438
02:26:33.671 --> 02:26:38.671
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna understand what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to look out for in the world and </v>

3439
02:26:38.671 --> 02:26:40.180
<v Speaker 3>what we need to be aware of as a society</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as a,</v>

3440
02:26:40.210 --> 02:26:45.210
<v Speaker 3>as a race of humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also you're not going to appreciate </v>

3441
02:26:45.210 --> 02:26:48.550
<v Speaker 3>things in the world that are beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and good and positive.</v>

3442
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:54.000
<v Speaker 3>So with the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing it to make people happy,</v>

3443
02:26:55.330 --> 02:27:00.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing it to make people listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even doing it to make people </v>

3444
02:27:00.330 --> 02:27:05.131
<v Speaker 3>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing it because it's things that </v>

3445
02:27:05.131 --> 02:27:08.461
<v Speaker 3>I've lived through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's things that I want to understand </v>

3446
02:27:08.461 --> 02:27:10.210
<v Speaker 3>better and I'm going to keep doing what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing.</v>

3447
02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:12.580
<v Speaker 3>And if people like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's awesome.</v>

3448
02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:13.900
<v Speaker 3>And if people don't want to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3449
02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:14.740
<v Speaker 3>that's cool too.</v>

3450
02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:17.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least from my personal experience,</v>

3451
02:27:17.021 --> 02:27:20.470
<v Speaker 4>listening to guys like Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 4>or listening to yourself or listening to</v>

3452
02:27:20.471 --> 02:27:23.380
<v Speaker 4>anybody talk about really deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>important subjects.</v>

3453
02:27:23.860 --> 02:27:26.890
<v Speaker 4>Even if you know what they're saying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be true,</v>

3454
02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:31.950
<v Speaker 4>it reinforces It in your own mind and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe even opens up new doors of </v>

3455
02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:34.390
<v Speaker 4>comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan certainly did that with me when I</v>

3456
02:27:34.391 --> 02:27:37.200
<v Speaker 4>was listening to him talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was saying some things like,</v>

3457
02:27:37.210 --> 02:27:38.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3458
02:27:38.141 --> 02:27:43.141
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like talking about dragons and dragons </v>

3459
02:27:43.141 --> 02:27:43.141
<v Speaker 4>have gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3460
02:27:43.141 --> 02:27:43.141
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jesus christ.</v>

3461
02:27:43.141 --> 02:27:44.200
<v Speaker 4>Like he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>

3462
02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:49.260
<v Speaker 4>He was hitting some notes about human </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology and the reason why we behave </v>

3463
02:27:49.871 --> 02:27:54.871
<v Speaker 4>in certain ways and the pitfalls of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these certain types of behavior that I </v>

3464
02:27:54.871 --> 02:27:58.351
<v Speaker 4>absolutely knew he was right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but and maybe I'd even thought about </v>

3465
02:27:58.351 --> 02:28:00.580
<v Speaker 4>them before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but seeing them reinforced so eloquently</v>

3466
02:28:00.730 --> 02:28:04.430
<v Speaker 4>and seeing express so articulately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really like it.</v>

3467
02:28:04.431 --> 02:28:07.900
<v Speaker 4>It sparked life in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3468
02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:11.560
<v Speaker 3>and even know he was talking about being</v>
<v Speaker 3>a warrior,</v>

3469
02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:14.410
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how these guys in modern times,</v>

3470
02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:17.380
<v Speaker 3>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't spend time being a warrior.</v>

3471
02:28:17.381 --> 02:28:20.410
<v Speaker 3>If you and I were living in 500 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

3472
02:28:20.411 --> 02:28:25.411
<v Speaker 3>you and I would both be battle scarred </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we would be used to that lifestyle.</v>

3473
02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:27.500
<v Speaker 3>People aren't used to that lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3474
02:28:27.501 --> 02:28:30.820
<v Speaker 3>They've kind of forgotten what that </v>
<v Speaker 3>feels like and so I'm.</v>

3475
02:28:31.180 --> 02:28:36.180
<v Speaker 3>That was my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was my life was to prepare </v>

3476
02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:36.320
<v Speaker 3>for war and go fight war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my whole life.</v>

3477
02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:39.170
<v Speaker 3>And so for me to look back on it noW and</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

3478
02:28:39.171 --> 02:28:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's normal.</v>

3479
02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:44.480
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's expected,</v>

3480
02:28:44.810 --> 02:28:46.820
<v Speaker 3>and it makes me say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3481
02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:51.430
<v Speaker 3>I understand now were kind of part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

3482
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:54.770
<v Speaker 3>I understand myself better when I hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>him say,</v>

3483
02:28:54.771 --> 02:28:59.771
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is this normal for guys to go out </v>

3484
02:28:59.771 --> 02:29:02.920
<v Speaker 3>and fight wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the warrior mentality and when </v>

3485
02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:02.960
<v Speaker 3>you come back and you tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

3486
02:29:03.650 --> 02:29:05.780
<v Speaker 3>people will react to that in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

3487
02:29:05.781 --> 02:29:06.800
<v Speaker 3>That's what he was saying about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

3488
02:29:06.801 --> 02:29:07.130
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3489
02:29:07.131 --> 02:29:08.630
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not some,</v>

3490
02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:13.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>academics sitting there reading a book </v>

3491
02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:13.760
<v Speaker 3>and in talking about what you're reading</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the book,</v>

3492
02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:13.760
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3493
02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:13.790
<v Speaker 3>I live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fighter.</v>

3494
02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:15.440
<v Speaker 3>I fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been through this stuff.</v>

3495
02:29:15.441 --> 02:29:20.441
<v Speaker 3>I've had physical challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people are listening to what </v>

3496
02:29:20.441 --> 02:29:20.441
<v Speaker 3>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3497
02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:25.010
<v Speaker 3>because you have that warrior mentality </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your life.</v>

3498
02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:31.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that guys like Jordan Peterson </v>

3499
02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:32.610
<v Speaker 4>and I think that anybody that can tap </v>
<v Speaker 4>into those truths that we know,</v>

3500
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:33.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3501
02:29:34.260 --> 02:29:39.260
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think we hear them enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're inundated with so much </v>

3502
02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:41.150
<v Speaker 4>stupid shit every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to get to any like,</v>

3503
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:46.090
<v Speaker 4>real substantial truths that will </v>
<v Speaker 4>positively affect your,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like tim ferriss is putting out all </v>

3506
02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:56.250
<v Speaker 4>these amazing podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson,</v>

3507
02:29:56.580 --> 02:30:01.580
<v Speaker 4>all these people that can express things</v>
<v Speaker 4>to someone like this podcast literally </v>

3508
02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:04.260
<v Speaker 4>has changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's changed my thinking.</v>

3509
02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:05.030
<v Speaker 4>It's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a d,</v>

3510
02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:10.100
<v Speaker 4>a totally different person than I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I first started this podcast </v>

3511
02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:13.140
<v Speaker 4>because talking to all these interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>and fascinating people and wise people,</v>

3512
02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:18.500
<v Speaker 4>it's been like having some crazy crash </v>
<v Speaker 4>course in a million different </v>

3513
02:30:20.311 --> 02:30:24.630
<v Speaker 4>disciplines and a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations and seeing the pitfalls of</v>

3514
02:30:24.631 --> 02:30:26.230
<v Speaker 4>some people's thinking and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3515
02:30:26.260 --> 02:30:30.030
<v Speaker 4>and being around people where you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>the holes in their,</v>

3516
02:30:30.130 --> 02:30:34.980
<v Speaker 4>the way they express themselves or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way they process information.</v>

3517
02:30:35.390 --> 02:30:40.390
<v Speaker 4>And it made me recognize the holes in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>own processing and the way I used to </v>

3518
02:30:40.390 --> 02:30:41.100
<v Speaker 4>communicate with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>

3519
02:30:41.101 --> 02:30:43.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm a better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a better conversationalist now.</v>

3520
02:30:44.130 --> 02:30:47.220
<v Speaker 4>And it all comes from just having these </v>
<v Speaker 4>intense conversations.</v>

3521
02:30:47.430 --> 02:30:52.430
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole podcast thing is something </v>

3522
02:30:52.430 --> 02:30:55.251
<v Speaker 4>that I never expected in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never expected it was going to come </v>

3523
02:30:55.251 --> 02:30:55.320
<v Speaker 4>along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it came along.</v>

3524
02:30:55.321 --> 02:31:00.321
<v Speaker 4>I never expected it would be something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I would do and I never expected it </v>

3525
02:31:00.321 --> 02:31:01.110
<v Speaker 4>would be something I consume as much as </v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

3526
02:31:01.111 --> 02:31:03.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't even have radio anymore in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking car.</v>

3527
02:31:03.530 --> 02:31:04.980
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to music.</v>

3528
02:31:05.010 --> 02:31:10.010
<v Speaker 4>If I listened to music and my music that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get off itunes or it's something that </v>

3529
02:31:10.750 --> 02:31:13.320
<v Speaker 4>someone like a new band that someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>tells me returns,</v>

3530
02:31:13.340 --> 02:31:16.080
<v Speaker 4>it turns me on too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't listen to anybody.</v>

3531
02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't listen to satellite radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't to local radio.</v>

3532
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:25.190
<v Speaker 3>I listen to podcasts constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent and there's </v>

3533
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:26.850
<v Speaker 3>something that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know even I experienced so.</v>

3534
02:31:26.851 --> 02:31:30.030
<v Speaker 3>So I what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 75 podcasts deep.</v>

3535
02:31:30.031 --> 02:31:32.640
<v Speaker 3>It's been going for a year and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>

3536
02:31:33.060 --> 02:31:38.060
<v Speaker 3>but when people come up to me now they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look me In the eyes and they shake </v>

3537
02:31:38.060 --> 02:31:42.921
<v Speaker 3>my hand and they know me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know you and I kind of know them </v>

3538
02:31:42.921 --> 02:31:47.841
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they have these shared experiences </v>

3539
02:31:47.841 --> 02:31:48.960
<v Speaker 3>with me and I talked about this on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that podcast about Rwanda.</v>

3540
02:31:49.230 --> 02:31:54.230
<v Speaker 3>They talk about the fact that the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing they do in a revolution in a coup </v>

3541
02:31:55.290 --> 02:32:00.290
<v Speaker 3>is they want to take control of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radio and there's this great piece in </v>

3542
02:32:00.290 --> 02:32:03.540
<v Speaker 3>there where he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about the fact that with</v>

3543
02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:08.190
<v Speaker 3>tv you have to take what the image on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the screen in your mind,</v>

3544
02:32:08.191 --> 02:32:13.191
<v Speaker 3>your eyes process it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it goes into your brain with </v>

3545
02:32:13.191 --> 02:32:13.191
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>

3546
02:32:13.191 --> 02:32:14.190
<v Speaker 3>You take those words and they go in </v>
<v Speaker 3>through your eyes and it processes.</v>

3547
02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:18.690
<v Speaker 3>It goes into your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with audio there's no filter.</v>

3548
02:32:18.691 --> 02:32:23.691
<v Speaker 3>The words are going directly into your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain where they're unfiltered and so </v>

3549
02:32:24.271 --> 02:32:29.271
<v Speaker 3>it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think this podcast audio </v>

3550
02:32:29.271 --> 02:32:31.560
<v Speaker 3>format is so powerful because the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are listening to this right now,</v>

3551
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:36.710
<v Speaker 3>they're sitting in the room with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're here with us and when I'm </v>

3552
02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:40.940
<v Speaker 3>recording my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually talking to them and they're</v>

3553
02:32:41.131 --> 02:32:43.200
<v Speaker 3>there and when I go out and I meet </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3554
02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:46.020
<v Speaker 3>you can absolutely feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3555
02:32:46.170 --> 02:32:48.960
<v Speaker 3>and that the little inside jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because even though my mom talking about</v>

3556
02:32:48.961 --> 02:32:52.040
<v Speaker 3>how dark and evil my podcast is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we have a good time to.</v>

3557
02:32:52.050 --> 02:32:55.210
<v Speaker 3>When we have episodes that are funny and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talk about regularly,</v>

3558
02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:58.380
<v Speaker 3>we talk about jujitsu and food and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else working out and we,</v>

3559
02:32:58.381 --> 02:33:03.381
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have fun too and all those little </v>

3560
02:33:03.381 --> 02:33:03.900
<v Speaker 3>inside jokes people will say the inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes to me that I never met this person</v>

3561
02:33:03.901 --> 02:33:08.901
<v Speaker 3>before but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he knows exactly what I'm talking </v>

3562
02:33:08.901 --> 02:33:08.901
<v Speaker 3>about and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's,</v>

3563
02:33:08.901 --> 02:33:12.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very powerful medium that I think got </v>

3564
02:33:12.890 --> 02:33:16.041
<v Speaker 3>skipped over and we went from radio just</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely absorbed into tv and then </v>

3565
02:33:17.761 --> 02:33:22.761
<v Speaker 3>absorbed into the internet and now all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden we got to this other side </v>

3566
02:33:22.761 --> 02:33:25.911
<v Speaker 3>where we're back to this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some reason why people used to </v>

3567
02:33:25.911 --> 02:33:27.960
<v Speaker 3>sit around that radio and listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>those radio shows back in the day.</v>

3568
02:33:27.960 --> 02:33:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Even I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3569
02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:32.520
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked radio shows.</v>

3570
02:33:32.810 --> 02:33:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Listen to dr demento,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dr sharma,</v>

3571
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:36.530
<v Speaker 3>dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3572
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:41.750
<v Speaker 3>I would sit there and listen to dr </v>
<v Speaker 3>demento and they'd have those little </v>

3573
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:44.271
<v Speaker 3>radio shows and those skits and that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a powerful medium and I knew it back </v>

3574
02:33:44.271 --> 02:33:45.300
<v Speaker 3>then and so for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

3575
02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:46.020
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3576
02:33:46.021 --> 02:33:51.021
<v Speaker 3>as soon as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you and tim were saying you </v>

3577
02:33:51.021 --> 02:33:51.240
<v Speaker 3>should do your own podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was absolutely,</v>

3578
02:33:51.241 --> 02:33:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

3579
02:33:53.161 --> 02:33:58.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my goal is that when people press play </v>

3580
02:33:58.161 --> 02:34:01.580
<v Speaker 3>on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want them to like be putting their </v>

3581
02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:02.220
<v Speaker 3>headphones on and like stretching their </v>
<v Speaker 3>neck a little bit,</v>

3582
02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:04.500
<v Speaker 3>pressing play and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just going,</v>

3583
02:34:04.501 --> 02:34:05.480
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3584
02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:11.120
<v Speaker 3>I want them to get absorbed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my goal was well there's also </v>

3585
02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:13.170
<v Speaker 3>nothing else like it in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can have,</v>

3586
02:34:13.171 --> 02:34:14.530
<v Speaker 3>you only have one guy you work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3587
02:34:14.531 --> 02:34:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Echo charles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3588
02:34:16.410 --> 02:34:18.160
<v Speaker 3>So it's you and him and that's</v>

3589
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:19.960
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not like a whole team.</v>

3590
02:34:19.961 --> 02:34:21.080
<v Speaker 1>If you had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3591
02:34:21.090 --> 02:34:26.090
<v Speaker 1>the audience that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you guys are a shit ton of </v>

3592
02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:26.090
<v Speaker 1>downloads now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

3593
02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:28.150
<v Speaker 1>that kind of audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are on a radio show,</v>

3594
02:34:28.151 --> 02:34:31.330
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a successful radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd be in a studio somewhere,</v>

3595
02:34:31.331 --> 02:34:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a network behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have production meetings,</v>

3596
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:36.850
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would tell you what the thought was</v>

3597
02:34:36.851 --> 02:34:41.851
<v Speaker 1>going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have people telling me what I could </v>

3598
02:34:41.851 --> 02:34:45.821
<v Speaker 1>and couldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People telling me to stop or do an </v>

3599
02:34:45.821 --> 02:34:49.260
<v Speaker 1>advertisement right now and we'll know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the beautiful thing about it </v>

3600
02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:53.851
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we're leaving money on the table </v>

3601
02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:55.810
<v Speaker 1>because right now all these advertisers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that come to us and they say,</v>

3602
02:34:55.811 --> 02:34:57.820
<v Speaker 1>hey can you talk about this and can you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about that and can you.</v>

3603
02:34:57.880 --> 02:34:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And they want to pay us money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd just like,</v>

3604
02:34:59.261 --> 02:35:00.250
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing it.</v>

3605
02:35:00.490 --> 02:35:02.260
<v Speaker 1>We have one we have on it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3606
02:35:02.350 --> 02:35:03.520
<v Speaker 1>your boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your company.</v>

3607
02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:05.470
<v Speaker 1>And you helped me in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3608
02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:08.320
<v Speaker 1>And good products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's it.</v>

3609
02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:13.440
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only advertisement we have </v>

3610
02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:15.360
<v Speaker 1>not doing anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no one that can tell me </v>

3611
02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:16.900
<v Speaker 1>what to do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful thing.</v>

3612
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:22.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot to it and also not </v>

3613
02:35:22.110 --> 02:35:22.600
<v Speaker 1>interrupting your podcast is giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not ever.</v>

3614
02:35:22.660 --> 02:35:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Never breaking up that thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keeping that thing going to the </v>

3615
02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:27.660
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say thank you very much.</v>

3616
02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:29.890
<v Speaker 1>See you guys next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

3617
02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:35.160
<v Speaker 1>and I just think that people get locked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in this is sort of like almost like a</v>

3618
02:35:35.411 --> 02:35:38.620
<v Speaker 1>trance of the way you're thinking there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in jockos mind,</v>

3619
02:35:38.621 --> 02:35:41.950
<v Speaker 1>you're talking and they're thinking how </v>
<v Speaker 1>your thinking.</v>

3620
02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:44.530
<v Speaker 1>They're like allowing themselves to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken on this journey,</v>

3621
02:35:44.531 --> 02:35:46.360
<v Speaker 1>whether they're in their car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're at the gym,</v>

3622
02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:51.480
<v Speaker 1>they're absorbed in your thoughts in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very unique way and because of the fact </v>

3623
02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:52.900
<v Speaker 1>there's not a whole lot of other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributing in it and entering into the</v>

3624
02:35:52.901 --> 02:35:53.970
<v Speaker 1>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3625
02:35:53.980 --> 02:35:58.390
<v Speaker 1>like producers and network executives </v>
<v Speaker 1>and advertising agencies and look,</v>

3626
02:35:58.391 --> 02:36:01.300
<v Speaker 1>we've looked at the stats and john go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to talk more about this.</v>

3627
02:36:01.301 --> 02:36:06.301
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could geT lost in analytics and </v>

3628
02:36:06.301 --> 02:36:07.030
<v Speaker 1>never find your true voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but podcasts,</v>

3629
02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:09.720
<v Speaker 1>it's almost entirely your true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so it,</v>

3630
02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:11.770
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say low tech,</v>

3631
02:36:11.771 --> 02:36:13.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not low tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's low.</v>

3632
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:17.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a small amount of voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3633
02:36:17.201 --> 02:36:22.201
<v Speaker 1>in terms of each individual podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just your voice and if maybe like </v>

3634
02:36:22.201 --> 02:36:23.290
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mine and the guest and whoever else</v>

3635
02:36:23.291 --> 02:36:24.730
<v Speaker 1>comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

3636
02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:29.940
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of other Intrusion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you mean singular visions </v>

3637
02:36:30.101 --> 02:36:35.101
<v Speaker 1>is what makes some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a reason why netflix </v>

3638
02:36:35.101 --> 02:36:39.211
<v Speaker 1>does so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why a lot of these hbo </v>

3639
02:36:39.211 --> 02:36:40.420
<v Speaker 1>shows dose well is because they leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people alone.</v>

3640
02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:41.380
<v Speaker 1>They just go make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3641
02:36:41.410 --> 02:36:43.150
<v Speaker 1>make us game of thrones will be back </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3642

02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:48.180
<v Speaker 1>a comedy special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3644
02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I did my last comedy special with </v>
<v Speaker 1>netflix.</v>

3645
02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:50.320
<v Speaker 1>They have fucking zero notes for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

3646
02:36:50.321 --> 02:36:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I've never done a goddamn thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't say,</v>

3647
02:36:52.601 --> 02:36:57.601
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't put that bit in and can see </v>

3648
02:36:57.601 --> 02:36:57.670
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I've ever done where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>said we love it.</v>

3649
02:36:57.860 --> 02:36:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3650
02:36:59.111 --> 02:37:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go kick ass.</v>

3651
02:37:00.490 --> 02:37:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3652
02:37:01.511 --> 02:37:03.130
<v Speaker 1>literally that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that joke.</v>

3653
02:37:03.131 --> 02:37:04.240
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

3654
02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually told that to my publisher </v>

3655
02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:09.670
<v Speaker 1>about my publisher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3656
02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:14.700
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best thing about my podcast is is </v>

3657
02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:14.700
<v Speaker 1>that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do whatever I want to do.</v>

3658
02:37:14.770 --> 02:37:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I can whatever I want to do.</v>

3659
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:19.040
<v Speaker 3>And that's what makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

3660
02:37:19.041 --> 02:37:20.960
<v Speaker 3>very liberating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no control mean you write,</v>

3661
02:37:21.070 --> 02:37:26.070
<v Speaker 3>write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know someone's going to edit that </v>

3662
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.070
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to change this and they're</v>

3663
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.690
<v Speaker 3>going to adjust that and they want the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover to look like this.</v>

3664
02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:31.310
<v Speaker 3>The podcast is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is just you and you know,</v>

3665
02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:34.940
<v Speaker 3>even the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first podcast came out and you know,</v>

3666
02:37:34.941 --> 02:37:39.941
<v Speaker 3>my wife lifts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've listened to it and she was all </v>

3667
02:37:39.941 --> 02:37:41.540
<v Speaker 3>stoked because when was the last time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you sat down and talk,</v>

3668
02:37:41.541 --> 02:37:44.000
<v Speaker 3>just talk to your wife for two and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>half hours,</v>

3669
02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:46.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen and my wife was like,</v>

3670
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:47.630
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's awesome?</v>

3671
02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Like she got to know me better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do it for 20 years.</v>

3672
02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:56.500
<v Speaker 3>She got to know me better because she </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to sit and listen to me talk for two</v>

3673
02:37:56.511 --> 02:38:01.511
<v Speaker 3>and a half hours and now she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's listening to every single one of </v>

3674
02:38:01.511 --> 02:38:01.511
<v Speaker 3>them and she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knows.</v>

3675
02:38:01.511 --> 02:38:04.920
<v Speaker 3>She actually knows me better than she </v>
<v Speaker 3>did before the podcast started because I</v>

3676
02:38:04.921 --> 02:38:08.060
<v Speaker 3>got a wife and four kids and jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have bork and travel and all that.</v>

3677
02:38:08.061 --> 02:38:13.061
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have time to sit there and talk </v>

3678
02:38:13.061 --> 02:38:13.061
<v Speaker 3>to my wife for for two and a half hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3679
02:38:13.130 --> 02:38:16.010
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just the reality of life.</v>

3680
02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3681
02:38:16.801 --> 02:38:17.850
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>

3682
02:38:17.851 --> 02:38:22.851
<v Speaker 4>when do you ever get a chance to sit </v>
<v Speaker 4>like this across from someone and talk </v>

3683
02:38:22.851 --> 02:38:26.431
<v Speaker 4>to them for three hours without checking</v>
<v Speaker 4>your phone or that anybody coming into </v>

3684
02:38:26.431 --> 02:38:29.721
<v Speaker 4>the room without anybody interrupting </v>
<v Speaker 4>you with something you have to do or </v>

3685
02:38:29.721 --> 02:38:30.270
<v Speaker 4>someplace you have to be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very odd.</v>

3686
02:38:30.420 --> 02:38:32.610
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things that I say.</v>

3687
02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:37.700
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons why I say that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed my life is because it educated </v>

3688
02:38:37.700 --> 02:38:39.930
<v Speaker 4>me on other people's thought processes </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way that you just don't.</v>

3689
02:38:39.990 --> 02:38:42.380
<v Speaker 4>You don't get one on one dialogue with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3690
02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:44.260
<v Speaker 3>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3691
02:38:44.350 --> 02:38:46.270
<v Speaker 3>as we talk about going back to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>primal things,</v>

3692
02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:51.360
<v Speaker 3>there's a primal thing about having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human conversation and if you think </v>

3693
02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:54.811
<v Speaker 3>about where technology is going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have much human conversation.</v>

3694
02:38:54.910 --> 02:38:57.730
<v Speaker 3>So you're a hundred percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only might not having two and a half</v>

3695
02:38:57.731 --> 02:39:02.731
<v Speaker 3>hour conversations with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not having two and a half hour </v>

3696
02:39:02.731 --> 02:39:05.401
<v Speaker 3>conversations with anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody until I come up here and sit </v>

3697
02:39:05.401 --> 02:39:07.410
<v Speaker 3>down with you or until I go into my </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast studio and I sit down and I have</v>

3698
02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:09.370
<v Speaker 3>it a two and a half hour conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

3699
02:39:09.580 --> 02:39:14.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million people that are going to sit </v>

3700
02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:16.561
<v Speaker 3>there and listen and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give me feedback on twitter and they're </v>

3701
02:39:16.561 --> 02:39:16.750
<v Speaker 3>going to tell me this and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell me their story.</v>

3702
02:39:16.751 --> 02:39:18.790
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

3703
02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:20.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're filling a hole.</v>

3704
02:39:20.561 --> 02:39:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a hole in communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now because you know,</v>

3705
02:39:24.310 --> 02:39:25.550
<v Speaker 3>we text each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3706
02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:26.560
<v Speaker 3>you and me text each other.</v>

3707
02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:27.910
<v Speaker 3>I text,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I text echo,</v>

3708
02:39:27.911 --> 02:39:29.070
<v Speaker 3>I texted everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>texted my wife,</v>

3709
02:39:29.130 --> 02:39:31.060
<v Speaker 3>think you and I've ever had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation on the phone.</v>

3710
02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:32.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3711
02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:36.650
<v Speaker 3>that's the word we're living in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just text.</v>

3712
02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:38.930
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

3713
02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm like legit things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3714
02:39:40.301 --> 02:39:41.320
<v Speaker 3>I gotta send you something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

3715
02:39:41.380 --> 02:39:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I just pull them out just like that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it is and it's totally </v>

3716
02:39:46.380 --> 02:39:50.191
<v Speaker 3>acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something missing and if we </v>

3717
02:39:50.191 --> 02:39:50.191
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3718
02:39:50.191 --> 02:39:50.770
<v Speaker 3>the next level is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we're going to roll.</v>

3719
02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:55.830
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the next thing is you </v>

3720
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.830
<v Speaker 3>trained together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

3721
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:57.070
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a gap and in human contact right</v>

3722
02:39:57.071 --> 02:39:58.630
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in having conversations,</v>

3723
02:39:58.631 --> 02:40:00.880
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just thinking of this right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this,</v>

3724
02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:05.900
<v Speaker 3>the whole nature of podcasting fills </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hole and if you look at the </v>

3725
02:40:05.951 --> 02:40:10.951
<v Speaker 3>podcasts that do well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's podcasts that are conversational </v>

3726
02:40:11.461 --> 02:40:13.810
<v Speaker 3>list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you go with the podcast,</v>

3727
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:14.220
<v Speaker 3>it's highly</v>

3728
02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:15.960
<v Speaker 2>produced and they got they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3729
02:40:16.010 --> 02:40:21.010
<v Speaker 2>because like radio lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those ones that are highly </v>

3730
02:40:21.010 --> 02:40:21.010
<v Speaker 2>produced and even the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced by,</v>

3731
02:40:21.010 --> 02:40:21.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>npr,</v>

3732
02:40:21.781 --> 02:40:24.410
<v Speaker 2>so they have real money behind them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

3733
02:40:24.420 --> 02:40:29.420
<v Speaker 2>They're a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for normal dudes that are just </v>

3734
02:40:29.420 --> 02:40:30.540
<v Speaker 2>sitting around and talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are popular podcasts.</v>

3735
02:40:30.541 --> 02:40:31.590
<v Speaker 2>That's why tim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sam harris,</v>

3736
02:40:31.591 --> 02:40:36.591
<v Speaker 2>those guys are sitting around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking and explaining stuff because </v>

3737
02:40:36.591 --> 02:40:37.230
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't exist anymore in the in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day to day life.</v>

3738
02:40:37.231 --> 02:40:42.231
<v Speaker 2>For a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what else doesn't exist in a </v>

3739
02:40:42.231 --> 02:40:42.930
<v Speaker 2>day to day life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place where it's okay to be a man.</v>

3740
02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:49.600
<v Speaker 2>It's actually okay to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay to have thoughts like </v>

3741
02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:51.390
<v Speaker 2>everybody is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so toned down and neutered.</v>

3742
02:40:51.870 --> 02:40:56.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like human resources and corporate </v>
<v Speaker 2>life has watered down people's natural </v>

3743
02:40:57.361 --> 02:41:00.780
<v Speaker 2>behavior to the point where people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just dying on the inside,</v>

3744
02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:03.150
<v Speaker 2>sitting in these fucking cubicles </v>
<v Speaker 2>rotting.</v>

3745
02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Just freaking the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having all these thoughts,</v>

3746
02:41:05.821 --> 02:41:08.800
<v Speaker 2>they can entertain having to pretend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be someone there.</v>

3747
02:41:08.830 --> 02:41:12.840
<v Speaker 2>They are not all day long putting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this bullshit way of talking,</v>

3748
02:41:12.841 --> 02:41:16.470
<v Speaker 2>this fake way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got to subscribe to whatever</v>

3749
02:41:16.471 --> 02:41:20.460
<v Speaker 2>fucking ridiculous policies their </v>
<v Speaker 2>company wants to enforce and you're just</v>

3750
02:41:20.461 --> 02:41:25.461
<v Speaker 2>a robot and you get out of there and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just want to scream or you want to </v>

3751
02:41:25.461 --> 02:41:25.860
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To some guys talk about some real shit.</v>

3752
02:41:25.861 --> 02:41:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3753
02:41:27.181 --> 02:41:28.440
<v Speaker 2>And then go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

3754
02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:30.960
<v Speaker 2>How come I can't talk about real shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3755
02:41:31.100 --> 02:41:34.020
<v Speaker 2>it's another reason why I wrote the kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>book because the kid's book,</v>

3756
02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:37.590
<v Speaker 2>instead of it being about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3757
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:40.470
<v Speaker 2>if someone's picking on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go and tell the teacher.</v>

3758
02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3759
02:41:41.491 --> 02:41:46.491
<v Speaker 2>actually if somebody's picking on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn to defend yourself and kick their </v>

3760
02:41:46.491 --> 02:41:47.400
<v Speaker 2>ass if needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

3761
02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:48.210
<v Speaker 2>That hasn't been said.</v>

3762
02:41:48.210 --> 02:41:49.410
<v Speaker 2>It's another reason I wrote the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3763
02:41:49.690 --> 02:41:51.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've toLd this story before,</v>

3764
02:41:51.421 --> 02:41:53.520
<v Speaker 2>but I went and got some book for my kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was little.</v>

3765
02:41:53.521 --> 02:41:54.930
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my one son and three daughters.</v>

3766
02:41:55.170 --> 02:41:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I went and got a book from ms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a pirate book.</v>

3767
02:41:57.060 --> 02:41:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking,</v>

3768
02:41:58.380 --> 02:42:03.380
<v Speaker 2>cool pirates are going to burn stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Takeover villages or steal things.</v>

3769
02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:08.960
<v Speaker 2>This will be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I read the book and it's just </v>

3770
02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:09.990
<v Speaker 2>complete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys are complete,</v>

3771
02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:12.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathetic.</v>

3772
02:42:12.201 --> 02:42:13.560
<v Speaker 2>They're pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not fake.</v>

3773
02:42:13.570 --> 02:42:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Pirate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake.</v>

3774
02:42:14.490 --> 02:42:16.260
<v Speaker 2>They're not manly pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3775
02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:20.850
<v Speaker 2>And I just was so embarrassed by some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even check check.</v>

3776
02:42:20.970 --> 02:42:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I threw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can't learn from a pirate that </v>

3777
02:42:26.191 --> 02:42:28.770
<v Speaker 2>you got to go out and crush some things </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

3778
02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Then we got to just check ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>because guess what?</v>

3779
02:42:31.590 --> 02:42:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Life is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what life is.</v>

3780
02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:36.900
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that we shield kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>from these days.</v>

3781
02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Life is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get a trophy.</v>

3782
02:42:40.530 --> 02:42:45.530
<v Speaker 2>You don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as a trophy for </v>

3783
02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:45.530
<v Speaker 2>participation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fake.</v>

3784
02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:48.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a lie doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't learn your times tables.</v>

3785
02:42:48.780 --> 02:42:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to work and study.</v>

3786
02:42:50.581 --> 02:42:53.360
<v Speaker 2>You don't get put into a special class </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get a tutor and maybe you get a,</v>

3787
02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:56.160
<v Speaker 2>you know you got some special help to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

3788
02:42:56.161 --> 02:42:57.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to work and make that happen.</v>

3789
02:42:58.050 --> 02:42:58.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

3790
02:42:58.810 --> 02:43:00.240
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to swim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>

3791
02:43:00.690 --> 02:43:02.010
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean you stay away from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

3792
02:43:02.011 --> 02:43:03.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn how to swim.</v>

3793
02:43:03.930 --> 02:43:05.760
<v Speaker 2>You step up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you man up.</v>

3794
02:43:05.790 --> 02:43:08.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's another reason why I wrote the</v>

3795
02:43:08.491 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 2>book so that people can actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids can learn that</v>

3796
02:43:12.490 --> 02:43:15.190
<v Speaker 3>life is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in order to deal with life,</v>

3797
02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:16.210
<v Speaker 3>you got to be hard.</v>

3798
02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:19.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just this idea that life is hard.</v>

3799
02:43:19.070 --> 02:43:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Something you're supposed to shield from</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

3800
02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:25.900
<v Speaker 4>It's so silly and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had this conversation with my </v>

3801
02:43:25.900 --> 02:43:28.871
<v Speaker 4>friends because everybody that I know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting how to fucked up </v>

3802
02:43:28.871 --> 02:43:28.871
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3803
02:43:28.871 --> 02:43:33.850
<v Speaker 4>but now we have kids and the last thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>we want is our kids to have a fucked up </v>

3804
02:43:33.850 --> 02:43:37.151
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we put our kids in these good </v>

3805
02:43:37.151 --> 02:43:37.151
<v Speaker 4>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live in these nice neighborhoods.</v>

3806
02:43:37.151 --> 02:43:41.290
<v Speaker 4>Everybody eats healthy and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking domestic violence and everybody </v>

3807
02:43:41.290 --> 02:43:43.520
<v Speaker 4>seems it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so different than all of our lives.</v>

3808
02:43:43.610 --> 02:43:48.610
<v Speaker 4>And we were talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and brian calendar actually talking </v>

3809
02:43:48.610 --> 02:43:48.610
<v Speaker 4>about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3810
02:43:48.610 --> 02:43:52.211
<v Speaker 4>we all have fucked up childhoods and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody we know had fucked up </v>

3811
02:43:52.211 --> 02:43:53.960
<v Speaker 4>childhoods and they're all interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want my kids to be boring,</v>

3812
02:43:53.961 --> 02:43:56.720
<v Speaker 4>but I also want them to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

3813
02:43:56.780 --> 02:43:58.370
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you approach that?</v>

3814
02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:03.640
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd get involved is what I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>chosen to do is get my kids involved in </v>

3815
02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:03.640
<v Speaker 4>martial arts and and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3816
02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:08.410
<v Speaker 4>and give them the opportunity to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult things and understanding that </v>

3817
02:44:08.410 --> 02:44:11.400
<v Speaker 4>through pursuing these difficult things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like in accomplishing stuff like you,</v>

3818
02:44:11.401 --> 02:44:16.401
<v Speaker 4>you learned something about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You learn that you have this ability </v>

3819
02:44:16.401 --> 02:44:16.401
<v Speaker 4>inside of you to overcome.</v>

3820
02:44:16.401 --> 02:44:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I've got this statement that I made on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my podcast about kids and I said,</v>

3821
02:44:19.311 --> 02:44:24.311
<v Speaker 3>if you're helping your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hurting them and if you think </v>

3822
02:44:24.891 --> 02:44:25.620
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3823
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:28.340
<v Speaker 3>and the example I gave is like tying </v>
<v Speaker 3>your kids' shoe.</v>

3824
02:44:28.580 --> 02:44:31.100
<v Speaker 3>If you tie your kids' shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3825
02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:36.220
<v Speaker 3>you're actually taking away the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity in their life to develop </v>

3826
02:44:36.220 --> 02:44:40.871
<v Speaker 3>their fine motor skills of tying a shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're actually taking that away from </v>

3827
02:44:40.871 --> 02:44:40.970
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same with everything.</v>

3828
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:43.160
<v Speaker 3>Make your own sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make your own bed,</v>

3829
02:44:43.161 --> 02:44:48.161
<v Speaker 3>clean your own room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to do this stuff for yourself </v>

3830
02:44:48.161 --> 02:44:48.161
<v Speaker 3>and when I'm helping you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hurting you.</v>

3831
02:44:48.161 --> 02:44:51.350
<v Speaker 3>So I think we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we can protect them without just</v>

3832
02:44:51.351 --> 02:44:56.351
<v Speaker 3>completely coddling them and then making</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that every issue that ever could </v>

3833
02:44:56.511 --> 02:45:01.511
<v Speaker 3>present itself to them has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminated because you're gonna end up </v>

3834
02:45:01.511 --> 02:45:01.511
<v Speaker 3>with some kids.</v>

3835
02:45:01.511 --> 02:45:05.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if those kids have to compete with </v>

3836
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:05.630
<v Speaker 4>some kid has had to take care of himself</v>
<v Speaker 4>their whole life,</v>

3837
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:06.220
<v Speaker 4>that kid's gonna be ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yup.</v>

3838
02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:11.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have a feral kid </v>

3839
02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:12.090
<v Speaker 4>competing against.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3841
02:45:12.871 --> 02:45:17.871
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why some of those competItive </v>

3842
02:45:17.871 --> 02:45:17.871
<v Speaker 3>sports are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are so important.</v>

3843
02:45:17.871 --> 02:45:18.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's an martial arts are great,</v>

3844
02:45:18.251 --> 02:45:19.890
<v Speaker 3>wrestling is great jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3845
02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:20.800
<v Speaker 3>football,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball,</v>

3846
02:45:20.801 --> 02:45:24.770
<v Speaker 3>anything thing that puts you in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenging positions where you're going</v>

3847
02:45:24.771 --> 02:45:26.830
<v Speaker 3>to have to step up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get ground out.</v>

3848
02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:29.080
<v Speaker 3>And like my one of my daughters </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestles.</v>

3849
02:45:29.350 --> 02:45:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she is,</v>

3850
02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:37.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the same one that got stage </v>

3851
02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:37.900
<v Speaker 3>fright and to see her step up and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3852
02:45:37.901 --> 02:45:39.010
<v Speaker 3>we live a pretty good life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3853
02:45:39.011 --> 02:45:40.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live in southern California,</v>

3854
02:45:41.050 --> 02:45:42.830
<v Speaker 3>we live in a nice house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3855
02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:44.200
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a nice living.</v>

3856
02:45:44.201 --> 02:45:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very comfortable situation.</v>

3857
02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Some of the hardest times that she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been put through is on the wrestling mat</v>

3858
02:45:50.170 --> 02:45:55.170
<v Speaker 3>and having to step up against some girl </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like the exact girl you're talking </v>

3859
02:45:55.170 --> 02:45:57.070
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some girl from the barrio in san diego,</v>

3860
02:45:57.190 --> 02:46:02.190
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough ass girl that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the ringer and has domestic </v>

3861
02:46:02.190 --> 02:46:06.991
<v Speaker 3>violence going on at her house and her </v>
<v Speaker 3>one escape from all that is to come out </v>

3862
02:46:06.991 --> 02:46:07.510
<v Speaker 3>and wrestle against some other girl and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat her down.</v>

3863
02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 3>So my daughter has to step up and</v>

3864
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.490
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

3865
02:46:11.570 --> 02:46:12.690
<v Speaker 2>it's an incredible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3866
02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:14.990
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly powerful and empowering.</v>

3867
02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Even I watched her change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3868
02:46:17.110 --> 02:46:22.110
<v Speaker 2>and when she would be intimidated by in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those situations to where now she's </v>

3869
02:46:22.110 --> 02:46:22.110
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it,</v>

3870
02:46:22.110 --> 02:46:22.910
<v Speaker 2>bring it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got something for you.</v>

3871
02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:27.790
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3872
02:46:27.890 --> 02:46:32.890
<v Speaker 2>we were almost three hours in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anything else that you've got a </v>

3873
02:46:32.890 --> 02:46:32.890
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3874
02:46:32.890 --> 02:46:34.190
<v Speaker 2>you're the only guys ever showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with this many notes.</v>

3875
02:46:34.250 --> 02:46:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3876
02:46:34.730 --> 02:46:37.310
<v Speaker 2>so what I want to do is now if we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend the next four hours going through,</v>

3877
02:46:37.860 --> 02:46:38.860
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hit it,</v>

3878
02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:40.940
<v Speaker 2>we hit all kinds of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3879
02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I was driving up here taking notes on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Jordan Peterson podcast.</v>

3880
02:46:45.741 --> 02:46:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that everyone should listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great,</v>

3881
02:46:47.180 --> 02:46:52.180
<v Speaker 2>great podcast to listen to and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many points that he covers in there </v>

3882
02:46:52.180 --> 02:46:54.350
<v Speaker 2>that are really profound and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>important important today,</v>

3883
02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:59.410
<v Speaker 2>but he's dealing with a very unusual </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where those coddled soft kids </v>

3884
02:46:59.410 --> 02:47:04.300
<v Speaker 2>are now in universities and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to run the show with these </v>

3885
02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:06.980
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous programs of inclusion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity and you know,</v>

3886
02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:09.470
<v Speaker 2>forcing their mindset down everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else's throat.</v>

3887
02:47:09.470 --> 02:47:13.550
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fascinating and disturbing to see</v>

3888
02:47:13.551 --> 02:47:15.920
<v Speaker 2>all that happening and it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3889
02:47:15.921 --> 02:47:16.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3890
02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:21.240
<v Speaker 2>it's actually disturbing to see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening and see kids could be focused </v>

3891
02:47:21.381 --> 02:47:26.381
<v Speaker 2>on such important things in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they ended up focusing on something </v>

3892
02:47:26.381 --> 02:47:29.810
<v Speaker 2>that is borderline in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>borderline,</v>

3893
02:47:29.950 --> 02:47:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningless.</v>

3894
02:47:31.490 --> 02:47:32.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>launch,</v>

3895
02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:34.550
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's move towards a real goal.</v>

3896
02:47:34.610 --> 02:47:39.260
<v Speaker 2>There's diseases to cure and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good things to do in the world.</v>

3897
02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3898
02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody agrees that racism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad and homophobia is bad,</v>

3899
02:47:44.511 --> 02:47:49.511
<v Speaker 2>but that's not exactly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with here we're dealing with is </v>

3900
02:47:49.511 --> 02:47:52.061
<v Speaker 2>people trying to control the way other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people behave and talk and think and it </v>

3901
02:47:52.061 --> 02:47:56.440
<v Speaker 2>might not even be in response to any </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual real like negative things that </v>

3902
02:47:59.181 --> 02:48:00.890
<v Speaker 2>have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're trying.</v>

3903
02:48:00.891 --> 02:48:04.400
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to create negative things</v>
<v Speaker 2>to battle that might not even be there.</v>

3904
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:09.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just a lot of weirdness today in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this world and I think that to bring it </v>

3905
02:48:09.790 --> 02:48:14.261
<v Speaker 2>back full circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this weirdness comes from a </v>

3906
02:48:14.261 --> 02:48:14.261
<v Speaker 2>lack of true struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3907
02:48:14.261 --> 02:48:15.650
<v Speaker 2>do you think That these kids that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up in Russia,</v>

3908
02:48:15.651 --> 02:48:17.840
<v Speaker 2>they're doing back flips off of the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>of buildings?</v>

3909
02:48:18.410 --> 02:48:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Are they dealing with the same like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3910
02:48:21.340 --> 02:48:24.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity lectures and classes that they</v>

3911
02:48:24.171 --> 02:48:25.370
<v Speaker 2>have to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an,</v>

3912
02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:30.520
<v Speaker 2>there's an intrinsic part of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings that wants to be part of a tribe </v>

3913
02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:31.400
<v Speaker 2>of some kind and wants to defend their </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe.</v>

3914
02:48:31.610 --> 02:48:34.350
<v Speaker 2>And when you grow up in a place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no real try,</v>

3915
02:48:34.351 --> 02:48:37.160
<v Speaker 2>but then you look for one to latch onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>and these people over here,</v>

3916
02:48:37.161 --> 02:48:42.161
<v Speaker 2>they have a cause and they've got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe and you can be part of that tribe </v>

3917
02:48:42.161 --> 02:48:45.191
<v Speaker 2>and you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can lash out at the bad </v>

3918
02:48:45.191 --> 02:48:45.320
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that happens a lot.</v>

3919
02:48:45.321 --> 02:48:50.321
<v Speaker 2>And I Think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unfortunately unfortunate because </v>

3920
02:48:50.321 --> 02:48:50.340
<v Speaker 2>it really crushes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3921
02:48:50.390 --> 02:48:52.370
<v Speaker 2>individuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I,</v>

3922
02:48:52.371 --> 02:48:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my kind of my premier base,</v>

3923
02:48:54.820 --> 02:48:59.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faults are around individual freedom to </v>

3924
02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:00.920
<v Speaker 2>be an individual thing for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your mind.</v>

3925
02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of comfort in those groups</v>

3926
02:49:03.651 --> 02:49:05.840
<v Speaker 2>that these people belong to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's,</v>

3927
02:49:05.841 --> 02:49:06.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of group,</v>

3928
02:49:06.801 --> 02:49:08.190
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a hardcore right wing</v>

3929
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:10.920
<v Speaker 1>group or a hardcore left ring group you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in,</v>

3930
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you kind of know what the rules are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you play by those rules.</v>

3931
02:49:14.341 --> 02:49:19.341
<v Speaker 1>And then you surround yourself with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of likeminded people and an echo </v>

3932
02:49:19.341 --> 02:49:21.900
<v Speaker 1>chamber who also support the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these rules are the rules and we have to</v>

3933
02:49:21.901 --> 02:49:23.010
<v Speaker 1>get these out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

3934
02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:28.440
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we just need to establish </v>

3935
02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:28.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of shit you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

3936
02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't steal from people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't rape anybody,</v>

3937
02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:29.100
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3938
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:34.110
<v Speaker 1>don't shoot anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like figure out a way we can </v>

3939
02:49:34.110 --> 02:49:34.980
<v Speaker 1>harmoniously get along together without </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking with each other,</v>

3940
02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then just let everybody be whatever </v>

3941
02:49:40.220 --> 02:49:40.220
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're gay,</v>

3942
02:49:40.220 --> 02:49:41.130
<v Speaker 1>you're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like listening to classical music</v>

3943
02:49:41.131 --> 02:49:43.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and running naked through the streets,</v>

3944
02:49:43.290 --> 02:49:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still fuck me,</v>

3945
02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:46.050
<v Speaker 1>just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3946
02:49:46.051 --> 02:49:47.940
<v Speaker 1>don't cause trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you know.</v>

3947
02:49:48.060 --> 02:49:48.830
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>

3948
02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:51.010
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about individual freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be yourself,</v>

3949
02:49:51.070 --> 02:49:52.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's,</v>

3950
02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:54.900
<v Speaker 1>which is what I like individual freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what you want to do.</v>

3951
02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Hard for insecure people to allow that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

3952
02:49:57.961 --> 02:50:02.961
<v Speaker 1>Because in insecure people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they see individual freedom that's </v>

3953
02:50:02.961 --> 02:50:05.180
<v Speaker 1>contrary to what their own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors,</v>

3954
02:50:05.190 --> 02:50:08.650
<v Speaker 1>like they have to question themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and challenge themselves.</v>

3955
02:50:08.651 --> 02:50:12.390
<v Speaker 1>So they decided that that person's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these people are wrong and I'm right</v>

3956
02:50:12.391 --> 02:50:17.391
<v Speaker 1>and this and this needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>established and we need to fight and we </v>

3957
02:50:17.391 --> 02:50:20.121
<v Speaker 1>need to go out and punch nazis or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they think they're </v>

3958
02:50:20.121 --> 02:50:21.360
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just gets real weird man.</v>

3959
02:50:21.930 --> 02:50:26.580
<v Speaker 1>It's weird than when that becomes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life and I'm sure you get this.</v>

3960
02:50:26.581 --> 02:50:31.581
<v Speaker 1>I get it a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is people on social media that </v>

3961
02:50:31.581 --> 02:50:33.870
<v Speaker 1>want me to weigh in on this thing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want me to weigh in on this side or</v>

3962
02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:36.510
<v Speaker 1>they're attacking me because of this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attacking me because of that.</v>

3963
02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Not so much attacking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people want me to weigh in on things</v>

3964
02:50:39.690 --> 02:50:41.730
<v Speaker 1>all the time and it's things that I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3965
02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:45.540
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't affecting me.</v>

3966
02:50:45.970 --> 02:50:47.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>

3967
02:50:47.371 --> 02:50:49.740
<v Speaker 1>my comments aren't goIng to move this </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

3968
02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And finally I don't care about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3969
02:50:53.550 --> 02:50:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I understand that you're obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3970
02:50:56.340 --> 02:50:58.080
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3971
02:50:58.350 --> 02:51:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not obsessed with this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're obsessed with,</v>

3972
02:51:01.350 --> 02:51:03.060
<v Speaker 1>so I don't even care that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with it.</v>

3973
02:51:03.061 --> 02:51:04.550
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when people asked me,</v>

3974
02:51:04.850 --> 02:51:05.490
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds good,</v>

3975
02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:07.180
<v Speaker 1>sounds good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go keep,</v>

3976
02:51:07.220 --> 02:51:08.700
<v Speaker 1>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep doing what you're doing.</v>

3977
02:51:08.701 --> 02:51:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not not my thing.</v>

3978
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get obsessed with things that </v>

3979
02:51:15.950 --> 02:51:15.950
<v Speaker 1>they won't even be obsessed with a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>

3980
02:51:15.950 --> 02:51:15.950
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>are obsessed with.</v>

3982
02:51:18.151 --> 02:51:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3983
02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:24.140

<v Speaker 1>Do them and get better at them.</v>

3989
02:51:32.310 --> 02:51:35.430
<v Speaker 1>It seems so simplistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a ridiculous,</v>

3990
02:51:35.431 --> 02:51:37.890
<v Speaker 1>idealistic point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's effective.</v>
