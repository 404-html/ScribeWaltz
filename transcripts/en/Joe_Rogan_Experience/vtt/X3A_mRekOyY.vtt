<v Speaker 1>Finding me at my best.</v>

32
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>My best friend was the fact that I had a chance to work with Mike.</v>

33
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I knew Mike Tyson before he was the champ.</v>

34
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.661
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

35
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:44.661
<v Speaker 1>So I seen that the whole journey from the guy who was a regular dude that was</v>

36
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>scared and he owed all these people were around him and tell him you could do</v>

37
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

38
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>And he did it and he became as bigger than life person all the way to the,</v>

39
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.363
<v Speaker 1>to the end.</v>

40
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Now the person that he is now,</v>

41
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>because if you see Mike now,</v>

42
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Mike got his shit together.</v>

43
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

44
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.713

00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.291
<v Speaker 1>He's not out of control.</v>

49
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>He's a married Dewey,</v>

50
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.391

00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>he's polite to people.</v>

52
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't get in trouble no more laughing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

147
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.471
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

148
00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

149
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.890
<v Speaker 1>building the years like the Bruce Seldon years where Bruce Seldon,</v>

150
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.660
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even like he missed him with a left talking cell.</v>

151
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Does knees buckle?</v>

152
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>He got up and just said,</v>

153
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing getting up?</v>

154
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.981

156
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.550

157
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>There's no fighter out there right now.</v>

158
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that has captured the attention since since him not like him,</v>

159
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>not like him since him.</v>

160
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.490
