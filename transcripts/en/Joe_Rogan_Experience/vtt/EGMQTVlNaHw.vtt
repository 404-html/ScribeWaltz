00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.980
Oh Shit.
You dirty bitches.

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.180
What know now.
Oh,
okay.

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Fucked up my flub.
Right.
I had a false start out of the gate,

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.420
but like you saying bolt,
I will recover my shitty start.

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.080
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.730
o,
n n,
I t,
makers of Alpha brain,
shroom,
tech,

7
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:33.840
sport,
shroom,
tech commune,
new mood,
strong bone,

8
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:36.720
all of these different things.
Well,
the big one is Alpha brain.

9
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.160
That's my favorite.
That's the one I rely on.
And uh,
I use all of them,

10
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:45.600
but to me,
Alpha brains,
my baby,
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't give that shit up.

11
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.620
That's stuff's amazing.
I've gotten Lorenzo Fertitta completely hooked on it.

12
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.390
I've got a lot of people hooked on it.
It's,
uh,
it's very effective.
What it,

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.030
what is it?
Their vitamins that enhance brain function is a bullshit.
No,

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.190
this is may,
it maybe it's a placebo.

15
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.230
I don't think my crew from a triple up,

16
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.540
we were in Scotland and I was having a rough morning and I was like,
fuck it.

17
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.830
I'm Alpha Brandon today.
And the,
and literally they said no more Alpha brain.

18
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.850
I said,
why?
And they go,
you will not shut the fuck up the whole van.

19
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:18.870
I was just playing these games like I was like fucking,
I was funny a shit,

20
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.020
but it was like,
they were like,
you're fucking exhausting us.
I was,

21
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.660
my wife outlawed Alpha brain when I'm hanging out with my daughters because I

22
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:26.370
don't know.
I don't believe my daughters,
I just think of jokes.

23
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.880
I'm just fucking firing while I love the shit.
That's weird.

24
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:30.750
That sounds like your high,

25
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:32.800
like your wife was telling you not to get higher on your kid

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.420
does not do that to me.
Are you dipping your Alpha brain and cocaine?
No.
No,
no.

27
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.060
But if you take some information and some coffee,
you're fucking creative.
End.

28
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.720
This is the new thing I heard.
If you put a little bit of nicotine nicotine,

29
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.440
nicotine gum is this shit emulates creativity.
Nicotine.

30
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.770
We had rob both on the podcast who,
uh,

31
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.530
talked about that about nicotine gum being really good for creativity.

32
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.393
Makes Sense.

33
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.420
Apparently what's really bad about cigarettes is the 590 different things that

34
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.180
they added to make them more addictive.
Which you know,

35
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.840
you want to know that you've been sold down a fucking river by politicians.

36
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.990
How about the fact that you're fucking cigarettes have 590 ingredients and all

37
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:17.970
those bitches do is make it easier to hook you what his cigarette companies like

38
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.990
added 20,000 good ingredients to it on top of the 500 bad one cause then it will

39
00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:25.320
be more good than bad.
At the end of the day man,

40
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:29.250
you're still burning things and taking that burning chemicals in your mouth and

41
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:32.660
that can cause cancer.
It just can,
you know,
even the,

42
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.720
the the best case example of burning chemicals and then breathing it in.

43
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.460
I don't see how that's going to help you.

44
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.250
The tobacco itself is not nearly as bad.

45
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:44.190
They're just a burning plant matter is not nearly as bad.

46
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.910
But if they put a little bit of asparagus or aloe into that smoke though,

47
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.900
you know,
so I think I'm saying for like you're a for quitting,
you know,
and,

48
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:55.640
and for I think tobacco supposed to be like if you like one of those Americans

49
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:59.830
cigarettes,
one of those things called those are supposed to be to kick.

50
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.020
They're also harder to smoke them worse for you.

51
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:04.660
And when they go out they go and everyone complains that they go out,

52
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.290
they just told stop burning and they start burning set on him.
All the shit,

53
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.050
all the loyal,
the little gasoline in there to keep it running.

54
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.000
They actually actually cigarettes now have these things built into the paper,

55
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.600
at least in California because by law they have to have these stoppers.

56
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.760
So when people flick cigarettes out the window,

57
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.270
it used to be they'll just burn all the way to the filter where now they have

58
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:28.390
like these things that's built into the paper and it stops it from smoking,

59
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.620
which probably gives you even more.
Yeah,
let's start adding to that.

60
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.160
That is the best thing I ever did as quit smoking and quit dipping.

61
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.690
I was addicted to dipping.
Worse than anything.
That's like a grab bag of money.

62
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:43.030
That's all it is.
You know you shouldn't be selling that shit.

63
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.540
You know you shouldn't be hooking people on that.
Get out of that business.

64
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:48.100
That's a creepy God damn business.

65
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.720
But what if your company was Philip Morris Tobacco and then you're driving a

66
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:56.140
fucking Ferrari and flying around in a private jet because you're poisoning all

67
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.890
these fucks.
So you have to keep like grease and politicians.

68
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:04.000
And that's why you never hear any of these guys.
You never hear Obama.

69
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:08.710
You never hear Bush.
You never hear anybody talk about getting rid of cigarettes.

70
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:11.590
They never do.
They talk about homosexuality,

71
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.780
they talk about everything but fucking,
they talk about Trayvon Martin,

72
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.030
but they don't talk about fucking cigarettes.

73
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.870
Cigarettes kill for this is a conservative estimate.

74
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.340
It could be more 400,000 people a year

75
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.110
and it might be adding a special effect to accidentally smoking a cigarette on

76
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:37.700
his way over here,
right after a strep throat.

77
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.240
You'd have to wrap your fucking head around that.
Man.

78
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.070
That's a lot of God damn people.

79
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.450
That's a half a million people like a picture of stack of bodies and there were

80
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:50.680
all rotting all because of cigarettes.
That is really crazy.

81
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.210
That is fucking fucking astounding.
Any other product,

82
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.900
if they told him that had that number,
they'd be like fucking magic happen tail.

83
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.660
Did that take out the Kale farmers?

84
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.940
Cale was killing 400,000 people a year.
Get your fucking imagine,

85
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:09.850
but people like would I like it though.
It helps me lose stay thin.

86
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.650
I should so much better with Kale.

87
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.860
I love what I see Green Shit on the toilet paper.
Kale,

88
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.410
Kale is Kale killed one person.

89
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.590
They would shut down the fucking Kael factories but cigarettes and just steady

90
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.950
kills.
Killed and more than one person.
What the fuck are you talking about?

91
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.780
Fucking salad always gets that disease on it or

92
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.110
not.

93
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.110
How they've killed people were seeing medical diagnosis and has some Ohio

94
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.250
disease.
Your conversation was running with snow shoes on for me.
Mud.

95
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.600
That was what?
That Salmonella ski goggles on.

96
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.310
Two baseball gloves.
Yeah,
that is true that a lot of people have gotten sick.

97
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.610
They've,
I think it's Ecolab,

98
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.690
Ecolab all bye from eating spinach especially.

99
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.930
And apparently it's because the way some farms are set up,

100
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.410
the shit from the cows actually runs down.

101
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:11.411
Like the water from that shit will get onto the crops and that can have ecolab

102
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.321
because,

103
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:14.930
and one of the reasons why I can have you cold eyes cause they're giving these

104
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:19.310
cows things are not supposed to be eating to make them fatter like grains.

105
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.820
It's the cattle were supposed to eat grass.
That's where the,

106
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.800
that's where their natural food is.
So when you don't give them grass,

107
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.430
they apparently can get really sick with the cola and then that shit gets onto

108
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:31.410
the spinach.
Yeah.
So it all goes back to like farming like an ass.

109
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.340
I think people have died from that.
I think hale has killed,

110
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:38.160
I don't know if more people have choked on scale.
It's spinach,
spinach,

111
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.060
spinach is kill people.
And the,

112
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.720
and the funny thing is I did a morning show thing with the,

113
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.190
in wherever I was in Omaha and I,

114
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.660
and they had a farmer that was talking about his grass fed steak.

115
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.220
You gotta try,
I do grass fed and so he gets it done the thing and I go,

116
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.370
so it wasn't like does grasp it tastes better and you've no,
not at all.

117
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.480
Like what?
He goes,
it actually has less flavor.
I go,
then what's the thing?

118
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:06.140
He goes,
oh,
that's just what I do.
No fucking,
there's no better.

119
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.070
The reason it's grasp fed,
it's like fucking nothing.
Well that's a weird,
uh,

120
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.150
for him it's a weird thing to say because I prefer the taste of grass fed.

121
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.070
It's more Gamey.
It's more gaming.
The ones that are corn,
Fred,

122
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.960
you know,
the,
they're just fat as fuck.
And also those are real,
oh my God.
Fuck.

123
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.110
Thumb up steak,
rib eyes,
fat Ribeye.
Yeah,
the preparations.
Disgusting.

124
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:29.630
You're fucking up these animals,
but Goddamn,
you make a good steak.

125
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.640
Let's get out of this commercial.
Do,
yeah.
Yeah.
Commercial.

126
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.641
But the bottom line is people planning that our commercials or have been boring.

127
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.490
Yeah,
because we're,
we're missing,
we're missing the sexiness.

128
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:47.960
We need another sexy thing.
Well,
maybe something,
something I could fuck.

129
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.970
You feel like we're missing something?
Not having the flashlight as a spark.
Oh,

130
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.730
absolutely.
Absolutely.
I think it's crazy.

131
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.070
I don't feel comfortable with it at all.

132
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.010
I miss talking about fucking gross sex toy.
Need to grow,
son.

133
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.520
Get out of that.
It's enough.
We can only,

134
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.610
I mean we did 200 plus podcasts when we talked about rubber boots.

135
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.050
That's beautiful.
How hard it is to do that.

136
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.150
How much would it cost for a sponsorship?
Like give me a ballpark.
We,

137
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.280
I talking about this in the air.

138
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.280
I want to talk about it because maybe I'll just have travel channel sponsored

139
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:21.650
the shells.
You have olive garden kind of money.
Yeah,
no,

140
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.700
I'll get travel channel [inaudible] seven more times on it.com that's,

141
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.660
Oh and,
and it,
uh,
what is Alpha brain?
Listen,

142
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:36.230
if you go to [inaudible] dot com everything will be explained.

143
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:38.810
It is a very comprehensive website,

144
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.390
including all the science behind Alpha brain.

145
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:44.150
What the different stole the ingredients.
Nutrients.

146
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.640
That stuff's great.

147
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:50.240
Is there anything have Melatonin in like any of the Onnit products have like a

148
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:53.270
sleeping aid,
like Melatonin at night you should do that.
The autonomy is awesome.

149
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.380
They should do like new mood bonus,

150
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:58.760
turbo style or something for sleep or like super needed.

151
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.250
New Mood would be almost the opposite because it's a boosting like an

152
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:06.660
enlightening.
Yeah,
but it relaxes you also does it?
Well,
I think for some folks,

153
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.110
some people have a little bit more tension so it's probably like alleviates a

154
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.300
little bit of that.
They should call it just something cool.

155
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.490
Like it's amazing though that they figured out someone can do that.

156
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.610
Pass the fuck out past the fucking chill,
chill,
chill.

157
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.230
They made a Melatonin.

158
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.740
Don't be such a Douche and it's spell it like da wd idea for sure.

159
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.080
I emailed on it this weekend on Twitter and asked him to come up with something

160
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:34.620
for alcohol to like make the turnaround better or

161
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.200
do you not gonna do anything?
You're poisoning yourself.
Talk.
Well,

162
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:44.550
what you can help,
two things can help one water to nootropics,

163
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:48.180
three battle ropes.
If you take like a bunch of new mood,

164
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.740
a bunch of Alpha brain after you,

165
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:52.890
if you're hung over and drink you to to drink a fuck load of water,

166
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.070
and you should almost always take nutrients with food.
The your,

167
00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:58.170
your body absorbs them better if they're connected.

168
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.810
<v 1>Did the fats and carbohydrates.
So you should always take pills with,</v>

169
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.700
with food.
But as far as I'm,
I think you're,

170
00:10:07.701 --> 00:10:09.170
the real problem is dehydration.

171
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.880
You're poisoning yourself and your alcohol is an Amino suppressant.

172
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.920
It's a diuretic.
It's like you're,

173
00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:18.860
you're really like sending your body through some shit.

174
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.170
<v 0>It's the only way to recover from that.
It's time,
water,
food,
good food.</v>

175
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.460
Give it a chance to go,
oh,
if I get a little bit of sleep the night before,

176
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.830
I feel like if I stopped drinking and then do some shit and then go to bed,

177
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.650
I feel fucking so much better.
But have,

178
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.910
when I wake up and I have that beer on the bed,

179
00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:40.060
stand next to me just staring at me like a gay lover.
Like,
wow,

180
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.710
we had a weird fucking night last night.
Anyway.

181
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.740
Dot Com.
O.
N,
n.
I.
T if you,
if you would have the first 30 pills,

182
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.510
<v 1>um,
and you,
uh,</v>

183
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.380
you have an opportunity to try it out and if you don't like it,

184
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.150
you get a hundred percent money back guarantee.

185
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.990
The idea is that what we're selling you is really good.
It's,

186
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.520
it's really effective.
And I don't want anybody to ever feel ripped off.

187
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.800
It's more important for me that people feel like this is an even deal than it is

188
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:12.521
to make money.

189
00:11:12.521 --> 00:11:15.940
So we have a hundred percent money back guarantee on the first 30 pills.

190
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.820
If you don't like it to say it,
it's it.
You don't have to return it.

191
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.890
I'm telling you,
it's some fascinating shit.
I love it.
It,
it,
it helps me.

192
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:29.320
But also diet helps me,
you know,
vitamins,
multivitamins,
fish,
oil,
everything you,

193
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.530
you need to take care of your health bitches get on that shit.

194
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.350
But if you're interested in any of the nootropics that are available in Alpha

195
00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:38.980
brain music,
codenamed Rogan,
and you'll save yourself 10% often,
as I said,

196
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.470
a hundred percent money back guarantee on the first 30 pills.

197
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.110
We also have just in kettle bells and battle ropes,
and these are the,

198
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:47.890
the newest addition to the Onnit store.

199
00:11:47.891 --> 00:11:50.350
And if you've never done kettlebell workouts before,

200
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.070
that's some manly man type shit.
It's a cannon ball with

201
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.700
<v 0>a handle on it.
And there's a lot of videos online.
It'll show you how to,</v>

202
00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:58.090
you know,

203
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.240
you can just go to youtube and if you want to learn how to do some of the

204
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:03.760
exercises,
but my advice to you,
if you're going to try it,

205
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.700
start with a lightweight,
it'd be fucking amazed.

206
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:09.730
You can get a great workout with a 35 pound kettle bell

207
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.530
or something like that.
You could not me son,
that's where I draw the line.

208
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.490
35 you save 35 pounds on.
I heard that and I was like,
well,

209
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:22.840
I'll get my 35 pound kettle bell and do those swings and I'm not,

210
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:25.430
I'm a 25 pounder.
Why it's,
yeah,

211
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.680
but my best ridiculous wrong with you.
I had a broken hip.

212
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.050
Ron came over to my house to show me how to do them.
It was doing them.
Fuck.

213
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.310
I was doing them all.
So you did,
you hurt yourself.
Fuck my backup.
Yeah,

214
00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:40.090
you've got to,
my advice is always start light and learn from an instructor.

215
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:41.080
If you can.
If you,

216
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:44.830
if you can afford to go to a gym and hire a guy for 20 bucks an hour or
whatever,

217
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:46.570
they charge more than that.
Right?

218
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:49.650
50 bucks an hour or you can just go to a John Heffrons show.
John half.

219
00:12:49.651 --> 00:12:52.900
I'll show you how to fuck.
He's a certified instructor.
Yeah.
He's a maniac.

220
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.600
Ephron's a maniac.
He's always doing something crazy like that.

221
00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:00.610
Going all Anthony Robbins on you.
He's always trying to succeed anyway.

222
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.950
Uh,
if you're interested in Kettlebells,
it's my opinion.
The the,

223
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.470
if I had to choose one method of strength and conditioning,

224
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.170
I would choose bodyweight exercises and kettlebells.

225
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:13.660
Things like body weight squats,

226
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.660
Hindu squats.
Look that shit up online there.
They're fucking ferocious.

227
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.440
I do 200 of them in a row.
It's so hard.

228
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.660
It's so hard when you get towards the end,
when you get close to 200,

229
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.150
there's a guy named Karl gotch was just fucking crazy.

230
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:33.670
Wrestler dude was awesome old catch wrestler.

231
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.180
He used to make his students to 500 of them before practice,

232
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.990
before practice 500 bodyweight squats before practice.

233
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:46.210
That's just try doing fucking just try to in 50 in your fucking hotel room,

234
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.720
literally unbelievably hard.

235
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.510
The idea behind kettle bells is that it makes your body work as one unit.
And uh,

236
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:58.900
I believe that,
you know,
with body weight squats and Chin ups and kettle bells,

237
00:13:58.901 --> 00:14:01.630
you can,
you can get in fucking phenomenal shape.

238
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.970
You don't really even need a gym.
You need to,
you know,

239
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.980
just fall some videos that you can get online.

240
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:09.580
Steve Maxwell's got some great videos.
We're going to eventually put out a video.

241
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.390
Um,
so show you guys what I do,
but it's,
you put out a video,

242
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.790
it's a great,
I used to be like,

243
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.120
like don't do it this way and instead of me doing it and I completely wrong and

244
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.120
just fall down poop everywhere.

245
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.950
There's a video of me doing kettle bells on travel channel.com and I fucking,

246
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.970
I was doing them and I thought it was doing murdering them.
Right.

247
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.650
And I fucking watch a video and I'm barely doing anything.

248
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.310
It looked like fucking,
I looked like a kid's mess around with my weights.

249
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.920
What kind of exercise where you was doing the fucking swinging on the swings?

250
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.353
I tried to do,

251
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.310
I read some article where a guy said he was going to do a thousand.
Yeah.

252
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.460
Well yeah,

253
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.570
they had this thing where they were going to do them in sets of a hundred over

254
00:14:49.571 --> 00:14:54.290
like a really short amount of time.
Yeah,
yeah.
I heard that's super bad for you.

255
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.490
It really bad for you.

256
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:59.070
But the guy lost like a ridiculous amount of weight just doing kettle bell

257
00:14:59.071 --> 00:15:03.130
swings.
Sure.
You put your body into extreme stress though,
you know,

258
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.150
I mean that's the idea.
I've heard a lot of them.

259
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.770
I'm really talking out of my ass.

260
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.520
I have a limited amount of knowledge really and swipes and in

261
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.260
boy,
that's the way to get out of a commercial.

262
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.100
Right.
And saved the day
anyway.

263
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.110
I don't know exactly what you need to do to get,
you know,
100% fit.

264
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.140
I'm not a an exercise physiologist,

265
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:34.280
but I do know that one way that works extremely well and the method that I use

266
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.450
is that kettlebells,
they're fucking awesome.
Kettlebells,
bodyweight exercises.

267
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:42.200
That's all I do,
sort of.
I do,
I'll,
I'll do whatever the fuck I want,

268
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.090
but what I'm telling you is

269
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.810
what I'm saying is kettlebells are the shirt.
All right,

270
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.350
go to [inaudible] dot com the code they broke.

271
00:15:53.351 --> 00:15:56.810
It does not work with the kettle bells on the battle ropes cause we sell those

272
00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:59.810
bitches as cheap as humanly possible.
They're not that expensive.

273
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.240
I thought it was going to be what you want to 50 bucks a kettle bell.
It's not,

274
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.940
it's affordable.
It's very,

275
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.440
it's very problematic to try to send these giant fucking cannon balls through

276
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:13.730
the mail.
Canon balls with the handles.
It's so silly,
like the shift,

277
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:17.480
it's like one of the dumbest things you get ever ship because it's so expensive

278
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.250
and the poor fucking people.

279
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:22.970
Could you imagine getting the Kettlebell?

280
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.630
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yeah,
but awesome.

281
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.290
Exercise equipment and we have a full line of them at [inaudible] dot com we

282
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:33.620
have packages.
I need to get a parent that he need to get a pair of them.

283
00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:36.050
You fucking lazy.
I'll give you some.

284
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.880
You want some 2020 I'll start off with to start over.

285
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.810
You should.
You're going to get in shape now.
No,

286
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:48.440
I mean that just to me kettlebells seems like the easiest thing to work like

287
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.370
that.
Easy to work.
Put weights on anything.

288
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:54.620
You just grab it and fucking dude done 20 minutes.

289
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.330
I'll give you a workout that will fucking break your spirit in 20 minutes.

290
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.340
I want that workout.
It's brutal.

291
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.190
You've got to get in shape before you do it though.
That's another thing,

292
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:05.990
you know,
build slowly.

293
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:08.840
If you're not a person who's been doing a lot of exercises are,

294
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:11.900
you know our friend Kevin Pereira from an attack of the show,

295
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.430
he got crazy in a weightlifting like all at once and he hurt his knees.

296
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.690
Like he fucked his shoulder up.
He was doing like heavyweights,
like right away.

297
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.850
I think he had a guy just training them.

298
00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:27.851
That was probably not conservative enough with how he like pushed him and he's

299
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:32.510
got knee problems now,
so don't,
don't,
don't do that.
You know,
be careful.

300
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.760
You can't get your shit together bitches.
That's my message.

301
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.690
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,

Cue The music.

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:22.120

you need to interview as many people as possible.

310
00:18:22.121 --> 00:18:24.850
So even when people are like special,

I was like,

315
00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:38.470
And then I stole the shit.
I started talking to them and I go,

316
00:18:38.471 --> 00:18:40.660

318
00:18:44.351 --> 00:18:46.870

And he wanted to get his picture with you.

319
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.530
And I was like,
Larry.
And then I said,
I go,
I look at the dude right now.

320
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.080
I kind of know I got him because he listens to this podcast.

321
00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.830
So I go skip the fucking wedding.
And he goes,
it's two weddings.

322
00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.870
I think it was good,
both of them.
And he looks at me and he goes,

323
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.453
I'll fucking do it.

324
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.060
Life goes on you.
We can't,
we can't.
It's my,
it's my cousin's wedding.

325
00:19:07.061 --> 00:19:08.290
And my roommate from college,
he goes,

326
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.050
I don't even know her roommate from college.
Let's go.
Let's fucking go.

327
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.810
So deep to me.
We cans on her part,

328
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.200

329
00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.820
They skipped one of the weddings just in case we called back to interview them

330
00:19:21.821 --> 00:19:25.240
again.
So they skipped.
He was,
they were in,
man,
let me tell you something.

331
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.500
I had never had more fun with one dude in my entire life.
We shot machine guns.

332
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.750
We fucking,
we jumped off a three story balcony like we did.

333
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.610
It was the funniest fucking trip.
Then at the end of the trip,

334
00:19:36.611 --> 00:19:37.930
we're sitting there like,
we've wrapped,

335
00:19:37.931 --> 00:19:40.990
we're having dinner as a group and he goes,
I give you guys have a good time.

336
00:19:40.991 --> 00:19:44.290
And he's like,
we just wanted to get a picture with you.
Okay.

337
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.510
Would you all weekend
a fucking great day for that guy.

338
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.770
Oh,
he was so fucking,
he was typical death squad,
right?

339
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.730
We're going to meet Celine Dion and,
and I,
and we're backstage.

340
00:19:57.731 --> 00:20:00.490
You get three minutes with her and we're getting,

341
00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:03.710
we've got tickets to the show for them,
for her.
And so we say,
I say to the guy,

342
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.390
go,
we go,
Erin,
is three minutes too much?
Yeah,
you can.

343
00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:09.730
You can't last

344
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.350
15 but that seems like a long a time.
And that was that Celine Dion.

345
00:20:17.351 --> 00:20:20.890
I would fuck you for three minutes.
Oh my God.
That was the deal.

346
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.980
Imagine if our culture was like so open that leg,
like a woman like that.

347
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:28.900
I would go in and just fuck off her fans for three minutes,

348
00:20:28.901 --> 00:20:30.640
but there was a price to it.
And when to charity,

349
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.380
I guarantee you get some people to do it for charity is the Spca.

350
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.280
Oh Wow.
Okay,
cool.

351
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.600
I can dig for charity and we can combine two things that everybody loves helping

352
00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:45.400
out the poor and blow jobs.
I'm fucking,
I'm all in.

353
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.520
So he gets three minutes with Celine Dion and I go,
I go,

354
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:49.780
everyone get your questions ready,

355
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.680
like we need to be tight so everyone have your questions.
So the girl,
I said,

356
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:55.000
what's your question to the girl goes,

357
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.050
I'm gonna ask her how she does it as a mother,
as a working mother,

358
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:00.400
how does she juggle it all?

359
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.880
And in my head I'm like wanting to be grain of Celine Dion's.
Like I'm very,

360
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:08.110
very wealthy.
I don't have to take care of my kids.
I fly on private jets,

361
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:10.210
but she didn't.
She was like,
I was like,
great,
great question.

362
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:12.460
So we'll get something that the cit network likes.
So go,
Aaron,

363
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:15.800
what's your question?
He goes,
dead fucking serious.
He goes,
oh,

364
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:19.990
I'm going to ask her if she's ever seen titanic.
I go,

365
00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:24.680
are you fucking kidding me?
He goes,
yeah,
I go,
that is the perfect questionnaire.

366
00:21:24.681 --> 00:21:27.700
And you ask her that.
And he goes,
why is that a dumb question?
I go,
no,
no,

367
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.400
it's not dumb at all.
So we get in.
Celine Dion comes in,

368
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:34.600
she meets him that she answers the question with the girl and then says to him,

369
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.620
I go,
Aaron's got a question.
And he goes,
oh,
I was wondering in your career.
I go,

370
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:41.860
stop it.
I go,
stop.
And Celine is like,
what?
And I go,

371
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.350
you ask her the question you said you were going to ask.
And he goes,

372
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.750
have you ever seen titanic?
And Celine Dion breaks out laughing,
goes,

373
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.760
cut.
Who the fuck is this guy?

374
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.870
What kind of a horrible question cut.
Cause she,

375
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.410
it's the dumbest question.
Did she ever see titanic?

376
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.130
We're rolling on the whole thing and she goes,

377
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.680
that is the dumbest question I've ever been at.
Have I seen?

378
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.380
Yes,
I saw the movie and he goes,
did you like,

379
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.610
are you kidding me?
It was,

380
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.580
we ended up spending like 17 minutes with her cause she fucking fell in love

381
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:23.140
with this guy.
So yeah.
And they had to pull her out of the room.
It was,

382
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:27.070
it was she,
the second he asked that question,
she fucking loved us.

383
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:29.860
And then she goes,
looks at me and she goes,
where'd you get these guys?

384
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:34.750
And I said,
and I go,
well.
And she goes,
wait,
who are you?
I'm Burt.
And she goes,

385
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:36.710

387
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.410
She was going on the stage with the show started late because she hung out with

388
00:22:44.411 --> 00:22:46.630
us backstage.
Japan is on,

389
00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:49.150
She'd had a really expensive dress and the handmade for her.

390
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.970
So she's a ballbuster.
She's awesome.
She was really fun.
And then ty would,

391
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.540
Celine Dion,

Have you ever hear the clip on Youtube?

397
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.840
Why during a show she said the n word and can I play it for you?
Cause it,

398
00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:29.170
there's a twist to it.
All right,

they're fucking amazing flavor.

416
00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:40.871
And it has a ketchup mustard that a fat guy made them because there's like extra

417
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.620
seasoning on them.

418
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:44.840
You know how when you get like that one reader that looks extra dark,

419
00:24:44.841 --> 00:24:47.570
you're like,
oh,
there's going to be a good one.
All the chips are like that.

420
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:49.670
And this is the weirdest fucking thing I've ever had in my life.

421
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.750
It tastes like a cheeseburger in your mouth.
It's a cheeseburger potato chip.

422
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:58.700
It's so fucking gross.
The mustard taste a mustard.
It has every flavor.

423
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.580
They're insane.
I the buffaloes can be good for you

424
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.680
serving sizes.
Chip.

425
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:12.080
Sometimes you just gotta take it.
Take it on the Chin for flavor

426
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:18.980
too.
Delicious.

427
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.140
<v 4>Cause I'm calling back one more tastes like white castle,</v>

428
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.920
White Castle hamburgers.
It tastes like to me.
Mcdonald's hamburgers.
Oh,

429
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.400
let me tell you,
I went to Burger King.

430
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.110
I have an eight in four days like I've been,
cause I was sick with strep throat.

431
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.930
You're so fucking lucky.
So I was eating watermelon,

432
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.730
watermelon.
I,
that's the only thing I could eat with like watermelon.

433
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.600
And so yesterday was the first day I was like,
you know what,
I can eat now.

434
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:48.980
My throat's not that sore anymore.

435
00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:51.500
I'm going to eat something really bad just to kind of,

436
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.770
cause I need something in me bad.
You know,
it's something horrible.

437
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.640
And so I was like the first fast food place.
So I went to Burger King.
I'm like,

438
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.980
all right,
I haven't been to burger king in a long time.
I'm going to try it out.

439
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.040
I had a whopper,
fries and uh,
their,
their smoothie,

440
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.370
the smoothie was okay,
but the whopper,

441
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:12.110
it tasted like it was grilled and thrown in a bucket and then thrown in the

442
00:26:12.111 --> 00:26:14.300
microwave and then slapped on Manet's.

443
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:18.260
It was just the most disgusting tasting hamburger ever.
Their fries,

444
00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:22.070
they changed our fries or something horrible.
Like I took one bite of fruit,

445
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.410
I'm like,
I don't want any more of that.
Like I,

446
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.560
they eat one thing and then I was looking and I was like,
what?

447
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.870
How is this place still in business?

448
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.590
There is so much competition nowadays for Burgers from all these like gourmet

449
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:38.270
burger places or just like in and outs type places.
Some those things take time.

450
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.200
The reason why Burger King and Mcdonald's works is familiarity.

451
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:46.680
People been going there forever and there's,
you know,
use a guarantee.

452
00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:48.780
You go in there,
you get it,
you go.

453
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.480
But something happened to Burger King because it didn't used to always be like

454
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:53.180
this.
They trying to fuck with Wendy's.
If you go,

455
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.490
if you want to go for like the best like chain and my opinion,

456
00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.320
Wendy's like national nationwide,
but Wendy's can't fuck within and out.

457
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.740
When these code,
no one fucks.
Fuck bakers the best.

458
00:27:04.741 --> 00:27:07.260
Take five guys burgers can fuck within and out.

459
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.640
Five guys burgers are right up there.

460
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.380
There are different than in and out burgers and you'd go,

461
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.610
how could it be different?
They're different.
That's what I'm saying.

462
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.500
I don't know what he's talking about.
All these awesome burger places,

463
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:20.480
Burger King and you know like their latest thing is a bacon milkshake or or

464
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.340
Sunday.
I'm like,
seriously,
that's a hilarious internet joke,

465
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.180
but no one's going to,

466
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.560
you're not going to fucking make money selling that in and out and five guys are

467
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:33.561
the shit when you cook the fucking Nice fresh meat patty right in front of you

468
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:38.700
and they slap it down there.
She took it right in front of you,
man.

469
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:43.410
No should be fucking pulled out of a bin and watered Jewish shouldn't.
Yeah,

470
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.980
we shouldn't even allow that other way.
It shouldn't be preprocessed at all.

471
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:48.990
Why does it need to be in and out?
It doesn't do it that way.

472
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.960
Ridiculous expensive profit thing.
If you,
if you uh,

473
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.570
all of a sudden you're using only fresh freezing your beef,

474
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.500
which is what in and out does these fresh beef,
then you have transport issues.

475
00:28:01.501 --> 00:28:02.700
It doesn't last as long.

476
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.720
You gotta you got to make sure that you judge how much you need.
Exactly.

477
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:09.670
Or You have overages inside.
It's not going to last slide.

478
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:14.040
I mean how long has like ground beef last if you don't freeze it can't be more

479
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.300
than a few days and it starts to get funky shows.

480
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:20.070
Like when you take anyone from not in La that envisioning when you take them to

481
00:28:20.071 --> 00:28:22.650
in and out,
they're always like fucking amazing.

482
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.280
That's what you're supposed to do.
It's like steak and shake on steroids.

483
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.130
It's funny,
we were like,

484
00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:34.650
we're so accustomed shitty food that's like that's the norm.

485
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.740
Like the shitty food is the norm in a world where there's competition.

486
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:42.100
It is weird that that happened.
Why isn't there one place though that's has like,

487
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:47.110
like imagine whole foods as a fast food place that's open all the time,

488
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:50.780
like a 24 hour place.
Like I make like a,
you know,
uh,
Mike,
uh,

489
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.420
bird sounds like Brian's looking for a place to pick up checks in the middle of

490
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.490
two.
Today's people that,

491
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.620
that are on all these diets and stuff and then they're so concerned about it

492
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.290
that,
that there'll be one person to step and be like,
look,

493
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.670
we're going to make Kinlaw 24 hours a day.
Fast food.
You know,
Chenwa sides.

494
00:29:08.671 --> 00:29:13.671
Like we're going to have a healthy all hundred percent natural vegan crap.

495
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.880
We know everything,
but it's 24 hours a day and it's,
you know,
like Starbucks.

496
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:21.600
So you need something that's an alternative to convenience in the box.

497
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:26.250
It's convenient.
I'm calling from job to job.
Like I had 10 minutes to eat.

498
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.550
I'm not going to go fucking to the grocery store and go home and cook and then

499
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.610
like I need,
all right a Wendy's,

500
00:29:32.611 --> 00:29:36.330
I'll get a baked potato and some chili or you know,
something stupid like that.

501
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.050
Yeah.
It's hard to eat healthy if you're on the fly,
that's for sure.

502
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.040
It is weird that we have so many different

503
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.570
<v 3>places where you could eat like shit,</v>

504
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.180
subways so hard to find a place where you can eat healthy.

505
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.050
They're coming out with one,
my dad just invested in it.
Oh yeah.
And it's,
yeah,

506
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:53.200
and the reason that,
the interesting thing is he told me about it.

507
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.450
I don't know what it is.
I don't know the name of it,

508
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.940
but it's a in definitely coming out in Florida and it's,

509
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.910
and they only talked about it cause when Chick-Filet got on law and he'd percent

510
00:30:00.911 --> 00:30:04.860
anyone gays to marry,
uh,
all heard all these other places talking about,
you know,

511
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.510
Chipola is one of the healthier places to eat and this new places,

512
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:10.120
it's going to be the same type of thing.
Like a lot of healthy options.

513
00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:12.670
Filets one of the healthier places.
Yes.
Most your gang

514
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:19.010
then just all the hate vibes you'd get
off.

515
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.610
My phone doesn't work up here.
I'd call my dad and get the name of the place.

516
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:23.290
But I've said the same thing Brian,

517
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.740
because I'd love to have something you can just go in and know that you can get

518
00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:28.570
a meal around 400 calories.

519
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:32.770
It's Kinda like fucking a little more tricky salad.
Something real.

520
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.700
Some real food.

521
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:38.260
So now I want to food borne a protein and a bunch of steam vegetables.
Yeah.
Yeah.

522
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.170
It's weird how much,
if you look at the,

523
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:44.350
just the overall numbers of restaurants that we have.

524
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.710
It's weird how much of it is shit.
Yeah,

525
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.990
it's the majority.
Like all the quick ones are shit.
Look at,
look at the,

526
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.120
I mean bell can,
you know,

527
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.910
can you imagine that it took Taco bell this long to come out with a healthy

528
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:00.730
option while they have bean burritos?
No,
they got the new thing.

529
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.530
They've got a Taco bowl you had like,
there's new bold at the chef designed that.

530
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.630
I saw commercial foreign.
I was like,
oh,
I gotta fucking try that out.

531
00:31:07.631 --> 00:31:11.080
And then I got to talk about,
I was like,
fuck that.
And Mexican pizza.
So like,

532
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:14.000
but I don't know what you just said.
Mexican pizza.
If you never,

533
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.480
you never have a sweater.
Weird little rant to yourself

534
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.920
trying to say,
I can't order healthy when I get to talk about,

535
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.000
I'm like fuck it dude.
Yeah,

536
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:31.060
that Dorito Taco you can't get or anything other than the Dorito taco shells are

537
00:31:32.231 --> 00:31:37.150
made out of Doritos.
It's most so amazing thing in the laundry.
That's Taco Bell,

538
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.580
Taco Bell.
That's somebody like unlike Burger King.
Taco bell is,

539
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.020
they're on their game.
They're making shit better tastes or having their,

540
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.970
their beat,
which horse was horse.

541
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.780
But I only know that because I did a channel,
a show for animal planet,

542
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.950
and this woman was raised premium stallions.
And she told me,
she was like,

543
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.870
so it was maybe one of the greatest days of my life,

544
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:05.550
but she told me she was premium stallions are stylings.

545
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.380
They keep pregnant cause they do this,
they produce this,

546
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:13.150
this hormone that goes into share hair shampoo.
And then she said,
oh yeah,

547
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.360
and it's the Canadian.
She went off on the Canadians.
She was like,
and I was like,

548
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:20.080
we're never gonna use this.
But apparently in Canada,
no,
it's a,

549
00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.860
it's a fat chick.
Was just some crazy hippie them.

550
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.880
They eat horse in Canada or a quick Google search tells you that a Taco Bell

551
00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:30.460
does not use horse meat and that is a false rumor.

552
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.750
And actually talk about his response to that is,
I mean,

553
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.890
they had a good response or whatever.
Who Cares?
It doesn't matter.
It's,

554
00:32:37.891 --> 00:32:40.010
it's delicious.
And W unlike

555
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.860
<v 0>burger king,
which seems like you're going to a crack house nowadays,</v>

556
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.250
the Obama Administration.
Okay.
The horse meat for Americans.

557
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:51.130
That's why I swear to God,
I want to say I had to be in there I go eight horse.

558
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:55.550
Me used to be legal in Japan where you used to just go to like places and eat

559
00:32:55.551 --> 00:32:58.670
horses,
but they outlawed and she said it was delicious.
Well the uh,

560
00:32:58.671 --> 00:33:00.590
the horses and other countries,
it,

561
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.510
this Guy Alistair Overeem is fucking huge.
And then a fighters,

562
00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:08.510
it's like a big power lift and looking dude,
it looks like a superhero.

563
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.560
You know Overeem is right.
Yeah.
We'll,
Overeem is a big on eating horse meat.

564
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.300
He says that's where he gets all his protein from.

565
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.720
A lot of athletes say that to really need horse meat.
Yeah.

566
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:21.020
Gotta be super easy to catch.
Tony's the veal breezy to catch.

567
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.920
She'll show with an apple versus a,
that's a,
that's a,

568
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.430
that's a team horse.
What am I certain Mustang.

569
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:31.760
It's like only like a wild fucking horses.
Like if they really taste good,

570
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.380
oh wait,
I'm sure people hunted them.

571
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.710
It's amazing that they figured out how to get along with people.

572
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:39.740
They're just like,
well just let them minus never freak out ever.

573
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:44.000
[inaudible] and they keep us alive cause every other animal like think about

574
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:46.880
like how prevalent they are amongst people.
You know,

575
00:33:46.881 --> 00:33:50.150
they get to live in the stall and everything's good and nobody eats them.

576
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.510
Nobody sets a fucking pissed and through their head they give you a nice food

577
00:33:53.511 --> 00:33:55.370
all the time.
They pat you and brush you.

578
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.340
The horse has it like way better than the cow,

579
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.960
the cows because the cows were like,
bitch you can't ride us.
They'll fuck off.

580
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.290
Get the fuck off.
Get the fuck off.

581
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.400
They wanted us off so bad.
Do you think the saw that another pasture,

582
00:34:10.401 --> 00:34:13.910
they were lunch there,
so we started eating them.
We were like,
fuck you bitch.

583
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.240
You won't let us ride you.
Okay,
well then we eat you.
How about that?

584
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:19.820
Stupid good are you to us.
We get rice you.

585
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.690
That's why we were barely eating the horses.
Even with all cars everywhere.

586
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:27.170
We don't need horses anymore.
We're getting the fuck out of them.
We're like,
no,

587
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:29.540
we have a special bond because you let me ride you.

588
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.760
They're cruising off this reputation from one that we use the right.
Exactly.

589
00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.880
They became my friends.
They became my friends when they're just the dopiest,

590
00:34:37.881 --> 00:34:42.050
most docile,
easily tricked animal.
They panic.
You lock 'em up you,

591
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.420
it's called breaking them.
You get a rope around their neck,

592
00:34:44.421 --> 00:34:45.980
you settle the fuck down.

593
00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.390
He'd let them know who's boss and write down the horse from then on lets you

594
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.940
ride them and right now they're in tenure.
Obviously they don't have the case.

595
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:55.610
There's probably been a lot more complications to the process than just

596
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.000
shortening this for the,
for comics.
He can,

597
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.120
when guys want to hear Rachel racing the inward.
Sure.
All right.
Here we go.

598
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:09.230
<v 6>It's better not be a tricky thing.
So that's,
I think that's what I like</v>

599
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.870
starting it because when you're on a plane and stuff,

600
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.480
I'm always envious of the nurse.
Yeah.
Yeah.

601
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.880
Don't let you bring the toils on though.

602
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:24.720
<v 0>Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hobos.
Envious of the what?</v>

603
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.980
<v 6>I'm fine and stuff.
I'm always envious of the niggers.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

604
00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.350
Do they still let you bring the totals on though?

605
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.130
<v 0>Wait,
hold on one more time.
It's my favorite.</v>

606
00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.250
<v 6>I'm always going to be his of the knitters.
Yeah.</v>

607
00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.660
<v 0>Yeah.
Did they still let you bring the turtles?</v>

608
00:35:40.661 --> 00:35:45.480
I don't know what she's talking about.
The knitters.
Oh

609
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.690
my God.
He's like,
do you get to bring the tools on?
Like

610
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.360
never

611
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.160
a woman got in trouble.

612
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:06.450
She was a teacher for using the word niggardly in a,

613
00:36:06.451 --> 00:36:10.080
in front of a class for using that word.
She got in trouble.

614
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.710
There was a congressman that got in trouble for that.
Yeah.
And it's,

615
00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.850
it's almost hilarious.
It's a word.
I mean,
that's a real word.
Yeah.
Yeah,

616
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.260
it sounds like another word,
but,
uh,
there's,

617
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:21.320
there's a lot of words that sounded like bad words.

618
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:25.650
The Django reprimanded for using the phrase cotton picking what?

619
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.611
Like Leanne,

620
00:36:26.611 --> 00:36:31.611
we were at the beach and she had said something like a gimme one cotton picking

621
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:34.110
minute.
And you know,
you've ever heard the tape,

622
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.280
this cotton picking in the south,
Leanne said it was a,

623
00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:41.700
it was a euphemism for God damn right.
So gimme this,
you know,

624
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.150
and then all of a sudden someone said something to her and Leanne went,

625
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.830
oh my God,
I never realized what I'm saying.

626
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.740
Like am I saying cotton pig in like a black person?

627
00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:52.710
Like actually will cotton picker.
Right.
And so I was like,
Holy Shit.

628
00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:57.711
And so I looked it up and it turns out that cotton pickin just is a horrible

629
00:36:57.841 --> 00:37:01.230
fucking activity.
It's like a fucking shit in my mouth.

630
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:04.080
Act like no one enjoyed cotton pickin so it's like,

631
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:05.080
give me one cotton picking minute.

632
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.820
It's like actually means give me the longest fucking minute you could ever give

633
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:12.750
me.
Cause Cotton Pickin was exhausting.
Gotten apparently is a,

634
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.090
was way easier to process.

635
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:20.180
So that's why it took over from hemp really until the 1930s they came out with a

636
00:37:20.551 --> 00:37:23.400
machine called the decorticator and they were going to have everything convert

637
00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:26.520
back to him where we use cotton,
but cotton is like,

638
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.540
it sucks ass and compared to him in comparison to have,

639
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:35.040
but it's not nearly as strong a tensile strength.
The the durability,
it's,

640
00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.930
it's an amazing plant,

641
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.670
but the people that were in the cotton industry got together with dupont,

642
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.630
who are the people that made Nylon and William Randolph Hearst,

643
00:37:45.631 --> 00:37:50.220
who was the guy who ran Hearst publications who also had these paper mills that

644
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:54.660
were all based on wood and he would have had to convert them to,
to use hemp.

645
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.110
So it was a basically an industry.
They were trying to suppress an industry.

646
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.570
That's how marijuana became illegal.

647
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:05.960
It all became illegal because of the cotton industry and fiber nylon,

648
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.530
all of them,
William Randolph Hearst,

649
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.310
all of them getting together and it's pretty much playing monopoly,

650
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.210
but it was about hemp.
It wasn't about the getting high part.
It was about this,

651
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.670
this incredible plant that if you PR by the way,

652
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:21.210
which is illegal in this country,
it's illegal.
You can't even get high on it.

653
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.770
It's a cousin of marijuana.
It's not,
it's not psycho.
I just,
the hemp,
it doesn't,

654
00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:28.380
it doesn't have the drug in it.
It doesn't have the drug in it is,
and you can't,

655
00:38:28.381 --> 00:38:30.570
you can't grow it.
You have to grow it.
In Canada,

656
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.850
we have this sort of stuff that's coming out on,
on it.

657
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:36.970
It's called a hemp force says protein powder made with hemp hearts.

658
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.480
It's so hard to get this stuff.
We can only buy 50 pounds of it a day.

659
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.770
You can't buy any more of it.

660
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.520
So we have like limited quantities like to sell this a hemp protein power

661
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:50.440
because it's the best hemp protein powder that you can get is made in Canada.

662
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.760
These,
uh,
hemp hearts,
and we can't grow them here.
We see.
They don't allow you to,

663
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.520
even though it's not,
it's like you can't get high from it at all.

664
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.690
It's impossible.
You can't,
you're not allowed to grow it here.
And then all,

665
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:05.050
it's like,
it's,
it's amazing how like natural resources,

666
00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:09.140
things like cotton in hemp oil even can be manipulated like that.

667
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.680
It's like we have to look at it like what it really is.

668
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.400
It's really like sort of an economic thing.
The cotton gin,
you know,

669
00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:19.390
straighten it out for a lot of people.
I kind of had a process cotton and that,

670
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:23.410
that made it a little bit easier,
but it's like that battle that we,

671
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:24.850
that the men,

672
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.560
the hemp and marijuana world lost in like 1930,
whatever it is,

673
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:33.190
they still still lost it.
It's amazing.
And the north was all about polyester,

674
00:39:33.191 --> 00:39:37.390
right?
Yeah.
The suits,
those leisure suits,

675
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.800
whoever talked people into those,

676
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.160
those fucking crazy suits that they wore in the 70s.
When you're skinny,

677
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:46.540
they lost their fucking mind.
Don Knotts,
Don Knotts,

678
00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.760
and he's the one that started all that stuff.
You know,

679
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.590
here's where you'd see how America lost his fucking mind in the 70s.
I was,

680
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:55.520
um,
I had a,
um,
uh,

681
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.680
a game of pool the other night with a Adam Ferrara.
Do you know Adam for our,

682
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.720
he's a comedian.
He's an,

683
00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:06.490
he's an Omaha and next weekend he used to be on a rescue me and he is now one of

684
00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:08.950
the American hosts for top gear.
And we went on,

685
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.880
we were both car enthusiasts and we were talking about looking at the cars from

686
00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:17.881
like the 70s like from the early seventies to the late seventies to the early

687
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.610
eighties to the nineties it's like what the fuck happened to us?

688
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:27.030
Like we completely lost the ability to make cool cars like somehow or another,

689
00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:31.750
if you go back to the fifties in the 60s and you look at what like America hat

690
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:36.310
and like core vats and fucking mustangs and those are dope cars.

691
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.010
There's so dope that people still want them today.

692
00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:43.630
Even with their shitty ass technology of the 1960s people still drive mustangs

693
00:40:43.631 --> 00:40:47.720
around cause they're so fucking cool looking.
We lost that,
that we liked.

694
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:51.310
I think that one of the best times,
that's what we were saying.

695
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:55.150
You were saying for tempo and you're like,
what the fuck was that car?

696
00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:00.180
The Camaro of the fucking eighties look at a 69 Camaro and to look at a Camaro

697
00:41:00.551 --> 00:41:05.350
of the eighties like what the fuck did you do?
You just like you melted it,

698
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.340
you smoothed it.
It's nothing now and it's,
it's boring as fuck.

699
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:12.220
This is like a terrible design that by the same people.

700
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.530
What kind of lazy cons design,

701
00:41:14.531 --> 00:41:19.531
that piece of shit car have fucking ugly ass Camaro like now the Camaro is bad

702
00:41:20.581 --> 00:41:23.800
ass now.
Then I was fucking,
oh he's the best it's ever looked.

703
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.050
I think they totally nailed it,
but it makes you wonder.

704
00:41:26.051 --> 00:41:28.750
It's like where are we in a haze as a country?

705
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.840
Like what the fuck happened is the auto world like though the community in this

706
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:35.060
country,

707
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.600
what the fuck happened to them in the eighties and the nineties they were so

708
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:39.500
uncreative.

709
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.860
I bet it was the same thing we were talking about is they just got the tobacco

710
00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:43.694
industry.
They just got,

711
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.690
they just stopped fucking caring and they're making money hand over fist and

712
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:49.120
then all of a sudden the Japanese just took it over.
I don't,

713
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.160
I would love to hear a story about it.
He was,
there must be some,

714
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:57.140
a bunch of factors.
It must be so lost the show.
Maybe it's like people like,

715
00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:01.100
like they gave up taking psychedelics and all the designers weren't taken

716
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:04.430
psychedelics anymore and they weren't drawing sting rays and said there were

717
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:08.360
drawing these fucking shitty Corvettes in the 80s did you ever see the core vets

718
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:10.670
of the 80s no.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

719
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.440
If you're driving around in a 1980 something corvette,
most,
I mean,

720
00:42:15.441 --> 00:42:17.310
you might be a cool guy.
He might be this fuzziness,

721
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.220
but chances are you're a fucking loser.
All right.
Yeah.

722
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.200
That's a probably a creepy dude.
And you drive them one of the ugliest,

723
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.510
one of the coolest cars America's ever designed,

724
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:29.600
and you wanted the ugliest versions ever.
That's the one that you picked.

725
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.710
But if you have a 1969 corvette,

726
00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:37.850
you go back to one of those old stang ratios are fucking evil things.

727
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.770
That's an evil looking car.
I mean even just a Plymouth and from like,

728
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.160
oh 67 it's just a monster.
You know all the ones,
the,

729
00:42:45.161 --> 00:42:49.460
the Cholos low rider out which one?
Oh yeah.

730
00:42:49.461 --> 00:42:54.170
Y'All the impala.
Impala is a bad ass fucking car piece of art.
Man.

731
00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:55.280
Ferrari's showed me,

732
00:42:55.610 --> 00:43:00.610
he's got a photo of a friend of his had a really nicely done 57 Cadillac and you

733
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:07.790
just look at it and go,
oh my God.
It was a work of art.

734
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:12.830
It was a work of art.
Those fucking man.
I get obsessed every no mental online.

735
00:43:12.831 --> 00:43:15.410
I'll just start googling like years of cars,

736
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:19.840
like the Lincoln where I wanted the Cadillac,
the 69 Cadillac car.

737
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.560
That convertible is just,
it's the big beast whale plus the,

738
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:29.090
that is the,
the one of the biggest examples of American excess,

739
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:34.250
the most beautiful examples that giant Cadillac.
Oh,
those were ridiculous.

740
00:43:34.251 --> 00:43:37.800
Those are fucking bad ass cars.
And I remember getting in one in highschool,

741
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.330
someone's dad had one and we felt like gangsters.

742
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.780
We had maybe a foot of caulk between the three of us,

743
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.490
but we felt like pimps just smoking cigarettes and all,

744
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.710
remember how the ride on those things,
man,

745
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:54.950
you just kind of like floated this could kind of take a corner.

746
00:43:54.951 --> 00:43:59.500
And they were the worst in handling.
They couldn't handle it all.

747
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.340
I always wanted one of those things.

748
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:04.420
There's a Volkswagen Volkswagen thing was like,

749
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:09.440
it was the ugly fucking looked like it belonged in the middle of the Sahara and

750
00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:13.760
a bunch of German should be coming out of it.
And it's really weird.
As in 1974,

751
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:16.130
I had a Volkswagen Corrado was one of my,

752
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.910
there was the first thing that I got when I had a development deal.

753
00:44:19.911 --> 00:44:22.930
I bought a used Corrado was a good car.

754
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:28.400
Was that the back?
The one with the back was kind of like,
uh,
like slicked back.

755
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.640
Um,
I don't know.
I don't remember what it looked like it to be honest with you.

756
00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:35.250
I remember the Volkswagen Scirocco.
It wasn't that,

757
00:44:35.251 --> 00:44:40.050
it was more of a boxy fucking love Volkswagen to my car.
I love your new card to,

758
00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:44.430
that thing's fucking awesome.
Yeah.
I'm in love with a car.
I had a Fox,

759
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:48.750
I had a Jetta,
I had a jeep,
I had a,

760
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.110
I'm trying to think of all my fucking cars.
You know what this thing is?

761
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:55.020
They look like a Gti.
It looks just like a Gti.

762
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.320
Oh I know what you're talking about.
This is the car,
this,
this car,

763
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.220
the only car in the world that has a sentimental feeling to me.

764
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.510
Even that stupid Barracuda that I bought and had made on the TV show,

765
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:09.720
there's not a sentimental to me as this car cause it was the first thing that I

766
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:14.721
got when I got some money and I wound up giving it to Dave Pierre due to work at

767
00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:20.310
the comedy store.
It was worth like,
I don't remember what it was worth it,

768
00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:24.300
it was worth a lot more than he had.
So,
uh,
I said,
how much do you have?

769
00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:28.290
And he's like,
I have like whenever he had,
you know,
like okay you can take it.

770
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.940
And he was like,
what the fuck you talking about?

771
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.330
Cause it was like basically it was like a new car,
but does,

772
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.800
when I was on news radio and I was,
I was a baller.

773
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.920
I heard a story about drew Carey giving his Miata to someone.

774
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:44.560
He gave his card.
Someone who was a me out of those are cool cars man.
They,

775
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:47.280
yeah they are.
Do you ever driving me on it?
No.
Bullshit.
No.

776
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.890
Jada's are fun fucking cars.
First of all,

777
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:54.620
they're super light and if you drive a super light car,
you really feel the road.

778
00:45:54.621 --> 00:45:58.350
Like really Miatas are great drive.
I've never driven in a Miata.
I just always,

779
00:45:58.351 --> 00:46:01.470
I just always had a visual drew Carey in a Miata.
They got fucked.

780
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.370
Somehow or another,

781
00:46:02.371 --> 00:46:07.371
my Miata got fucked and their first bland version of the car,

782
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.370
you know it became a woman's car.
Yeah.
I don't know why,

783
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.220
but it's a fun little sporty car.
It's like,

784
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.240
it's a weird thing with car culture is that like there's a lot of folks that

785
00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:20.760
will drive like older cars from like you know,

786
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.250
driving a 1960 mg,

787
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:27.540
one of those little things and you'll drive those but you won't respect them.

788
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:32.430
Miada like people don't like me out.
It doesn't get any respect.
It's Japanese,

789
00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:36.690
it's a,
but it's a really competent little car and my buddy had a Miata and we in

790
00:46:36.691 --> 00:46:38.430
college,
they're great cars.

791
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:41.270
They were great cars but they were perceived as chick cars.
Yeah,

792
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.160
it's a chip card.
It's like a Boxster.
The Porsche Boxster.

793
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.640
Porsche has a new Boxster that really is so good looking.

794
00:46:47.641 --> 00:46:52.500
It will slay the idea that it's a chick car.
This new Boxster is so dope.
Really?

795
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.700
Oh it looks so killer.
Yeah.
Porsche design teams.

796
00:46:55.701 --> 00:47:00.660
So they just make things that you lost for you look at him.
You just go,
oh fuck,

797
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:05.130
I w I would rather,
I think I would rather,
if I had to get like a sports car,

798
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:10.320
I got the given the,
the corvette fucking turbo,

799
00:47:10.321 --> 00:47:13.980
whatever the beast quarterback Zr one for like a for like a week.

800
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.580
They get it to me and I drove that thing around and I fucking loved it.

801
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.340
I loved it because everyone looks at you.

802
00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:23.160
It's like having a big Dick and a locker room.
You like that?
Fuck.

803
00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.570
Everyone looks at you.

804
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.890
That's ridiculous and he's a fucking bad.
We get about getting one.

805
00:47:29.891 --> 00:47:31.660
I'm thinking about getting a red one with black wheels.

806
00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:37.030
I don't get my socks on doing not get it right.
Get up fucking,

807
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:39.580
that's why I want to get a red car because they're so stupid.

808
00:47:39.581 --> 00:47:43.170
I've never had a red car.
I've never had a reason why they're stupid.
Why?
Why?

809
00:47:43.171 --> 00:47:47.230
They're so stupid?
Because it's like,
hey,
look at me.
I think it looks ridiculous.

810
00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.730
No,
I like red.
I wanted a red car.
Always looks very manly.
It's very ridiculous.

811
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:55.810
I just feel like it's such a stupid fucking thing to get in the first place to

812
00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:58.640
get one of those crazy.
What the fuck do you need a corvette?

813
00:47:58.641 --> 00:48:01.390
Look that for you and you can't drive them.

814
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.690
They're really hard to drive in La because the,

815
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:07.420
you know the spoiler in the front.
Hey,
bottoms bottoms out.
So like I was like,

816
00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.190
I could never cross,
uh,
cross third street.
Yeah,
you could.
I have a gt three,

817
00:48:12.191 --> 00:48:13.970
which is even lower than that.
Believe it or not.

818
00:48:13.971 --> 00:48:17.180
And then I drove that thing everywhere.
Yeah,
but you gotta like,
you gotta go.

819
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.560
Really?
I just deal with it.
I listened to all the time

820
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.370
and I keep going.
Huh?
Red Cars get pulled over by cops also do that.
Yeah.
Yeah,

821
00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:32.290
I bet they would because this is like mostly douchebags driving red cars because

822
00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:34.300
it's such an,
it's such a thing.
It's,

823
00:48:34.301 --> 00:48:39.301
you have to not be thinking about anyone else feelings at all.

824
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.290
You have to be,
if you're driving around a red car,
you know,

825
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.730
you're not thinking of like what someone else is going to feel if they're

826
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:53.460
looking at you.
That's a totally selfish color,
you know,
because it's,
it's,

827
00:48:53.461 --> 00:48:57.910
it's like you just want to yeah.
Oh,
to yell it out.

828
00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.790
Like subtle,
you know,
white is understated,
you know,

829
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.360
you don't have to wash it as much and that's ridiculous.

830
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:06.670
Go to the car and Washington and you don't,
black cars.

831
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:11.430
Black cars are covered in dust the sec in la,
but a white corvette just,

832
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.150
I'm sorry,
it does not look as good as a black or a red one.
Core federal record.

833
00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.430
You are,
you're in the middle of the road with the white one.
Yeah.

834
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.480
You're not really fully committed to being an asshole.

835
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.800
I think if you have a red corvette,
you're fully committed to him.

836
00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:25.920
Am embracing the own.

837
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:30.990
You're like almost like selfish need for the lusty,

838
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:35.710
lusty color of a car.
You know,
Steve,
what are you getting it right?

839
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:36.790
Shiny?
I don't know.

840
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.870
They probably not really portions of smarter car more and it's not,

841
00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:44.530
and I don't need a car any faster than the car I have.
I don't drive fast anyway.

842
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.460
I don't,
I don't even like to drive fast.
But I liked his cars that handle well.

843
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.860
I don't like to do anything stupid on the roads.

844
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:55.090
I've been doing a lot of stupid shit with the turbo.
I was like,

845
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:58.660
I think it was like a pickup.
I think if you go back 25 casts,
I say,
you know,

846
00:49:58.661 --> 00:50:01.900
like I say the same thing,
like I never give a fat ass.
I don't need a fast car.

847
00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:04.170
Once you have a car that can go fast,
God,

848
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.990
they find a lot more holes that you can fit in.

849
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.510
It's the the ability to do it where it's there,
so composed,

850
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.570
you know like that Volkswagen that he has.
Okay.

851
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:18.750
You compare that to that car would beat around a track any power muscle car from

852
00:50:19.091 --> 00:50:24.091
the 60s but he took like some regular 1969 Camaro with stock equipment,

853
00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:28.850
one of those bad ass Camaro's and raced it around the Nurburgring.

854
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.670
You would dust that thing.
You wouldn't even be close to paddle.

855
00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:35.240
Shifting is my new favorite.
It's like playing a video game.

856
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.270
That is the worst way to be driving a car when you're high as thinking you're

857
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:43.040
playing a video game.
Who's like a video game.
Try not to think that when we did,

858
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:47.480
we drove a Lamborghinis and Ferraris there.
The car,
they loved,

859
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.810
the people that work there loved the most was the Camaro daily.

860
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.890
They had iro there,

861
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.830
they'd take you out like on your first lap and a Camaro and they're like,

862
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:56.410
this is the best car.
They're look,
I mean,

863
00:50:56.450 --> 00:51:00.320
I mean obviously of $600,000 Lamborghini is a great car,

864
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.020
but they fucking love this Camaro and they drove it.

865
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.060
It's also an American car in the middle of Mexico.

866
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:07.670
So it is exotic to these guys cause all Mexican.

867
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.180
So they make their own cars.
If they have a new one,

868
00:51:11.181 --> 00:51:15.980
Mexican Mexico is coming out with a new,
I'm like really expensive.

869
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:19.120
Like Lamborghini type equivalent.
Real.
Yeah.
And this,
this,

870
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.510
the place we were at is getting one.

871
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:23.210
They're like one of the first ones coming out on the line.
They're getting,

872
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.530
what about a Canada?
Did they make their own cars?
That's a good question.

873
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:29.870
I don't think they do.
Maybe they've made a couple.

874
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.690
You think they will because they're right next to Detroit or day.
Yeah.

875
00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:34.660
But maybe they see what kind of Douche bags build cars.

876
00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.660
It's just buy their shit out of the business,

877
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:43.550
stay out of their creepy business.
They're like,
they're like a,
they're like,

878
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.210
they're like a Dunkin.
When he used to live with you,
he was like,
why buy weed?

879
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:50.010
That was God
because you,

880
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:54.290
have you seen the new Camaro Zl one that's coming out?
No.
Oh my God.
It's a,

881
00:51:54.291 --> 00:51:57.680
it's a new one with a corvette engine in it.
So it's like,

882
00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:00.170
I think it's 500 and 500 plus horsepower.

883
00:52:00.171 --> 00:52:04.040
I think it's like five 40 or five 50 or something like that.
Ridiculously fast.

884
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:07.580
Handles awesome.
Looks fucking spectacular.

885
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:10.310
It looks like a proper American muscle car.

886
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:12.680
And this one is the yellow one is going to be ridiculous.

887
00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.810
Adam Ferrara just gotten one and he,
uh,

888
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.050
he drove it around and he said he would show up.
He goes,
I would show up,

889
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:20.870
you know,
to Adam's get that long island accent.

890
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.510
I would show up my fucking hearts racing.

891
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:28.700
I'm just went through something.
It's a fucking cars.
Ridiculous man.

892
00:52:28.701 --> 00:52:30.800
You're not supposed to have that car.
You got a rocket into your day.

893
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:35.870
What the fuck are you riding around him?
Is He really a car guys?
She loves cars.

894
00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.680
Really?
The color you should.
Oh yeah,
he's great on the show.
Chameleon paint.

895
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:43.030
Have you heard of chameleon pain was ridiculous.
Shit.
Wait,
we heard of it.

896
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.630
It changes when you change.

897
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:48.440
It has like a million different colors and it changes depending on the light.

898
00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:52.610
Somebody Puts It on myth in 23 posts on the road.
It's awesome.

899
00:52:52.611 --> 00:52:55.100
If you want to let everyone know that you're Puerto Rico and get the one that

900
00:52:55.101 --> 00:52:58.280
beaver has,
that'd be perhaps with the mirrors fucked up.

901
00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.270
Can you you magic dry.
I'm not copping Justin Bieber.

902
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.310
Very nice girl.
I showed you in the mirror card.
His car,

903
00:53:07.311 --> 00:53:12.110
that's all made out of mirrors or eliminate.
I actually enjoyed meeting him.

904
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:16.170
He's a UFC fan.
He likes.
Oh,
you met him in La.
We'll let them in.

905
00:53:16.171 --> 00:53:19.130
The UFC came by and said hi.
That's good.
Very friendly kid.

906
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:21.830
He kiss you on the cheek or the lips.
Neither one.

907
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.190
I met Robin Williams and I didn't know

908
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.790
<v 3>him at Robin.
Whoa,
this is crazy.</v>

909
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:32.000
I did a show at the Improv Friday night and uh,

910
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.190
afterwards me and Joey were hanging out and you know the upper area where you

911
00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:37.680
can eat.
We were hanging out and taking pictures.

912
00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:40.920
So there's a line to get up there to take pictures.
So there's guys in the line,

913
00:53:40.921 --> 00:53:44.400
he gets out to me and he's,
he's talking to me,
complimenting me,

914
00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:48.120
saying these nice things about the shows.
It was fearless and all,
it was really,

915
00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:51.900
he was very complimentary and I was really thankful.
I was like,
wow,
thank you.

916
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:55.140
Thank you very much.
And then I realized,
Holy Shit,
you're Robin Williams.

917
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:59.400
You realize in the middle of him delving in the middle of him talking to me,

918
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:02.670
I didn't know it was Robin Williams.
He had a beard.
He had a white beard on,

919
00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:06.000
he had glasses on and a baseball hat or like some old dude.

920
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.330
He just looked like some dude.
Yeah,
I just,
just some guy with a beard.

921
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:14.240
He was very nice,
but he's a voice threw me off and then I realized he's,

922
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.970
cause he was being kind of soft spoken,
you know,

923
00:54:15.971 --> 00:54:18.930
is there was a lot of people around and he was trying to fly under the radar and

924
00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:21.650
then all of a sudden I'm like,
Holy Shit,
I'm talking to Robin Williams.
Wait,

925
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.350
did he came?
How crazy is that that he came down to meet you?
It was awesome.

926
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:25.980
You know,

927
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.710
I've only had a couple times where something like that has happened and where it

928
00:54:28.711 --> 00:54:29.760
really kind of freaked me out.

929
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000
One of them was a gene Simmons came to our near show reel and he was a great,

930
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:41.310
he was bad to you.
Oh,
he's a fucking cunt to me.
Really,
really bad.
What happened?

931
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:45.780
Top,
top 10 top five worst experience was this was the celebrity.

932
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:47.700
Holy Shit.
What happened?

933
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:51.270
We were doing the show and we were going to interview him and I was like,

934
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.970
I told the producers I was like a fucking,
and the biggest kiss fan I was,

935
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.620
I grew up like any Halloween from the first 10 years of my life.

936
00:54:58.621 --> 00:55:02.250
I was one of the fucking guys from kiss fucking talent show.

937
00:55:02.251 --> 00:55:05.610
I dressed up in my mom's Leotard,
her gay,
his belt,

938
00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:10.410
possible to bike chains and a kiss thing and just jammed out to a party all

939
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:14.150
night long for fucking three minutes,
just jammed out like air guitar.

940
00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:15.960
It fucking loved kiss,

941
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:20.510
literally loved kiss and so and so.
Then we,

942
00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:23.010
I tell them that and they go,
great,
we'll set up the interview.

943
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:24.240
There's going to be fucking cake walk.

944
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:28.240
The only other time I did that the show was when slash was there.
She was like,

945
00:55:28.241 --> 00:55:31.590
I love fucking slash and I got along great with slash we ended up drinking and

946
00:55:31.591 --> 00:55:34.890
my fucking watch McCall call it.
So,
so then,
uh,
so he shows up,

947
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:39.030
tricking him a fucking watch,
McCall and my green room,
my green room.
So,
uh,

948
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:43.890
my dressing room,
so fucking gene him,
he shows up and I'm,
and I go up to,

949
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.470
he's in the room,
I'm going to do the preinterview.

950
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.050
So I go to his dressing room and knocked on the door and they open it and I
said,

951
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:51.900
Mr Timmins,
my name is Bert.
I'm the host of the show,
I'll be doing the interview.

952
00:55:51.901 --> 00:55:56.310
And he just puts his finger in front of my face and he goes,
no.
And I went,
what?

953
00:55:56.311 --> 00:56:00.360
And he goes,
not now.
And he shut the door on my face.
I went,
okay.
I go,

954
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:02.850
clearly it's,
it's early in the morning.
Maybe he's not a morning guy.
That's fine.

955
00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.560
I'm going to give him his time to have coffee or whatever.

956
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.300
And then before I go out on stage,

957
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:09.000
I'll do my pre interview while he's going through makeup.
So,
uh,

958
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:10.351
he's in the getting,

959
00:56:10.351 --> 00:56:13.590
doing his makeup and I come in and now it's like eight o'clock in the morning,

960
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.500
come in and they go,
Mr. Simmons,
money's bird.
I'll be doing the interview.

961
00:56:16.501 --> 00:56:19.890
And he goes,
didn't I tell you not to speak?
And I went,
okay.

962
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:22.800
And then he looked at somebody,
he goes,
is he interviewing me?

963
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:27.010
I don't want him to interview me.
And I went,
oh,
fuck.
Like what did I do?

964
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:29.890
So then I leave.
And then Mark Cronin comes in and he goes,
listen,

965
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:34.900
Jean doesn't want a guy to interview him.
He wants.
Um,
Daphne,
the girl,

966
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:38.650
he wants Daphne to interview him.
I definitely didn't know shit about kiss.
I go,

967
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:41.620
this is my hero.
I can't be on it.
He goes,
here's,
I'll tell you what,

968
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.611
I will let you,

969
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:45.220
you can be on the couch and you can just kind of hang out in the interview and

970
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:48.970
you can jump in as much as possible.
But Daphne's going to run the interview.

971
00:56:48.971 --> 00:56:53.020
Gene would rather Daphne run it.
I went,
okay.
So I go out,
I sit on the couch,

972
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:55.340
I won't say a word now I'm being respectful.
I'm like,
all right,
clearly,

973
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:59.110
whatever it is,
maybe at the end I can just tell him what a big fan of kiss I am.

974
00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:02.410
So I sit on the couch,
Daphne does the interview,
I jumped in here and there.

975
00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:04.720
It's totally comfortable.
Totally cool.

976
00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:08.020
We cut for commercial and everyone that works in the show has headsets on.

977
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:12.700
So and more.
Mike,
we can hear everyone and g in Daphne says,
you know,
gene,
um,

978
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.090
the reason birds out here is he was the biggest kiss fan growing up.

979
00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.130
And gene goes,
really?
And she goes,
yeah,

980
00:57:18.131 --> 00:57:22.720
he dressed is gene said he dressed as you for Halloween.
He and she and I go,

981
00:57:22.721 --> 00:57:25.840
yeah,
as a matter of fact.
And he looks at me,
he goes,
shut up.
I'm talking to her.

982
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:29.020
And I went,
Ooh,
but you're talking about me.
And he goes,

983
00:57:29.021 --> 00:57:32.800
I'm turnaround turnaround and I want it now.

984
00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:37.240
Now I W I go to turn around and I see everyone that's working on the floor of

985
00:57:37.241 --> 00:57:40.780
the AEC show literally turn,
cause they're all have headsets in.

986
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:44.350
They turn and look as I'm turning around,
they're like,
oh my God.

987
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:47.260
So I turn around and Daphne's is just like appalled.

988
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:50.080
And then all of a sudden Cronin comes out of the out of the room and he goes,

989
00:57:50.081 --> 00:57:52.690
you know what?
I think we got it all in the first one and jeans,

990
00:57:52.691 --> 00:57:56.260
like a new to talk about my dog,
but I'm selling.
And he's like,
yeah,
we'll,

991
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.250
we'll bring it up later.
And he goes,

992
00:57:57.251 --> 00:58:00.010
but I have a lot of products I'm trying to sell.
He's like,
we got it.

993
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.470
Thank you Mr. Simmons.
And she gets up and leaves.
And I was like,

994
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.510
what a fucking cunt.
Wow.
What?
And I fucking till the day I die,

995
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.100
I will fucking slam his name.

996
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.090
I've never been treated worse and I've never treated anyone even an eighth.

997
00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.650
I'm not.
Now granted I'm not gene Simmons.

998
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:18.370
I don't get hassled all the fucking time by every rock fan ever.

999
00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:21.760
But like Jim Norton had a horrible story with him when he first met him.
He did.

1000
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:24.610
Yeah.
Jim had a horrible story.
Craig gas has a horrible,

1001
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:27.820
everyone has a horrible story.
And then if you can help him,

1002
00:58:27.821 --> 00:58:32.020
like obviously opion Anthony's is a huge show and Jean realized that he needed

1003
00:58:32.021 --> 00:58:34.300
to have little Jimmy on us.
I don't know what it is,

1004
00:58:34.301 --> 00:58:38.350
but Jimmy now had a good experience with them and their friends.
So,

1005
00:58:38.351 --> 00:58:42.790
but I fucking hated that guy.
Wow.
That sucks to hear that.
It sucks.

1006
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:44.260
Cause I was like such a big fan.
You know,

1007
00:58:44.261 --> 00:58:48.820
you meet slash and slashes literally like the coolest fucking guy.

1008
00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.370
Sit down on the couch.
I go,
hey man,
how are you doing?
He goes,
not good.

1009
00:58:51.371 --> 00:58:55.050
My wife kicked me out last night,
really?
And he goes,
Ya.
And I was like,

1010
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:58.840
and he was like in a Kipp on your food,
those words.
And I like,
Oh,

1011
00:58:58.841 --> 00:59:02.510
if I heard that from slash I'd be like,
dude,
we're drinking.
I said,
please.

1012
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.980
I said to him,
I go,
I got booze in my green room and he goes,
stands up,
let's go.

1013
00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:10.540
And we went with two x classes and start drinking.
And then he says,

1014
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:13.860
and then he gets done this show,
this is the size she goes,
he goes,
uh,

1015
00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:17.070
looks at me.
And he's like,
um,
what,
um,
what,

1016
00:59:17.071 --> 00:59:19.450
so what's your schedule for the rest of the day?
And I'm like,

1017
00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:21.920
and I had that girl,
remember that girl did with cerebral?
She was there.

1018
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:24.410
And I was like,
nothing just cause I got to fly to Europe and a few hours,

1019
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:25.330
but I wouldn't mind him another drink.

1020
00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.550
So we go to my green room and just keep drinking until this carp takes him.

1021
00:59:28.551 --> 00:59:32.990
I was like,
what a fucking great dude.
Oh,
let me tell you what sucks man.

1022
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:35.870
My poisonous snakes at an earthquake,
you know,
like just a fucking,

1023
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.370
he's an awesome fucking guy.
And then you cut the gene Simmons like Joe Montana.

1024
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.770
Amazing.
Fucking remember,
Oh,

1025
00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:48.830
who was the night in Nigeria nightmare.
He was a football player.

1026
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:52.760
I don't know anything.
This is my favorite.
The guy's name,

1027
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:55.430
if you type in the Nigeria nightmare,
Brian,
and you'll come up with his name.

1028
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:57.740
He was a fucking beast.
They took him out of Africa,

1029
00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:02.030
put him in the backfield for the chief,
and he was a monster.
Right?

1030
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:07.790
But he didn't,
his English was always a Coya.
Echolalia he,
he's,

1031
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.590
he's huge.
He's like fucking six,
six,
three 50.
So I tell him,
I go,
uh,

1032
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:16.340
so we do the interview and everyone wants to take pictures and,
and I go,
oh,

1033
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:19.250
I want one too,
but I want one.
We just,
me and you shirtless in my green room.

1034
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.730
And so everyone laughs and he doesn't laugh.
He doesn't get it.
He's like,
oh.

1035
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:26.300
And I was like,
okay.
So everyone laughs,
relief.
I'm walking in my green room.

1036
01:00:26.301 --> 01:00:28.280
All the sudden he's behind me.
And he goes,

1037
01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.550
let's take picture of no shortness in your green room.
And I was like,
oh,

1038
01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:34.970
I'm kidding.
And then he goes,
I got you a funny boy.

1039
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:38.930
I thought I was getting fucking ass rape.
Do you imagine?

1040
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.580
How long do you think you can fight them off?

1041
01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.200
How do we say three 50 wouldn't find them off at all.
I'd be like,

1042
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:48.920
let me just turtle up just turtle.
I was asking the audiences this week,

1043
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:53.720
what would you rather finish in your mouth?
What would you rather,
okay,

1044
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.360
this is my genius bit of material I was working on this week.

1045
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.900
Suck a dude's Dick for 15 minutes like the whole time up until climax and then

1046
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:07.460
you get to pass it off or be the dude that sucks it for that 15 seconds and just

1047
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:10.930
take a load in the mouth.
We just landed on Mars.
We just ended on March part.

1048
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.220
We just have a late late,

1049
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.440
loves the the Mars rover for through fucking space for eight months.

1050
01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:18.790
Landed on Mars or
whatever.

1051
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.870
That's fake Dick.

1052
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:26.230
Or take the load Brian Sec the deck or take it sucked a dick all the way up to

1053
01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:30.720
the climax and then you can pass it off.
So you got to start it off and then or

1054
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:38.090
request when Brian is asking you if something's real,

1055
01:01:38.091 --> 01:01:39.760
that's how dumb.
No,

1056
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:43.520
I mean you obviously would want to get your dick sucked instead of doing the

1057
01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:46.280
site's not in the game,
Brian.
That's not what he said.
Brian,

1058
01:01:46.281 --> 01:01:50.960
you don't even paying attention Brian.
[inaudible]

1059
01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:55.760
barely or is not hot in here dude.
The air conditioning's on.

1060
01:01:55.761 --> 01:02:00.170
I feel it blowing in my space.
I'm still sick.
So changes subject Brody TV show.

1061
01:02:00.171 --> 01:02:04.100
It's fucking amazing isn't it?
Oh it is so fucking good.
It is.

1062
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.200
It is on HBO go.
And I literally,

1063
01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:11.300
it is so good that I watched the pilot pilot ends like the first one ends and

1064
01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:13.800
I'm hooked and I realized that that moment I'm watching every single one.

1065
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:18.140
So why is everyone on the show?
Thank you.
Is,
yeah.
Is that the word?

1066
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:20.910
It's just out there.
It's like,

1067
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:25.380
I think his mom said questions his sexuality and he says,
you know,

1068
01:02:25.381 --> 01:02:26.100
I'm in the checks,

1069
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.910
the checks and at one point he's in his room like talking to the camera and he's

1070
01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:32.610
pulled out a playboy.
You'll see.
Look,
I have a playboy I,
this is what I like.

1071
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.650
So I believe it.
I mean,
I don't,
I never thought he was gay.

1072
01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:37.770
I have always thought that whenever someone has to like really try to convince

1073
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:40.380
you that they're not gay,
they'd probably gay.
I don't,
I don't.

1074
01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.050
I think if you're getting it called by your mom and your sister,

1075
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:44.960
you're just tired of fucking like,
look,

1076
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.660
I think his mom and his sister thinks he's gay,
but he didn't talk to her sister.

1077
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.530
The sister thing.
He's gay because he doesn't have a girlfriend.
She,
I dunno.

1078
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:55.270
She bullies him.
That's a fucking so good.
Jo Jo,
you watch the first episode.

1079
01:02:56.130 --> 01:03:01.110
It's amazing.
It's on,
it's on HBO go and it's on HBO on demand and it's everyone.

1080
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:04.320
I mean,
everyone loves it and everyone watches all six episodes in a row.

1081
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:07.950
You're hooked like fucking loss in the first,
it needs to be longer.

1082
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.340
Beginning one is introducing you to Birdie Stevens pretty much.

1083
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.260
And it's everything you love about Brody,

1084
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:17.820
everything you love and it explaining why Brody's so funny what we like about

1085
01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:22.080
them.
Sarah Silverman and then it ends with his mental breakdown.
And then,

1086
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:26.670
and then the next one is documenting the mental breakdown.
Like Sarah,

1087
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.090
Zack voicemails that he left is that he's fucking,

1088
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:31.620
and then you're going and then you're like,

1089
01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:33.600
where the fuck is this going to go from here?
Like,

1090
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.880
and then it's him coming out of the watchman,

1091
01:03:35.881 --> 01:03:40.030
call it and then it's in going through therapy and like,
like really kind of get,

1092
01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.430
trying to get out and get,

1093
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.020
get some success in and get out and like deal with whatever issues he had in the

1094
01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:50.640
past.
It is so fucking good.
And here's what it really is too.

1095
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:53.250
It's a great representation of Brody cause he's Hilarious,

1096
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:56.250
but he's also very vulnerable.
He's very honest.

1097
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.220
It's so the best introduction that Brody,

1098
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:02.130
and if you did not know who Brody was and you watched that,

1099
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:06.720
you are now a brony fan.
Mps.
It's that good.
What is it called?

1100
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.180
It's called enjoy it.
Brody Stevens and joy.

1101
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:12.240
And if you watched the first two minutes,
you will fucking,

1102
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.140
I got to watch the whole thing.
You can,
you can get like a bunch of them,
right?

1103
01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:17.550
There's six episodes.

1104
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:21.860
It's an HBO is kind of testing this out and hopefully it does great because how

1105
01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:25.710
long are they?
16 minutes eat something like that.
Perfect.
It's so good.

1106
01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:30.270
Have you seen Jerry Seinfeld's comedians in cars getting coffee?

1107
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:32.500
Really interesting man.
It was him,

1108
01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:37.020
the Larry David and it was fun like seeing these two brilliant guys that have

1109
01:04:37.021 --> 01:04:40.170
accomplished like this incredible task creating Seinfeld,

1110
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:44.640
that Sitcom but palling around together in his old Volkswagen like many,

1111
01:04:44.641 --> 01:04:47.160
many years later.
That was really cool.
Yeah,

1112
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:51.330
it was really cool just to have them talk and they're talking about cars and

1113
01:04:51.331 --> 01:04:54.450
Seinfeld's talking about the kind of cars and he likes to drive in different

1114
01:04:54.451 --> 01:04:58.750
cars every time because well he collects cars.
Seinfeld has a flower is,

1115
01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.190
I know where his car collection is.
Shh.
Don't tell anybody,

1116
01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:05.930
but he does call him creepy Brian Torture you.

1117
01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.090
Someones going to kidnap you and torture you just so that you give up the the

1118
01:05:09.091 --> 01:05:12.090
location.
Where do you see this?
It's online.
It's,

1119
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:16.660
I think it's called comedians in cars getting coffee.com.
He has Colin Quinn.

1120
01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:17.980
What a great idea.

1121
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:22.480
<v 0>I did,
uh,
the uh,
laugh factory podcast yesterday with dom Irrera and um,</v>

1122
01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.220
and and uh,
Jamie Masada,
the owner of the laugh factory and uh,

1123
01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:30.430
I said that I got,
that's when I didn't like Jerry Seinfeld,
which is really,

1124
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:34.180
there was a moment in time where I was slightly upset at him just for a half a

1125
01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:36.640
second.
But when I say something like that in the podcast,

1126
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.220
it's really ridiculous because the only reason why I was upset it was when

1127
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:43.660
Kramer got busted and then they were on Letterman and Kramer called in via

1128
01:05:43.661 --> 01:05:46.690
satellite and it was sitting there and people were laughing at some of the

1129
01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:51.040
things he said and,
and Jerry will stop it.
It's not funny.
I was like,
oh,

1130
01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:54.100
come on man.
That's ridiculous.

1131
01:05:54.101 --> 01:05:58.850
I saw I got upset at him for a brief second.
I sent him protecting his friend.

1132
01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:01.960
Yeah,
of course.
Of course.
I understand.
He's uptight.
He need me.
Look,

1133
01:06:01.961 --> 01:06:05.560
the guy doesn't ever talk about sex ever.
If you watch any of his standup,

1134
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:07.990
it's there's nothing sexual,
there's not,
you don't get to know him.

1135
01:06:07.991 --> 01:06:11.020
He's what he is is like a master joke teller.

1136
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:13.780
He's like a master comedian who can essentially,

1137
01:06:13.781 --> 01:06:16.900
he could take any subject and put it through his,

1138
01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:20.350
his professional mind and find the best way to get the funny in it.

1139
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.810
It's that kind of funny is that doesn't appreciate like the kind of like if Stan

1140
01:06:25.811 --> 01:06:28.510
hope was there and it will stand hopes friend that had done that on television,

1141
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.190
he would be laughing with the crowd.
He would be laughing his face.
It'd be red.

1142
01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.680
I could see him,
I could see him just,
you know,

1143
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:40.270
talking ad nauseum about the subject.
But to Jerry Seinfeld,

1144
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.270
he could not see the,

1145
01:06:41.271 --> 01:06:45.910
the humor and the chaos and I think that's silly chaos is there's more humor in

1146
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:48.040
chaos in this country.
Then there isn't anything else.

1147
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:53.250
I've gotten nervous on stage as of late because of the onslaught of technology

1148
01:06:53.711 --> 01:06:56.410
and people recording and people just posting and recording and recording.

1149
01:06:56.411 --> 01:07:00.040
I'm just going to do that.
You just got to accept that.
I ask people,

1150
01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:00.821
if you come to my shows,

1151
01:07:00.821 --> 01:07:03.970
please don't put it up on youtube for a bunch of reasons.
One,

1152
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.360
because I'm working on this stuff,
it's all I'm always working on shit.

1153
01:07:07.361 --> 01:07:09.490
I don't want it to be like,
if it's going to be out on a DVD,

1154
01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:12.790
I want it to be the right style.
I want it to be done.
There it is.

1155
01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.670
So while you're,
you know,
capturing that and then putting it up,

1156
01:07:15.671 --> 01:07:17.380
you're kind of fucking up my process a little bit.

1157
01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.560
Chris Rock said he's going to stop going on stage until they figured out,

1158
01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.790
oh well good luck.
That's silly.
I would never do.
He was saying,

1159
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.310
he was saying that he's not,
he's being facetious.

1160
01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.440
It was an article I read on line,
but he's,
he was saying,
he was like,
you know,

1161
01:07:29.441 --> 01:07:31.690
it really sucks because when people tape it and put it up,

1162
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.720
then that's the representation that the world gets to see.

1163
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.790
And he goes to the evolution of the joke,
you know,

1164
01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:39.730
black black people versus Edwards.
He goes,
we evolution.

1165
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.910
That joke was horrible and there's a lot of times where it just didn't look

1166
01:07:42.911 --> 01:07:45.880
right.
Oh yeah.
And he goes,
and then I got it to the place where it worked.

1167
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.270
And even still,
it's like,
it's like,
uh,
you know,

1168
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.330
once you even get it to where it was works,

1169
01:07:51.331 --> 01:07:54.070
it's not until another six months later that you figure out the right tech,

1170
01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:58.660
you know?
And it's like,
that's the thing that sucks is like fucking,
you know,

1171
01:07:58.661 --> 01:08:01.330
you trying to write a joke and then people video tape and put it up and you're

1172
01:08:01.331 --> 01:08:03.160
like,
I wouldn't fucking done.
Yeah.

1173
01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:06.400
It's also the people can know what your material is before they come to your

1174
01:08:06.401 --> 01:08:08.980
shows.
They'll know,
look,
all this stuff that you're going to do,

1175
01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:13.510
they saw last week show in Calgary or wherever it was.
Yeah.

1176
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.940
But you know what man,
let's just a part of life.

1177
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.360
<v 1>Yeah.
Well this is the new world we live in.
All I can do is just do my best,</v>

1178
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.050
try to write as much as possible,
perform a lot,
stay sharp,

1179
01:08:24.051 --> 01:08:27.980
keep coming up with new shit.
Keep going out there and going at it.
You know,

1180
01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.970
all that other stuff is just whatever it is,
you can't stop it.
You know,

1181
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:34.640
you got to,
when it comes to technology and things like,

1182
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.210
you know when it comes to people filming your art,

1183
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:42.090
you know that you're doing in front of a large group of people and in front of a

1184
01:08:42.091 --> 01:08:44.840
of an audience is people that are going to want to film it.
And it's just,

1185
01:08:44.841 --> 01:08:47.030
that's what they want to do.
It's a part of life.

1186
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.430
I wonder why they want to film it's cause it's,
they're enjoying it.

1187
01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.430
They're a big Bert Kreischer fan.
They come to see you,
man.
They're all excited.

1188
01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:56.090
You know,
if I go to see somebody,
man,
I'll,
I'll fucking think about filming it.

1189
01:08:56.510 --> 01:09:00.080
If I went to see like a really good comic,
Dave Chappelle is doing a set and I,

1190
01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:02.720
and Brian was there and they let Brian put up his camera.
I'm like,
yeah,

1191
01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:05.540
I get a copy of that.
I would love to see that.
I'd love comedy,
man.
Yeah.

1192
01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:10.470
I love comedy,
man.
I like,
well,
I like bootleg recordings of a,

1193
01:09:10.471 --> 01:09:11.660
of bands sometimes.

1194
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:14.310
<v 4>I have the first set that Chappelle did on,
uh,</v>

1195
01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.170
when he came back from being crazy in Africa and still really?
Yeah,

1196
01:09:17.171 --> 01:09:20.650
he did at the comedy store and I got to,
Oh,
you should put that online.

1197
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:24.380
That's so fucking crazy though,
that I automatically was like,
I want to see that.

1198
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.830
I'm like,
and that's all to

1199
01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:31.750
fight you in the ring.
I heard,
oh,
this is really,
that.

1200
01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:34.630
That's from 2008 he knows it.
Yeah.
He never really said that.
Anyway,

1201
01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.990
so somebody just made it up.
He looks at scroll up,
but he's working out,

1202
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.430
but he still smoked cigarettes.
It's sad,
you know,
such a smart guy.
I like Brian.

1203
01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:46.870
Brian enjoys him just with strep throat.
He's in there puffing away.

1204
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:50.380
I didn't have anyone.
I was on strip there.
I had one recently because I was like,

1205
01:09:50.381 --> 01:09:54.910
damn,
I miss the beauty of cigarettes.
The way you would have you would quit.

1206
01:09:55.210 --> 01:09:58.800
Yeah.
Technically.
[inaudible] mk four days.
Yeah.

1207
01:09:58.801 --> 01:10:02.050
So you made through the hard part and you went right back to the amazing thing.

1208
01:10:02.051 --> 01:10:04.720
It's like,
why do you want not want to watch HDTV again?

1209
01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:10.150
What cigarettes are that good to you?
They're awesome.
Cigarettes,
coffee,

1210
01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:13.900
Pussy.
How are cigarettes good for you and what does it do for you?
It just,

1211
01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:17.190
it's just,
it tastes good.
It's relaxing.
It's,

1212
01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.710
it just takes you down a notch when you need to think about something,

1213
01:10:20.711 --> 01:10:23.330
you light a cigarette up and it just kind of puts you in this like little,

1214
01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.280
do you know why nicotine every,
yeah.
Not even that,
just the other stuff,

1215
01:10:27.281 --> 01:10:32.020
but every time you smoke a cigarette there's like a slow count down before you

1216
01:10:32.021 --> 01:10:35.440
need another one,
before your system needs that,
that fix.

1217
01:10:35.441 --> 01:10:38.970
And when it doesn't have that fixed and you get all antsy and that [inaudible]

1218
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.870
just from probably wasn't even manifest itself,

1219
01:10:40.871 --> 01:10:43.840
like really obviously in your everyday life.
Just a little bit more tense,

1220
01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.960
just a little bit weirder,
a little bit,
whatever.
And you're like,
man,

1221
01:10:46.961 --> 01:10:49.510
I need a fucking cigarette.
And so then whatever happens,

1222
01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:51.610
you get some pussy fucking,
you know,

1223
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:54.340
step out of the office for a second and then he hit it.

1224
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:59.260
But everybody has an Ansi shoot.
You just do certain things.
Wow.
That's nuts.

1225
01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.950
Just relaxed me.
No,
it gives you a fixed,
you're a junkie.
Yeah.

1226
01:11:02.951 --> 01:11:06.160
Some people do that.
Take that fixed food.

1227
01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:09.820
Some people take that fix an alcoholic and people think that fix and playing

1228
01:11:09.821 --> 01:11:12.690
pool.
You know you have the Ansi Shit.

1229
01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:20.400
She might've,
I hit the pool hall real quick.
Placing balls,
arguments.

1230
01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:24.360
I've ever heard of that,
but the,
it is not hot in here for you guys.
Not at all.

1231
01:11:24.361 --> 01:11:28.350
I'm drenched on man.
It's coming out of there.
All right,

1232
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:32.610
let me see your arm pit Bert.
Oh,
I sweat naturally.
I'm a sweater.

1233
01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:35.540
Both of you bitches could use the sweat it off a little bit.
Oh,

1234
01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:40.320
sweating for four days.
I'm the most detoxed person right now.

1235
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:44.490
What is it about the cigarettes that keeps you from,
I mean,

1236
01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:47.210
you know it's bad for you.
What is it about it that is it just,

1237
01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:51.810
you just may weigh the risks versus the reward and they were like,
fuck it.

1238
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.550
I like it.
The whole thing,
man.

1239
01:11:53.551 --> 01:11:58.230
I like going out to have a cigarette and talking to the people outside.

1240
01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.270
I like eating a good meal.
It just,

1241
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:02.840
after that you have a fucking cigarette and just,
it just,

1242
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.170
it's like a perfect meant to at dinner.
I,
you know,
with alcoholic,

1243
01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.940
forget about it.
That's just like,

1244
01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:11.460
it's ridiculous how great cigarettes are with alcohol.

1245
01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:14.910
It's like a good pairing with everything and yeah,
I understand.

1246
01:12:14.911 --> 01:12:19.650
It's fucking horrible.
Yeah.
I'm going to get fucking buttle cancer of the lungs,

1247
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:24.420
but I don't care.
Like I know I need to quit.
I know I need to quit,

1248
01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:27.180
but I'm not in a huge rush to quit.

1249
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:32.540
I told you that all of the stuff that you just said you loved that you could

1250
01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:37.890
erase that and never,
no.
Never have smoked.
Never have smoked ever.

1251
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.370
Okay.
What'd you do it or would you still go,
fuck it.
I still,

1252
01:12:41.371 --> 01:12:45.660
I would not believe that there's a thing like that because you can't erase the

1253
01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:48.690
fucking hole.
Nope.
I tell you why I smoked.

1254
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:55.670
I smoked smoke and I'd have no one for it whatsoever.
None.
No.

1255
01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:58.380
It's been a long,
very long time that I'm not smoking a cigarette,

1256
01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.950
but like I'm saying is you will quit and then Wa at soon you will,

1257
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:05.040
all that Shit you love will just disappear and you'll go,
ah,
it's funny,

1258
01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:06.930
I don't miss them.
Like I don't miss them at all.

1259
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.900
So you don't ever ever think like,
oh man,

1260
01:13:09.901 --> 01:13:12.000
that's cigarette actually smells really good or I never do.

1261
01:13:12.001 --> 01:13:13.820
I think of cigarette smells good.
No,

1262
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:16.590
no one thinks of cigarette smells good except the person with it in their mouth.

1263
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:21.600
I know Brian Love the smell of up and down because I swear when Brian didn't

1264
01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.360
smoke cigarettes,
he had a completely different tune.

1265
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:28.710
He would tell you how horrible they were and how the smell of it makes him sick.

1266
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.900
I can't believe he was ever so stupid that he smoked and he feels so much better

1267
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.260
and he can think better and it's like it's not.

1268
01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:39.180
I have this constant worry about when the next cigarette is coming,

1269
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.440
second loaning and an android device and bragging about it.
Yes,
I understand.

1270
01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:46.500
I used to be like that.
And then you got back to cigarettes.
Now you're like,

1271
01:13:46.501 --> 01:13:50.850
cigarettes are the most awesome thing in the world.
Rural they make,

1272
01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.570
I'll tell you what,
the only,
the only thing is they make a long car ride.
Doable.

1273
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:58.320
Oh,
car rides.
You know what makes a long car ride doable?
This shit right here.

1274
01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:02.880
Podcasting.
Oh fuck.
Yeah.
This is where this is design.

1275
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:05.100
That's why we don't do them live folks.
People go,

1276
01:14:05.101 --> 01:14:06.810
you guys should have a live podcast.
You know,

1277
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.530
knowing that would be if we were alive and your car and giant comedy club,

1278
01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.130
those things are life.

1279
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.470
<v 0>The only way life,</v>

1280
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:18.070
the only way a live podcast and would it be cool is if the live part was

1281
01:14:18.071 --> 01:14:20.440
interactive.
Don Did it right.

1282
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:24.910
Dawn Barris sitting a live podcast successfully on his big 10 or big free

1283
01:14:24.911 --> 01:14:29.110
podcast.
He did it in front of the studio audience.
He did two episodes.

1284
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.110
It was more like he puts on a show though.
It was beautiful.
Yeah.
He's,

1285
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.570
it's more like his isn't like a standard podcasts like the way we would have,

1286
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:38.670
like if we did this in front of a live audience,

1287
01:14:38.671 --> 01:14:41.590
we probably wouldn't be the best buck.
But what I was thinking is,

1288
01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:45.850
I think would it be a great idea though is to have an interactive one have like

1289
01:14:45.851 --> 01:14:50.851
a question and answer sort of a podcast that would be easy to do and people

1290
01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.720
enjoy that and people,
we could put that online and people would enjoy that.

1291
01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.760
And that would be actually a fun thing.

1292
01:14:57.790 --> 01:15:02.740
And if we did it on a night at a comedy club,
we could do some stand up too.

1293
01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.330
You know,
we could all go do a set first.
I'll do like a short set,
you know,

1294
01:15:07.331 --> 01:15:09.280
maybe everybody does like 15,
20 minutes.

1295
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:12.580
So the first hour of it plus is just comedy.

1296
01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.540
And then we'll do a little Q and.
A.
We're all of us get on like,

1297
01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:18.970
like we did at the end of my comedy special in Atlanta.

1298
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:23.740
Everybody came onstage in Atlanta.
Joey was up there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we all,

1299
01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:25.090
um,
Duncan was up there.

1300
01:15:25.091 --> 01:15:28.510
We all talk to the audience and the audience got to ask us questions,

1301
01:15:28.511 --> 01:15:30.040
what kind of questions do they ask?
So that's like

1302
01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:39.100
a lot of the questions are silly.
One of them was a guy,
a guy who uh,

1303
01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:41.960
want to challenge me about the moon landing.
Who would,

1304
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:45.730
when Brock versus a flotation tank,
by the way,
ladies and gentlemen,

1305
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:49.720
did you see the,
the rover and that was really sweet.
Actually,

1306
01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:53.320
I don't not believe that we went to the moon.
People confused on my stance.

1307
01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:58.980
I've altered it several times.
So there was some confusion.
My current stances,

1308
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:00.310
uh,
don't,

1309
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.840
I do not believe that we didn't go to the moon and I'm not convinced that we

1310
01:16:04.841 --> 01:16:08.700
went,
that's what I think I'm not going to send out.

1311
01:16:08.701 --> 01:16:11.440
Would never say we didn't go.
Okay.
Cause I don't know if we went,

1312
01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:15.160
but I'm not convinced we went.
No,
I'm not 100% convinced.

1313
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.730
It sounds so stupid.
I know it sounds stupid,

1314
01:16:18.731 --> 01:16:21.790
but I think might've been possible.

1315
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:26.530
It's more interesting that you don't believe it because you do that with almost

1316
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:29.380
everything.
You want to believe the opposite.

1317
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:33.520
We want to know.
I wanted to be honest,

1318
01:16:33.521 --> 01:16:36.220
like when it comes to like big foot and Ufo is,
believe me,
dude,

1319
01:16:36.221 --> 01:16:40.060
nobody wants to believe in bigfoot or Ufo is more than me.
Nobody does,

1320
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:44.620
but I look at it and long ago I am not buying it.
I'm not buying it.

1321
01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:47.800
I'm not about especially not buying Ufos.
I just look at it.

1322
01:16:47.801 --> 01:16:50.140
I look at the people that are talking about it and I go,

1323
01:16:50.141 --> 01:16:53.110
I think there was some fuckery afoot.

1324
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.440
I think that there's a lot of people that are seeing government aircraft so that

1325
01:16:56.441 --> 01:16:58.690
they don't understand a lot of stealth technology,

1326
01:16:58.691 --> 01:17:02.410
a lot of new drones and all kinds of shit that the government's been working on

1327
01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:04.150
forever.
I think there's a lot of it.
Is that,

1328
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:09.380
do I rule out the possibility that somewhere someone in our past has seen a

1329
01:17:09.381 --> 01:17:10.070
spaceship from

1330
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.680
<v 1>another dimension or another world?
No,
definitely not,</v>

1331
01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:15.530
but there's too many sightings.
I'm not buying it.
I don't.

1332
01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:18.680
I think most of it is crazy people.
You know,

1333
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:22.820
if you a certain amount of any story you hear from people,

1334
01:17:22.821 --> 01:17:26.240
any fantastical story that just gets distributed through the internet or the

1335
01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:29.060
news or whatever,
a huge percentage of that has got to be crazy.

1336
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:32.270
People that want attention because it's so easy to get attention.

1337
01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.030
And if you're the type of person that wants to fake something,

1338
01:17:35.031 --> 01:17:37.600
what are you gonna do?
You can make crop circles.
You can make a,

1339
01:17:37.601 --> 01:17:42.230
a fake UFO photos for a long time.
The crop circles were real.
And then that one,

1340
01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.840
they did that video where the guy proved he could do it in the night.

1341
01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:46.580
The only problem,

1342
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:50.090
the only problem with those crop circles is the ones that they can do.

1343
01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.880
They pale in comparison to some of the ones that are unexplained.
Yeah.

1344
01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:55.930
Cause they had the kick ass people don't want to talk to,

1345
01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:59.810
not just that there's something that happens to the,
the nodes of the plant.

1346
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.420
They explode out like with engineering and chemical.

1347
01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:04.070
Well it looks like a microwave.
They actually,

1348
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.330
what I was gonna say is there was a show where they,
uh,

1349
01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.560
some kids from MIT I believes from MIT or Harvard,

1350
01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:14.740
a recreated all of the situations that happen inside of a crop circle.

1351
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:18.110
They did it inside of four hours.
They did it at night,

1352
01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.840
they did it with night vision.
They put together a pretty,

1353
01:18:20.841 --> 01:18:23.840
it wasn't the most complex,
but it was a pretty cool one.

1354
01:18:23.841 --> 01:18:27.020
It was a cool crop circle that mimicked the,
uh,

1355
01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:30.490
one of their science buildings on their campus.
And um,

1356
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:34.310
they actually figured out a way to a,
there's a little iron fragments,

1357
01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:35.480
like almost microscopic,

1358
01:18:35.481 --> 01:18:40.190
like balls of iron melted iron that people have found inside the crop circles.

1359
01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:43.070
They recreated that.
They looked at that and they said,
well,

1360
01:18:43.071 --> 01:18:46.910
maybe this is evidence that some sort of a massive microwave technology was

1361
01:18:46.911 --> 01:18:50.480
being used and it cooked the ground and the iron in the ground was turning these

1362
01:18:50.481 --> 01:18:53.090
hot little metal beads.
There was like that was,

1363
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:56.210
or there's some sort of a reaction to it that was one of the thoughts and maybe

1364
01:18:56.250 --> 01:19:00.950
they killed,
they connected that to the growth nodes to the fact that these,
uh,

1365
01:19:00.951 --> 01:19:03.620
these nodes had explode.
But these kids,

1366
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:07.760
these students were able to recreate all of the,
um,

1367
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:11.000
the different characteristics.
They were,
they made the growth nodes.

1368
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:12.890
They had a microwave thing that they would blast.

1369
01:19:12.891 --> 01:19:15.590
He was wearing like a crazy radiation suit and shit.
It was pretty nuts.

1370
01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:19.550
What a long extension cord attached to a generator and they're microwaving all

1371
01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:20.384
the,
the wheat.

1372
01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:23.210
And then when they microwaved the weed at some of it popped and blew out,

1373
01:19:23.211 --> 01:19:26.770
just like those growth nodes.
So they recreated that.
They,
um,

1374
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:31.550
they had this like this fire a gun that they would spray this,

1375
01:19:31.551 --> 01:19:33.020
um,
this,
uh,

1376
01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:38.150
carbon into and it would be like trying to make these little iron,
you know,

1377
01:19:38.151 --> 01:19:42.470
molten iron,
iron pellets.
And they recreated it.
They recreated these,

1378
01:19:42.471 --> 01:19:45.200
I like,
I think it was like iron or something like that.

1379
01:19:45.201 --> 01:19:48.920
I forget what it was there.
There was,
there were shooting through this,
uh,

1380
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:52.850
this blast of fire.
And then they eventually did it with a bomb.

1381
01:19:52.851 --> 01:19:57.710
They put the iron ore in a bomb and they blew a bomb up sky high in the middle

1382
01:19:57.711 --> 01:19:58.310
of the field.

1383
01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:01.900
All of these are ridiculous because that's not how the people who did it could

1384
01:20:01.901 --> 01:20:04.730
have done it because otherwise people are gonna see this fucking torch in the

1385
01:20:04.731 --> 01:20:05.564
middle of their field.

1386
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:08.010
They're going to hear the bomb go in the middle of their field.

1387
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:13.010
So it doesn't explain it well enough for it to be reasonable for the iron

1388
01:20:13.801 --> 01:20:17.550
particles.
But the other thing was the expulsion,

1389
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.850
the explosion of these nodes and these plants,

1390
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:22.890
they can only do it in a couple of plants,

1391
01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.400
whereas in these larger crop circles that are more complex,

1392
01:20:26.401 --> 01:20:29.790
it seems like it's much more,
much more prevalent.

1393
01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:32.790
So the real question is how do they do in those things?

1394
01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:34.680
And there's a lot of people that believe,

1395
01:20:34.681 --> 01:20:38.730
and it might really be not a bad idea or not a bad thought,

1396
01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:43.650
is that this is just some technology that is not public,

1397
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:47.760
that there's a way to make a geometric pattern in a field of wheat with some

1398
01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:51.450
sort of a laser that's attached to a satellite that's in the sky and then it can

1399
01:20:51.451 --> 01:20:55.170
shoot down and cut into the ground like this,
this,

1400
01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:57.930
this thing that it can microwave these plants and flatten them out.

1401
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.360
It sounds ridiculous,
but so does the Internet.

1402
01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:02.370
You know everything sounds ridiculous.

1403
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:07.380
I had a guy from the CDC and my show in Atlanta and what does the CDC Center for

1404
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.590
Disease Control and he was,
he had me convinced,
I'm telling you,

1405
01:21:10.591 --> 01:21:14.910
convinced that the government created aids to guild gays and blacks.

1406
01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:18.720
Well,
he's an idiot.
Convince.
Yeah,
that's ridiculous.

1407
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:23.310
There's be people that say that our silly,
you don't,
that is a study so silly.

1408
01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:26.910
The thing you think that the government is trying to kill off gays and black

1409
01:21:26.911 --> 01:21:29.460
people.
Well they're doing a real shit job of it.
Okay.

1410
01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:32.160
Gay People in black harder everywhere.

1411
01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.790
It is true.
Maybe it is true.
Maybe that's why the government,

1412
01:21:38.791 --> 01:21:41.730
because the government fucks up everything,
right?
They fuck up everything.

1413
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:44.220
So now trying to wipe out gays and blacks,

1414
01:21:44.221 --> 01:21:47.610
they've actually increased their numbers.
10 fold.
So stupid.

1415
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:51.750
It's so stupid.
We're just trying to kill off the poor.

1416
01:21:51.751 --> 01:21:54.360
People know poor people are dying because they're sick.
You crazy fuck.

1417
01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:55.221
And when the,
you know the,

1418
01:21:55.221 --> 01:22:00.000
the standard for calling someone like the real problem with Aids in Africa,

1419
01:22:00.001 --> 01:22:04.440
everyone's like aids Africa.
Everyone has aids in Africa.
Yeah,
but you know what?

1420
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:06.630
You know what AIDS is.
AIDS means you're fucking immune.

1421
01:22:06.631 --> 01:22:09.210
System has crashed and there's a bunch of reasons for that.

1422
01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:13.760
And one of them is the lack of nutrition those people have,
but it's not HIV.
Oh,

1423
01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:17.400
a lot of it isn't man.
When you attach aids to the same,

1424
01:22:17.401 --> 01:22:20.580
like when you call it all the same thing,
it's not all the same thing,
man.

1425
01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:23.460
That the aids of the,
the crushing of the immune cells,

1426
01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.250
the immune system that these Africans are experiencing.

1427
01:22:26.251 --> 01:22:30.150
It may or may not be HIV related,
but they're not testing them all for HIV.

1428
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:32.940
When they come up these statistics,
they're seeing people with AIDS,

1429
01:22:32.941 --> 01:22:35.370
they're seeing people are wasting away and they know what the fuck is going on.

1430
01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:40.260
But I guarantee you that a percentage of that it's gotta be nutrition.

1431
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:43.710
I have a large percentage.
I thought I,
that's crazy.
I thought it was,

1432
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.440
I thought everyone just had aids.
Like no,
it becomes a salty sea.

1433
01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:49.950
It becomes a social issue and it becomes something like if you want to donate

1434
01:22:49.951 --> 01:22:53.520
money to aids research,
that is like,
you know,
that's like real,
that's real.

1435
01:22:53.610 --> 01:22:54.990
But if you want to donate money to,

1436
01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:57.690
there's these people that aren't eating and they're getting really sick.
Oh,

1437
01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:00.960
they don't even know what disease.
Oh,
I'm gonna Save my money for a disease.

1438
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:05.210
You know,
it's all dizzy.
Anything,
you know,
if you could have fucking bulemia,

1439
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:10.090
that's a disease dis ease.
You're not at ease.
You're a fucking mess.
You know,

1440
01:23:10.091 --> 01:23:12.220
and these poor people in Africa,

1441
01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:14.500
what you're dealing with is a bunch of different factors.

1442
01:23:14.501 --> 01:23:18.820
I'm sure some of them are getting HIV too and whether or not HIV causes AIDS.

1443
01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.100
Is that Peter Duesberg guy screws scares of fucking Shit Outta Ya.

1444
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:27.210
Cause he's a biologist at the University of California Berkeley.
And look,
I'm a,

1445
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:32.100
I have no understanding of biology diseases,
how they work,

1446
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:35.110
how they in a,
you know,
a retro viruses.
I don't understand any of that stuff.

1447
01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:35.800
Right.

1448
01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:39.070
So when I listened to a guy like that talk and say that he doesn't believe that

1449
01:23:39.071 --> 01:23:41.920
HIV causes AIDS and he thinks that aids is a bunch of different,

1450
01:23:41.921 --> 01:23:43.770
it's ridiculous shit.
It sounds like it is.
Right.

1451
01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:46.860
<v 4>That's just like you and you're always accountable when you were a kid that</v>

1452
01:23:46.861 --> 01:23:49.870
people lie to you a lot.
Like every single person lied to you.
Right.

1453
01:23:50.190 --> 01:23:54.120
<v 1>I'm really good at spotting liars because I get lied to a lot.
Yeah,
sure.</v>

1454
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:57.180
Like your dad was mine.
I was around a bunch of idiots.

1455
01:23:57.530 --> 01:24:00.990
That's about a bunch of crazy violent idiots when I was a little kid.

1456
01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:06.150
So I at an early age was forced to like look at everything for myself.

1457
01:24:06.451 --> 01:24:09.000
I couldn't trust that guy.
I thought he was cool.

1458
01:24:09.001 --> 01:24:11.040
I thought he was my dad until he started hitting my mom.

1459
01:24:11.041 --> 01:24:13.920
I couldn't trust that guy cause even though it's my grandfather who was trying

1460
01:24:13.921 --> 01:24:17.990
to fuck my mom in front of me.
Yeah,
I remember that when I was a little kid,

1461
01:24:17.991 --> 01:24:22.290
like my mother was shitting running away from my dad's dad because he was trying

1462
01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:24.780
to grab her and he's trying to grab her pussy in front of me.

1463
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.460
I was real little.
I was like four or five,

1464
01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:33.390
but it was one of those deigning memories like where he's chasing her around

1465
01:24:33.391 --> 01:24:36.060
like a counter or something like that and I would just,

1466
01:24:36.061 --> 01:24:39.210
it just creeped me the fuck out man.
Is your mom's still alive?
Yeah.

1467
01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.420
Where's she live?
I don't want to tell you.

1468
01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:45.550
<v 4>Hey,
so I got,
I got something that I need to tell you guys.</v>

1469
01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:47.020
You guys need to get this done.

1470
01:24:47.050 --> 01:24:50.020
My mom doesn't let me talking about her on the podcast or you need to get this

1471
01:24:50.021 --> 01:24:52.900
done,
Joe.
You definitely talking about my mom,
dude.

1472
01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:57.370
I know it's changing it for a little respect for me to talk about her.

1473
01:24:57.610 --> 01:25:00.110
She'd be like,
bring me up.
What do you want to say?
Uh,

1474
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.110
when I had my aids outbreak this weekend,

1475
01:25:02.111 --> 01:25:05.320
I went was at the doctor and they put that thing in your ear to like look

1476
01:25:05.321 --> 01:25:08.980
through and make your ears.
I don't know why they didn't see your ears,
but uh,

1477
01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.220
they,
they were like,
dude,
your,
your earwax is really bad.

1478
01:25:12.221 --> 01:25:14.380
I can't even see her eardrum.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1479
01:25:14.381 --> 01:25:17.110
Please tell me you're pulling up a video on the Internet of cleaning out of

1480
01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:20.470
yours.
No,
no,
no.
I just saw that the other day.
Right.
Well,
he's just telling you,

1481
01:25:20.471 --> 01:25:23.530
he's about to tell you that.
Just did it.
Uh,
so,
so they're like,
you know,

1482
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:24.790
that's bad.
And I'm like,
yeah,
I know.

1483
01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:28.630
I actually always have to try to clean my ears out with hydrogen peroxide and

1484
01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:31.180
always doing the Q tip thing.
And she's like,
no,
no,
that's,
it.

1485
01:25:31.181 --> 01:25:34.870
Just pushes it in it.
It does nothing that you need to come back here,
here,

1486
01:25:34.871 --> 01:25:36.520
pour this in your ears tonight,

1487
01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:40.300
and then pour it in this one in your ear in the morning and come back to me and

1488
01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:43.450
like a day or two.
And I'm like,
okay.
And so I go home,

1489
01:25:43.451 --> 01:25:47.020
I poured this shit in my ear and then the next day I put it in my other ear,

1490
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:49.960
whatever.
And I go there and she puts this like what?

1491
01:25:49.961 --> 01:25:54.700
It was a like heavy duty waterpik in my ear.
And she pushes it in.

1492
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:58.520
And at first you're like,
it doesn't hurt.
It kind of vibrates.

1493
01:25:58.521 --> 01:26:01.740
So it's kind of uncomfortable,
but it doesn't hurt.
And uh,

1494
01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:06.050
Sh and you're holding up this little jar next to your ear.
And then she goes,

1495
01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:09.290
oh my God,
that I've never seen that.
That came all out in one chunk.

1496
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:10.910
And then I'm like,
what?

1497
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:15.890
And I look at it and the water's Brown and there was like a chunk of wax the

1498
01:26:15.891 --> 01:26:20.750
size of like a half dollar and like just amazing.
It was amazing.

1499
01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:24.500
Half dollars bigger than you.
It was a humongous,

1500
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:29.060
and she said that my whole ear canal is filled with wax.
Wow.
And,

1501
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:32.240
and what happens is she's like,
there's two different kinds of earwax.

1502
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.690
There's ones that's kind of like a honey and there's one that's kind of like a

1503
01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:38.210
prune and she's like,
you have the prune kind,

1504
01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:42.290
which like builds and builds and it stays kind of like a hard things.

1505
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:44.750
You never even know it's there.
It just makes it your canal.

1506
01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:46.400
You've got to get the number of the slowly,

1507
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:48.620
well this is just a minute clinic and cvs,

1508
01:26:48.621 --> 01:26:51.300
which I don't know if you know what those,
you wanted to cvs to get this done.
No,

1509
01:26:51.301 --> 01:26:55.190
no.
I found this dude.
So anyways,
I did my other ear,
it was twice as bad anyways.

1510
01:26:55.191 --> 01:27:00.191
And now I have HD hearing like seriously two or three times better hearing than

1511
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:02.330
than I was.
They're like,
wow.
People,
she's like,

1512
01:27:02.331 --> 01:27:05.200
people think like they have this thing after they get done their word,

1513
01:27:05.201 --> 01:27:07.460
they call it like,
oh I have dog hearing now.
And I'm like,

1514
01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:10.700
that's what it feels like.
I feel like I,
I've been like,

1515
01:27:10.701 --> 01:27:15.080
I did pop my ears for 10 years.
So have you seen the videos?

1516
01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:20.740
That's why they have certain sounds that they put around a certain buildings

1517
01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:25.340
that only kids can hear and it's like annoying to keep kids away,
right?
Yeah.

1518
01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:29.060
There's a frequency that young kids can hear that we can't hear anymore.
Really?

1519
01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:31.300
I heard about that.
I heard about that.

1520
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:34.550
There's a ring tone do you can get for your phone that does that frequency that

1521
01:27:34.551 --> 01:27:37.220
only kids so your parents can hear when you hear that you're getting texts.

1522
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:38.740
That's hilarious.

1523
01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:42.470
What is interrupt their say so because I had something to say about that.

1524
01:27:42.471 --> 01:27:44.300
What you were saying.
Where is it very fast.

1525
01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.740
Remember I was just saying the story and I was like,
oh wait very fast.
Anyways,

1526
01:27:48.741 --> 01:27:52.610
the HD
ear thing when you interrupt with it your thing,

1527
01:27:52.611 --> 01:27:55.640
we were talking about my mom.
No,
no,
no.
I mean during my ears story,
Burt,

1528
01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.370
you said something right at the very end and it made me speed up the end but I

1529
01:27:58.371 --> 01:28:01.730
wanted it to,
we lost against marijuana.

1530
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:07.130
Definitely.
I definitely got an minute clinics.
I went to minute clinic.

1531
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:10.130
Did you know this?
Cvs has these things you just go in,

1532
01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:13.220
it could be like typing your name.
This woman goes,
alright,
ready to see you.

1533
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:17.090
You come and be like,
Hey,
I got strep throat and she's let me check.
Yeah you do.

1534
01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.860
Here's your medicine prescription by,

1535
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:23.560
and you don't have to do any of the doctors shit anymore.
So I've,

1536
01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:28.390
I just go to these minute doctor who diagnosed,
well it's,
it's a,

1537
01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:32.540
uh,
a nurse or,
yeah.

1538
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:37.130
And so they know enough for most things,
like most common colds,
strep throat,

1539
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:37.993
whatever.
Bullshit.

1540
01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:41.510
But so now I just go all the time because it's covered by insurance also.

1541
01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:45.590
Even if it wasn't something like 60 or $70 and you just go there and be like,

1542
01:28:45.591 --> 01:28:47.800
I think I have strep.
And she's like,
you open your mouth.
She goes,

1543
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:49.670
you probably do.
Yeah you do.

1544
01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.920
And then you just go next door and drop off your prescription.

1545
01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:54.500
You're in and out in like an hour.
There's no wait.

1546
01:28:54.570 --> 01:28:56.630
You know where they learned that from?
The oxycontin clinics.

1547
01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.640
So Florida pain management,

1548
01:28:58.670 --> 01:29:01.620
pain management is a lot of fucking money and pain management.
Well,

1549
01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:02.010
this is a lot of

1550
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.620
<v 0>money in prescribing all kinds of different medications.</v>

1551
01:29:04.621 --> 01:29:08.280
Anytime you can get a line of people that need some pills and you could sell him

1552
01:29:08.281 --> 01:29:10.920
some pills,
you just have to have a doctor that it's willing to write,

1553
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:14.100
scribble some shit on some paper and you're golden.
They've got,

1554
01:29:14.101 --> 01:29:15.450
my buddy is doing that now.

1555
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:20.040
They created a group of doctors who do house calls but do house calls over the

1556
01:29:20.041 --> 01:29:23.730
phone and so you basically,
it's like,
it's like,
look,

1557
01:29:23.731 --> 01:29:26.550
the majority of prescriptions are for antibiotics,
so listen,
I've got a cold.

1558
01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:29.490
I know I need fucking antibiotics.
Can you prescribe me anything?

1559
01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:32.900
Take antibiotics every time we get a call.
No,
I don't take anything good for you.

1560
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:34.770
I'll take a fucking thing.
That's how I test.

1561
01:29:34.771 --> 01:29:39.270
It's an old Mitch Hedberg is how I testify.
Bates.
See if I'm alive in five days.

1562
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:42.600
I've gotten sick,
sick,
sick too.
I had to do it with strap,

1563
01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:47.010
but I usually don't either.
Well,
I have that if I got the flu,

1564
01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:51.600
the flu,
I've taken medicine.
I take that,
uh,
Tamiflu taking that stuff.

1565
01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:56.550
It's very good when you,
right after you get the flu,
like within,

1566
01:29:56.790 --> 01:30:00.120
what are you doing?
Sticking things into my,
for soaking up the sweat.

1567
01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:04.620
But that Tamiflu stuff's very effective.
If you catch it like really quick.

1568
01:30:04.890 --> 01:30:08.000
What do you guys talk about when you're not doing a podcast?
We don't talk much.

1569
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:08.843
We try not to tell it.

1570
01:30:10.770 --> 01:30:14.790
He called me the other day and I wanted to tell him about this ear shit,

1571
01:30:14.791 --> 01:30:17.550
but we're like,
yeah,
we're like,
stop talking.
And it's like,

1572
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:18.840
what's the point of talking?
I was like,

1573
01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.770
we have to only talk about like the podcast that we just did.
Like,

1574
01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:26.040
Hi guys yesterday.
Yeah,
we'll talk.
That's what we're talking about.

1575
01:30:26.041 --> 01:30:29.830
We're talking about what went good,
what didn't go so good.
Fine.

1576
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:34.440
How did you not videotape them cleaning out your ear?
Uh,
I was thinking of it.

1577
01:30:34.441 --> 01:30:39.090
Yeah,
it was really disgusting.
Even though your ear at cvs.
Yeah,

1578
01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:42.690
I'll go tomorrow.
I want to get my,
have a little closet.

1579
01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:45.030
There's not every cvs minute clinic,

1580
01:30:45.031 --> 01:30:47.760
but if you go to like minute clinic.com or whatever or cvs,

1581
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:52.300
but they have like a little room about the size of a little small office and you

1582
01:30:52.301 --> 01:30:56.820
just go in and they do it all right there.
It's super cheap,
super convenient.

1583
01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:00.390
I love it and I've got a really nice people.
I got a clinic one time,

1584
01:31:00.391 --> 01:31:04.320
nothing was fucking amazing.
Speaking about health.
Okay.

1585
01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:07.140
I tried the bacon and eggs diet in the morning,

1586
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:10.320
big and eggs and coffee and I tried the Kale Shit.

1587
01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:14.970
That's why it looks a rib bone and I'm back to the Kale shake.
Unfortunately.

1588
01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:18.370
The reality is that bacon and eggs,
when you,

1589
01:31:18.371 --> 01:31:21.570
you have the bacon and eggs and coffee breakfast,
Robb Wolf,

1590
01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:25.000
the guy wrote the Paleo solution to try for a month though.

1591
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:28.710
Is that what he said?
Yeah.
Try for a month and then let me know how you feel.

1592
01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:33.030
Really.
I tried it for a little while.
Digestive juices.

1593
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:38.490
It's very different operation for a Kale shake than it is for bacon and eggs and

1594
01:31:38.521 --> 01:31:42.750
the amount of energy have,
like when I have a Kale shake,
I don't feel hungry,

1595
01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:46.050
but I have energy.
It's a very weird thing and I'm not,

1596
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.860
it's not like I'm struggling to process the food that's in my body.

1597
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:53.480
It's super easy to process because it's dirty,
Vitamix down.

1598
01:31:53.481 --> 01:31:57.480
It's already blended the fuck up.
It does not taste that good.
It doesn't,

1599
01:31:57.630 --> 01:32:00.490
it tastes okay.
But for the health benefits,

1600
01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:04.390
<v 1>I take that shit in the morning and I feel fucking great and I've tried the</v>

1601
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:07.990
other way.
I try,
listen,
nobody likes fucking bacon and eggs more than me.

1602
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:11.740
I love it.
I like bacon and eggs with hot sauce.
That's what I like to do.

1603
01:32:11.741 --> 01:32:13.330
Throw a little salt and pepper on them.

1604
01:32:13.331 --> 01:32:16.720
Fucking sunny side up eggs and give me some fucking hot sauce.

1605
01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:20.380
I'll eat the shit out of some bacon and eggs and I fucking love Bacon.

1606
01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.680
When he was talking about cooking Bacon for two hours,
my dick got hard.

1607
01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:29.050
But the reality for me is that I find that I think I,

1608
01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:34.090
I feel personally like I need some animal protein.
I try,

1609
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:36.760
I've tried like to go vegan before I've tried to go just to,

1610
01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:41.290
for experimental purposes.
I get it.
I fucking miss meat,
man.
I miss it.

1611
01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:44.380
Especially after I lift weights or anything.
Rick really strenuous.

1612
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:48.790
My body wants a meat and uh,
I'm not really big fan of cows,
you know,

1613
01:32:48.791 --> 01:32:52.180
I wish they were treated better,
you know,
I would rather eat game.

1614
01:32:52.181 --> 01:32:55.000
I'd rather eat wild things that were running around their whole life and then

1615
01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:56.410
got blasted out of nowhere.

1616
01:32:56.620 --> 01:33:01.090
I think that's like the most humane and the smartest way for us to approach it.

1617
01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.310
Like,
I really think Ted Nugent's got it nailed.

1618
01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:06.850
That guy lives on a fucking giant ranch and he kills animals every day.

1619
01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.570
He goes and he sits up in a tree stand and he waits and he shoots a fucking deer

1620
01:33:10.571 --> 01:33:13.390
with a bow and Arrow and that's what they eat for dinner.
It takes it home.

1621
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:16.660
It's got,
you know,
yeah,
he's got a whole fucking set up up there.
I mean,

1622
01:33:16.661 --> 01:33:21.660
it's amazing and so good for you too.
You know,
it's so good for you.
But I'm,

1623
01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:26.200
when I look at like what makes me feel the healthiest,
um,
I've tried,

1624
01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:30.100
I've tried the bacon and eggs in the morning and although it's fucking fantastic

1625
01:33:30.101 --> 01:33:33.790
and delicious as shit,
I don't feel as good as when I,
uh,

1626
01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:37.510
when I have the Kale shakes,
cal shakes,
just give me more energy.

1627
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:39.760
I'm not struggling to digest it.

1628
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:44.790
There's a difference between the digestion feeling of the bacon and eggs by the

1629
01:33:44.951 --> 01:33:47.530
way,
are pretty goddamn light.
You could choose some eggs down.

1630
01:33:47.531 --> 01:33:51.580
You could have like three sunny side up eggs with like very little butter and it

1631
01:33:51.581 --> 01:33:55.480
really nothing.
You know,
it's like,
it's really light if you,
uh,
if you,
um,

1632
01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:59.620
poach them,
they're fucking fantastic,
fantastic.
Really,
really light.

1633
01:33:59.621 --> 01:34:02.080
But what are you producing to jail shake that it tastes like sugar is mine.

1634
01:34:02.081 --> 01:34:05.820
Taste amazing,
but like it's from,
you know,

1635
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:10.870
a little bit of that.
Um,
I just put the standard ingredients,
celery,

1636
01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:14.770
cucumber,
Kale,
and then I,
I'm,
I'm always have garlic,

1637
01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:18.340
raw garlic and ginger and coconut oil.

1638
01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:22.840
Robb Wolf says you just put coconut oil so it helps your body to absorb the

1639
01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:25.270
nutrients in the Kale shakes when you add a little fat to it.

1640
01:34:26.190 --> 01:34:29.980
And then coconut oil is a really healthy fat to have anyway.
Super good for you.

1641
01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.980
It's like juicy fruit.
They're the fucking amazing.

1642
01:34:32.981 --> 01:34:36.760
What are you putting in that half a banana?
Half a pair of half an orange,
uh,

1643
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:40.870
um,
Kale,
hemp,
hulled grapes.

1644
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:45.950
So yours is more like a fruit smoothie.
You can smooth it.
Definitely.
And um,

1645
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:48.940
and I wonder because when I was drinking them,
I wasn't losing a ton of weight.

1646
01:34:48.941 --> 01:34:51.500
I was plateaued hardcore.
It's a lot of calories.
It's big.
It's a lot.

1647
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.260
There's a lot of us have a dick load of calories.

1648
01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:57.190
Well there's also all that other stuff is,
it's got a lot of sugar in it know.

1649
01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:58.010
And even though it's

1650
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.170
<v 0>fruit sugar,
it's sugar,
natural sugars from fruit,</v>

1651
01:35:00.171 --> 01:35:03.260
it's better for you than standard sugar.
You know,
like,
you know,

1652
01:35:03.261 --> 01:35:06.860
processed sugar was still really shouldn't have that much probably all the time.

1653
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:11.330
You know,
I think that your body aches for Greens.
Fruits are very good,

1654
01:35:11.331 --> 01:35:11.871
very important,

1655
01:35:11.871 --> 01:35:16.670
especially after training after training like fruits tastes fucking delicious.

1656
01:35:17.150 --> 01:35:20.160
Oh you have a nice delicious pair.
Fdlr workout.

1657
01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:25.190
Amazings of the best herbs to Donald Rollins.
We were doing this show.

1658
01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.310
This TV's over for what you want to call it for comedy central.

1659
01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:33.470
And L is like Donald grew up in the hood.
He's a respectful,

1660
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:35.750
he wouldn't dress it in gay shit cause he was like,
Nah,

1661
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:38.120
my boys will see that shit and I'll never let that shit down.

1662
01:35:38.121 --> 01:35:41.360
I'm not going to be like no gay.
I'm not,
you know that's Danelle.
So done.

1663
01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:44.420
They'll get him in trouble.
No,
Donald would say that on this podcast.

1664
01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:48.500
Darnell were out in the middle of the desert doing a photo shoot for comedy

1665
01:35:48.501 --> 01:35:51.020
central.
It's hot as fuck.
We're all dusty.

1666
01:35:51.021 --> 01:35:56.021
And they bring out a huge bowl of watermelon and Don Ellis just fucking couldn't

1667
01:35:56.121 --> 01:35:58.400
bring himself to eat the watermelon cause he's like,
Nah,

1668
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:59.740
I'm not going to fucking do that.

1669
01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:02.690
I'm not going to eat watermelon in front of a bunch of white people.

1670
01:36:02.691 --> 01:36:07.000
That's so silly.
So funny.
Cause it's such a weird thing that watermelon thing,

1671
01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:08.990
watermelon and chicken are both delicious.

1672
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:12.290
He implied that black people enjoy watermelon and chicken.

1673
01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:16.640
All of a sudden you're a racist.
I'm implying you enjoy delicious foods too,

1674
01:36:16.641 --> 01:36:18.500
by the way.
Maybe the best foods ever.

1675
01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:22.460
Really good fried chicken is fucking fantastic.

1676
01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.970
If you get like some serious like Roscoe's chicken and Waffles,
fried chicken,

1677
01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:30.320
you go to Roscoe's.
Oh fuck.
We go to Roscoe's.
Yes.
Goddamn Roscoe's is good.

1678
01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:31.550
The waffles are fucking me.

1679
01:36:31.551 --> 01:36:36.050
Even better than the waffles are sensational and the fucking chicken is perfect.

1680
01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:40.520
It's,
it's fucking get some good tasting food and watermelon when you're hot and

1681
01:36:40.521 --> 01:36:42.860
thirsty is the most satisfying fruit ever.

1682
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:45.860
How could anybody be upset that you're talking about them?

1683
01:36:45.861 --> 01:36:48.290
Like in chicken and waffles and chicken and watermelon?

1684
01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:52.200
I don't know where that came in.
Why that would be.
Everyone likes I should there.

1685
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:55.940
It's weird.
You know chickens at one point in time or a luxury item.

1686
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.290
That's why I like one of the presidents,

1687
01:36:57.291 --> 01:37:00.170
I think it was Roosevelt promised a chicken in every pot.

1688
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:03.830
You know the chicken was a,
the more preferred animals.

1689
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:07.760
Harder to get it was a beef was more common.
The reason they pried it.

1690
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:12.380
The reason is that it traveled.
Well that'd be Friday.
It could last.

1691
01:37:12.710 --> 01:37:13.281
Oh really?
Yeah.

1692
01:37:13.281 --> 01:37:15.800
That was why that was why the fried chicken was a big southern thing.

1693
01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:18.850
Cause you could travel with it.
How long will it last?
If you fry it,

1694
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:24.350
it lasts forever.
If you put it in the fridge,
I'm guessing more than one meal.

1695
01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:27.740
So this was a,
they used to have to roll the dice with food back then.

1696
01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:31.760
Right when they make food they probably were a grill careful with like leftovers

1697
01:37:31.761 --> 01:37:33.800
and shit.
Once we figured out leftovers.

1698
01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:37.370
It's really interesting cause that's how sort of society was created.

1699
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.510
If you stop and look,

1700
01:37:38.511 --> 01:37:41.180
first of all we figured out how to get all our shit and put it together.

1701
01:37:41.181 --> 01:37:45.050
We figured out agriculture and we figured out how to get everything in one
place.

1702
01:37:45.051 --> 01:37:48.620
So we built cities,
you know,
and then you have resources you have,
you know,

1703
01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:51.260
have everything's all stock piled up,
you know,

1704
01:37:51.261 --> 01:37:56.261
and then it gets to where if where we're at today,

1705
01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:02.360
it's like now we figured out a way to stock pile pretty much everything and even

1706
01:38:03.241 --> 01:38:04.440
food in your house,

1707
01:38:04.530 --> 01:38:07.530
like you can eat it and cook it and then you store it away in the freezer.

1708
01:38:07.530 --> 01:38:10.680
So it's like you're stockpiling.
Yeah.
You know?
And that,

1709
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:15.510
that's something you couldn't do when you were just walking around outside

1710
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:19.320
trying to hunt for food everyday.
It's hard keeping vegetables,

1711
01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:22.860
but vegetables think how quick vegetables go bad.
They never,

1712
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:26.130
and then they all ripe at once and you're like,
fuck everyone,

1713
01:38:26.131 --> 01:38:27.880
let's start eating cucumbers.
All he could do,

1714
01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:30.960
you got to eat them as quick as you can.
And then in the winter you're fucked.

1715
01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.750
If there's an apocalypse,
the,
you know,

1716
01:38:33.751 --> 01:38:36.510
the number one animal to get that will sustain you and your entire family.

1717
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:41.190
What rabbit rabbits on this fucking dude preparers.
You know,

1718
01:38:41.191 --> 01:38:44.770
you can starve from eating rabbits.
It's like a type of a,

1719
01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:49.830
a lack of fat to your diet.
You can,
you can literally starve.
You can,

1720
01:38:49.831 --> 01:38:51.360
you know.
Sure enough nutrients.
Yeah.

1721
01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:55.320
If if say if you will like trap somewhere and all you had to eat was rabbits for

1722
01:38:55.321 --> 01:38:58.060
like a month,
you might starve to death just eating just those rabbits.

1723
01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:01.520
So they said this guy said,
he said it's wrong.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
Well I'm,

1724
01:39:01.521 --> 01:39:02.970
I'm pretty sure it's true.
There's Garcia,

1725
01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.890
they reproduce so quickly that within a year you've,
you're fucking crop is huge.

1726
01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:10.260
Well the thing is you would have to eat other things as well.
Yeah.

1727
01:39:10.261 --> 01:39:11.610
Rabbit starvation.
It's true.

1728
01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:16.050
That's from rabbit starvation or the eating of others is skinny meet who wrote

1729
01:39:16.051 --> 01:39:17.700
that though?
Bugs.
No Bro,

1730
01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:22.110
this isn't a fucking Wikipedia with scientific statements.
I was really,

1731
01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:23.820
it was really,

1732
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:28.470
it's a form of acute malnutrition caused by excess consumption of any lean meat

1733
01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:31.770
coupled with a lack of other sources of nutrients,

1734
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:35.700
usually in combination with other stressors such as severe cold or dry

1735
01:39:35.701 --> 01:39:40.350
environment.
So if it's a severely drug it desert or really dry environment,

1736
01:39:40.351 --> 01:39:41.930
you can eat rabbits and stuff.
It does.

1737
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:47.310
Dick symptoms include diarrhea,
headache,
fatigue.

1738
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:51.780
That's everyday for Brian.
You're dying of rabid poisoned son.

1739
01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:56.250
Hate to tell you this.
Yeah.
Isn't that amazing?
That's why you need fat.

1740
01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:59.820
Your body needs fat.
It's very important.
We got real weird with all this low fat,

1741
01:39:59.821 --> 01:40:03.960
this low fat that we need fat.
There's a lot of like avocado.

1742
01:40:03.961 --> 01:40:07.260
This isn't like a healthy fats you can get from plants if you're not into eating

1743
01:40:07.261 --> 01:40:10.360
animals,
but you need some fucking fat,
your body,
you need a lube up those joints,

1744
01:40:10.361 --> 01:40:14.470
bitch.
I'll just want protein and some vegetables.
That's my fucking diet.

1745
01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:19.060
Tuesdays,
steak.
That's what's up.
That's what's up.
Vegans,
you don't know I,

1746
01:40:19.061 --> 01:40:21.660
I'm down with all your food.
You know you guys make some delicious,

1747
01:40:21.661 --> 01:40:26.370
nutritious and very healthy food.
However it can't fuck with a robot.

1748
01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:30.280
You cannot fuck with a ribeye over mesquite.
Bone mets.

1749
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:34.530
He fuck ass son.
When we say Bonin,
fuck yes.

1750
01:40:35.130 --> 01:40:39.720
No better feeling than the smell.
What's wrong with you?

1751
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:43.620
How could you run away from it?
Fuck a cow.
They would eat.

1752
01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:45.660
They would eat you if you were made out of grass.

1753
01:40:45.661 --> 01:40:48.390
They would eat the fucking shit out of you.
They don't care about your,

1754
01:40:48.391 --> 01:40:51.750
they're dumb as hell.
He should not torture them for sure.
Absolutely.

1755
01:40:51.751 --> 01:40:54.010
I think the factory farming is cruel.
I'd

1756
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.080
<v 1>be much willing,
more willing to pay more for a,</v>

1757
01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:01.960
a burger that comes from sustainable farms where they're doing it organically

1758
01:41:01.961 --> 01:41:05.170
and that you know,
humanely kill the cow when it comes time to do it.

1759
01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:10.120
I would much rather do that,
but cows are here to be all right.
Don't get crazy.

1760
01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:14.140
Steak is God damn delicious and if we didn't kill cows,

1761
01:41:14.141 --> 01:41:16.060
we're going to have to fucking run around neutering them.

1762
01:41:16.061 --> 01:41:19.060
Then we're going to have to figure out some way to stop them from fucking,

1763
01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:20.980
we're going to have to,
we're going to have a regular environment.

1764
01:41:20.981 --> 01:41:23.230
We're going to have to separate the bowl from the cows and then what?

1765
01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:27.640
We just let those cows not breed and starve to death or do we manage this

1766
01:41:27.641 --> 01:41:30.640
involved would do left us animal go extinct because we're not going to eat it

1767
01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:34.240
anymore because those are the options or mountain lions on the streets.

1768
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.070
Those are your options.
What's your options?

1769
01:41:36.071 --> 01:41:39.800
We bring fucking tigers into North America.
There's a lot of asphalt,

1770
01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:43.550
which you really,
yeah,
cause I think would make people nicer.
The capacity.

1771
01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:47.530
Pasadena.
There's bears in Pasadena again.
Again,

1772
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:50.100
think about are they're swimming and everyone's pools now.

1773
01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.960
Like all these bears are going cause it's so hot and Pasadena to go.

1774
01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:54.820
Well they're coming down from big bear.

1775
01:41:54.821 --> 01:41:57.440
They're coming down from a lake arrowhead and big bigger,

1776
01:41:57.441 --> 01:41:59.980
but it's like a weekly thing now and they pretty much just said,
yeah,

1777
01:41:59.981 --> 01:42:01.450
this is going to happen.
It's really hot.

1778
01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.300
They time to go bear hunting in the backyard.
That's what I say.

1779
01:42:04.770 --> 01:42:08.170
I mean bear that's in my yard can suck my dick.
I'm going to shoot him.

1780
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:12.940
I'm not calling conservation.
I have,
I have a big tickets to lady Gaga.

1781
01:42:12.941 --> 01:42:15.880
I was trouble.
You could get in trouble.
If I don't give a fuck,

1782
01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:18.950
I don't give a fuck.
Maybe I have to pay a fine bear.

1783
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.060
That bear needs to be shot and killed.
Do I really mean this?
Let,
no,

1784
01:42:22.061 --> 01:42:25.420
I probably called him.
I'm just fucking around.
Call animal control.

1785
01:42:25.421 --> 01:42:28.720
I would like definitely bring my kids and say this is what a bear looks like and

1786
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:31.210
I would have definitely have a gun on me,
you know,

1787
01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:35.620
in case they tried to get into the house.
Do you have a shotgun?
Dude,

1788
01:42:35.621 --> 01:42:40.490
I got a lot of shit.
Really don't fuck with him.
We shot machine guns,
man.

1789
01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:44.920
I want to show,
have you seen the videos of all the this uh,
by the way,

1790
01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:49.340
I'm in no way do we make light of any of the recent gun shooting tragedies that

1791
01:42:49.341 --> 01:42:51.280
have been going on when you discuss guns,

1792
01:42:51.281 --> 01:42:52.780
I think that's sort of the elephant in the room.

1793
01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:54.970
You have to bring up all these different tragedies that are going on.

1794
01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:59.860
There's a Sikh temple thing is so horrific,
man,
if you never met seeks before,

1795
01:42:59.890 --> 01:43:02.770
they are some of the nicest,
most peaceful people.

1796
01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:06.700
And they're saying that someone confused him.
Some white supremacists,

1797
01:43:06.701 --> 01:43:10.210
dude confused them with Muslims and he was a,
you know,
an idiot.

1798
01:43:10.211 --> 01:43:13.840
And so I had 11 gun kidding.
You had a messed up.
He was a veteran.
He's probably,

1799
01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:18.280
you know,
had PTSD.
So anyway,
he goes in and shoots up this place.

1800
01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:22.900
But there's videos and this is where it gets really crazy of these people that

1801
01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:23.930
are,
um,

1802
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:28.600
from the temple who we're talking to reporters and they're talking about

1803
01:43:28.601 --> 01:43:30.850
multiple gunmen.
They said there were three other guys.

1804
01:43:30.851 --> 01:43:33.940
They kept saying there's three other guys.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I didn't see that.

1805
01:43:33.970 --> 01:43:38.320
Pull it up here.
I'll,
I'll tell you what the video is.
Eddie Bravo,
uh,

1806
01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:41.720
tweeted it
when Eddie Bravo tweets things.

1807
01:43:41.721 --> 01:43:46.721
So you gotta go.com is cloud collection must be,

1808
01:43:48.670 --> 01:43:51.820
oh,
he knows when they're spraying.
So you say that

1809
01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:52.971
<v 0>they're spraying,</v>

1810
01:43:52.971 --> 01:43:56.930
he knows when they're spraying all the reason I know about chem trails.

1811
01:43:57.610 --> 01:44:00.740
Yeah.
He's,
he's a beautiful person.

1812
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:04.700
I talk about chem trails all the time when people was like,
really?
And I go,
yeah,

1813
01:44:04.701 --> 01:44:06.860
yeah.
And I never knew where it came from.
It's from Eddie Bravo.

1814
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:10.970
He believes that Shit,
man,
he believes it.
But it'd be crazy if he was right.

1815
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:16.940
Let me find this man.
Give me a second.
So this guy was so stupid that he missed,

1816
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:21.110
he can confuse Sikhs with the terrorists.
I think so.

1817
01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:24.860
I think he's just doesn't like how they look and act like they turbans and the

1818
01:44:24.861 --> 01:44:27.910
hair.
Cause I mean during these interviews,
so that's the,

1819
01:44:28.190 --> 01:44:30.740
you could tell dumb people look at that and be like,
those are terrorists.

1820
01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:35.450
People who look at that and go,
yeah,
look at that.
But that's fucking ridiculous.

1821
01:44:35.730 --> 01:44:36.021
Yeah.

1822
01:44:36.021 --> 01:44:40.880
That's the standard story with this story is as much more fantastical.

1823
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:45.080
Okay.
This is the,
this is the video.
Go to seek massacre,

1824
01:44:45.230 --> 01:44:50.230
s I k h massacre and then colon.

1825
01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:55.970
That's the two dots.
One on top of the other.
Oh,
why would you do that?

1826
01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:58.580
Eye Witness testimony?

1827
01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:06.540
I use two hands or silly bitch testimony contradicts official story.

1828
01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:10.520
Well,
it's not ridiculous.
These people are saying,

1829
01:45:10.521 --> 01:45:13.790
and this is where it gets interesting is because these people were saying that

1830
01:45:13.791 --> 01:45:17.630
they were there and they saw more than one gunman and it could mean they were an

1831
01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:20.840
absolute abject terror and they hallucinated.

1832
01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:24.320
But the fact that so many of them hallucinated you know,

1833
01:45:24.321 --> 01:45:27.500
when you're in a period of intense,
traumatic situation like that,

1834
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:30.650
it is possible that one person could say that.

1835
01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:33.590
It would no one in the Colorado massacres said anything more than they did.

1836
01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:37.370
Yes they did.
Yeah they did.
Yeah,
that's it.
Click,

1837
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:39.583
click on that.

1838
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:46.950
<v 7>My dad is out at the hospital and we're just relaying information back and</v>

1839
01:45:47.471 --> 01:45:50.920
forth.
I'm trying to get as much info as possible.

1840
01:45:52.410 --> 01:45:57.410
Have you learned from him about what transpired inside or from your mother?

1841
01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:00.340
The most I can learn,

1842
01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:05.710
the most I know as he now is that there were multiple shooters.

1843
01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:10.520
There's multiple people.
It was a very well coordinated.

1844
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:16.050
It wasn't haphazard and I think that's why uh,

1845
01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:21.370
police and everybody are taking the proper protocol to get the situation under

1846
01:46:22.421 --> 01:46:23.250
control,

1847
01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:26.470
not trying to jeopardize anything and describe what's happening currently.

1848
01:46:26.471 --> 01:46:30.670
But as far as your mother,
she was at the time that we spoke at one point hiding,

1849
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:31.663
um,
had,

1850
01:46:31.810 --> 01:46:35.860
did she give you any sense for how many people at that time at least we're

1851
01:46:35.861 --> 01:46:38.510
hiding the sense over there.

1852
01:46:38.511 --> 01:46:40.990
It was when she started hiding in the closet.

1853
01:46:41.290 --> 01:46:45.150
She didn't know how many people were out there,
so she just got,

1854
01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.400
so that's one of them.

1855
01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:50.090
<v 0>That's the wrong one.
But this is what I want you to,
that you</v>

1856
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:54.150
<v 4>to this one.
I hit what did,
no,
no,
that's not it.
I said,
just go to youtube.</v>

1857
01:46:54.151 --> 01:46:56.150
There's all these videos.
I know,
but just go.
Just trust me.

1858
01:46:56.190 --> 01:46:59.100
Go to youtube and get this video because this is a really good one.

1859
01:46:59.101 --> 01:47:01.800
It's a great compilation,
but that right there had,

1860
01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:04.440
he said something very important in that video.
What he say?

1861
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:09.500
He said that there was multiple shooters and my mom didn't know before she hid

1862
01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:14.610
how many shooters or was she made to the conclusion that there was multiple

1863
01:47:14.611 --> 01:47:17.250
shooters after she hit.
Okay.
I don't know what you're talking about,

1864
01:47:17.251 --> 01:47:20.250
but go pull this.
Just pull this up.
Seek s I k h

1865
01:47:20.610 --> 01:47:25.410
<v 1>massacre
massacre m a s S,
a,
Z,</v>

1866
01:47:26.010 --> 01:47:28.920
and seek massacre.
An eye witness testimony.

1867
01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:34.043
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1868
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:37.580
<v 1>Testimony contradicts</v>

1869
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.843
cts.

1870
01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:42.353
<v 7>Yes.</v>

1871
01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:48.750
<v 1>Yeah,
that's it.
The second one down.
All right.
Oh,
second one.
Yeah,
that's it.</v>

1872
01:47:48.751 --> 01:47:50.160
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Okay.

1873
01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:53.820
Now listen to this because this is a,

1874
01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:58.290
<v 8>we now know this is the Guttman who opened fire inside that sick Tampa in</v>

1875
01:47:58.291 --> 01:47:59.124
military

1876
01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:02.400
<v 7>shooters and that they are Caucasian descent.</v>

1877
01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:07.450
<v 4>All right,
that just so you know,
that guy I just explained,
that's called wait,</v>

1878
01:48:07.710 --> 01:48:10.490
hold up.
Stop it Brian.
That is not complete bullshit.

1879
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:14.670
You are relaying a man's discussion that his own mother said to him,

1880
01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:17.130
I don't know if it's total bullshit.
It's too much.

1881
01:48:17.131 --> 01:48:20.910
Trent chain down the information.
When he said,
know what he said though?

1882
01:48:20.911 --> 01:48:22.590
He said something very,
very important.

1883
01:48:22.770 --> 01:48:27.770
His mom had no idea how many shooters or was until after she hit your right.

1884
01:48:28.141 --> 01:48:31.740
So,
so she's hidden and she came to the conclusion there was multiple shooters.

1885
01:48:31.770 --> 01:48:36.090
That's what he said.
But he's relaying what his mom said.
That shit gets very far.

1886
01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:40.040
He's on the phone with her.
He says,
but he's relaying what she said.
You know,

1887
01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:43.830
unless you're talking to her and she says that you don't know why the fuck she

1888
01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:46.200
thought there might be something else to the reason why she thought there was

1889
01:48:46.201 --> 01:48:48.960
multiple shooters.
There might be more than one reason they might've seen it.

1890
01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:50.900
This video is only focusing on

1891
01:48:51.530 --> 01:48:52.363
<v 1>play this</v>

1892
01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.620
<v 7>or multiple shooters.
There's multiple people.</v>

1893
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:59.040
It was a very well coordinated.

1894
01:49:00.110 --> 01:49:01.890
It wasn't haphazard

1895
01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:06.340
white males who Gus darkly,
uh,

1896
01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:11.350
just all black clothing came in and opened fire on the,
uh,
uh,

1897
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:15.200
our congregation.
Well,

1898
01:49:15.201 --> 01:49:17.120
my mom's hiding in the sponsoring our,
she's,

1899
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:19.720
she's hyper scared and saying that the people are still in there.

1900
01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:22.780
<v 4>I don't know how many some people went inside</v>

1901
01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:28.770
the people judge and they did a bunch of suits.

1902
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.930
<v 8>Lisa,</v>

1903
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:33.400
one wonder the wounded man said an unknown number of government had walked into

1904
01:49:33.401 --> 01:49:35.830
the kitchen of the Sikh temple and open fire.

1905
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:38.080
The man who said his father had been wounded,

1906
01:49:38.081 --> 01:49:40.360
reported that there had been multiple gunmen.

1907
01:49:40.930 --> 01:49:44.770
We now know this is the Guttman who opened fire inside that sick Tampa in

1908
01:49:44.771 --> 01:49:48.250
military vet.
Uh,
you know what?
We are really apparently

1909
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:53.200
<v 9>as lone wolf terrorism and what we need to do is change the way in which people</v>

1910
01:49:53.201 --> 01:49:55.090
think about guns,
especially young people.

1911
01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:59.500
We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into

1912
01:49:59.501 --> 01:50:04.210
thinking about guns in a vastly different way and just really brainwash people

1913
01:50:04.211 --> 01:50:07.090
into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.

1914
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.520
<v 10>Okay.</v>

1915
01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.680
<v 1>See,
that's why it's weird.
It wasn't just one guy.</v>

1916
01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.500
That's why I was trying to tell you to let it play.
Right.

1917
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.280
The one guy's really ain't some shit from his mom in there,
it sounds like.
Well,

1918
01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:21.220
yeah,
and the other woman was in there.
She saw more than one person.

1919
01:50:21.221 --> 01:50:22.630
Everybody was saying it's more than one person.

1920
01:50:22.631 --> 01:50:25.450
Does that mean there was more than one person?
No,
it doesn't.

1921
01:50:25.451 --> 01:50:26.320
Because I'll tell you,

1922
01:50:26.321 --> 01:50:29.200
if you've ever been inside of any sort of a chaotic situation,

1923
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:30.880
people lose their shit.

1924
01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.760
And a lot of times people don't know exactly what's going on.

1925
01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:36.460
They're on survival mode.
They're on fight or flight mode.

1926
01:50:36.610 --> 01:50:37.900
When adrenaline takes over,

1927
01:50:37.901 --> 01:50:40.480
people go into a tunnel and they don't know what the fuck is going on.

1928
01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:44.020
And if you know one person starts saying there's more than one gunman,

1929
01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:47.980
the you need just need one person to say it and then boom,
you'll,
you'll,

1930
01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.040
everybody will be repeated is also ex military,
is that what they said?

1931
01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:52.450
So that could be another thing.

1932
01:50:52.451 --> 01:50:56.680
If these were all military guys and they grabbed the other three are,

1933
01:50:56.681 --> 01:50:58.480
you know what it could be,
you know,
who knows?

1934
01:50:58.481 --> 01:51:01.240
It might be some militia and they kidnap the other three and you know they're

1935
01:51:01.241 --> 01:51:04.690
going to let them go because they have a fucking cop somewhere.
Who knows?
Man,

1936
01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:08.980
you know,
I don't know if there was four people or just one person in there.
I,

1937
01:51:08.981 --> 01:51:10.600
you know,
I don't know if it was really just a,

1938
01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:14.530
but that's the sad thing is is these people died and if,

1939
01:51:14.531 --> 01:51:17.140
if it really was some sort of a white supremacist group,

1940
01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:20.740
these people are the nicest people ever.
Sikhs.
Sikhs,
first of all,

1941
01:51:20.741 --> 01:51:23.190
they eat marijuana.
It's part of their religion.
Yeah.

1942
01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:26.170
They have some like crazy yogurt drink.
They have some,

1943
01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:29.620
the fuck they are with shit will blow you through the fucking center of the

1944
01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:32.860
universe.
If you just cook it,
do it.
It's like a yogurt.

1945
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:36.070
It's like a marijuana yoga.
I mean they do it to get high.
It's,
yeah,

1946
01:51:36.071 --> 01:51:39.130
it's a part of their religion.
That's awesome.
Fuck yeah.
I,

1947
01:51:39.610 --> 01:51:42.430
I run into a lot of Sikhs in Canada.
They come to a lot of shows,

1948
01:51:42.431 --> 01:51:43.450
especially in Toronto.

1949
01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:46.780
They are some of the nicest fucking coolest people you'll ever meet.

1950
01:51:46.930 --> 01:51:51.040
But people are thrown off because we see a guy in a turban,
we assume Muslim,

1951
01:51:51.041 --> 01:51:55.480
we assumed they hate us.
Seeks Love the western way of starting a Muslim.
No,

1952
01:51:55.481 --> 01:51:57.250
they're not nuts.
Totally different.
They're very,

1953
01:51:57.430 --> 01:52:00.500
not only that didn't really open about having their,
um,

1954
01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:04.720
I think there a type of Buddhas.
Wait a minute.
I think seekers,
the religion.
Yeah.

1955
01:52:04.721 --> 01:52:08.820
What is it?
It's an Indian Sikh is,
okay,

1956
01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:11.890
let's find out because I've met a lot of them and then they,

1957
01:52:11.891 --> 01:52:15.610
they seem to be some really nice people.
And so when I,
when I see this,

1958
01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:19.180
it's just a,
it's a,
it's a monotheistic religion.

1959
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:23.170
Founded in the 15th century in the Punjab region,

1960
01:52:24.230 --> 01:52:27.940
continue to progress for tendons.
Successive Sikh Gurus.

1961
01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:32.560
Sikhs are expected to embody the qualities of a sense subpar.

1962
01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:34.270
A saint soldier,

1963
01:52:34.570 --> 01:52:39.570
one must have control over one's internal vices and be able to be constantly

1964
01:52:39.611 --> 01:52:40.690
immersed in virtues.

1965
01:52:40.691 --> 01:52:45.691
Clarified in new Guru Granth Shah heap the principle belief of the seek our

1966
01:52:46.131 --> 01:52:51.131
faith in the y guru represented by the phase.

1967
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:55.110
While it was weird,
I don't even know what all these extra dots are.
Yeah,

1968
01:52:55.140 --> 01:53:00.140
I'll try this it on tar tar meaning one God along with praxis in which the Sikh

1969
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:03.591
is in,

1970
01:53:03.591 --> 01:53:08.450
joined in to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all

1971
01:53:08.451 --> 01:53:11.840
human beings.
This sounds like the most beautiful religion ever.
Peaceful.
Yeah.

1972
01:53:11.841 --> 01:53:13.460
Seek advocate advocates.

1973
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:17.780
The pursuit of salvation in a social context through the congressional pack

1974
01:53:17.781 --> 01:53:21.230
practice of meditation of the name and message of God.

1975
01:53:21.231 --> 01:53:25.520
The follows of seek are ordained to follow the teachings of the tenancy gurus or

1976
01:53:25.521 --> 01:53:30.521
enlightened leaders as well as the holy scripture and titled The the Goof grants

1977
01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:33.980
or heap Granth Sahib Ji,

1978
01:53:33.981 --> 01:53:36.890
which along with the writings of the six seat,
he is getting a little wordy.

1979
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:38.960
I think we figured out that the conspiracy though,

1980
01:53:38.961 --> 01:53:41.720
they're all fucking high on marijuana and they're seeing multiple people.

1981
01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:45.050
I'll tell you what.
Well that's actually a good point.
That's a very good point.

1982
01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:46.130
If they were in the,

1983
01:53:46.170 --> 01:53:51.020
there are actually high stir fry in their ceremony.
Yes.

1984
01:53:51.021 --> 01:53:51.620
Yeah.
That

1985
01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:55.010
<v 3>makes 100% really good point.
When I was a kid,
we,</v>

1986
01:53:55.310 --> 01:54:00.310
me and my buddy and his mom took a boat across our lake to go watch a party and

1987
01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:03.780
these I have to leave.
Yeah.
I guess I have to leave soon.
And uh,

1988
01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:06.680
these kids started throwing oranges at us.

1989
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.020
It was like the most traumatic thing that ever happened to me and that at that

1990
01:54:09.021 --> 01:54:11.000
time,
cause it was the middle of the night and gene Simmons or less than.

1991
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:12.580
So it was before gene Simmons.

1992
01:54:12.581 --> 01:54:15.030
Do you think gene Simmons going to reach out to you after this call?
Kim.
Wow.

1993
01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:20.120
Let them try.
He was nice to me when I met him twice.
Sure.
It was nice.

1994
01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:25.350
Uh,
in 2000,
2000,
2000.
Yeah.

1995
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:28.940
So he changed in the last 12 years.
Would you give him at a break?
I'll be,
yeah,

1996
01:54:28.941 --> 01:54:31.950
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what kind of my show.
I'm not gonna.

1997
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:35.270
I won't have any,
would you have him in your man cave and do a podcast with him?

1998
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:39.020
Yeah.
Oh,
and a fucking,
he'll do that for his reality show.
It'd be a good episode.

1999
01:54:39.021 --> 01:54:43.270
The guy got a facelift on TV as well.
Yeah.
He got a fresh face.
His what?

2000
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:46.790
In his rider.
Everyone's got shit in the rider and his writer,

2001
01:54:46.791 --> 01:54:49.640
he has to come in and see the lighting before the day before.

2002
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:52.820
So he came over to the studio the day before and just check the lighting and had

2003
01:54:52.821 --> 01:54:55.660
his own lighting guy come in and Redo the lighting.
Wow.
Yeah.

2004
01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:58.440
Why would you care about the lighting?
Cause his hair,
I think.
Uh,

2005
01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:01.560
so he wants to make sure it's not,
it's not dropping down.

2006
01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:03.920
You're dropping right down on his head light.
So it's super soft.

2007
01:55:03.921 --> 01:55:06.490
Everyone looked good in that episode.
I'll be under a soft.

2008
01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:07.850
Do you know why they do riders?

2009
01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:13.010
Why the concept of a rider is there initially.
So like,
so like,

2010
01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:14.000
uh,
was it,

2011
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.350
was it guns and roses or van Halen had the ridiculous rider where they had only

2012
01:55:18.351 --> 01:55:21.110
brown m and.
M's,
they want an m and m's and the thing,
but it's only brown.

2013
01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:24.170
Which band was it?
Uh,
I don't fucking know.
Joe.
Come on.
Don't pick me apart.

2014
01:55:25.930 --> 01:55:27.980
You're just so,
uh,

2015
01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:31.190
but the reason they did it is because they had a bunch of pyrotechnics.

2016
01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:35.660
So the idea was if they're not paying attention to the smallest thing,

2017
01:55:36.110 --> 01:55:39.690
then they're not paying attention to anything.
So that's why they put right.

2018
01:55:39.710 --> 01:55:43.590
Ridiculous things and riders so that the,
the artists knew.
All right,

2019
01:55:43.591 --> 01:55:44.160
this is a top

2020
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:47.210
<v 0>notch show.
So that was the whole concept of writers.</v>

2021
01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:49.380
I thought that was fascinating.
That is fascinating.

2022
01:55:49.450 --> 01:55:52.410
I think it's more like they're spoiled cuts and they want fucking brown m and

2023
01:55:52.411 --> 01:55:55.920
some people do.
Some people are some given anything in your writer.
I'm like,

2024
01:55:55.921 --> 01:55:58.470
I think they have to bring water.
No.

2025
01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:03.390
Heineken's water and bottle of red wine,
bottle of red wine,
throat coat,
honey,

2026
01:56:03.450 --> 01:56:04.890
throat coat,
honey,
coffee

2027
01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:13.430
sharpies.
Sharpies.
Yeah,
you're right.
That's exactly right.

2028
01:56:14.190 --> 01:56:18.360
Turkey or any kind of mixed meat's going to have some meat and fruit.

2029
01:56:18.361 --> 01:56:21.080
We had a fruit fruit to fuck.
I have nothing in my ride.

2030
01:56:21.110 --> 01:56:23.700
I get a ride or sign you don't want.
It's important.
It's important.

2031
01:56:23.701 --> 01:56:28.701
Red Ball rolling with Joey fucking Diaz and if you don't ever want Joey hungry,

2032
01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:31.950
you want to have some food around for him to make a quick sandwich so Joey can

2033
01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:35.540
slap a fuck.
He'll be right about to go onstage and he's got a fucking handle it.

2034
01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:38.210
When we got here,
we've got some fucking,
Jeez Dude,

2035
01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:41.400
he is the most requested comic.
When I go on the road,
he's an animal.

2036
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:43.350
They're like,
well,
should we do is come in here and I'm like,

2037
01:56:43.351 --> 01:56:46.980
I have no fucking idea.
I don't poke his dates.
I played this for everybody.

2038
01:56:46.981 --> 01:56:49.620
The video of him I played after the podcast.

2039
01:56:49.621 --> 01:56:53.190
I've already played it on the podcast form of him going on stage in New York and

2040
01:56:53.191 --> 01:56:57.090
it's like a minute and a half of people screaming before he goes on stage.

2041
01:56:57.150 --> 01:57:00.390
It's what this podcast is taking things to.
The next level.

2042
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.860
Every time I go on stage,
it's the machine does squad and you're like,

2043
01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:08.920
but Joey is,
Joey is the embodiment.
I was sentenced to Brian.
Joey has is like,

2044
01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:12.600
it's like the thing you can't get,
like you can't get it in your hometown,

2045
01:57:12.601 --> 01:57:15.210
so when it does come to your hometown,
you're like fuck.

2046
01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:18.750
That's how does that came out today with Joe is Joey's the party.

2047
01:57:19.410 --> 01:57:22.410
Joey's the party.
That's why I bring Joey.
Joey has,

2048
01:57:22.650 --> 01:57:27.180
there's not a single special that I've done since 1999 it doesn't have Joey in

2049
01:57:27.181 --> 01:57:31.500
it.
Joey always introduces me.
Joey always comes with me to the shows.
Joey.

2050
01:57:31.501 --> 01:57:34.770
Oh cause what?
I want Joey,
I'm having fun.
Joey's low.

2051
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.510
He's the life of the party.

2052
01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:40.800
Like this is what I'm so bummed out that my Canadian friends can't meet Joey,

2053
01:57:40.801 --> 01:57:43.860
that we can't bring Joey to Canada,
but Joey can't get into Canada.

2054
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:47.420
He's in the middle.
He's getting that fixed.
The Fuck Outta here.

2055
01:57:47.421 --> 01:57:48.300
You Ain't going to get you.

2056
01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:52.530
They let the dude who's in jail for armed kidnapping in Canada.

2057
01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:55.950
That's my favorite part of explaining.
Joey went to club booker goes,
so what?

2058
01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:59.460
What is he,
what's he like?
And I go,
he's hard to explain.
And they go,
well,

2059
01:57:59.461 --> 01:58:01.560
what is he doing before stand up on was like prison.

2060
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:06.360
When you meet a guy like that,
it's just,
you know,
you,

2061
01:58:06.361 --> 01:58:08.940
you want to do everything you can to let other people know about it.

2062
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.610
That's how I feel.
And he's my mock Joey and I was like,

2063
01:58:11.611 --> 01:58:13.950
this is such a rare gem of a human.

2064
01:58:13.951 --> 01:58:16.770
I got to do everything I can to spread this guy's name.

2065
01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:19.540
I want to go on the road with you and Joey.
When weekend I'll go,

2066
01:58:19.541 --> 01:58:21.030
I'm doing the trip.
Flip thing.

2067
01:58:21.031 --> 01:58:25.380
We start in like a couple of weeks and I tried to cancel a bunch of dates,

2068
01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.900
but I still want to stand up.
I can't do a whole week,

2069
01:58:28.050 --> 01:58:31.440
so I'd love to fucking do like just one of your weekends.
Well,
I do.

2070
01:58:31.441 --> 01:58:33.180
Sometimes I'll do a stack show.

2071
01:58:33.181 --> 01:58:38.181
Like I got a stack show coming up in Vegas on August 31st we decided to have,

2072
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:42.220
it's going to be Ari,
Dunkin,
Joey and

2073
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:43.570
<v 1>me.
Holy Shit.</v>

2074
01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:47.590
So we're going to have a big ass crazy fucking show at the Mandalay bay.

2075
01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:52.240
I like doing it like
this pitch.
Can't let it go.

2076
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:56.200
Um,
you know,
but to have a show like that,
like a four,

2077
01:58:56.201 --> 01:58:59.080
four man killer show for headliners,
you know,

2078
01:58:59.710 --> 01:59:02.470
I think we'll start doing more of those.
That's fun.

2079
01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:05.250
If you do want more fun power in man,

2080
01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:07.690
and you look at my schedule and then let me know where you want to go.

2081
01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:10.930
I'll do that in a heartbeat.
Okay.
Come on.
Cause I can't do a long weekend,

2082
01:59:10.931 --> 01:59:14.090
but I can do like a weekend with you.
Okay,
well let's do it.
Let's,
um,

2083
01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:18.960
let's find a,
a couple of dates coming up and locks up,
man.
But,
uh,
yeah,
we're,

2084
01:59:18.961 --> 01:59:20.410
we're going all over the fucking place,

2085
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:23.020
so I've got a lot of shit coming up in North Carolina.

2086
01:59:23.021 --> 01:59:27.070
I'm doing a Raleigh and Asheville,
North Carolina.

2087
01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:31.240
In September I'm doing,
uh,
Minneapolis in October.

2088
01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:35.590
I'm doing a,
I've got a bunch of dates coming up.
Sacramento.

2089
01:59:35.591 --> 01:59:37.990
I'm doing a theater up there.
Um,

2090
01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:41.680
I'm going to do with the San Jose Improv as a UFC in San Jose.

2091
01:59:41.710 --> 01:59:44.790
That San Jose Angel Province.
That shit.
Oh,
it's a beautiful palace.

2092
01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:48.500
Fucking amazing place.
Houdini.
He used to work there.
Yeah.
Used to be a,

2093
01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:51.370
if you're in San Jose and you don't go to that Improv,
you really,

2094
01:59:51.371 --> 01:59:54.340
you wouldn't even know as you drove by that unless you were like a resident that

2095
01:59:54.341 --> 01:59:55.450
knows the history of the building.

2096
01:59:55.660 --> 02:00:00.040
But that's an old time show building from like silent movie days and it is

2097
02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:04.540
unbelievably gorgeous.
It is a beautiful,
beautiful club.
It's one of the,

2098
02:00:04.541 --> 02:00:08.710
my favorite places to work in San Jose.
He's the shit son.

2099
02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:12.460
We've got to show a Wednesday night at the icehouse.
That's tomorrow night.

2100
02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:14.620
It's going to be,
that's going to be an insane show.

2101
02:00:14.890 --> 02:00:18.460
Tom Rhodes is where my favorite human beings.
It's ridiculous.
The lineup.
Brian,

2102
02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:22.180
uh,
we got Bert Kreischer to tongue,
Sam Tripoli,

2103
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:27.100
Tom Rhodes,
Brody Stevens,
Benson,

2104
02:00:27.850 --> 02:00:32.140
dom Arrera.
That's crazy.
That's what's,
and me,

2105
02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:35.180
I'm going to have to take it at a party party,
bro.

2106
02:00:35.181 --> 02:00:39.250
I'm a party car service and customer comedy.com.

2107
02:00:39.490 --> 02:00:43.840
And that means,
uh,
if Brody or other,
if,
uh,
if he burned does that,

2108
02:00:43.841 --> 02:00:46.390
he'll also be on the ice house chronicles with brother's getting me on it,
right?

2109
02:00:46.391 --> 02:00:50.080
Yeah.
Brody Brody with dom Irrera with Tom Rhodes.

2110
02:00:50.110 --> 02:00:53.080
It's sure to be one of the best ice house chronicles of all time.

2111
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:55.150
And if you want to get the ice house chronicles,

2112
02:00:55.151 --> 02:00:58.900
it's one of my favorite podcasts that we do and it's on Brian's labeled a death

2113
02:00:58.901 --> 02:01:02.500
squad label.
Um,
what was death squad?
That sounds Kinda meathead.
Ish.

2114
02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.430
It's a nickname that ob from opie and Anthony gave me when I showed up at the

2115
02:01:06.431 --> 02:01:11.260
studio,
uh,
we showed up,
Brian and Tate Fletcher and Eddie Bravo and it's like,

2116
02:01:11.261 --> 02:01:13.680
oh,
Joe Rogan brought the dust squad.
It was so,
it was like,

2117
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:16.300
it became like a silly thing.
It's silly.
More than anything.

2118
02:01:16.301 --> 02:01:19.390
We don't think we're really killing anybody relaxed.
Uh,
but anyway,

2119
02:01:19.450 --> 02:01:20.890
it's fun when people,
when people go,

2120
02:01:20.891 --> 02:01:22.720
what is this fucking desk squad you're a part of?

2121
02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:25.600
It's crazy and I can't explain to you,
but I'm on iTunes.

2122
02:01:25.601 --> 02:01:28.090
If you go to the desk squad label on Itunes,

2123
02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:31.390
that's the only way to get ice house chronical should go to desk squad.tv.

2124
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:34.630
You can check that shit out there,
but we do regular shows at the ice house,

2125
02:01:34.631 --> 02:01:38.380
so if you're in Pasadena,
most likely almost every week we're there.

2126
02:01:38.381 --> 02:01:40.280
It's a great fucking club.
It's a club.

2127
02:01:40.281 --> 02:01:43.950
It's been around since the 1960s and to us it's all,

2128
02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:46.280
Brian and I were just talking about this.
This is our lab.

2129
02:01:46.281 --> 02:01:47.650
It's like the greatest club ever.

2130
02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:52.340
It's the best thing ever for to just fucking do shows every week.

2131
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:59.000
I don't think I've done one of those shows even remotely sober last show,

2132
02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:00.300
the last show I did there,

2133
02:02:00.301 --> 02:02:03.650
it was in the big room and I kept talking to the lights.

2134
02:02:03.710 --> 02:02:05.760
I thought there was a balcony,
oh show.

2135
02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:09.830
I kept talking to them about and the kid in the front row goes,

2136
02:02:09.831 --> 02:02:12.140
who the fuck are you talking to?
And I go them and he goes,

2137
02:02:12.141 --> 02:02:13.610
there's no second floor.
And I got it.

2138
02:02:13.611 --> 02:02:15.880
I like to wait where the fuck is the second time you read the laugh?

2139
02:02:16.130 --> 02:02:18.790
I thought it was,
I was like,
I thought there was a second fucking floor.

2140
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:24.010
That was the funniest show that was so it is chaos playing drunk.

2141
02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:26.570
Every show is the funniest show.

2142
02:02:26.590 --> 02:02:30.190
Like the last one we did was more fun than the ones that we'd done before and

2143
02:02:30.210 --> 02:02:34.910
it's,
and the conversations are fucking epic.
Will we have,
it's a real green room.

2144
02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:38.990
It's like what,
what the icehouse chronicles are.
It's like,
you know,
we,

2145
02:02:39.110 --> 02:02:41.180
we've been doing podcasts for a while,

2146
02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:44.360
but to do a podcast and a show at the same time,

2147
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:48.110
really it's like one of the most perfect combinations because everybody gets

2148
02:02:48.111 --> 02:02:52.250
loosened up before they go onstage in the,
in the podcast studio.

2149
02:02:52.251 --> 02:02:54.890
So we're all talking shit and having fun,

2150
02:02:54.891 --> 02:02:56.750
making a whiskey shot before you go and stay.

2151
02:02:56.751 --> 02:02:59.330
I don't think I would have done one of those shows without you pulling me aside

2152
02:02:59.331 --> 02:03:02.020
and going,
let's do a shot of Jack.
We do shots were doing shots.

2153
02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:06.380
I just put one up yesterday and the icehouse chronicles 40 and it has Tiffany

2154
02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:10.100
Haddish in it.
This amazing new comic that I love her to death.
She's,
she,

2155
02:03:10.101 --> 02:03:14.960
she's hilarious and she does her secret town of Queen.
Don't tell people

2156
02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:20.480
she keeps to the beat.
But anyway,
it's the ice house chronical.

2157
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:24.020
So always,
always a good time.
Always a good time and available.
Free.

2158
02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:28.370
All of it's free on iTunes as well as this podcast Joe Rogan experience.

2159
02:03:28.371 --> 02:03:29.720
It's on Sirius satellite radio.

2160
02:03:29.721 --> 02:03:32.700
We thank them very much for putting it on the opiod and Anthony Channel.
Uh,

2161
02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:35.600
opie and Anthony are our boys.
We loved them and little Jimmy.

2162
02:03:35.601 --> 02:03:38.150
So it's an honor to be on the same network as them.

2163
02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:42.470
But the bottom line is about this.
The show is this,

2164
02:03:42.650 --> 02:03:45.230
this shows always going to be free.
I mean,
it's online.

2165
02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:46.730
It's going to remain like this.

2166
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:51.790
I think the love that we've experienced from you guys is one of the coolest,

2167
02:03:53.241 --> 02:03:58.241
most inspiring things that I've ever been a part of in my entire quote unquote

2168
02:03:58.641 --> 02:04:00.200
career in show business.

2169
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:05.510
I think we figured out how to cut out all the middleman,
all the bullshit,

2170
02:04:05.511 --> 02:04:06.560
all the producers,

2171
02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:10.550
and allow people to have real fucking conversations.

2172
02:04:10.551 --> 02:04:14.030
Allow people who are listening to join in on a real conversation.
You know,

2173
02:04:14.031 --> 02:04:18.410
I'm not bullshitting you.
I might be wrong.
No,
I fucked things up.

2174
02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:22.640
I get things wrong.
I confused dates,
but I'll never lie.
I am not lying.

2175
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:26.600
I will not.
If I,
if I,
if I tell you something,
it's because I believe it.

2176
02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:30.080
If I tell you something on this podcast is because I've experienced it or it's

2177
02:04:30.081 --> 02:04:35.060
in my mind or it's,
it's truly you're going to get my uncensored thoughts.

2178
02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:38.070
Every single fucking don't lie.
There

2179
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.370
<v 0>was an old thing that Brian used to do all the time after videos.
Don't lie,</v>

2180
02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:43.433
but it's true.

2181
02:04:43.570 --> 02:04:44.710
<v 1>Our,
our ethic,</v>

2182
02:04:44.711 --> 02:04:48.910
all of us together and it's an important way of looking at the world,
man.

2183
02:04:48.911 --> 02:04:52.900
The more truthful you are with your own thoughts and the more truthful you can

2184
02:04:52.901 --> 02:04:55.090
be about your,
your own thoughts to other people,

2185
02:04:55.091 --> 02:04:58.150
the more we can all learn from each other because if you're saying something

2186
02:04:58.151 --> 02:05:01.180
like Bert Kreischer,
you're an honest dude.
When you tell me something,

2187
02:05:01.181 --> 02:05:04.960
I know that that is coming right from you.
I go,
Burke crushers and honest dude,

2188
02:05:04.961 --> 02:05:08.170
I can totally trust what he's saying right now.
This is a good conversation.

2189
02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:12.040
As soon as you can't,
you're in a bullshit conversation.

2190
02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:14.950
As soon as you're talking,
well,
how's everything?
You know you have you.

2191
02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:16.570
Have you been out to the lake this year?

2192
02:05:16.690 --> 02:05:19.390
As soon as you get into a bullshit conversation where you don't really care

2193
02:05:19.391 --> 02:05:20.224
about what you're saying,

2194
02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:23.100
you're just making noises with your mouth for social purposes,
you know,

2195
02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:24.960
and nobody's growing from that.
You're,

2196
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:27.280
you're not growing from that shit that you have to do when you're in that

2197
02:05:27.281 --> 02:05:30.400
fucking cubicle all day talking on the phone,
answering customer service calls,

2198
02:05:30.401 --> 02:05:32.950
you're not growing from that.
God Damn it.
Nope.
You,

2199
02:05:33.070 --> 02:05:38.070
you grow from having either experiencing a real conversation through your,

2200
02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:41.440
through your headphones because you're tuning into this podcast or you're having

2201
02:05:41.441 --> 02:05:42.730
real conversations yourself.

2202
02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:45.310
You have a real conversations with your friends and don't,

2203
02:05:45.311 --> 02:05:48.400
don't keep anybody in your life where you can't have that.

2204
02:05:48.580 --> 02:05:50.350
If you can't have a real conversation with them,

2205
02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:52.630
they are just going to be a goddamn roadblock.

2206
02:05:52.631 --> 02:05:55.960
Those people are walking landmines and you owe it to them to tell them the

2207
02:05:55.961 --> 02:05:58.390
fucking truth.
Don't be that person yourself.

2208
02:05:58.510 --> 02:06:00.160
And if you run into one of those people,

2209
02:06:00.161 --> 02:06:03.190
the only way they're going to change is they're going to feel like shit because

2210
02:06:03.191 --> 02:06:05.740
people call them out on it and they're going to have to reassess their own

2211
02:06:05.741 --> 02:06:08.800
situation.
That's the only way you improve people.
You got to tell the truth.

2212
02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:14.010
<v 0>Don't hang out with cuts and then stop giving me shit for saying the things I do</v>

2213
02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:19.640
should stop giving you shit.
What are they giving you shit about nothing.

2214
02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:22.650
Yeah.
There's a lot of brutal red band haters out there.
You know why?

2215
02:06:22.651 --> 02:06:24.980
Because they look at you and they'd go,
well it could do book,

2216
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.690
but they can't do that cause then I you so Tom the socket.
That's right.

2217
02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:34.960
Say it sucks some on it down in your mouth.
Bitches on a.com go to

2218
02:06:36.530 --> 02:06:37.860
thank you to Alienware

2219
02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:40.850
<v 1>may also for a,
we were at my house,
which by the way,</v>

2220
02:06:40.851 --> 02:06:45.830
we do have a new studio that's going to be set up it literally any day now.

2221
02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:48.230
We're waiting to get the green light to get in there and start,

2222
02:06:48.290 --> 02:06:50.510
start the construction,
but I'm excited.
I just going to be,

2223
02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:52.760
so I'm going to put it in a pool table.

2224
02:06:52.761 --> 02:06:55.460
I might put in an isolation tank if I could figure out a place to install a

2225
02:06:55.461 --> 02:06:56.230
shower.

2226
02:06:56.230 --> 02:06:57.900
<v 0>Well you,
I have a place to install it.
I'm bringing,</v>

2227
02:06:57.901 --> 02:07:00.960
I'm bringing this illegal wine,
not an illegal one from uh,

2228
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.250
from the desk squad Scotland guys gave me and bringing that tomorrow.
Beautiful.

2229
02:07:05.251 --> 02:07:08.220
It's called buckfast.
You drink it at first you're going to be the tester.

2230
02:07:08.350 --> 02:07:11.910
If anyone in Los Angeles,
once a cat and they will take good care of it.

2231
02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:15.270
Let me know.
Don't do that.
I'm going to find some crazy cats.

2232
02:07:15.370 --> 02:07:18.620
She's going to skin your cat and send you photos doing Instagrams,

2233
02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:20.880
which you got to do and pissing in your bed.
No,
no.
It's just,

2234
02:07:20.881 --> 02:07:25.800
it's just I have too many animals and such a small place and it's out of
control.

2235
02:07:25.810 --> 02:07:26.970
Should have brought your dog over man.

2236
02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:29.790
I called you to see if you wanted me to do,
bring your dog over Wednesday.

2237
02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:33.240
Bringing dog over was coming here with coming here Wednesday.
Joey Diaz tomorrow.

2238
02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:35.970
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great joy and Coco motherfucking Das,

2239
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:38.920
<v 1>probably three.
All right.
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2240
02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:42.790
if you use a code name rogue and you will save yourself 10% off any of the

2241
02:07:42.791 --> 02:07:46.330
supplements at [inaudible] dot com that's o,
n n,
I t.
And again,

2242
02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:49.690
I discussed this before.
If you're interested in any of these things,

2243
02:07:49.691 --> 02:07:53.350
I suggest you go to the Onnit website because it is very comprehensive.

2244
02:07:53.410 --> 02:07:55.330
It discusses all the science behind it.

2245
02:07:55.331 --> 02:07:59.020
And I also suggest that you use Google all this stuff in Google,

2246
02:07:59.021 --> 02:08:01.300
the word the tropics and the controversy behind it.

2247
02:08:01.301 --> 02:08:04.990
And I have been a fan of them for years.
I take them on a regular basis.

2248
02:08:04.991 --> 02:08:07.780
I benefit from them.
That's why I saw them.
I,
uh,

2249
02:08:07.781 --> 02:08:10.390
I firmly believe in it enough to the point where the first 30 pills,

2250
02:08:10.391 --> 02:08:12.820
if you buy them,
if you don't feel that they're satisfactory,

2251
02:08:12.821 --> 02:08:14.350
you get a hundred percent money back guarantee.

2252
02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:17.470
Nobody wants you to feel ripped off.
So I can't keep repeating myself,

2253
02:08:17.471 --> 02:08:20.830
so I might have to record this eventually.
It's getting ridiculous.

2254
02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:23.170
I tried to keep these organic.
It was much more fun though.

2255
02:08:23.171 --> 02:08:26.110
You're right with the fleshlight keeping it organic when you're talking about

2256
02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:27.410
kind of dolls and

2257
02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:33.340
you gotta get some cannon balls and you learn how to do some Turkish getups and

2258
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:36.070
needed to get off the bicep curls and tricep extensions.

2259
02:08:36.071 --> 02:08:39.100
You fruity bitch cause you're in balancing your body and you're going to get

2260
02:08:39.101 --> 02:08:43.000
dick pains.
All right.
This podcast is over.
We thank you very much for tuning in.

2261
02:08:43.001 --> 02:08:47.380
As always,
we thank you.
And Oh Denver this weekend hall La Brandon Walsh,

2262
02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:51.950
Wa wa Joey Diaz and Matt's a good show.
Yeah,
at the paramount.
It's um,

2263
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.340
there's a big ass place.

2264
02:08:54.341 --> 02:08:57.580
But last I heard is think there's only a couple of hundred tickets left.

2265
02:08:57.710 --> 02:09:02.380
Well it's cause it's 100% amazing show.
Yeah,
it's going to be fun now Denver,

2266
02:09:02.381 --> 02:09:06.730
this Friday,
if you coming into the UFC in Denver,
we're at the paramount theater.

2267
02:09:06.850 --> 02:09:07.690
If you go to my Twitter,

2268
02:09:07.691 --> 02:09:10.420
I put up a link to it really recently or just Google that shit.

2269
02:09:10.421 --> 02:09:13.270
You could figure it out but don't go through a scalper cause they will fuck you.

2270
02:09:13.450 --> 02:09:14.111
That's creepy man.

2271
02:09:14.111 --> 02:09:17.230
When he started doing theater as Louis Ck has got it down right cause the

2272
02:09:17.231 --> 02:09:18.100
scalpers,
it's,

2273
02:09:18.101 --> 02:09:20.680
it's a weird thing when you go and you find your tickets for sale somewhere

2274
02:09:20.681 --> 02:09:23.920
other than the official website and because it's sold out and they're for sale

2275
02:09:23.921 --> 02:09:27.190
for a fuck load of money.
Louise got the business paradigm down.

2276
02:09:27.191 --> 02:09:29.380
I've got a copy him with everything he does except his hair

2277
02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:34.740
is a beautiful show.
I make it fun of,
I had to say it,
but look,

2278
02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:37.510
I don't have any hair so I'm going to shit,
I got an hour.
Ridiculous.

2279
02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:41.050
I'm going to shape minds.
It's the greatest thing I've ever done.
I feel so free.

2280
02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:44.800
I feel so relaxed.
Like I don't ever have to go to haircuts and by the way,

2281
02:09:44.801 --> 02:09:47.320
hairdressers,
we'll fucking hold you hostage with those scissors.

2282
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:51.340
And I was telling him,
that's not how I operate.
Like cut the fucking hair.

2283
02:09:51.341 --> 02:09:55.810
Jesus Christ holding me this like members.
People do that with joints.
You know,

2284
02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:58.480
we had a friend that used to do that with joints all the time.
It's puff,
puff,

2285
02:09:58.481 --> 02:10:02.470
pass,
not pop pop up.
Beth,
let me tell you a story.
This motherfucker said to me,

2286
02:10:02.471 --> 02:10:02.951
and you,
your,

2287
02:10:02.951 --> 02:10:07.030
your whole held hostage because he's got the reefer dirty bitch tomorrow.

2288
02:10:07.031 --> 02:10:12.031
Joe Diaz Cock suckers get him to come to the Po to the Ice House too if we can.

2289
02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:16.480
Oh,
he,
I asked him.
He can't,
he can't.
He's,
he's a busy guy,
but he,
uh,

2290
02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:18.460
he will come if he can and he's there all the time,

2291
02:10:18.580 --> 02:10:21.920
but he'll be here on the podcast tomorrow.
Thank you.
Everybody go to fall.
