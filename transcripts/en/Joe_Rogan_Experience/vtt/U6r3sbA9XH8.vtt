48
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>If he punched a steep in the face,</v>

49
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get more steam out of his fucking he is.</v>

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>It's embarrassing.</v>

59
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just embarrassing it because it's Mark Hunt.</v>

60
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>They knew he was on the juice.</v>

61
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>He went in there loaded to the gills.</v>

62
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>It was just an imbalance.</v>

63
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>It was an embarrassing thing for everybody.</v>

64
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>And Mark Hunt that every fucking right to be mad.</v>

65
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>They put them in there with a guy that's coming off rocket fucking fuel.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

264
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:11.560
<v Speaker 1>It could be then,</v>

265
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.691
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

266
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Then this is what this is.</v>

268
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 1>This is beyond you.</v>

269
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.540
<v Speaker 1>This is beyond I this and I haven't really seen the setup at the fucking New</v>

272
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.790
<v Speaker 1>but then I'll tell you the deck that I'm talking to them so you didn't know who</v>

<v Speaker 1>the seed was already planted in New York.</v>

00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>It was already planted.</v>

00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.631
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

295
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:01.050
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't fight enough and get,</v>

296
00:08:01.051 --> 00:08:01.250

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:01.980
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

298
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.910
<v Speaker 1>That's Wayne's talking shit.</v>

299
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the seed.</v>

300
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>You're dumb fucks.</v>

301
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening here.</v>

302
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:08.324
<v Speaker 1>What is he saying?</v>

303
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.163
<v Speaker 1>He's just talking shit.</v>

304
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>You hear what he said?</v>

305
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

306
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.550
<v Speaker 1>It went on and then timeline said,</v>

307
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.513
<v Speaker 1>somebody said,</v>

308

323
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.850
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to fight Tyrone.</v>

324
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>He's going to fight Tyron and killed one time for canopy.</v>

325
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Like they threw Dennis deeper with Frankie.</v>

326
00:08:52.411 --> 00:08:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Edgar was fucking working</v>

327
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:56.803

328
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>That is safe as available.</v>

329

<v Speaker 1>You know the color of his skin so already gets,</v>

330
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 1>he's talking some truth.</v>

332
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to fight Ferguson.</v>

333
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>He's dropping a fight.</v>

334
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:12.401
<v Speaker 1>Tony Ferguson.</v>

335
00:09:12.401 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Why not just bro,</v>

336
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 1>it's too much height and Tony Ferguson don't give a fuck.</v>

337
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 1>He's a bugbear backstage again,</v>

338
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>fucking Florida.</v>

339
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 1>That is a horrible for me,</v>

340
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.030
<v Speaker 1>it's tremendous.</v>

341
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>It's tremendous.</v>

342
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like a zoo.</v>

343
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

344
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.010
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

345
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.660

349
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:32.180

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.213
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

353
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Crank it up.</v>

354
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.853
<v Speaker 1>He's setting it up.</v>

355
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.440
<v Speaker 1>She's setting up the one shot.</v>

356
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 2>There's eight guys,</v>

357
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:49.584
<v Speaker 2>big guys</v>

358
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.030
<v Speaker 1>with that phone.</v>

359
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

360
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.793
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

361
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:55.663
<v Speaker 1>There's 10 guys.</v>

362
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Look out.</v>

363
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Drain Tyron looks.</v>

364
00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's hit rewind it again.</v>

365
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 1>We went in the Sh sh</v>

366
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 2>nothing much.</v>

367
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>You're that lady to,</v>

368
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:11.751
<v Speaker 1>you said what's up?</v>

369
00:10:11.751 --> 00:10:12.471
<v Speaker 1>And he started crying.</v>

370
00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:12.711
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

371
00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:13.091
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

372
00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:13.311
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

373
00:10:13.311 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 1>not much,</v>

374
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.140
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile you look at Tyron.</v>

375
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Tyron looks so drained there.</v>

376
00:10:17.061 --> 00:10:20.000
<v Speaker 1>When he made that weight is like right after he made the way</v>

377
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.620
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go for three fucking cops goes,</v>

378
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.570
<v Speaker 1>nobody ever saw this shit.</v>

379
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.371
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know what.</v>

380
00:10:27.371 --> 00:10:30.080
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to fight Ferguson because it's a fucking,</v>

381
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.810
<v Speaker 1>it's arrow.</v>

382
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Smith guns and roses was Aerosmith on steroids and Tony Ferguson is little Diaz</v>

383
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.040
<v Speaker 1>with fucking</v>

384
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.523
<v Speaker 1>blood in them.</v>

385
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.341
<v Speaker 1>You understand me?</v>

386
00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:44.174
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want that.</v>

387
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

388
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm Tony Ferguson and Dana.</v>

389
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not a draw paint and junk.</v>

390
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:51.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

391
00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:51.771
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

392
00:10:51.771 --> 00:10:56.771
<v Speaker 1>Uncle Bobby Dana is not going to let his nephew fight collar be kidding.</v>

393
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Connor versus Tony is not a draw.</v>

394
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not a draw for Conner.</v>

395
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

396
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.360
<v Speaker 1>He's your guy.</v>

397
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a big fucking fight.</v>

398
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Make a total big fucking side though.</v>

399
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they're making it?</v>

400
00:11:10.791 --> 00:11:11.624
<v Speaker 1>Eddie?</v>

401
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.250
<v Speaker 1>You tell me.</v>

402
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they make us?</v>

403
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to self and I love these guys.</v>

404
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.031
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me,</v>

405
00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

406
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not clowning your guy.</v>

407
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.960
<v Speaker 1>But as far as the average consumer buying a paper view,</v>

408
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not a cell.</v>

409
00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:24.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just not hell.</v>

410
00:11:24.081 --> 00:11:24.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

411
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:24.651
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

412
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of fighting,</v>

413
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.340
<v Speaker 1>fighting a top challenger is always a sale and Tony,</v>

414
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but Tony Ferguson is most certainly a top challenger.</v>

415
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.370
<v Speaker 1>When Nate Diaz fought Conor for the first time,</v>

416
00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:41.720
<v Speaker 1>it was a giant fight because Nate Diaz had a name and he's a bit,</v>

417
00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:42.950
<v Speaker 1>he's a bigger name than Tony,</v>

418
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.270
<v Speaker 1>arguably for sure.</v>

419
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Not even close,</v>

420
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.430
<v Speaker 1>much bigger now after he beat them for others.</v>

421
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.800
<v Speaker 1>And Tony wasn't the same as it is now.</v>

422
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.843
<v Speaker 1>It's a different,</v>

423
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing now,</v>

424
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:53.480
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

425
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 1>but he had it because of nick and nick had had all the strike force success,</v>

426
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 1>elite Eggsy success,</v>

427
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 1>you know all that is a lot of TV time.</v>

428
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>There's the ultimate fighter winner,</v>

429
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Nate.</v>

430
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>

431
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 1>nick had just got done beaten Anderson or fighting Anderson Rather.</v>

432
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:11.944
<v Speaker 1>And you know nick,</v>

433
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 1>nick is like a pretty well known figure,</v>

434
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:14.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

435
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>His brother,</v>

436
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>they're both the Diaz brothers are like,</v>

437
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>so that's a different level.</v>

438
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.030
<v Speaker 1>But having them take that fight on short notice too.</v>

439
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.910
<v Speaker 1>But Connor was the main draws my point</v>

440
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>because I agree,</v>

441
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

442
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.610
<v Speaker 1>he's the main draw.</v>

443
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.080
<v Speaker 1>If you're calm and you're his manager,</v>

444
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 1>he'd go and let's fight Tony,</v>

445
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 1>who's a tough fucking matchup,</v>

446
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.250
<v Speaker 1>but he's not as big as the name is.</v>

447
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 1>A guy like Nate Diaz at 55 who we're going to make more money,</v>

448
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe not as tough as a fight bigger name.</v>

449
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing it from the business point and not fighting,</v>

450
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.793
<v Speaker 1>not fighting can be.</v>

451
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.930
<v Speaker 1>You also have the fight in horrible fight for,</v>

452
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do a Russia card and when they do a Russia card they want to do</v>

453
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>a rush card with Connor or with hubby brother.</v>

454
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So when they do a rush,</v>

455
00:12:57.421 --> 00:12:58.254
<v Speaker 1>a car with a beam,</v>

456
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 1>it's most likely going to be for a title I would imagine like so a title.</v>

457
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.831
<v Speaker 1>It all depends.</v>

458
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:03.650
<v Speaker 1>If common accepts,</v>

459
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.470
<v Speaker 1>that reminder might be Tony and in my parents room and apparently they offered</v>

460
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:11.260
<v Speaker 1>it to Tony and Tony said that he wanted to make the same amount of money that</v>

461
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Habib Manx.</v>

462
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just perfectly fun at first,</v>

463
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.070
<v Speaker 1>but you know they said,</v>

464
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

465
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you got a contract,</v>

466
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 1>you got to honor your contract.</v>

467
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 1>That's at least how it's been explained.</v>

468
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:20.681
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

469
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's been explained.</v>

470
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.761
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

471
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:21.931
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

472
00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:23.110
<v Speaker 1>well you sign these contracts,</v>

473
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 1>you got to honor the contract.</v>

474
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

475
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:25.901
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

476
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:26.120
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

477
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 1>that only works one way.</v>

478
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 1>The only works for the UFC because they don't honor all the contracts.</v>

479
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.830
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

480
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.500
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean for works for they can cut them.</v>

481
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 1>They can.</v>

482
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.040
<v Speaker 1>You have a six week contracts and you've lost two,</v>

483
00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:36.400
<v Speaker 1>but that seems contrary to cut.</v>

484
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 1>It's in the contract that you can get cut if it wasn't in the contract.</v>

485
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>There's guys who have fought and they fought out their entire contract for sure.</v>

486
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

487
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:43.601
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just saying,</v>

488
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:43.871
<v Speaker 1>hey Joe,</v>

489
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:44.430
<v Speaker 1>here's the ones,</v>

490
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I remember the early days and Pedro Huizar had this giant contract because they</v>

491
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 1>thought the page was going to be the heavyweight champ.</v>

492
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 1>And so they were giving him like undercard fights.</v>

493
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 1>He's making quarter of $1 million.</v>

494
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

495
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:54.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

496
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.751
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky man.</v>

497
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Because I get the,</v>

498
00:13:56.811 --> 00:13:59.710
<v Speaker 1>the idea that they would want to protect Konner um,</v>

499
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:00.241
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

501
00:14:00.241 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 1>and really set up the big money fights,</v>

502
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 1>especially now because he's the biggest guy.</v>

503
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>But then you've got Connor who's kind of fucking crazy and he's like,</v>

504
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

505
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.730
<v Speaker 1>the way he is John down tire and literally he gets,</v>

506
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.451
<v Speaker 1>or Dune,</v>

507
00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it from,</v>

508
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.550
<v Speaker 1>from a business standpoint,</v>

509
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:13.940
<v Speaker 1>they're going,</v>

510
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

511
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.510
<v Speaker 1>what's the biggest fight pot?</v>

512
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you have three fights left.</v>

513
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Who are the three biggest names we can fight and to make this happen.</v>

514
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 1>So you stay on to feel big and make the most money.</v>

515
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:23.150
<v Speaker 1>He might not be under feet.</v>

516
00:14:23.151 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's definitely not undefeated now.</v>

517
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

518
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest thing is the Woodley fight because that's a one seven.one seven</v>

519
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:30.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a third belt guys.</v>

520
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:30.934
<v Speaker 1>That's a fight.</v>

521
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.793
<v Speaker 1>As</v>

522
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.540
<v Speaker 1>much control on you motherfuckers up.</v>

523
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>You didn't see it.</v>

524
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

525
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:36.700
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

526
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying if the Khabib is going to be,</v>

527
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.001
<v Speaker 1>especially after,</v>

528
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't talk to take the punch from Michael Kahn.</v>

529
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying Michael Michael Johnson,</v>

530
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.650
<v Speaker 1>but the fight is could beat and then the next fight has to be Ferguson.</v>

531
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:48.484
<v Speaker 1>If he beats him,</v>

532
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:49.810
<v Speaker 1>not just the way it is,</v>

533
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:51.030
<v Speaker 1>which I Cook Ferguson,</v>

534
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 1>we can't wait.</v>

535
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 1>They can't wait like fridges and needs a fight like in the next four or five</v>

536
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:56.170
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

537
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 1>It could be me as a fight in the next fucking two,</v>

538
00:14:57.921 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 1>three months.</v>

539
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

540
00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.713
<v Speaker 1>don't fight in Brooklyn</v>

541
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.383
<v Speaker 1>from now.</v>

542
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 1>When you went to view them.</v>

543
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

544
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.240
<v Speaker 1>he put the hat on your Mustang.</v>

545
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.001
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

546
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 1>you'll fight in Brooklyn.</v>

547
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Put her hat on my head every time I put it every time.</v>

548
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:10.731
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

549
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:11.290
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

550
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love where that and you don't say he looks at me and shows me the hat.</v>

551
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I give him the nod like yeah,</v>

552
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I put that hat on.</v>

553
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I like that hat.</v>

554
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Me As a fan,</v>

555
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see is Tony Rush.</v>

556
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Gabby.</v>

557
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.040
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

558
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a fight.</v>

559
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.250
<v Speaker 1>There's not a better match up.</v>

560
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I can be made into movies.</v>

561
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

562
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I like Tony versus Connor.</v>

563
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 1>I even like a beat versus Connor.</v>

564
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

565
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.863
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

566
00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

567
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I like Connor versus Woodley.</v>

568
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I like that to fight to fight.</v>

569
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the next money fight.</v>

570
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.620
<v Speaker 1>But he's going to eventually,</v>

571
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the UFC gives them enough power to do that.</v>

572
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I can get that.</v>

573
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

574
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:49.783
<v Speaker 1>He's got all the power.</v>

575
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Well here's the thing about doing cowardly loses to Bisping.</v>

576
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>If he loses those catch weight fight,</v>

577
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:57.350
<v Speaker 1>he still keeps that 170 pounds strap.</v>

578
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.200
<v Speaker 1>That's if that catch that.</v>

579
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.630
<v Speaker 1>That's just he my,</v>

580
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:01.671
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

581
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 1>he can't hold on to divisions.</v>

582
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I run against my board cause I gotta go to,</v>

583

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

585
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 1>they were going after Tyro planted the seed,</v>

586
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:11.031
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

587
00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>There are two divisions.</v>

588
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.430
<v Speaker 1>It's been backstage at u of C's.</v>

<v Speaker 1>All the guys.</v>

590
00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:19.941
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what happened when I'm away from the Russian as either as long as</v>

591
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

592
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 1>but specifically we can talk over each other.</v>

593
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:25.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

594
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 1>they'll do the NASA thing when they go to interview and they die in car</v>

600
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.500
<v Speaker 1>They're going to hope that they fall off a cliff or a plane goes down.</v>

<v Speaker 1>if he goes up to [inaudible] tire and nothing happened,</v>
