<v Speaker 1>Drive by day,</v>

2
00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night,</v>

3
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>all day they come in,</v>

4
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.903
<v Speaker 1>they weigh in.</v>

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Then once we record it,</v>

6
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.483
<v Speaker 1>make sure they're cool,</v>

7
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>they can rehydrate and they have many,</v>

8
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>many more hours to rehydrate.</v>

9
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.971
<v Speaker 1>So guys,</v>

10
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>we're rehydrating six hours earlier.</v>

11
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Most guys showed up at 10:00 AM they made weight and then they had way more</v>

12
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:18.871
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

13
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>So when you saw people stand on the scale,</v>

14
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I was saying official weight,</v>

15
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>when I was announcing it,</v>

16
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>they had weighed in at 10 o'clock in the morning.</v>

17
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>So it was already four in the afternoon.</v>

18
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>These guys were hydrated and thick.</v>

19
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>No one looks sick,</v>

20
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>at least visually.</v>

21
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.631
<v Speaker 1>No one looked like,</v>

22
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>like Conor McGregor looked when he fought Chad Mendez when they weighed in and</v>

23
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>he looked like a dead man.</v>

24
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.073
<v Speaker 1>A dead man.</v>

25
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>S cheeks were all sucked in.</v>

26
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>It looks horrible.</v>

27
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.331
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

29
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>you did good in the fight.</v>

30
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

31
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

32
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.203
<v Speaker 1>he really did.</v>

33
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>He cuts a lot to get to one 45.</v>

34
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:47.954
<v Speaker 1>He's a big boy.</v>

35
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.133
<v Speaker 1>He's a big boy.</v>

36
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>He's way bigger than,</v>

37
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>like chosen.</v>

39
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Aldo and Josie all was cutting a lot at one point.</v>

40
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:54.100
<v Speaker 1>His career.</v>

41
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.541
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

43
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I've never a hardcore fan.</v>

44
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I've never enjoyed the fight more than I enjoyed Nate Diaz.</v>

45
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.761
<v Speaker 1>Conor Mcgregor,</v>

46
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I was lost my mind so much at the end of the fight.</v>

47
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge Diaz Fan and that was just incredible.</v>

49
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:05.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>on 10 days notice.</v>

51
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

52
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.221
<v Speaker 1>Well that whole,</v>

53
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>to card or that to fight,</v>

55
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>

57
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>the two fights,</v>

58
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.313
<v Speaker 1>the final fights,</v>

60
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.071
<v Speaker 1>the Holly Holm,</v>

61
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Miesha Tate was one of the most exciting endings to any fight ever.</v>

62
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>When Misha took Holly down in the fifth round of fight where she was losing it,</v>

63
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>took her back and choked her.</v>

64
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

65
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I read an article today where someone was saying that it was,</v>

66
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.791
<v Speaker 1>that me,</v>

67
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>she had lost virtually every second.</v>

68
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>It was from a guy I respect a writer and she won the second.</v>

69
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:30.361
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

70
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

71
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.621
<v Speaker 1>The second round,</v>

72
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>she took her down and pounded her.</v>

73
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I think they did they give her a 10,</v>

74
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>eight yes.</v>

75
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>And they should,</v>

76
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>she dominated.</v>

77
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>So I read this article,</v>

78
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>this is ESPN writer wrote it and I was like,</v>

79
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:40.891
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute man,</v>

80
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:41.191
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

81
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.001
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that like,</v>

82
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:42.834
<v Speaker 1>why are you saying that?</v>

83
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

84
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>that's silly hyperbole,</v>

85
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

86
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make any sense.</v>

87
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>and me show it was threatening in the third and fourth after that,</v>

89
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Holly was on her bike.</v>

90
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.951
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

91
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:53.784
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

92
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Like she's fighting perfect and super cautious with no chances and barely</v>

93
00:01:58.321 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>winning those rounds,</v>

94
00:01:59.191 --> 00:01:59.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:00.670
<v Speaker 1>just winning them but barely winning.</v>

96
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.503
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't nothing,</v>

97
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>nothing big happened and definitely no threat.</v>

98
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>So that victory when Misha Tate choked out,</v>

99
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Holly and Holly's punching in the air,</v>

100
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>like how fucking dramatic is that going out cold punching in the air while she's</v>

101
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>going out.</v>

102
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And then Nate beating up Connor and that second round after he gets fucked up in</v>

103
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.324
<v Speaker 1>the first round,</v>

104
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>beating him up in the second round and then choking him insane.</v>

105
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Probably like two,</v>

106
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>two of the most exciting finishes to any fight ever.</v>

107
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.161
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

108
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>and the Connor thing was just insane because he was on a tear that was one of</v>

109
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the biggest tears in MMA history.</v>

110
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.743
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

111
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>to watch it go down like that,</v>

112
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:35.611
<v Speaker 1>especially like you said,</v>

113
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>like he was winning the fight and then Nate turns it around and it was almost</v>

114
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>like on a drop of a dime,</v>

115
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>like nay,</v>

116
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>nay,</v>

117
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>like came to life in that second round and starts talking shit.</v>

118
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>So it was really fun in a home for the Jab.</v>

119
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>He hit him with that big one too and it was like,</v>

120
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>oh well they has a snake,</v>

121
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>like one to two.</v>

122
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.310
<v Speaker 1>He like whap whap and then he liked slithers around.</v>

123
00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't find them with the counter.</v>

124
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>He's really good.</v>

125
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And there's no one worse than a Nate or Nick Diaz to get hurt by in a fight</v>

126
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>because once they hurt you,</v>

127
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>they just like,</v>

128
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>they push a pace and then when you get hurt they like pick it up and pick it up.</v>

129
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:10.391
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>

130
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean before you know it,</v>

131
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Conner's hit like 25 fucking times on the feet and he's shooting for a take</v>

132
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

133
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are always doing triathlons.</v>

134
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>So even though Nate is like you're taking that fight in 11 days notice and he</v>

135
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>wasn't in shape,</v>

136
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>he's still in way better shape than most people.</v>

137
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>So like him going five rounds is non feasible.</v>

138
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

139
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not outside of the realm of imagination.</v>

140
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.863
<v Speaker 1>He's in shape.</v>

141
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>He's just not in the kind of shape that he's going to be when they have a</v>

142
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>rematch.</v>

143
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>And that becomes a real fucking problem.</v>

144
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think he's going to beat him up again with Nate sad.</v>

145
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.310
<v Speaker 1>He's like goes,</v>

146
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.611
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

147
00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

148
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>if I had a camp we wouldn't have fucking touch me.</v>

149
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.021
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

150
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 1>my plan was to go out slow in the first round and he came out fast enough in the</v>

151
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>first round.</v>

152
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>So I got tagged a couple of times.</v>

153
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.261
<v Speaker 1>But that's so cool.</v>

154
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:50.771
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

155
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:51.491
<v Speaker 1>Stick to the plan,</v>

156
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:52.324
<v Speaker 1>stick to the plan.</v>

157
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the second round it starts loosening up and opening up.</v>

158
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And Conor was just dead.</v>

159
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Well I heard,</v>

161
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean people are talking to Nate about,</v>

162
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.751
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>

163
00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.441
<v Speaker 1>going into that fight,</v>

164
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>like Connor's power,</v>

165
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>it was what a lot of people were talking about.</v>

166
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.721
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

167
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:01.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:05.420
<v Speaker 1>he put one punch on Josie Aldos Chin and he's out and he's talking,</v>

169
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.681
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

170
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:06.301
<v Speaker 1>they can't handle it.</v>

171
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:06.800
<v Speaker 1>My power,</v>

172
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.601
<v Speaker 1>I don't do us as well.</v>

173
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:08.434
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

174
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

175
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>and Nate was saying in one of the post fight interviews where it was like,</v>

176
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.081
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

177
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm spoiling with Andre Ward and Joe Schilling and like heavyweight boxers.</v>

178
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing rounds with heavyweight boxers.</v>

179
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you're going to hit him with that he hasn't seen or kind of</v>

180
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:23.370
<v Speaker 1>dealt with when he's,</v>

181
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

182
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>like talking like Andre Ward and Joe Schilling,</v>

184
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:27.210
<v Speaker 1>like decent strike.</v>

185
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>You're saying literally the best,</v>

186
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.553
<v Speaker 1>the best,</v>

187
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>the best inboxing and the best of the kickboxing.</v>

188
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:37.211
<v Speaker 1>Joe Schilling cuts wait to kickbox at 185 pounds and knocks dude's dead dead</v>

190
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>with one punch.</v>

191
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>So that guy is sparring with Nate on a regular basis.</v>

192
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Andre Ward,</v>

193
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>who is one of the best fucking boxers on the planet earth.</v>

194
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.760
<v Speaker 1>One of the slickest said that Nate gives as good as it gets when they spell.</v>

195
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

196
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

197
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

198
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think Joe Schilling,</v>

199
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I might be getting it,</v>

200
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>but I think Joe Schilling said he's never heard either one of them and a</v>

201
00:04:58.601 --> 00:04:59.261
<v Speaker 1>sparring session.</v>

202
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I think he said that on a fighter and the kid,</v>

203
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I believe it man.</v>

204
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Tough fucking dudes,</v>

205
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:04.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

206
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Tough fucking dudes.</v>

207
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>But what's fascinating to me is that he wanted to jump right back in there and</v>

208
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>do it again and that Nate wanted to,</v>

209
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>or that I'm Connor wanted to just run it back and I was like,</v>

210
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:16.084
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

211
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

212
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 1>It seems weird that he gets to do that.</v>

213
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Not so much that he wants to,</v>

214
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>but it just seems weird that they were like,</v>

215
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

216
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>like even when Dana White was talking about in his like,</v>

217
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:24.701
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

218
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>we tried to convince them to go down to one 45.</v>

219
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.131
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

220
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Nate's the,</v>

221
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.031
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

222
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:28.151
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

223
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>he's the matchmaker now.</v>

224
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:30.041
<v Speaker 1>He just gets to go.</v>

225
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you let them if you want,</v>

226
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make a ton of money,</v>

227
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.101
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

228
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:33.311
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

229
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the market and that guy's,</v>

230
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>that guy's what people want to see.</v>

231
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>He can do what he can do,</v>

232
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:38.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever he wants to do.</v>

233
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>But Nate's going to get a big pay day off it.</v>

234
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>But it's not just that the emperor has been stripped down.</v>

235
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.231
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

236
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>So now he's exposed.</v>

237
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>So now someone's beating him.</v>

238
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing,</v>

239
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>what do you do now?</v>

240
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>You want to make money.</v>

241
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.161
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

242
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you want to make money,</v>

243
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you make the biggest fight you can right now while he's been exposed.</v>

244
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And the biggest fight for sure is when I say expose,</v>

245
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean he's not talented.</v>

246
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean exposed,</v>

247
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>meaning he's a human and he can lose.</v>

248
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>And that happens with every fighter they lose.</v>

249
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:05.541
<v Speaker 1>And once they lose,</v>

250
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

251
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

252
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you can be beat.</v>

253
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

254
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>we saw it with Anderson Silva,</v>

255
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>you saw with Mike Tyson and when after Mike Tyson fought buster Douglas,</v>

256
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>who was a different world,</v>

257
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.411
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

258
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

259
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>oh he's human.</v>

260
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 1>So I say exposed not in a disrespectful way,</v>

261
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>but got exposed.</v>

262
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.221
<v Speaker 1>He lost,</v>

263
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:22.781
<v Speaker 1>he got choked out.</v>

264
00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I got beaten up on the ground and then he got choked out quick.</v>

265
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.430
<v Speaker 1>So this is not an invulnerable,</v>

266
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>perfect fighter who's unbelievably durable,</v>

267
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

268
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Who can take punishment like no man.</v>

269
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those guys in the UFC,</v>

270
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>there's champions like that in the UFC that are like Robbie Lawler.</v>

271
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably durable.</v>

272
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>You can't put them away.</v>

273
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hard to put that guy away.</v>

274
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about that.</v>

275
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a guy got dinged up,</v>

276
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>shot for a Shitty,</v>

277
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:47.410
<v Speaker 1>wide open takedown,</v>

278
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 1>got taken down and got demolished on the ground and got choked unconscious</v>

279
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 1>quickly afterwards.</v>

280
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.023
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

281
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.391
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

282
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:54.224
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

283
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Could that happen with dos Anjos fuck yet.</v>

284
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Could Dosantos could do that too?</v>

285
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.421
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

286
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean condom might knock 'em out.</v>

287
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.071
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

288
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Kind of does have that punch,</v>

289
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>but you got to put him in against Nate again cause that's the big money rematch.</v>

290
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.723
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

291
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 1>if this guy turns out to be a guy who's going to win some and lose some and the</v>

292
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 1>beginning of his career,</v>

293
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 1>this unbeatable wild Celtic warrior character.</v>

294
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's all gone.</v>

295
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.101
<v Speaker 1>But he's champ.</v>

296
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>He's still got a belt at one 45 yeah.</v>

297
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost kind of a,</v>

298
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>a weird position for now.</v>

299
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

300
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>here's my question.</v>

301
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.133
<v Speaker 1>When I say for now,</v>

302
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>can you really keep banking that weight?</v>

303
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

304
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Well I've wondered about that too.</v>

305
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I've heard some people have argued with me saying like,</v>

306
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:33.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

307
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 1>he can make the weight.</v>

308
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Cause he was,</v>

309
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.101
<v Speaker 1>he was what it was.</v>

310
00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:37.020
<v Speaker 1>He won 69 against Nate.</v>

311
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>So they're saying he basically,</v>

312
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 1>that's what he starts at and he can just cut down from there.</v>

313
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.353
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>

314
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>But look what he looked like at the,</v>

315
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:43.311
<v Speaker 1>at the way in.</v>

316
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you can,</v>

317
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean he kinda,</v>

318
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Speaker 1>he definitely can do it.</v>

319
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>It's physically possible.</v>

320
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I was so looking forward to the press conference though,</v>

321
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>just because I can't,</v>

322
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

323
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.720
<v Speaker 1>you've got this guy in Connor who is like the ultimate shit talker.</v>

324
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got Nate,</v>

325
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

326
00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:58.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

327
00:07:58.791 --> 00:07:59.271
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

328
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>the dynamic at the first press conference was amazing.</v>

329
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.593
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

330
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>And at that moment when he was just like kind of talking circles around Nate and</v>

331
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 1>they just broke and he goes,</v>

332
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>

333
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.021
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

334
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Fuck your belt.</v>

335
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this press conference.</v>

336
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Like they just went to gangster on them.</v>

337
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.710
<v Speaker 1>But now like how can con I was so interested,</v>

338
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>like how can he show up and talk shit like that when Nate's got the perfect</v>

339
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>rebuttal that anything he has to say 10 days,</v>

340
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>just saying all kinds of crazy stuff.</v>

341
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Like the first eight minutes were easy.</v>

342
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

343
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

344
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>but here's the difference between the first day,</v>

345
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 1>the last three minutes,</v>

346
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>the last three were a lot worse.</v>

347
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

348
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>they were awful.</v>

349
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you got fucked up,</v>

350
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:37.531
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

351
00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you got to just accept that?</v>

352
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.080
<v Speaker 1>But that's part of his thing is that he has to like look at things in the most</v>

353
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 1>positive light possible.</v>

354
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>And Man,</v>

355
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:47.924
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

356
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

357
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.130
<v Speaker 1>I think stylistically it's a troublesome fight for him because Nate is a very</v>

358
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:56.820
<v Speaker 1>clever boxer and his ground game is a world from where Connor is right now.</v>

359
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen Nate role with guys.</v>

360
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking legit,</v>

361
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>very high level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt under a very respected camp.</v>

362
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>His cardio is outstanding.</v>

363
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 1>His boxing's nasty.</v>

364
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>So where's Connor's shining?</v>

365
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>The only way I think,</v>

366
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:10.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

367
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:11.311
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's like,</v>

368
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:11.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:11.981
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

370
00:09:11.981 --> 00:09:14.940
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to like fight a Diaz brother and beat them.</v>

371
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>You're usually when people beat them,</v>

372
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:17.291
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like their,</v>

373
00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>they really stick to a strategy.</v>

374
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kind of take them down and avoid submissions or like leg kick and</v>

375
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:24.490
<v Speaker 1>circle on Joe's.</v>

376
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Beat him up in that way.</v>

377
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>But you know what,</v>

378
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>there's also different show up.</v>

379
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

380
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.461
<v Speaker 1>there's also,</v>

381
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:29.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

382
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 1>different camps.</v>

383
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

384
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you're coming in,</v>

385
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 1>who knows what kind of fucking injuries you're dealing with.</v>

386
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:34.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

387
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

388
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.710
<v Speaker 1>you see a guy like Nate come in and look really kind of lackadaisical against</v>

389
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Hofeld dos Anjos.</v>

390
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Then you see him come back and look shredded against Michael Johnson and looks</v>

391
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:46.201
<v Speaker 1>sensational.</v>

392
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:46.521
<v Speaker 1>So you go,</v>

393
00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

394
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>that's what he's capable of when he's on and focus,</v>

395
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be ready for that guy.</v>

396
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:50.941
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

397
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:51.061
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

398
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:52.070
<v Speaker 1>that's the best he's ever looked at.</v>

399
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 1>You got Michael Johnson fight.</v>

400
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 1>You can't think that the guy who lost dos Anjos is showing up.</v>

401
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think of the guy that came out,</v>

402
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 1>swarmed cowboy in the first round is common.</v>

403
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy's a clever fucking boxer.</v>

404
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>So where does Connor shine?</v>

405
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Knock out power.</v>

406
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>That's where he shines.</v>

407
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Like Connor can dead dudes.</v>

408
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:09.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

409
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

410
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.693
<v Speaker 1>They're tough to hit.</v>

411
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.030
<v Speaker 1>They have great head movement and Green Chins and they there,</v>

412
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 1>they roll with punches.</v>

413
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:15.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

414
00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>the only guy to ever stopped Nate was,</v>

415
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

416
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson and Josh did.</v>

417
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 1>It was a brutal head kick.</v>

418
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 1>And Josh Thompson to this day,</v>

419
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I say it's one of the most underrated guys.</v>

420
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

421
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

422
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:25.510
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

423
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 1>the stars did not align for him,</v>

424
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>but he could have easily been a UFC champion.</v>

425
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 1>He was champion a Strikeforce.</v>

426
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

427
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Speaker 1>And with Gilbert and him and Gilbert went back and forth,</v>

428
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson's worldclass fighters.</v>

430
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:37.740
<v Speaker 1>So when Josh Thompson head kicked him,</v>

431
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

432
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like Josh to do that to anybody in that division and then it catches you.</v>

433
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

434
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

435
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.550
<v Speaker 1>He sees an older now and he's just know,</v>

436
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a guy that like,</v>

437
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:47.371
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

438
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:49.040
<v Speaker 1>the stars didn't like perfectly aligned for,</v>

439
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 1>but like skill wise and technique wise,</v>

440
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.880
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking world class fighter.</v>

441
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.610
<v Speaker 1>So when he knocked out Nate Diaz,</v>

442
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily an indication that Nate Diaz is done,</v>

443
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>but he's just,</v>

444
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.590
<v Speaker 1>that's how good Josh Thompson is.</v>

446
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

447
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.873
<v Speaker 1>And at the time,</v>

448
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.541
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

449
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 1>so Nate rebounds from that.</v>

450
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think people you look at like the losses is like the dos Anjos fight.</v>

451
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 1>And you look at that,</v>

452
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>the Josh Thomson fight,</v>

453
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>

454
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

455
00:11:12.351 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>how good is he?</v>

456
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

457
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I can beat that guy.</v>

458
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 1>But then you look at the Michael Johnson finding go,</v>

459
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Woo that that guy is fucking dangerous.</v>

460
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.801
<v Speaker 1>Jim Miller.</v>

461
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Serone exactly.</v>

462
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Lot of these fights where was just unbelievable.</v>

463
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

464
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:24.721
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

465
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:25.554
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

466
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

467
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things were styles,</v>

468
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 1>make fights and,</v>

469
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.441

471
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like going in,</v>

472
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:31.711
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

473
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're going to get in Nate's head.</v>

474
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 1>My talking shit.</v>

475
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:34.830

476
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.220
