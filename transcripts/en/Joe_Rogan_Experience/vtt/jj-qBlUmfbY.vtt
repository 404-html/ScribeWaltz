<v Speaker 1>right up there with a lot of people like Richard Pryor.</v>

48
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

49

<v Speaker 1>Even though he didn't live very long died of pancreatic cancer when he's only in</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

52
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:01.054
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

53
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.470
<v Speaker 1>so he creates this,</v>

54
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:03.281
<v Speaker 1>this documentary,</v>

55
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>the American drug war.</v>

56
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

57
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>that's how I heard about you and I,</v>

58
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>and that's how I heard about,</v>

59
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>cause I had already,</v>

60
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I had already heard about Barry seals and Barry seal and his connection with the</v>

61
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>CIA and selling drugs.</v>

62
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't,</v>

63
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know of any one person like you who could be directly connected to the</v>

64
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>dude that was connected to Nicaragua that was connected to Oliver North and that</v>

65
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.390
<v Speaker 1>the whole chain of events.</v>

66
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.141
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

67
00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:26.731
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

68
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

69
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I think when a window,</v>

70
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 2>when Glen on testified against me,</v>

71
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.430
<v Speaker 2>he talked about</v>

72
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 2>his balls to going on a fishing ship with a George Bush senior.</v>

73
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

74
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.220
<v Speaker 1>When the kid went,</v>

75
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 1>now Barry seal was murdered.</v>

76
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:41.980
<v Speaker 1>He had George Bush phone number in his pocket</v>

77
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>as deep as it gets Migraine,</v>

78
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>a tracking device in that phone number.</v>

79
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.073
<v Speaker 1>I know where you at.</v>

81
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile,</v>

82
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>and meanwhile,</v>

83
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>no one goes to jail.</v>

84
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>No one on that side goes to jail.</v>

85
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

86
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>No one goes to jail,</v>

87
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.683
<v Speaker 1>I should day.</v>

88
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing they make the laws.</v>

89
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>But how the fuck did they let you out at work?</v>

90
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

91
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 1>they only you,</v>

92
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>you went in for 20 years.</v>

93
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I had a life sentence man.</v>

94
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 2>And how'd you get out early?</v>

95
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Learning how to read and write and study the law.</v>

96
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.310
<v Speaker 2>And finally loophole.</v>

97
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.233
<v Speaker 2>What was the loophole?</v>

98
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

99
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 2>what they did is they charged me under the three strike law and what they were</v>

100
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 2>saying is that since I had got convicted and all these different states,</v>

101
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 2>that those added up to three strikes.</v>

102
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 2>But what they didn't see in the,</v>

103
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 2>in the law is that in order to get struck out,</v>

104
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to prison,</v>

105
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 2>get out and committed another crime,</v>

106
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.273
<v Speaker 2>go to prison,</v>

107
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 2>get out and they commit the third one.</v>

108
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's three strikes.</v>

109
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>So we can't get you on three felonies before you're ever convicted.</v>

110
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.720
<v Speaker 2>That three strikes,</v>

111
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.220
<v Speaker 2>three strikes if,</v>

112
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

113
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

114
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 2>if safe hands.</v>

115
00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 2>And what I use is,</v>

116
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:53.750
<v Speaker 2>is a guy standing out.</v>

117
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:54.980
<v Speaker 2>When I used to stand out on the street,</v>

118
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Speaker 2>I used to make hundreds of sales a day right there on that one block.</v>

119
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>So I said no.</v>

120
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 2>If somebody wanted to,</v>

121
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 2>they could have gave me a hundred convictions because I saw different people</v>

122
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 2>every time.</v>

123
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.463
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

124
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.530
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't believe that the law meant that every sale you may was a separate</v>

125
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.704
<v Speaker 2>conviction.</v>

126
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I believe that they meant just like I just explained it.</v>

127
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

128
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.571
<v Speaker 2>Because if so,</v>

129
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>then everybody who ever sold cocaine,</v>

130
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

131
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Three strikes and it makes sense because the idea is supposed to be</v>

132
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>theoretically that jail is supposed to be able to really rehabilitate.</v>

133
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

134
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.090
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

135
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>So if you are unreal habilitate double,</v>

136
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>if you've gone through two separate times and you're still out doing the same</v>

137
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

138
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.591
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

139
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>well this dude's a career criminal.</v>

140
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>This is his third offense done.</v>

141
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

142
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's how the law was rolled up.</v>

143
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Even though I don't believe you should play baseball with people lives.</v>

144
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

145
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Because the person could not be changed at one time and then be changed tomorrow</v>

146
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 2>and then his circumstances changed.</v>

147
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 2>And he may be in a different position.</v>

148
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

149
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 2>before you can start passing judge judgment on people,</v>

150
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 2>you have the live in their shoes and you know,</v>

151
00:03:57.581 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 2>that's why people ask me now,</v>

152
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:02.310
<v Speaker 2>how do I feel about drug dealers and I'm gonna and then it gets him,</v>

153
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 2>they'd do what they feel like they got to do or what they know they got to do.</v>

154
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:06.964
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

155
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

156
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 2>before we pass judgment,</v>

157
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>we have to get all the facts and live in that person's shoes,</v>

158
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 2>the fee,</v>

159
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 2>if we would do the same thing that they did.</v>

160
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.950
<v Speaker 1>And you're a perfect example of that.</v>

161
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.903
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

162
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>

163
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.410
<v Speaker 1>you're away.</v>

164
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.700
<v Speaker 1>You went away for 20 years,</v>

165
00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:20.810
<v Speaker 1>you find this loophole.</v>

166
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.200
<v Speaker 1>How deep into your sentence had you had already figured out how to read?</v>

167
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.440
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

168
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>how long have you started reading it?</v>

169
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Immediately,</v>

170
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.343
<v Speaker 2>right away.</v>

171
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Take classes there and I taught my,</v>

172
00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:30.971
<v Speaker 2>me and my celly,</v>

173
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:31.820
<v Speaker 2>he taught me how to read.</v>

174
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.790
<v Speaker 2>He made me some cue cards with my ABC's on them and her cool.</v>

175
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.391
<v Speaker 2>And went from,</v>

176
00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:40.391
<v Speaker 2>from nose to a reading my indictment to reading the newspapers to a Tureen law</v>

177
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:41.330
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

178
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

179
00:04:41.661 --> 00:04:41.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

180
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:45.020
<v Speaker 2>for the first time when I found out is that I had never wanted to read before in</v>

181
00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:45.854
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

182
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.270
<v Speaker 2>That was the real problem.</v>

183
00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I never really wanted to read.</v>

184
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

185
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

186
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see any reason why Jack and Jill went up the hill and why I should</v>

187
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:53.624
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

188
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.490
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

189
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.860
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have it when Jason no money.</v>

190
00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:01.730
<v Speaker 2>I would say some money.</v>

191
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.171
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

192
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:02.381
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

193
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

194
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.431
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

195
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't interesting to you.</v>

196
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't interesting to me.</v>

197
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>But then once you realize,</v>

198
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:07.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

199
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:09.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of information that I don't have access to.</v>

200
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I became an advocate reading.</v>

201
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.090
<v Speaker 2>I read over 300 books before I left prison.</v>

202
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

203
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

204
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

205
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 1>You've read more books than I have in my lifetime.</v>

206
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

207
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.040

211
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.760
<v Speaker 1>At what point in time did you start devising a plan to try to like figure out a</v>

212
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>way to get out of there?</v>

213
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

214
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.950

217
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.820

219
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.781
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they knew how to fight the system and then they had like guys that all they did</v>

221
00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.580
<v Speaker 2>all day was sit there and study the law.</v>

222
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

223
00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:48.500
<v Speaker 2>they would sit at the table while other people were playing cards and chess and</v>

224
00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:49.334
<v Speaker 2>Domino's.</v>

225
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.630
<v Speaker 2>They would be studying the law.</v>

226
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.290
<v Speaker 2>So I got,</v>

227
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I got in with those guys.</v>

228
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.110
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be kind of a crazy feeling,</v>

229
00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

230
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's just hoping you can crack this fucking system.</v>

231
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.621
<v Speaker 1>Got You.</v>

232
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Locked</v>

233
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 2>up is tough.</v>

234
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 2>What is the hedge to hurt daily?</v>

235
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:02.751
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>

236
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 2>you got like migraine headaches and you sitting in this concrete building,</v>

237
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to draw a picture for you.</v>

238
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>You sitting in this concrete building is 28 stories high.</v>

239
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

240
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 2>nothing but concrete and steel.</v>

241
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.190
<v Speaker 2>The windows are about three inches wide open and about six feet long</v>

242
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.733
<v Speaker 2>escaped.</v>

243
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 2>It looks almost impossible.</v>

244
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.801
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

245
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 2>you think about that too.</v>

246
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:29.001
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

247
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 2>if I had a long rope,</v>

248
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I could scale the side of the building.</v>

249
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.661
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

250
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:33.494
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

251
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 2>it's like a desperation,</v>

252
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:35.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:35.961
<v Speaker 2>and you're saying,</v>

254
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:36.171
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

255
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:41.171
<v Speaker 2>it gotta be one loophole in these books because you know that if you can show</v>

256
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 2>them in the book where they made a mistake or where the book says that they</v>

257
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 2>should have did this,</v>

258
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 2>when they did that,</v>

259
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.651
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

260
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 2>you got action.</v>

261
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.611
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

262
00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:50.821
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

263
00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 2>you're getting headaches just from thinking and reading too much.</v>

264
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

265
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:54.820
<v Speaker 2>That's all you want to do.</v>

266
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.260
<v Speaker 2>You just want to stand them books.</v>

267
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:56.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

268
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

269
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I got a life sentence,</v>

270
00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:06:58.421 --> 00:06:59.380
<v Speaker 2>when you've got a life sentence,</v>

272
00:06:59.381 --> 00:07:00.820
<v Speaker 2>it's like this is forever.</v>

273
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.571
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

274
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:03.580
<v Speaker 2>this is all you're going to see for the rest of your life,</v>

275
00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:04.001
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

276
00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:04.834
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

277
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

278
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think that was fitting for me.</v>

279
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.290
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that they convicted you for life on that three strikes law.</v>

280
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.310
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you should be able to go after them for abusing the law,</v>

281
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:16.600
<v Speaker 2>which should be criminal.</v>

282
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:16.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

283
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:17.321
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

284
00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you can't go at the federal prosecutor.</v>

285
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:19.834
<v Speaker 2>He's immune.</v>

286
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.531
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

287
00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 2>From,</v>

288
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.160
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

289
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.640
<v Speaker 2>from prosecution because he,</v>

290
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.240
<v Speaker 2>he's not working as an individual.</v>

291
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's been proven that he's corrupt.</v>

292
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe if you can prove he's he's corrupt but we're not because he</v>

293
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.150
<v Speaker 2>incompetent and justly that yeah.</v>

294
00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:34.870
<v Speaker 2>In combination.</v>

295
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.703
<v Speaker 2>In your case,</v>

296
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.170
<v Speaker 2>if he does something to you,</v>

298
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.780
<v Speaker 2>you could charge you with a thousand keys even though you only had one,</v>

300
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.630
<v Speaker 2>and if you've got a thousand keys,</v>

302
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:43.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

303
00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:44.920
<v Speaker 2>that gives you a life sentence.</v>

304
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.753
<v Speaker 2>If you got one,</v>

305
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

306
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:47.200
<v Speaker 2>you get probation.</v>

307
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.880
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

308
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.773
<v Speaker 2>if it's powder,</v>

309
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:51.321
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

310
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:52.990
<v Speaker 2>that's a thing people don't know about that.</v>

311
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

312
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Not Crap because crack was in the ghetto and powder was all these,</v>

313
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.440
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>

315
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 2>these people that had money were using the powder.</v>

316
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Crack is way more illegal.</v>

317
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

318
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:07.090
<v Speaker 2>It was a hundred to 100 to one.</v>

319
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:07.983
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

320
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.310
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

321
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:09.781
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

322
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.810
<v Speaker 2>is that racist?</v>

323
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Very racist.</v>

324
00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 2>And it has to be right.</v>

325
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.690
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

326
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

327
00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:16.270
<v Speaker 2>and even though they just changed it 18 to one,</v>

328
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I think that was still,</v>

329
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.630
<v Speaker 2>why isn't it one to one?</v>

330
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I said because they already proved,</v>

331
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I sat down on the couch with the guy who invented the law.</v>

333
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

334
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

335
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be in the documentary six six,</v>

336
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:29.950
<v Speaker 2>six documentary after you're out.</v>

337
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 2>You sat down with the,</v>

338
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.320
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing that since I've been out.</v>

339
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing the documentary since I've been out and,</v>

340
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:35.770
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

341
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:36.101
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

342
00:08:36.101 --> 00:08:39.790
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that I got mad about even with Obama and his</v>

343
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:41.740
<v Speaker 2>administration is that they didn't make it one on one.</v>

344
00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:46.180
<v Speaker 2>And then even after they made it 1801 they left it for guys who have been in 20</v>

345
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:46.451
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

346
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:47.261
<v Speaker 2>25 years,</v>

347
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:48.490
<v Speaker 2>they didn't make it retroactive.</v>

348
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Meaning that they don't get out.</v>

349
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 2>They don't get no benefit from the,</v>

350
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:53.260
<v Speaker 2>from the 18 to one.</v>

351
00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:54.220
<v Speaker 2>It's guys right now,</v>

352
00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:54.611
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>

353
00:08:54.611 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 2>if they the 18 one,</v>

354
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 2>they will walk out of prison today.</v>

355
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

356
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.840

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.370

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.061
<v Speaker 2>cause you know,</v>

00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Clinton signed the bill where you're 2155.</v>

364
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 2>You've got one year after you convicted to come up with newly discovered</v>

365
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

366
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.290

<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>

369
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:18.161
<v Speaker 2>say a few minutes.</v>

370
00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 2>If you go to prison unjustly and you do all your appeals and everything,</v>

371
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.593
<v Speaker 2>one year,</v>

372
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 2>you got one year to prove yourself innocent.</v>

373
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Now after that one year,</v>

374
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 2>if you don't find it and then a day after that one year you find this newly</v>

375
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 2>discovered evidence,</v>

376
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 2>you can't even submit it to the coach.</v>

377
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.513
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

378
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be maddening.</v>

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:40.351
<v Speaker 2>It's maddening.</v>

380
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:41.360

381
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:41.570

383
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:46.524
<v Speaker 2>to hear it.</v>

384
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.550
<v Speaker 1>So when you went to jail for this,</v>

385
00:09:48.551 --> 00:09:49.900
<v Speaker 1>so when you're finally in prison,</v>

386
00:09:49.901 --> 00:09:50.151

387
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:50.290

388
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.320
<v Speaker 1>was this the first time you'd ever been in prison other than the one time you</v>

389
00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:55.390
<v Speaker 1>got arrested and you stayed in there for awhile?</v>

390
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:55.851
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

391
00:09:55.851 --> 00:09:56.220

394
00:09:58.311 --> 00:09:59.330
<v Speaker 2>I've been to jail twice.</v>

396
00:10:00.791 --> 00:10:01.624

397
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.471

00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:02.591
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

399
00:10:02.591 --> 00:10:04.120
<v Speaker 1>How long did you go away for the first time?</v>

400
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.360
<v Speaker 2>A five and a half years.</v>

401
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.613
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

402
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.570
<v Speaker 2>So you were in the second time I was in trapped.</v>

403
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even go into that point when I was in trap because I wasn't selling</v>

404
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:12.734
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

405
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I was building a youth center because when I did is I figured out what kids in</v>

406
00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:21.830
<v Speaker 2>the ghetto need to get them out of gangs and drugs.</v>

407
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I know what they need.</v>

408
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.980
<v Speaker 2>So when I did is I bought,</v>

409
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.270

<v Speaker 2>They need somebody to come and and,</v>

414
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.700
<v Speaker 2>and walk them through it.</v>

415
00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Somebody they can go and talk to when they need to talk to him,</v>

416
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

417
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:39.440
<v Speaker 2>not talk to him once they already been corrupted and their heads are already in</v>

418
00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:39.741
<v Speaker 2>the game,</v>

419
00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:40.760
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to hear you then,</v>

420
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

421
00:10:41.091 --> 00:10:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I already got my mind made up.</v>

422
00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm doing.</v>

428
00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:00.100

00:11:16.221 --> 00:11:17.210
<v Speaker 2>nothing in south central.</v>

441
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.390
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

442
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.460

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>so you said you got set up.</v>

444
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.550
<v Speaker 1>This is the last time.</v>

445
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

446
00:11:24.191 --> 00:11:24.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

447
00:11:24.431 --> 00:11:25.450
<v Speaker 2>When I got the life sentence,</v>

448
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.440
<v Speaker 2>this guy called me.</v>

449
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not selling drugs,</v>

450
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.810
<v Speaker 2>selling drugs are on,</v>

451
00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:29.020
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

452
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

453
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't sold drugs and six years,</v>

454
00:11:32.861 --> 00:11:33.694
<v Speaker 2>seven years.</v>

455
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

456
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.260
<v Speaker 2>How did you stop?</v>

457
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.603
<v Speaker 2>I just quit.</v>

458
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Did you quit after you got arrested?</v>

459
00:11:38.081 --> 00:11:39.280
<v Speaker 2>The first time in five years.</v>

460
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.200
<v Speaker 2>I quit a year and a half before I went to prison.</v>

461
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.711
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

462
00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:42.310
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

463
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm through with this.</v>

464
00:11:42.971 --> 00:11:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

465
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I got eight $900,000 cash.</v>

466
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I've got property all over the place.</v>

467
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.030
<v Speaker 2>All I got to do now is make this property and stuff work for me and you know</v>

468
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I've got enough money to hold me off for awhile.</v>

469
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.503
<v Speaker 2>I'm through with it.</v>

470
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 2>So I walked away from the game.</v>

471
00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.490
<v Speaker 1>So I'm confused as on your timeline here because when you were 20 years old,</v>

472
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.790
<v Speaker 1>that's when you started and then when you were 28 you got arrested.</v>

473
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.331
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

474
00:12:05.331 --> 00:12:06.860
<v Speaker 1>But you did five years in jail,</v>

475
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:08.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

476
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Where's the five years?</v>

477
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I did five years in 89 I went to prison.</v>

478
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.113
<v Speaker 1>How old were you then?</v>

479
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.540
<v Speaker 1>28 Dash 28 28 and a half.</v>

480
00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:20.510
<v Speaker 1>You go to jail for five years and then you get out for,</v>

481
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I got out,</v>

482
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I got off for six months for six months and then they give you the life</v>

483
00:12:24.081 --> 00:12:24.914
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

484
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.023
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

485
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.073
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

486
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So the life sentences,</v>

487
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:29.840
<v Speaker 1>a total setup.</v>

488
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.423
<v Speaker 2>Total setup.</v>

489
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:32.743
<v Speaker 2>Total entrapment.</v>

490
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I was not selling drugs.</v>

491
00:12:33.951 --> 00:12:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Then they'll call me in a matter of fact,</v>

492
00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:38.150
<v Speaker 2>he called me the day I got a prison.</v>

493
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

494
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.220
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

495
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:40.461
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

496
00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:41.091
<v Speaker 2>I need to see you.</v>

497
00:12:41.091 --> 00:12:41.361
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

498
00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:41.541
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

499
00:12:41.541 --> 00:12:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm kicking it with my mom.</v>

500
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:43.101
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

501
00:12:43.101 --> 00:12:45.770
<v Speaker 2>my mom came and see me and stuff like that.</v>

502
00:12:45.771 --> 00:12:46.071
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

503
00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm kicking it with my mom.</v>

504
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool.</v>

505
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I hydrogen a couple of days.</v>

506
00:12:48.861 --> 00:12:52.070
<v Speaker 2>So when I finally going to highlight and he's telling me how man,</v>

507
00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.180
<v Speaker 2>I got it at this price,</v>

508
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.081
<v Speaker 2>at that price,</v>

509
00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:54.914
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

510
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:55.850
<v Speaker 2>that's a good price.</v>

511
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.840
<v Speaker 2>And all this is recorded too.</v>

512
00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:01.580
<v Speaker 2>So that didn't help.</v>

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:02.030

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:04.640

<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>

578
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Most police officers at this point in time believe that should ignite hired cops</v>

579
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.030
<v Speaker 1>to kill biggie smalls and that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fascinating shit that the cops were so dirty that the cops were working with</v>

587
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.860
<v Speaker 1>gang members.</v>

588
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.970
<v Speaker 1>They're working with murderers,</v>

589
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:50.880
<v Speaker 1>working with criminals and making money clearly profiting.</v>

590
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

591
00:14:51.871 --> 00:14:52.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:52.751
<v Speaker 2>cops man,</v>

593
00:14:52.751 --> 00:14:53.910
<v Speaker 2>they just like everybody else,</v>

594
00:14:53.911 --> 00:14:54.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

595
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.640
<v Speaker 2>they lie,</v>

596
00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.540
<v Speaker 2>cheat and all other things that the normal person goes through in life.</v>

597
00:15:00.541 --> 00:15:02.490
<v Speaker 2>So I don't put nothing past him,</v>

598
00:15:02.491 --> 00:15:04.560
<v Speaker 2>especially when you start putting all that money on the table.</v>

599
00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:04.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

600
00:15:04.801 --> 00:15:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I remember my first young guy who got arrested by him and they stole his money.</v>

601
00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:10.770
<v Speaker 2>He was like 16 years old,</v>

602
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:11.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:14.640
<v Speaker 2>the cops just raided my house.</v>

607
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:15.661
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:18.541
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:19.251
<v Speaker 2>what'd you am?</v>

616
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:19.531
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

617
00:15:19.531 --> 00:15:19.711
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

618
00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I had like $40,000.</v>

619
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.171
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

620
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.004
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

621
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.061
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

622
00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:24.271
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

623
00:15:24.271 --> 00:15:26.640
<v Speaker 2>they asked me who money was and I told him it wasn't mine.</v>

624
00:15:26.641 --> 00:15:27.540
<v Speaker 2>They told me to go.</v>

625
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.290
<v Speaker 2>So when he got out,</v>

626
00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:32.160
<v Speaker 2>when I got with him,</v>

627
00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:32.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

628
00:15:32.701 --> 00:15:33.511
<v Speaker 2>we call the lawyer,</v>

629
00:15:33.511 --> 00:15:34.111
<v Speaker 2>you're in total oil,</v>

630
00:15:34.111 --> 00:15:34.710
<v Speaker 2>you hey man,</v>

631
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.600
<v Speaker 2>it was $40,000 at that house,</v>

632
00:15:36.601 --> 00:15:37.421
<v Speaker 2>but wasn't no drug.</v>

633
00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:38.400
<v Speaker 2>So he called and they said,</v>

634
00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:38.581
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

635
00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:39.660
<v Speaker 2>with no money at that house.</v>

636
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

637
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:43.510
<v Speaker 1>That's super common,</v>

638
00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:44.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

639
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

640
00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:44.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

641
00:15:44.591 --> 00:15:45.640
<v Speaker 1>That happened all the time.</v>

642
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no one policing the police.</v>

643
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no one governing the government.</v>

644
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a real issue.</v>

645
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.860
<v Speaker 1>They got the beginner,</v>

646
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.790
<v Speaker 1>they got the guns.</v>

647
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

648
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.871
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

649
00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:57.250
<v Speaker 1>they can change the laws.</v>

650
00:15:57.251 --> 00:15:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean we see what the fuck is going on now with this country.</v>

651
00:15:59.441 --> 00:16:02.020
<v Speaker 1>It was like every week they'd come up with some new,</v>

652
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.490
<v Speaker 1>even more restrictive,</v>

653
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.010
<v Speaker 1>even more or wetland law that gets through.</v>

654
00:16:06.011 --> 00:16:08.920
<v Speaker 1>That allows them to tap your phones with no wire,</v>

655
00:16:08.921 --> 00:16:09.701
<v Speaker 1>with no warrants.</v>

656
00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Rather,</v>

657
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

658
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.360
<v Speaker 1>listening on your phone calls,</v>

659
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.870
<v Speaker 1>tap your fucking gps systems that could follow everywhere you go.</v>

660
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And they can do all this shit without warrants now.</v>

661
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And they do it supposedly under the guise of terrorism.</v>

662
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.110
<v Speaker 1>But it's really under the guise of making it easier for them to prosecute you</v>

663
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:29.710
<v Speaker 1>for whatever the fuck they want to cause he's a goddamn business and locking</v>

664
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:30.910
<v Speaker 1>people up in cages.</v>

665
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.671
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

666
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

667
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.410
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they into.</v>

668
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 1>So you find your loophole and then you chase after it,</v>

669
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.370
<v Speaker 1>you're in jail.</v>

670
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

671
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.120
<v Speaker 1>And then once you find it,</v>

672
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Luke,</v>

673
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I remember that day when I read it in the book,</v>

674
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.881
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

675
00:16:42.881 --> 00:16:43.714
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

676
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.390
<v Speaker 2>he just like popped out at me.</v>

677
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.293
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

678
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:47.890
<v Speaker 2>go to jail,</v>

679
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.800
<v Speaker 2>commit a crime and get released.</v>

680
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I started to the phone to call my minority.</v>

681
00:16:53.141 --> 00:16:53.381
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>

682
00:16:53.381 --> 00:16:53.561
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

683
00:16:53.561 --> 00:16:54.394
<v Speaker 2>I found it.</v>

684
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.423
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

685
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 1>So what happens then</v>

686
00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.830
<v Speaker 2>where was discouraging what he said after he read it,</v>

687
00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:01.360
<v Speaker 2>he didn't see it the same way I did.</v>

688
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.090
<v Speaker 1>You're a better lawyer than your fucking lawyer</v>

689
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:06.630
<v Speaker 1>come harbor.</v>

690
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

691
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.810
<v Speaker 1>I should get an honorary degree.</v>

692
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

693
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:13.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

694
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.890
<v Speaker 2>so I just told him to put it on the books,</v>

695
00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:16.161
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

696
00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Then the judge went through her thing.</v>

697
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:17.811
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

698
00:17:17.811 --> 00:17:18.541
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Ross.</v>

699
00:17:18.541 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 2>It's not the way you said is.</v>

700
00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:20.810
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

701
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:21.380
<v Speaker 2>can you,</v>

702
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 2>she must came read if she can't read that she can't read.</v>

703
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 2>So then the prosecutor went through his whole thing,</v>

704
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 2>but then I went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and they agreed with me</v>

705
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:32.630
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

706
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

707
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.410

708
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

709
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.461

00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

711
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.220

712
00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:40.130
<v Speaker 2>everybody would be career criminals on their first arrest.</v>

713
00:17:40.131 --> 00:17:40.964
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

714
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

715
00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Literally everybody would be in life.</v>

716
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Here I am life.</v>

717
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Here I am.</v>

718
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

719
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 1>So nice sort of ninth circuit court appeals.</v>

720
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 2>They agree with you,</v>

721
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 2>they side with you.</v>

722
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:52.471
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

723
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:53.520

724
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:53.911
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

725
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Speaker 2>and I had nine more years to do,</v>

726
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:55.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

727
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

728
00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Why nine more years?</v>

729
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

730
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 2>that's just where it was.</v>

731
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:01.501
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

732
00:18:01.501 --> 00:18:02.670
<v Speaker 2>that's how much time I had left.</v>

733
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 2>So you had $20 cut me down.</v>

734
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:05.941

<v Speaker 2>I had a life,</v>

737
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.100
<v Speaker 2>but they took me down to 20.</v>

738
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.040
<v Speaker 2>So the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals cut you down a 20.</v>

739
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

805
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.360
<v Speaker 2>You know the guy sitting in his chair and the guy walks up behind him and just</v>

806

807
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.173
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

808
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:39.901
<v Speaker 2>brutal,</v>

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

820
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.570
<v Speaker 2>I've seen guys get stabbed.</v>

821
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

822
00:19:58.561 --> 00:19:59.394
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking a shower.</v>

823
00:19:59.410 --> 00:19:59.671
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

824
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:00.660
<v Speaker 2>you hear this loud noise,</v>

825
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:02.400
<v Speaker 2>like just kept bumping up against the wall.</v>

826
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.761
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

827
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:03.060
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

828
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:03.271
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

829
00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Really violently,</v>

830
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:04.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

831
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:04.861
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

832
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:06.540
<v Speaker 2>this is somebody's body,</v>

833
00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:06.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

834
00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:09.060
<v Speaker 2>like why would somebody be hitting the wall this hard?</v>

835
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:09.923
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

836
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.243
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

837
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:16.110
<v Speaker 2>so I can wrap my towel up and I look my head out the shower and I see this guy</v>

838
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:17.220
<v Speaker 2>and this guy stabbing him.</v>

839
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 2>And so to get off tonight,</v>

840
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:22.500
<v Speaker 2>he's just throwing this back and he hit everything up against the wall trying to</v>

841
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:23.460
<v Speaker 2>get away from the knife.</v>

842
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.380
<v Speaker 2>So it was really violent.</v>

843
00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:25.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

844
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.880
<v Speaker 2>prison is really violent.</v>

845
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

846
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 2>you have to be careful,</v>

847
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.970
<v Speaker 2>especially in the USP,</v>

848
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.670
<v Speaker 2>the USP or when the loans are dangerous too,</v>

849
00:20:33.671 --> 00:20:36.160
<v Speaker 2>but not as dangerous as USP because these guys don't have nothing to,</v>

850
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Speaker 2>what does the USP US penitentiary,</v>

851
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.180
<v Speaker 2>penitentiary.</v>

852
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.013
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference?</v>

853
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.203
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

854
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:43.831
<v Speaker 2>say for instance,</v>

855
00:20:43.831 --> 00:20:44.850
<v Speaker 2>the FCI,</v>

856
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.460
<v Speaker 2>you can't have more than 20 years and be at Fci if you have more than 20.</v>

857
00:20:49.461 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 2>FCIS stands for a federal correctional institution.</v>

858
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 2>That's like a medium.</v>

859
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

860
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.210
<v Speaker 2>So if you could have more than than,</v>

861
00:20:57.211 --> 00:20:58.150
<v Speaker 2>than than 20 years,</v>

862
00:20:58.151 --> 00:20:59.410
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go to a USP.</v>

863
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:00.551
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

864
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 2>if you go to a FCI and you've got 20 years,</v>

865
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 2>but you keep getting into trouble fights and you know something,</v>

866
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 2>maybe you stabbed somebody and then they're going to send you to a USP in the</v>

867
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.340
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

868
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:09.671
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

869
00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:10.181
<v Speaker 2>you go up here,</v>

870
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:11.620
<v Speaker 2>these guys can handle stabbings.</v>

871
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.270
<v Speaker 2>So they're there,</v>

872
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.930
<v Speaker 2>they'll boost you up and then they got what they call it,</v>

873
00:21:15.931 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 2>a low is for the guys.</v>

874
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 2>We've got like five years,</v>

875
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 2>six years.</v>

876
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Then you go to a low.</v>

877
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 2>So they kind of keep it separated like that by your violence,</v>

878
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 2>by how much you're getting in trouble,</v>

879
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.493
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

880
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 1>So the USP is the most dangerous.</v>

881
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the most absolutely African murderers,</v>

882
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 1>life sentences.</v>

883
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And then they had guys from all over the country safe and [inaudible],</v>

884
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Washington DC and,</v>

885
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

886
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.063
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

887
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.950
<v Speaker 2>you been getting in trouble in Washington DC.</v>

888
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Then they shipped you down to California to keep you out of trouble.</v>

889
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:46.091
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

890
00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:47.650
<v Speaker 2>some of those guys from DC or really,</v>

891
00:21:47.651 --> 00:21:48.484
<v Speaker 2>really violent.</v>

892
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.820
<v Speaker 2>And what they do is they take all the bad,</v>

893
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.250
<v Speaker 2>it's guys from all over the country and they put them in u s sps.</v>

894
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.570
<v Speaker 2>So you may have a,</v>

895
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 2>a thing where guys are fighting over territory,</v>

896
00:21:58.511 --> 00:21:59.440
<v Speaker 2>like the TV,</v>

897
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:00.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

898
00:22:00.341 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 2>like the DC guys or the Philadelphia guys might say,</v>

899
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:03.761
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

900
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:05.230
<v Speaker 2>we want to watch this program tonight,</v>

901
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 2>the Philadelphia 76 or the plans.</v>

902
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:10.240
<v Speaker 2>So we want to watch Philadelphia 76 in the night because you're always watching</v>

903
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:11.074
<v Speaker 2>the Lakers.</v>

904
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.310
<v Speaker 2>So that could cause a fight.</v>

905
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:13.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

906
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.411
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

907
00:22:13.411 --> 00:22:14.740
<v Speaker 2>it's of like territorial,</v>

908
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

909
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:16.024
<v Speaker 2>the way it works.</v>

910
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Did you get an anti violent interaction?</v>

911
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>

912
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.051
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>

913
00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I stayed in the law library.</v>

914
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

915
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.890
<v Speaker 1>They don't come in a law library and fight.</v>

916
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.121
<v Speaker 1>So how did you,</v>

917
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:26.590
<v Speaker 1>that's how you avoided everything.</v>

918
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time.</v>

919
00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.550
<v Speaker 2>And the only time I really would put myself in a,</v>

920
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:30.960
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

921
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.291
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

922
00:22:31.291 --> 00:22:34.260
<v Speaker 2>in harm's way is when,</v>

923
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.430
<v Speaker 2>when football season,</v>

924
00:22:35.431 --> 00:22:35.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

925
00:22:35.641 --> 00:22:38.070
<v Speaker 2>I played flag football with the guys.</v>

926
00:22:38.071 --> 00:22:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I played basketball with them.</v>

927
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

928
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.910
<v Speaker 2>but I always had a mentality to,</v>

929
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.360
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

930
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.180
<v Speaker 2>to diffuse anything that they'd ever happened.</v>

931
00:22:45.181 --> 00:22:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't fight,</v>

932
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

933
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.160
<v Speaker 2>if somebody filed me hard on the basketball court,</v>

934
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.730
<v Speaker 2>it was my fault because I put myself on the basketball court.</v>

935
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.120
<v Speaker 2>If I file somebody hard on the basketball court,</v>

936
00:22:57.121 --> 00:22:59.550
<v Speaker 2>it was my fault because I filed anymore.</v>

937
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.270
<v Speaker 2>So I would always apologize to guys when I fired him hard.</v>

938
00:23:03.271 --> 00:23:04.560
<v Speaker 2>But that's just the type of person I am.</v>

939
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

940
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.120
<v Speaker 2>when I played basketball,</v>

941
00:23:06.121 --> 00:23:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to hurt anybody,</v>

942
00:23:07.111 --> 00:23:08.130
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I do,</v>

943
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

944
00:23:08.491 --> 00:23:09.450
<v Speaker 2>I filed a lot,</v>

945
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:10.441
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

946
00:23:10.441 --> 00:23:10.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

947
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:11.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

948
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

949
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:11.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

950
00:23:11.581 --> 00:23:12.414
<v Speaker 2>I got along well,</v>

951
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:12.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

952
00:23:12.751 --> 00:23:15.440
<v Speaker 2>people respected me and I show the utmost respect.</v>

953
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

954
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Did you have to align yourself with any groups in prison?</v>

955
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.441
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

956
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:20.921
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

957
00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:25.921
<v Speaker 2>even though I am adopted by most groups,</v>

958
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

959
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:30.550
<v Speaker 2>they adopt me most groups and most of the groups in DL adopt me,</v>

960
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

961
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

962

<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody,</v>

963

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

964
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 2>the Philadelphia guys that decrypts the bloods,</v>

965
00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.573

00:23:40.061 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm just cold without all of them,</v>

970
00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

971
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

972
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.740
<v Speaker 2>the only one probably is not as as is is,</v>

973
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.133
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

974
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

975
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Cerenia hose and ham brothers are probably the only two groups that,</v>

976
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.451
<v Speaker 1>but it's a certainty.</v>

977
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I was Mexicans and then the Aaron Brothers obviously kick your k dude.</v>

981
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:00.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

982
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:01.364

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

984

<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

987
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.210
<v Speaker 2>we don't hang out but they don't hang out with blacks</v>

988
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.250
<v Speaker 1>the day you got out of jail,</v>

989
00:24:09.251 --> 00:24:09.790
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

990
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:14.350
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was that like the day you get out of 20 years knowing that you got</v>

991
00:24:14.351 --> 00:24:14.710
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

992
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:15.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

993
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:15.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

994
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.190
<v Speaker 2>hair by hair.</v>

995
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.473
<v Speaker 2>It was luck.</v>

996
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:19.511
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>

997
00:24:19.511 --> 00:24:20.161
<v Speaker 2>it was guys,</v>

998
00:24:20.161 --> 00:24:23.310
<v Speaker 2>when I was in prison it was guys who had the same issue I had.</v>

999
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:24.960
<v Speaker 2>It didn't get out.</v>

1000
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1001
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:27.960
<v Speaker 2>They will argue that almost the same way.</v>

1002
00:24:27.961 --> 00:24:28.451
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1003
00:24:28.451 --> 00:24:29.191
<v Speaker 2>a matter of fact,</v>

1004
00:24:29.191 --> 00:24:32.640
<v Speaker 2>we are trying to get the guy who was the first guy to get a life sentence for</v>

1005
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.533
<v Speaker 2>selling crack.</v>

1006
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.820
<v Speaker 2>We tried to get his interview and his issue was,</v>

1007
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.320
<v Speaker 2>it was almost identical to mine.</v>

1008
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Just a little different though,</v>

1009
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.050
<v Speaker 2>but close.</v>

1010
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:40.841
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>

1011
00:24:40.841 --> 00:24:41.730
<v Speaker 2>he's in for life.</v>

1012
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.481
<v Speaker 2>He's in for life.</v>

1013
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:44.010
<v Speaker 2>And he was only like 20 years old,</v>

1014
00:24:44.011 --> 00:24:44.844
<v Speaker 2>19 years old.</v>

1015
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.930
<v Speaker 1>And it was the same situation.</v>

1016
00:24:47.931 --> 00:24:50.080
<v Speaker 1>They used the three strike rule and here's the three strike rule.</v>

1017
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 1>But he had,</v>

1018
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.580
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have three convictions,</v>

1019
00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.360
<v Speaker 2>his convictions and little different.</v>

1020
00:24:55.361 --> 00:24:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1021
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:55.990
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1022
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.191
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1023
00:24:56.191 --> 00:24:57.610
<v Speaker 2>he did have convictions.</v>

1024
00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.043
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1025
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.690
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1026
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:00.281
<v Speaker 2>his was,</v>

1027
00:25:00.281 --> 00:25:00.601
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1028

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.200
<v Speaker 2>And he got arrested that day.</v>

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.580
<v Speaker 2>So he wasn't convicted.</v>
