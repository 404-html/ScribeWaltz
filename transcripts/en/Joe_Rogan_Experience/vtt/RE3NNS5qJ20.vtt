1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.220
<v Speaker 1>This may transition into a TSA rant and I apologize if it does cause it's still</v>

3
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>fresh in about,</v>

4
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.901
<v Speaker 1>we gotta talk about that.</v>

6
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

7
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>the biggest fucking government works program that's really going on right now.</v>

8
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Our tax dollars going to create a system to create jobs to demean us and make us</v>

9
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>feel like criminals for wanting to take a flight,</v>

10
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>a program that is inefficient,</v>

11
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>ineffectual by thousands of thousands.</v>

12
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>That's hyperbole by hundreds of sorted papers that is inefficient,</v>

13
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.344
<v Speaker 1>ineffectual,</v>

14
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>that demeans us,</v>

15
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>that leads to lobbyists in government,</v>

16
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>kickbacks for these corporations that make machines that scan us and take nude</v>

17
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>photos.</v>

18
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>This essentially for the folks at me off for the folks that do the Tsa,</v>

19
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>it is a shit job.</v>

20
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with people that don't want to be there.</v>

21
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm dealing with people that don't want to comply and in their defense,</v>

22
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.241
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

23
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>there's that fucking classic Stanford study that we've brought up over and over</v>

24
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>again of what happened when they just had college students have one person in</v>

25
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>charge or the ward.</v>

26
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>The other person is the prisoner.</v>

27
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.321
<v Speaker 1>When they,</v>

28
00:00:58.321 --> 00:00:59.041
<v Speaker 1>when you do that,</v>

29
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>people abuse Pete Radio and radiation.</v>

30
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It to me is is a moot point.</v>

31
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

32
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.541
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

33
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I deserve it.</v>

34
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't write this violation.</v>

35
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a rights violation.</v>

36
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Plus the rapid scan corporation,</v>

37
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the two big corporations that had like,</v>

38
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you know the $70 million contracts to install these machines,</v>

39
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>they were funding Chertoff who was the ex head of the Homeland Security</v>

40
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.511
<v Speaker 1>Administration.</v>

41
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Like they've increased their lobbying five five by like 50% or something since</v>

42
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>2008 and 2010 that was the last study I read.</v>

43
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>So Lord knows how much money they're spending now to kick.</v>

44
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>They get kickbacks to people in power to do these no bid contracts to put in</v>

45
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:33.144
<v Speaker 1>these machines,</v>

46
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

47
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>most most security and defense experts tell you that they can actually detect</v>

48
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>the plastic explosives that could blow up at seven 47 like they can't actually</v>

49
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>detect it.</v>

50
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Plus there was a case in Florida,</v>

51
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>just not only black,</v>

52
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>probably two years ago,</v>

53
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>where hundreds of thousands of the photos from people going through those</v>

54
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>machines because it does store photos,</v>

55
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>even though it doesn't display them.</v>

56
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Those photos were hacked and it was,</v>

57
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:57.391
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

58
00:01:57.391 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>we don't store these photos,</v>

59
00:01:58.651 --> 00:01:59.484
<v Speaker 1>they don't get taken,</v>

60
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>but they have a nude picture of you somewhere.</v>

61
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I think metal detectors are good.</v>

62
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

63
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of checking your bags is good.</v>

64
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:08.400
<v Speaker 1>There's too many cons.</v>

65
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>There are certainly,</v>

66
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>there are certainly there should be a standard of protection,</v>

67
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>metal detector,</v>

69
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>how do you want to scan the baggage?</v>

70
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.241
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

71
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>But I think we've drawn the line way too far and we've drawn up the x ray</v>

72
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>machine in the Austin airport and it's right next to one of those rapid scan</v>

73
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>body scanning machines.</v>

74
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.274
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

75
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>And there is a long line for the rapid scan machine and that's when they say,</v>

76
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>oh that lines get long.</v>

77
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Come on through the x rays.</v>

78
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>So right away I'm like,</v>

79
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:30.601
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

80
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>If this is integral to my safety,</v>

81
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>you're now chucking my safety out the window for the convenience factor of</v>

82
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>cycling people through security.</v>

83
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

84
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>they really saying that it's not safe and these are really what they're saying</v>

85
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>the rabbits can thing or the,</v>

86
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.991
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

87
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:43.081
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

88
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

89
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about,</v>

90
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about if we need those,</v>

91
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>those body scanning machines because they can detect a whole bunch of stuff that</v>

92
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>a traditional x ray can't.</v>

93
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

94
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>is that when it gets to inconvenient?</v>

95
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Because the line is too long.</v>

96
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>You're now throwing my safety out the window.</v>

97
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>That seems inconsistent.</v>

98
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>It seems wrong.</v>

99
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.761
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

100
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

101
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>But I'm in line to go through the x and then randomly they do the,</v>

102
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.580
<v Speaker 1>you need to go through the rapid scan machines.</v>

104
00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:02.861
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

105
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>can I just go through the x Ray?</v>

106
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

107
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:04.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

108
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Now they're angry with me because I even asked that.</v>

109
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So I opt out as I normally do.</v>

110
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>My belongings go through the machine.</v>

111
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Now I can't see them.</v>

112
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.891
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

113
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.071
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

114
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I can't see my laptop.</v>

115
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I can't see my phone.</v>

116
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:14.651
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any of that stuff.</v>

117
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>It's over there.</v>

118
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.660
<v Speaker 1>You're la,</v>

119
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>your belongings are fine.</v>

120
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.681
<v Speaker 1>How do I know that?</v>

121
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:18.431
<v Speaker 1>I can't see them?</v>

122
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>They didn't give anybody to do it.</v>

123
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>So I'm already on edge.</v>

124
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:20.921
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

125
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I always hit it.</v>

126
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Always feel like whenever I take a fucking jet blue flight,</v>

127
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna be my occupied moment.</v>

128
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna end with pepper spray to the face and I'm gonna get handcuffed even</v>

129
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>though as polite as can be.</v>

130
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.171
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

131
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I just want someone to watch my shit right?</v>

132
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I get stuck in a glass box where I'm next to a girl that couldn't have been more</v>

133
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>than six years old.</v>

134
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>she has a handicap.</v>

136
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>She's in a wheelchair and there was something mentally wrong with her.</v>

137
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:41.194
<v Speaker 1>She was stemming,</v>

138
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>she was rocking.</v>

139
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>She was pulling her hair and crying because there were three TSA agents trying</v>

140
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 1>to tell her to lift her arms so they can swab her clothes,</v>

141
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>swab her wheelchair,</v>

142
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>the back pad,</v>

143
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>the tires,</v>

144
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.171
<v Speaker 1>the wheels,</v>

145
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

146
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Her Dad is there on the brink.</v>

147
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine how traumatic it is to try to bring somebody in a special needs</v>

148
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>child through an airport in general.</v>

149
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>But now they've been selected for special screening and he has to try to explain</v>

150
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>to his daughter who was having a fit.</v>

151
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Rightfully so as strangers are groping her and you know,</v>

152
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.031
<v Speaker 1>swiping,</v>

153
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>swabbing her seat.</v>

154
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to calm her down.</v>

155
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>by holding an iPad and her face and doing whatever he can to get her to relax.</v>

158
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Do I have to lift her out of the seat?</v>

159
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:18.031
<v Speaker 1>He asked.</v>

160
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:18.864
<v Speaker 1>Yes you do.</v>

161
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to lift her up.</v>

162
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>She's fighting it.</v>

163
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>My heart is breaking for this guy.</v>

164
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm sitting in this glass box is because after my pat down,</v>

165
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>they ran my little piece of cloth or they ran the gloves and the piece of cloth</v>

166
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>that they swipe the bottom of my feet with through a machine.</v>

167
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Like by the way,</v>

168
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>machines would lead,</v>

169
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>which we spent more than $30 million on to install and airports in this machine</v>

170
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>said I tested positive for nitrates.</v>

171
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I had that will happen one.</v>

172
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And I pulled up.</v>

174
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

175
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>so what's a nitrate?</v>

176
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.311
<v Speaker 1>Well sir,</v>

177
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:42.701
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

178
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:42.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>that could be used as a chemical.</v>

180
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.161
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

181
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:45.994
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

182
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

183
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a chemical be used in a lot of things.</v>

184
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:48.401
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

185
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a,</v>

186
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad thing.</v>

187
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing.</v>

188
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Like this isn't a problem and I go,</v>

189
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:51.911
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

190
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it is a problem because I have a flight to catch and I want to know like why I'm</v>

191
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>being detained longer.</v>

192
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.560
<v Speaker 1>While you're tested positive for nitrates,</v>

193
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 1>we have to give you a,</v>

194
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>an even more thorough screening.</v>

195
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

196
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>well what else can test positive for nitrates?</v>

197
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Guy Couldn't answer it.</v>

198
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Second person couldn't answer it.</v>

199
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Third person ask you if you had been to a farm.</v>

200
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.141
<v Speaker 1>No they did not.</v>

201
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 1>But the third guy finally said,</v>

202
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:10.020
<v Speaker 1>well the,</v>

203
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>the head of the security mob there said,</v>

204
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>well if you've walked on grass that has fertilizer on it,</v>

205
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>then you might test positive for nitrates.</v>

206
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Even a certain heart medications that seniors take and test positive for</v>

207
00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>nitrates.</v>

208
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>So I'm now stuck in a glass box,</v>

209
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.150
<v Speaker 1>detached from my valuables watching this poor girl having a meltdown.</v>

210
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>As these three people are going to love her and I start to cry cause it just,</v>

211
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>it breaks my heart that this is happening.</v>

212
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>This poor guy is having to go through this and I,</v>

213
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:34.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I go to put my hand on a shoulder and tell him like,</v>

215
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

216
00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:37.991
<v Speaker 1>you have to go through this.</v>

217
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And he looks back and he's choked up.</v>

218
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's been in there for a good 15 minutes trying to calm down his</v>

219
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>

220
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>So then I start questioning,</v>

221
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>why are you guys doing this?</v>

222
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And I'm being polite and being calm,</v>

223
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>being everything you could possibly be while asking how much longer this is</v>

224
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>going to take because I have a flight to catch.</v>

225
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>They grab my belongings and start walking them away and go,</v>

226
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:55.541
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>

227
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:55.901
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

228
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

229
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you're coming here to this private screening room.</v>

230
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.221
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

231
00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:58.281
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

232
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:58.401
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

233
00:05:58.401 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be in a private screening room.</v>

234
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I want this enhanced pat down to happen right here because I want my girlfriend</v>

235
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:04.514
<v Speaker 1>to videotape it.</v>

236
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

237
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:05.121
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

238
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:05.181
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

239
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:05.511
<v Speaker 1>no sir.</v>

240
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>You're going by this time,</v>

241
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 1>my belongings are in the frosted glass private screening room.</v>

242
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm in the private screening room with them and there's a giant placard that</v>

243
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>says this is a private security room.</v>

244
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>There was no filming whatsoever.</v>

245
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>If a tree,</v>

246
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>if a TSA employee tells you to stop filming,</v>

247
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 1>you must seats filming immediately.</v>

248
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>You do have the right to call in a witness to be there.</v>

249
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.673
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking,</v>

250
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 1>why can't the camera be my witness?</v>

251
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Because if I'm traveling alone,</v>

252
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>who else am I going to call fucking Ghostbusters am I gonna Bring Tsa in here?</v>

253
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in a glass box with two dudes by myself.</v>

254
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>He swabs me down with the gloves and then he says,</v>

255
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll be right back.</v>

256
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I have to test this glove goes,</v>

257
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>puts his hand on the handle of the door with the glove on it that he just wiped</v>

258
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>me down,</v>

259
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 1>opens it up and walks out on his merry way.</v>

260
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>So I looked to the other guy who's left in the room.</v>

261
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:47.511
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

262
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was that?</v>

263
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 1>And it was like the first time I had cursed and he goes,</v>

264
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:51.051
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

265
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

266
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>he just swapped my body down with that glove.</v>

267
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Then grabbed the handle.</v>

268
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>If someone in her earlier did have explosives on them and he grabbed that handle</v>

269
00:06:58.911 --> 00:06:59.481
<v Speaker 1>with that glove.</v>

270
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>That's now on my test.</v>

271
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Why is any testing right here?</v>

272
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>There's a machine in the room.</v>

273
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh Sir.</v>

274
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>That that machine's calibration is off.</v>

275
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:05.954
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's here.</v>

276
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

277
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:07.221
<v Speaker 1>it happened in the room?</v>

278
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:08.001
<v Speaker 1>Cause the calibration is off.</v>

279
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:08.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

280
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a tag on it that says it needs to be serviced.</v>

281
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

282
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>So I'm waiting five minutes go by.</v>

283
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I've strike up conversation with the guy.</v>

284
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I hate that that little girl out there in the wheelchair that's having the fit</v>

285
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 1>and I can still hear her having a poor meltdown out there.</v>

286
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Why are they out there?</v>

287
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Well he tested positive for nitrates as well.</v>

288
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh he did?</v>

289
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

290
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Why is the girl there?</v>

291
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

292
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 1>she tested positive for nitrates.</v>

293
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

294
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.190
<v Speaker 1>So all three of us have tested positive for nitrates with the one machine that's</v>

295
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:31.521
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

296
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>You've got another one in here that need servicing and recalibration and you</v>

297
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 1>think there's nothing wrong with this situation.</v>

298
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.281
<v Speaker 1>Guy Comes back,</v>

299
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:37.611
<v Speaker 1>tells me,</v>

300
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:38.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm clear,</v>

301
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I leave the room and I see the father is still there struggling with his</v>

302
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 1>daughter and I'm like,</v>

303
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm again like moved to tears.</v>

304
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>And I asked this guy,</v>

305
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>tell me as a human being,</v>

306
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:47.690
<v Speaker 1>do you think this is right?</v>

307
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this treatment for this poor girl is right?</v>

308
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

309
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.381
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

310
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>she tested positive for nitrates and went right.</v>

311
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.913
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

312
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 1>But there are many other countries who deal with terrorism on a far greater</v>

313
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 1>level than we do who have far more swifter and more and more common sense</v>

314
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:06.500
<v Speaker 1>approach to security that doesn't demean their citizenry.</v>

315
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't cost them millions of taxpayer dollars.</v>

316
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's right,</v>

317
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>that that girl is having a meltdown,</v>

318
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 1>you're swabbing her wheelchair,</v>

319
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>do you really think she's a terrorist?</v>

320
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm just asking you as a human being.</v>

321
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.900
<v Speaker 1>And there was a long pause and he sort of looked down and looked at his shoes</v>

322
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:18.734
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>

323
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:19.371
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

324
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm finally going to have a moment,</v>

325
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:24.080
<v Speaker 1>a real moment here as a human being is going to take off that TSA helmet for a</v>

326
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:24.351
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

327
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>And he looked up and looked me right in the eyes and says,</v>

328
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.430
<v Speaker 1>she tested positive for nitrates.</v>

329
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I realized,</v>

330
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.703
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

331
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 1>This is a lost cause.</v>

332
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:32.611
<v Speaker 1>This is a losing battle here.</v>

333
00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:33.444
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

334
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:42.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
