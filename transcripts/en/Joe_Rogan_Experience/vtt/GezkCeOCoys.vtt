1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're great.</v>

2
00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:03.190
<v Speaker 1>We've got two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

3
00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:07.180
<v Speaker 1>You could pick the front of the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way to start to</v>

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>your weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can start it.</v>

5
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about these toilets that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a built in.</v>

6
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a bad day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like a buck cleaner.</v>

7
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the days are kind of crude.</v>

8
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>You ever use it a day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

9
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good at it.</v>

10
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was</v>

11
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>this stream of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the perfect size and pressure</v>

12
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>warmth and I have had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we want to get into it right,</v>

13
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>right off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had an anal orgasm before with a</v>

14
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>vibrator and the only once in my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that day I was like,</v>

15
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>if I stayed on here like 10 more minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could get you.</v>

16
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it could a lot of gals out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking notes.</v>

17
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I just use like diaper wipes in</v>

18
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>my butt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>that's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I like think about it like,</v>

20
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if my beard,</v>

21
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>if I had like shit smeared all over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that be cool with the diaper wipe</v>

22
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>and just going out in public?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

23
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is to power wash it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what that power wash my face</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

25
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I scrub it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shower,</v>

26
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>put my head in a tub of water for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

27
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>They're very smart with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but day and the day never caught on here</v>

28
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just went with paper,</v>

29
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gets caught in your butt and it</v>

30
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>gets caught if you're a girl with not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>neatly tucked vagina.</v>

31
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Like most women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little pieces break off ones that soft.</v>

32
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I use Scott brand toilet</v>

33
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>paper instead of Sharman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone thinks I'm being cheap and I'm</v>

34
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:33.001
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

35
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want toilet paper stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my vagina.</v>

36
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>You ever wipe your Dick with toilet</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper or not?</v>

37
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just your bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No drip,</v>

38
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>drip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop it right back.</v>

39
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.273
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

40
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Not a concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered that.</v>

41
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

42
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously it's not as efficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery method.</v>

44
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotta be careful about the wiping front</v>

45
00:01:58.411 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>to back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you got?</v>

46
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan,</v>

47
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>you want to send my daughter once my</v>
<v Speaker 1>young daughter got sick from that.</v>

48
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I learned the hard way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>She didn't understand and we were on</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation.</v>

50
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I actually got sick from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She gets a fever</v>

51
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say she was three or,</v>

52
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:19.531
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>you want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you tell them it doesn't make</v>

55
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>sense to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>back to front is the way you'd normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would go,</v>

57
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>but then you gotta do it in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go that way until your arms get</v>

58
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you got to lift your leg up.</v>

60
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I can reach all the way around now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you wipe your ass with your leg up on</v>

61
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>the toilet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

62
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I stand up to wipe my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to get in there squat though.</v>

63
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>You could get into but whole area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

64
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I always do a captain Morgan stance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean out the area.</v>

65
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.380
<v Speaker 1>He has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh and the leg up on the barrel because</v>

66
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.790
<v Speaker 1>when you stand up you gotta wipe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wipe and wipe.</v>

67
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>And when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this going to end?</v>

68
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why I think every toilet</v>

69
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>should really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would it be hard</v>

70
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.090
<v Speaker 2>to have one of those jet things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>every toilet it doesn't seem that.</v>

71
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's a big ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.570
<v Speaker 3>My concern is so like if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>squirting and then like poop crumbles</v>

73
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:11.520
<v Speaker 3>are coming out right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're going back down.</v>

74
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Like could it ever then hit the thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's squirting on you and then could</v>

75
00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:17.520
<v Speaker 3>poop squirt gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my,</v>

76
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.780
<v Speaker 3>that's my main concern.</v>

77
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Well there's bigger concerns in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is one.</v>

78
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're just specifically talking</v>

79
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:28.290
<v Speaker 3>about toilet concerns that a major one.</v>

80
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that because of the water</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure,</v>

81
00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:32.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you would have to have all</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all of them,</v>

82
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.780
<v Speaker 3>like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it would have to prairie dogging,</v>

83
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.391
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

84
00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:41.990
<v Speaker 3>It would have to be like a cow patty</v>
<v Speaker 3>fiber diet,</v>

85
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.860
<v Speaker 3>who's already</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

86
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.220
<v Speaker 3>we're sex birth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

87
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:52.400
<v Speaker 3>you're human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every new how sex is in some way.</v>

88
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:53.630
<v Speaker 3>A sexpert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

89
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.400
<v Speaker 3>That's our platform because we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>

90
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.400
<v Speaker 3>we're not experts at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said the other day to corrine,</v>

91
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.070
<v Speaker 3>what's the name of the whole that hugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Tampon and she was like,</v>

92
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:02.520
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay Christina.</v>

93
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did look it up.</v>

94
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people call the whole thing the</v>

95
00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:09.920
<v Speaker 3>vagina and that's inaccurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vaginas are so complicated.</v>

96
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.770
<v Speaker 3>How the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the thing is not a vagina and</v>

97
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 3>that's inaccurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The just the,</v>

98
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 3>the sex hole is the vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

99
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.590
<v Speaker 3>people call the whole thing the vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not technically accurate.</v>

100
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.970
<v Speaker 3>If the doors are closed and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the outside,</v>

101
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.621
<v Speaker 3>you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

102
00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:25.610
<v Speaker 3>that's a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

103
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not technically correct.</v>

104
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.820
<v Speaker 3>My Labor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

105
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.500
<v Speaker 3>that's Lavia you're looking at there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

106
00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Here's the church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the staple because the door,</v>

107
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you how I feel about it.</v>

108
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:37.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The operation where they remove labial</v>

109
00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 2>lips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems so goddamn right.</v>

110
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Labioplasty yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody actually,</v>

111
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 3>cause that doesn't do your vagina's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fully functioning and it works fine.</v>

112
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.110
<v Speaker 3>It's just the aesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you get the surgery and it</v>

113
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:50.790
<v Speaker 3>goes awry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>

114
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:55.200
<v Speaker 3>Somebody had emailed us once about Dane</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cook had a bit about like meaty posy</v>

115
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:58.830
<v Speaker 3>lips a while ago and she'd got</v>
<v Speaker 3>labioplasty because of that bit.</v>

116
00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

117
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.640
<v Speaker 3>I like Dane Cook a Laba and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had talked about that because I</v>

118
00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:07.590
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching his special and I just</v>

119
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.300
<v Speaker 3>put my hands over my face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

120
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:12.450
<v Speaker 3>this is not what we need it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

121
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:15.480
<v Speaker 3>surely no one's going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause he said that it's a joke.</v>

122
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.300
<v Speaker 3>He's a comic and he's a cute comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you're like,</v>

123
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.360
<v Speaker 3>should I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not me personally.</v>

124
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:25.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also desensitizes the area a lot.</v>

125
00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:28.650
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine you're cutting meat stitching</v>

126
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:30.750
<v Speaker 3>things back up and things get numb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

127
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 3>nice surgery.</v>

128
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 2>And the slight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a slice down my knee that I had</v>

129
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>this knee operated on in 1994 and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>still numb.</v>

130
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 2>This skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where they did what's called a</v>

132
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Patella tendon graft with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

133
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.330
<v Speaker 2>they cut along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slice.</v>

134
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 2>They took a piece of your Patella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pull that out and then they stitch</v>

135
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>it inside the knee and that area in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>front where they took the scar,</v>

136
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 2>like where the scars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's numb.</v>

137
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 2>So just no nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nerve endings there.</v>

138
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel,</v>

139
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 4>well it feels notice will be different</v>
<v Speaker 4>than the sides.</v>

140
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 4>Like that one strip where the scar is</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different.</v>

141
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:06.254
<v Speaker 4>So imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

142
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

143
00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:09.070
<v Speaker 3>imagine your policies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your knee and that just so what's the</v>

144
00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:10.750
<v Speaker 3>point of life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the point of living now?</v>

145
00:06:10.751 --> 00:06:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm always just an envision your knees</v>
<v Speaker 3>as my pussy.</v>

146
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Whenever I see plessy knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be big</v>

147
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.690
<v Speaker 4>pussy too because it's little pussies</v>
<v Speaker 4>opening.</v>

148
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why babies come out.</v>

149
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you have to get c sections and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the,</v>

150
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 4>the baby doesn't get the product out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>China.</v>

151
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:30.791
<v Speaker 4>Juices on the baby and they don't get</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right healthy bacteria.</v>

152
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.043
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

153
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.781
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know why.</v>

154
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 3>There's a notepad here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking notes.</v>

155
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.803
<v Speaker 3>Underline this</v>

157
00:06:42.241 --> 00:06:44.560
<v Speaker 4>section.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually unhealthy for the baby's</v>

158
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.890
<v Speaker 4>immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were gonna say hotter</v>

159
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.980
<v Speaker 4>because you're placing your face doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>get sued.</v>

160
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not mashed when they come out,</v>

161
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 3>they don't look like they've got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook photo,</v>

162
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 3>ratty face tune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've heard,</v>

163
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.730
<v Speaker 3>we've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know what phase,</v>

164
00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 3>tuning wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been in La for like three days.</v>

165
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.380
<v Speaker 3>We've heard face tuning it five times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you can auto tune Britney</v>

166
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 3>spears voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it sounds listenable to the general</v>

167
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 3>public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can also do that to your fucking</v>

168
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

171
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:24.110

<v Speaker 3>I can smudge it in so that it's thinner.</v>

172
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 3>But then you meet somebody in person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen one of those in real life and</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's chaotic.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

216
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.080

<v Speaker 1>and that's her business.</v>

219
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who thinks Kim guard issue cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians actually perfect is</v>

220
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're young and impressionable.</v>

221
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>People are held up to way higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>

222
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 1>You look at that and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>step in and be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>give her her to her.</v>

226
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:30.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>

227
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 1>but here's the reality is if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid and you're paying attention</v>

<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars.</v>

<v Speaker 1>make that thing cause she cheated</v>

233
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:49.830
<v Speaker 1>guided.</v>

234
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

235
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:52.590
<v Speaker 1>well if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're projecting this image of</v>

236
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>perfection and then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no that's not really,</v>

237
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of work to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paparazzi that you hire to edit it and</v>

238
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 1>then put it out like casually on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>

239
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 1>In her defense it's a business or</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses this looking,</v>

240
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like</v>

241
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I would just play a sentence to my child</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

242
00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter to us.</v>

243
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>You can say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say that,</v>

244
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:24.210
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a 16 year old girl and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you see her on television and you</v>

245
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 1>see her popular at one time and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly were people who looked hotter</v>

246
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>but I still turned out okay and like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't by any means have a a perfect 10</v>

247
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:34.240
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she has confidence.</v>

248
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.190
<v Speaker 1>My body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any problems with it and I</v>

249
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:41.850
<v Speaker 1>still ingested a lot of this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fluffy pop culture.</v>

250
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I actually love pop culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my favorite things,</v>

251
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:47.020
<v Speaker 1>like just inane information about</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrities,</v>

252
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 1>but this is a different kind of pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture because this is pop culture that</v>

253
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 1>is famous for just being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is what I would call it,</v>

254
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 1>instagram culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these instagram models and</v>

255
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.130
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do have to be careful about that</v>

256
00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:03.510
<v Speaker 1>because even I find myself at 32</v>
<v Speaker 1>flipping through instagram and going</v>

257
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:04.500
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

258
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of work to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some dude,</v>

259
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some black guy,</v>

260
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

261
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.260
<v Speaker 1>he just was some funny dude who had this</v>
<v Speaker 1>video post about instagram girls saying,</v>

262
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank all my fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

263
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

264
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 1>you don't have fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a pervert.</v>

265
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not your fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

266
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 1>and if you keep showing pictures of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass,</v>

267
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep looking because I'm like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

268
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Stop pretending that you've got some</v>
<v Speaker 1>talent,</v>

269
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.760
<v Speaker 1>people who love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's uncomfortable</v>

270
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.230
<v Speaker 1>talent to have fans though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

271
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.130
<v Speaker 1>you just gotta be hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes,</v>

272
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.310
<v Speaker 1>there are people who I'm just fans of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ass.</v>

273
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 1>You're not fans of anyone's ass bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm a fan of looking at Kim</v>

274
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Kardashian and I have no problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying no.</v>

275
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I am enjoying funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where my point was pointing</v>

276
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're like,</v>

277
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go break it down.</v>

278
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't put me on this hierarchy of a fan.</v>

279
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm a down to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're jerking off team a bedroom.</v>

280
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan of certain musicians.</v>

281
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

282
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't follow you around this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people do,</v>

283
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:08.291
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

284
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Karen was always very naturally</v>
<v Speaker 3>confident and she's the only person I</v>

285
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 3>know that's a woman that has actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>confident,</v>

286
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat my snow.</v>

287
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:18.990
<v Speaker 3>Someone else they way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

288
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 3>just like the way you are confident is</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unique because she truly doesn't</v>

289
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 3>give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I only talent and everyone comes up</v>

290
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 3>to me and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Krinn.</v>

291
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Quinsig really insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

292
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's honestly not.</v>

293
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very nice.</v>

294
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 3>Are you a confident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you insecure?</v>

295
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.000
<v Speaker 3>What's your insecurities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

296
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty confident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

297
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 3>but everyone's insecure little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of your own mortality.</v>

298
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.210
<v Speaker 3>You worry about all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to die.</v>

299
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly worried about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

300
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.800
<v Speaker 3>We're worried about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You worried about your health,</v>

301
00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 3>you're worried about social status</v>
<v Speaker 3>position in society,</v>

302
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 3>your friends worry about your health is</v>
<v Speaker 3>an insecurity though.</v>

303
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:02.010
<v Speaker 3>That's just carry the Kale security.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

304
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a broad definition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

305
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 3>Like we have to think of insecurity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think of just like how</v>

306
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 3>people perceive you that don't know you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

307
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly trying to make up for</v>

308
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:15.030
<v Speaker 3>something that you feel like you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>lacking in an area you're lacking in.</v>

309
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.150
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people aren't confident in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their intelligence there.</v>

310
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 3>How funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know whatever occupation you are that</v>

311
00:13:23.081 --> 00:13:24.730
<v Speaker 3>you're not the best in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

312
00:13:24.731 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 3>I constantly think I have things to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

313
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll never be satisfied until I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best,</v>

314
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:30.790
<v Speaker 3>which will never happen.</v>

315
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.800
<v Speaker 3>So it's just a constant loop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best,</v>

316
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything existing,</v>

317
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 3>existing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything I want to do,</v>

318
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I want to try to do.</v>

319
00:13:38.471 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 3>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tend not to do things if I don't think</v>

320
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 3>that I can excel in them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I don't have fun.</v>

321
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.840
<v Speaker 3>It's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very true.</v>

322
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did go to universal studios</v>

323
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 3>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was fun.</v>

324
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by you don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun?</v>

325
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't,</v>

326
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

327
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have like a,</v>

328
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.620
<v Speaker 3>I have a bit about how I don't like fun</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

329
00:13:57.621 --> 00:13:58.780
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

330
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.700
<v Speaker 3>I like working as opposed to fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just frivolous fun.</v>

331
00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:05.770
<v Speaker 3>If I feel like it's like a waste of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>just hanging out.</v>

332
00:14:05.771 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard time just like hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a hard time relaxing because we're</v>

333
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:10.000
<v Speaker 3>not doing something.</v>

334
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christina because me and my friend,</v>

335
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:14.550
<v Speaker 3>but we're also getting work done at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same time or in universal.</v>

336
00:14:14.551 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 3>We were in line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were creating the intro for the show</v>

337
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 3>last night and we were all always were</v>
<v Speaker 3>always working.</v>

338
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>

339
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.200
<v Speaker 3>But then I discovered psychedelics and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like that's the only kind of like</v>

340
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.650
<v Speaker 3>that's the release that I need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

341
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.370
<v Speaker 3>So you don't enjoy like recreational</v>
<v Speaker 3>activities?</v>

342
00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't want to go fishing or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whitewater rafting.</v>

343
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.210
<v Speaker 3>So I feel like that is productive</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm making my body stronger.</v>

344
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:36.580
<v Speaker 3>So I do like stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very analytical,</v>

345
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:39.350
<v Speaker 3>has to be a purpose to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

346
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.510
<v Speaker 3>I like skiing but it's because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

347
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm learning a new skill.</v>

348
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:49.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want a party with that girl?</v>

349
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.171
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

350
00:14:50.171 --> 00:14:51.004
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

351
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean unless</v>

352
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which yeah,</v>

353
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>like dmt or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Then that's super fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's so sweet when she's drunk.</v>

355
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird cause she like gives you</v>
<v Speaker 1>compliments and you'd never hear a</v>

356
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>compliment from her and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

357
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 1>you like look really good tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You always look good though.</v>

360
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to just space out</v>
<v Speaker 1>compliments so that they're really</v>

361
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 1>powerful when you space them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

362
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Speaker 1>When you give them that ration them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

363
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:14.661
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

364
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad thing.</v>

370
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 1>That's great that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>more work done but it has it served you</v>

<v Speaker 1>great name for a podcast by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use you guys an example all the time</v>

374
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.230
<v Speaker 1>and when you do people email us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tweet us and we go up like 10</v>

375
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:49.810
<v Speaker 1>positions of the podcast charts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

376
00:15:49.811 --> 00:15:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Like God Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my manager was like the Rogan</v>

377
00:15:52.611 --> 00:15:54.120
<v Speaker 1>bump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like so cool.</v>

378
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I usually guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a great example of people that</v>

379
00:15:56.931 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 1>didn't have like a big social media</v>
<v Speaker 1>profile or a big,</v>

380
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you weren't on big TV shows or podcasts</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot up because it's good cause it's</v>

381
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like how you guys banter with each</v>

382
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:09.560
<v Speaker 1>other too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You almost finish each other's sentences</v>

383
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.870
<v Speaker 1>and you almost talk over each other but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

384
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have like you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and you'll interject with your</v>

385
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 1>thought while you're having a thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you pick up your thought right</v>

386
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:18.680
<v Speaker 1>after her.</v>

387
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like you guys have a ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been working together for many</v>

388
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.240
<v Speaker 1>years before the podcast so I think and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of episodes of guys we</v>

389
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:27.650
<v Speaker 1>fucked that I'd have to go back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to.</v>

390
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 1>It will be very embarrassed by how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>times I interrupted the fucking guests</v>

391
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Speaker 1>or her and so it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

392
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 1>When you're enthusiastic and you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his car and someone's talking,</v>

393
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:39.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't know when to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

394
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 1>but a secret twin language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've said like the same sentence,</v>

395
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 1>a long sentence at the same time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very creepy.</v>

396
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.030
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk with our eyes when we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing like a live show and know exactly</v>

397
00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the next thing we need to do is now</v>

398
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 1>when you say you guys worked together</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he did the podcast,</v>

399
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:57.440
<v Speaker 1>what'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are a comedy duo is called,</v>

400
00:16:57.441 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 1>sorry about last night.</v>

401
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.080
<v Speaker 1>So we did a standup shows me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were produced,</v>

402
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 1>we the two woman show at UCB.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would do sketches,</v>

403
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.410
<v Speaker 1>video sketches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shit.</v>

404
00:17:06.411 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Anything we thought was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was one of the,</v>

405
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.250
<v Speaker 1>the impetus for the podcast was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakup crane got dumped in a Panera</v>

406
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:17.870
<v Speaker 1>bread and it was like the worst I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen anybody handle a breakup</v>

407
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.410
<v Speaker 1>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it really took a toll on her and it</v>

408
00:17:20.411 --> 00:17:22.410
<v Speaker 1>was not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't show a lot of emotion.</v>

409
00:17:22.411 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to see her cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

410
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one day she texted me,</v>

411
00:17:26.031 --> 00:17:27.560
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should just interview every guy we've</v>

412
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 1>ever fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that on a podcast,</v>

413
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>which is called guys we fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

414
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually that's,</v>

415
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

416
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I like how you call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you call it an anti slut shaming podcast</v>

417
00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:39.300
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.930
<v Speaker 1>That's why that was my addition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That needs to stop.</v>

419
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>

420
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.320
<v Speaker 1>And also you need to stop slut shaming</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

421
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people do that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

422
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 5>And I got to say like I feel like guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>we fucked is the female Viagra because</v>

423
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 5>it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women have written us like I want to go</v>

424
00:17:56.881 --> 00:17:59.760
<v Speaker 5>out and have sex cause now I know how to</v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate what I want.</v>

425
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.740
<v Speaker 5>I know it's not weird to say what I</v>
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>

426
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:02.281
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

427
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:05.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a slut if I sleep with somebody</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the first date or have a one night</v>

428
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:07.650
<v Speaker 5>stand and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's really cool.</v>

429
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this country,</v>

430
00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.320
<v Speaker 2>we still have the echoes of the puritans</v>
<v Speaker 2>that landed here.</v>

431
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:11.951
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

432
00:18:11.951 --> 00:18:16.630
<v Speaker 2>there's some weird sexual politics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on in this country.</v>

433
00:18:16.631 --> 00:18:20.890
<v Speaker 2>There's some weird way that we have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewing sex that I think is directly</v>

434
00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:23.500
<v Speaker 2>connected to the original way this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country was founded.</v>

435
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like some serious pr prudishness</v>

436
00:18:25.931 --> 00:18:29.230
<v Speaker 2>that exists in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exist in other places and</v>

437
00:18:29.231 --> 00:18:30.880
<v Speaker 2>some people here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing because they think</v>

438
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:32.410
<v Speaker 2>that we get more work done because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

439
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 2>That our society is more geared towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity and getting ahead as</v>

440
00:18:38.021 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 2>opposed to some societies that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>

441
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:45.160
<v Speaker 5>if you stifle a part of yourself though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going to come out somehow.</v>

442
00:18:45.161 --> 00:18:48.190
<v Speaker 5>And that's why people sexually assault,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say the repression.</v>

443
00:18:48.191 --> 00:18:51.520
<v Speaker 5>I think black people act out sexually in</v>
<v Speaker 5>any religion,</v>

444
00:18:51.521 --> 00:18:54.250
<v Speaker 5>any religion that oppresses people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were leaving.</v>

445
00:18:54.251 --> 00:18:56.140
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're going to explode one</v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

446
00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.213
<v Speaker 5>Catholicism.</v>

447
00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the classic example and there's,</v>

448
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.910
<v Speaker 2>if there was as many people in Nascar</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fuck kids as Catholic priests,</v>

449
00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.550
<v Speaker 2>how quick would they shut down Nascar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

450
00:19:06.551 --> 00:19:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like religion is so controlling,</v>

451
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.710
<v Speaker 2>but you can watch documentary after</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

452
00:19:11.711 --> 00:19:12.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>

453
00:19:12.311 --> 00:19:13.990
<v Speaker 2>do you know the whole story about</v>
<v Speaker 2>ratzinger?</v>

454
00:19:13.991 --> 00:19:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Who was the last pope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

455
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was wanted for crimes against</v>

456
00:19:18.371 --> 00:19:19.240
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

457
00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:22.810
<v Speaker 2>it's got literally cannot leave Rome if</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes to certain places.</v>

458
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.300
<v Speaker 2>He could be tried for pro crimes against</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

459
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.620
<v Speaker 2>What he did when he was a bishop or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck the position they</v>

460
00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:32.020
<v Speaker 2>call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was taking priests that were</v>

461
00:19:32.021 --> 00:19:36.280
<v Speaker 2>molesting kids and covering it up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving them to another parish.</v>

462
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.900
<v Speaker 2>He moved one priest to a place where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>molested 100 deaf kids.</v>

463
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

464
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was a hundred percent factual,</v>

465
00:19:47.051 --> 00:19:48.790
<v Speaker 2>proven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>non speculative.</v>

466
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's responsible for moving these people</v>

467
00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:55.300
<v Speaker 2>and the number of Catholic priests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

468
00:19:55.301 --> 00:19:57.100
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be some Catholic priests</v>

469
00:19:57.101 --> 00:19:59.920
<v Speaker 2>out there who were wonderful people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry you get lumped into this,</v>

470
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.450
<v Speaker 2>but the sheer number of Catholic priests</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been involved in most dating,</v>

471
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.680
<v Speaker 2>molesting kids,</v>

472
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.220
<v Speaker 5>fucking stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's terrifying.</v>

473
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had a guy emailed us,</v>

474
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.790
<v Speaker 5>so it was in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was molested by one of the priests</v>

475
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:12.950
<v Speaker 5>and he got interviewed on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

476
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 5>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by that breaking piece about them,</v>

477
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:17.280
<v Speaker 5>we get w one thing I've learned from</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing guys,</v>

478
00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:19.350
<v Speaker 5>we fucked all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I that really surprised me.</v>

479
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.480
<v Speaker 5>I feel like 85% of the population has</v>
<v Speaker 5>either been molested as children or</v>

480
00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 5>raped or sexually assaulted in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like some big way.</v>

481
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 5>Not just like groping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

482
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea it was that common.</v>

483
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 5>And then I thought back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

484
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:35.070
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get like one time I went to this</v>

485
00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:38.790
<v Speaker 5>doctor because I had to get blood work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I picked a general doctor and he was</v>

486
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:39.750
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was this old man.</v>

487
00:20:39.751 --> 00:20:40.970
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna give you a breast exam.</v>

488
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.670
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh,</v>

489
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I,</v>

490
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 5>and he went real slow with it and then I</v>
<v Speaker 5>left.</v>

491
00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 5>I had put my shirt back on and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I left the doctor's</v>

492
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.350
<v Speaker 4>office and I was walking home and I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

493
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.340
<v Speaker 4>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah God damn it.</v>

494
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.060
<v Speaker 4>I was so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

495
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 4>I'll let that slide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I turned into a bit,</v>

496
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:00.550
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ever been sexually assaulted?</v>

497
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 4>But she didn't realize until afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been a series of doctors that</v>

498
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:08.370
<v Speaker 4>had been arrested for drug in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>patients and then molesting whether</v>

499
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.770
<v Speaker 4>under camera's like some patients with</v>
<v Speaker 4>suspected it.</v>

500
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.700
<v Speaker 4>And so they had done the investigation</v>
<v Speaker 4>and put hidden cameras and caught the</v>

501
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:18.370
<v Speaker 4>doctors feeling them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I even caught doctors having sex with</v>

502
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:22.950
<v Speaker 4>patients while they were under.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are things that I may be just a</v>

503
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.990
<v Speaker 4>neat to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some fucking creeps out there.</v>

504
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.830
<v Speaker 4>I know you're from Jersey as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was born there,</v>

505
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.930
<v Speaker 4>but I only lived there toe seven cause I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

506
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:36.250
<v Speaker 4>my grandfather was in the hospital for</v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer when that angel of death,</v>

507
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:38.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you heard about this</v>
<v Speaker 4>doctor that coming around like killing</v>

508
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:42.620
<v Speaker 4>people and we're pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're pretty sure that's what happened.</v>

509
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.760
<v Speaker 4>My grandfather died like pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>abruptly.</v>

510
00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 4>My Mom's gonna kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she had said something to me</v>

511
00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:54.760
<v Speaker 4>privately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I guess it was just two of settings.</v>

512
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.790
<v Speaker 4>You can't trust anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that you can't trust anybody.</v>

513
00:21:58.791 --> 00:22:01.120
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to run into so many people</v>

514
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.150
<v Speaker 4>that if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like we were talking before the</v>

515
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 4>podcast started about social media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like one out of 10 if you have nine</v>

516
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:10.630
<v Speaker 4>people that are awesome and then one out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of 10 is just a fucking creep,</v>

517
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.630
<v Speaker 4>you get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>

518
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.290
<v Speaker 4>Now think about running into people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many hundreds of people you run</v>

519
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:19.120
<v Speaker 4>into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All it takes is one creep.</v>

520
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.760
<v Speaker 4>And so it's not that you can't trust</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

521
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.570
<v Speaker 4>it's just like you're going to run into</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain amount of creeps just based on</v>

522
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 4>the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The majority of people are not sexual</v>

523
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:33.910
<v Speaker 4>predators are not giant pieces of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the ones that are really stick out.</v>

524
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Speaker 4>I think what you're talking about too is</v>
<v Speaker 4>big too about the suppression.</v>

525
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.050
<v Speaker 4>I think the suppression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any sort of suppression of desires,</v>

526
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it fosters that sort of creepy behavior.</v>

527
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.130
<v Speaker 4>It builds up and it looks for some sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of an outlet.</v>

528
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:50.170
<v Speaker 4>And that outlet comes out in really</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird ways.</v>

529
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 4>Like I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well Jim Norton Pretty Open about it.</v>

530
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.580

<v Speaker 4>he gets,</v>

531
00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.930
<v Speaker 4>he goes to them and all that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

532
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:02.470
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that he tells me</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that these ladies say that a giant</v>

533
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:06.010
<v Speaker 4>percentage of their business is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>really powerful ceos,</v>

534

<v Speaker 4>buttoned down men who have to like be in</v>
<v Speaker 4>control all the time,</v>

535
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.430
<v Speaker 4>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

536

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

537
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.590
<v Speaker 4>profile that they're projecting to their</v>
<v Speaker 4>company.</v>

538
00:23:17.591 --> 00:23:22.591

<v Speaker 4>kicked in the balls and the love to be</v>

<v Speaker 4>What's in there,</v>

541
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.163
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

542
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.550
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a thing that's happening to</v>

543
00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 4>people when you have to pretend to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that you're not.</v>

544
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you find a lot of Ortho.</v>

545
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm Jewish and so like a lot of orthodox</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jewish men are veil.</v>

546
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.430
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

547
00:23:42.431 --> 00:23:44.930
<v Speaker 4>hiring sex workers and it download and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of,</v>

548
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is a very</v>

549
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 5>broad statement to make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know a lot of touching on the</v>

550
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:52.520
<v Speaker 5>subway kind of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just see it more.</v>

551
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're making sex robots that would</v>

552
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.630
<v Speaker 5>look really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they look like actual women.</v>

553
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:01.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could tell it's a robot but</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

554
00:24:01.291 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 5>it looks very close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was thinking like,</v>

555
00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:06.890
<v Speaker 5>because women have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think with women they oppress</v>

556
00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:09.500
<v Speaker 5>themselves with their own sexuality and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like man,</v>

557
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.170
<v Speaker 5>women are the ones that should be</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting this sex dolls because then we</v>

558
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 5>can feel what it's like to have sex</v>
<v Speaker 5>without giving a shit what the person</v>

559
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:17.930

<v Speaker 5>Thanks cause it's a fucking doll.</v>

560
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.350

<v Speaker 5>let loose and be vulnerable.</v>

561
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 5>Be Vulnerable.</v>

562
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can use a vibrator,</v>

563
00:24:23.831 --> 00:24:25.420
<v Speaker 4>you could use a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

564
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love just sex robot.</v>

00:24:33.881 --> 00:24:34.714
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

567
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.200
<v Speaker 4>these are dolls though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are guys who choose dolls is their</v>

568
00:24:38.201 --> 00:24:40.420
<v Speaker 4>life partners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did an article,</v>

569
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.090
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

570
00:24:43.091 --> 00:24:46.660
<v Speaker 4>I wrote this article,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy contacted me and he told me he</v>

571
00:24:46.661 --> 00:24:51.661
<v Speaker 4>had severe acne when he was young and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then he's disfigured and he's never had</v>

572
00:24:51.941 --> 00:24:53.590
<v Speaker 4>sex with a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is why.</v>

573
00:24:53.591 --> 00:24:54.370
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want,</v>

574

575
00:24:56.921 --> 00:25:00.520
<v Speaker 4>It was all anonymously through email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he and I started going back and forth</v>

576
00:25:00.521 --> 00:25:01.810
<v Speaker 4>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

577
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.860
<v Speaker 4>cause he was upset that at the article</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was mocking these guys that think</v>

578
00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:07.270
<v Speaker 4>that this is their girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

579
00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.450
<v Speaker 4>I see where you're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

580
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.510
<v Speaker 4>I see his point too though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if you were just,</v>

581
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.600
<v Speaker 5>he has an insecurity and he didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be vulnerable with a person because</v>

582
00:25:16.601 --> 00:25:19.210
<v Speaker 5>you're risking the rejection and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>rejection hurts.</v>

583
00:25:19.211 --> 00:25:21.970
<v Speaker 5>But I feel like in addition to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>repression thing though,</v>

584
00:25:21.971 --> 00:25:25.030
<v Speaker 5>I think masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched this documentary called I'm</v>

585
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.220
<v Speaker 5>the mask I live in on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so good.</v>

586
00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.720
<v Speaker 5>And it points out these little things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that little boys pick up like a,</v>

587
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.230
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

588
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:36.190
<v Speaker 5>I was at a pool with my friend one</v>
<v Speaker 5>summer and this dad was trying to get</v>

589
00:25:36.191 --> 00:25:37.450
<v Speaker 5>his son to jump in the pool and he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

590
00:25:37.451 --> 00:25:38.500
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't be a girl.</v>

591
00:25:38.501 --> 00:25:39.520
<v Speaker 5>Jumped in the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

592
00:25:39.521 --> 00:25:42.640
<v Speaker 5>then he jumped in with those little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 5>things get in your head.</v>

593
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.890
<v Speaker 5>And it gets to the point where when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a grown man,</v>

594
00:25:44.891 --> 00:25:48.940
<v Speaker 5>you feel like you deserve pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or the getting pussy or getting girls is</v>

595
00:25:48.941 --> 00:25:50.500
<v Speaker 5>gonna make you up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

596
00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.260
<v Speaker 5>raise in status and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's</v>

597
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.520
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also a code kind of a perpetuating</v>

598
00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:59.400
<v Speaker 4>cycle because if you're an idiot and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>raise kids that are idiots,</v>

599
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.310
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your parents were dumb and they</v>

600
00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:04.680
<v Speaker 4>raised you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might have some really shitty ideas</v>

601
00:26:04.681 --> 00:26:06.060
<v Speaker 4>in your head that you've got to iron</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

602
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes it takes like a lot of</v>

603
00:26:07.621 --> 00:26:11.280
<v Speaker 4>life experience to figure out what those</v>
<v Speaker 4>are and how to get them out.</v>

604
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.410
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you ever are self aware of it.</v>

605
00:26:13.411 --> 00:26:14.760
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like people go through their</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole lives,</v>

606
00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:17.130
<v Speaker 4>they never know 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of people you run</v>

607
00:26:17.131 --> 00:26:19.530
<v Speaker 4>into that are 70 that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching this,</v>

608
00:26:19.531 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

609
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.430
<v Speaker 4>video on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy looked like he was in his late</v>

610
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.030
<v Speaker 4>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>

611
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giving some Asian guy a hard time on the</v>

612
00:26:26.971 --> 00:26:30.300
<v Speaker 4>bus and he was saying all this ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watch that too.</v>

613
00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.580
<v Speaker 4>He and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

614
00:26:32.581 --> 00:26:34.860
<v Speaker 4>this is an old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old guy.</v>

615
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 5>He also seemed a little not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

616
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.360
<v Speaker 5>he was a little mentally unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that night I saw that video</v>

617
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there</v>

618
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.960
<v Speaker 3>was a guy doing the same thing to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

619
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was at a Panera bread and there's</v>

620
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:49.460
<v Speaker 3>this black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working there and,</v>

621
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's always an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to get them to sponsor our</v>

622
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 3>tour</v>
<v Speaker 3>gift cards instead and give them out as</v>

623
00:26:57.991 --> 00:27:01.900
<v Speaker 3>prizes is that just show</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealt with this guy.</v>

624
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.790
<v Speaker 3>But he wasn't old but he was saying the</v>
<v Speaker 3>n word like re like very,</v>

625
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.890
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to intervene but I,</v>

626
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:10.770
<v Speaker 3>he might stab me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say that about someone to the,</v>

627
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.340
<v Speaker 3>to the employee and the employee was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to brush it off.</v>

628
00:27:13.341 --> 00:27:14.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God damn it.</v>

629
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 3>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was obviously,</v>

630
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the hell was up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>him mentally,</v>

631
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:20.720
<v Speaker 3>but he had some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some issues and he was talking to</v>

632
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.120
<v Speaker 3>himself and smacking himself and pushed</v>
<v Speaker 3>his chair over and picking it back up.</v>

633
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to get the fuck outta here man.</v>

634
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.470
<v Speaker 3>And then I like kind of like went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

635
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:29.670
<v Speaker 3>don't hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

636
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 3>but then he eventually left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

637
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.230
<v Speaker 3>fine line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when do you intervene if someone's</v>

638
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:38.320
<v Speaker 3>mentally unstable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't fix them now to shame them.</v>

639
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 3>They're talking to voices that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even talking to them.</v>

640
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:42.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you say,</v>

641
00:27:42.991 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to get the fuck outta here.</v>

642
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Then they decided to shoot you and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>

643
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Then employee like he know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he realized that the guy wasn't there</v>

644
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.590
<v Speaker 3>like all there hopefully and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't,</v>

645
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.830
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy in the subway figured that out</v>

646
00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:57.960
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so chill.</v>

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Gay was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen that a lot in New York City</v>

648
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that seem disturbed and then just</v>

649
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:07.110
<v Speaker 3>going off on racist rants to people or</v>
<v Speaker 3>their faces.</v>

650
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like was straight up to gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean again,</v>

653
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.170
<v Speaker 3>people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>

654
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:19.980
<v Speaker 3>as you say off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a guy not too long ago</v>

655
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:22.230
<v Speaker 3>who just went up to the man sitting next</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me and he was like,</v>

656
00:28:22.231 --> 00:28:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw you looking at me.</v>

657
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like that.</v>

658
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:28.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to fuck you and this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this young woman,</v>

659
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:33.690
<v Speaker 3>this young woman did very much like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kristina and I'm kind of just thinking</v>

660
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:37.740
<v Speaker 3>in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to step in but that was not one</v>

661
00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 3>some ways mentally unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's we just all realized like,</v>

662
00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:42.720
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to take anything this</v>

663
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 3>person saying to heart so boys are so</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird cause you jam and that little</v>

664
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:48.060
<v Speaker 3>thing with people and they know you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get out.</v>

665
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.500
<v Speaker 3>That feeling of vulnerability is always</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the air and because of that people</v>

666
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.360
<v Speaker 3>that are fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll take advantage of that.</v>

667
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.040
<v Speaker 3>It's also a great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great place for sexual assault.</v>

668
00:28:57.041 --> 00:28:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Like all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the sexual assaults I've</v>

669
00:28:58.981 --> 00:29:03.360
<v Speaker 3>experienced have been on the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just hard cox elbow in the motorway</v>

670
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.840
<v Speaker 3>stomach versus when you're on the subway</v>
<v Speaker 3>late at night and there's not many</v>

671
00:29:06.841 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Speaker 3>people in the car and then you'll look</v>
<v Speaker 3>up across from you and there's this guy</v>

672
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 3>with his hand down his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to town on his dick and</v>

673
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:13.590

<v Speaker 3>I want to die.</v>

674
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.110
<v Speaker 3>And you make eye contact with them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like fuck.</v>

675
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Or when someone sits right next to you</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's absolutely no reason to do</v>

676
00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:21.080
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wash it happens on the subway.</v>

680
00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:28.230
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people take his shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple times.</v>

681
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:33.180
<v Speaker 3>Once on the platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just take a shit early in the</v>

682

<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his bathroom usage time.</v>

683
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:37.110
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have a bathroom to go to in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the subway.</v>

684
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.720
<v Speaker 3>So do they do it on the floor to do the</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the edge?</v>

685
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.770
<v Speaker 3>On the floor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the floor.</v>

686
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:41.950

<v Speaker 1>homeless people?</v>

689
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

<v Speaker 1>impractical jokers.</v>

711
00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know that San Francisco,</v>

712
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.660
<v Speaker 1>they have such a problem with shitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people shitting on this trip.</v>

713
00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.390
<v Speaker 1>They have an APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have an app where you could find</v>

714
00:30:55.391 --> 00:30:58.150
<v Speaker 1>out where the human shit is and report</v>
<v Speaker 1>it so you could avoid it.</v>

715
00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like piles.</v>

716
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.990
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco is super duper liberal</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost to the point where they're like</v>

717
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 1>creative unless you want to share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're just super open minded</v>

718
00:31:10.151 --> 00:31:12.820
<v Speaker 1>lefties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where we invited the homeless man</v>

719
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:17.060
<v Speaker 1>in San Francisco to do Karaoke with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the best night ever lives</v>

720
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 1>there and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

721
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.070
<v Speaker 1>I think they're trying to combat that by</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitting on the street.</v>

722
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a good tactic to shit on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street who areas that have been,</v>

723
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.070
<v Speaker 1>see there's like a can be near the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tenderloin.</v>

724
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably where a lot of people</v>

725
00:31:37.241 --> 00:31:38.074
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're shitting,</v>

726
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.310
<v Speaker 1>I love San Francisco by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things about them is that</v>

727
00:31:42.311 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 1>they're so progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

728
00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:48.961
<v Speaker 1>there's so left hard left that they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate shit on the street bowl in like</v>

729
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 1>a really weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The homeless people in San Francisco</v>

730
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 1>tend to have a reputation of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and we were a karaoke night</v>

731
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 1>before I took the week cookie cookie of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

732
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:10.020
<v Speaker 1>I got it from a fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we've since learned</v>

733
00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.430
<v Speaker 1>after our show here with her brother and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

734
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.610
<v Speaker 1>really fun and there was this homeless</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy comes up.</v>

735
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.670
<v Speaker 1>He was like dancing to the music and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like those scenes where everyone's</v>

736
00:32:27.671 --> 00:32:29.950
<v Speaker 1>having a fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warm Christmas inside and then we'll</v>

737
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.850
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to dance.</v>

738
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 1>We bought him beers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went so well.</v>

739
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 1>It was my brother reacted like you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

740
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the match of the guys,</v>

741
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 1>we fucked dowels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brought him in.</v>

742
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 1>We did buy him a couple of beers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then later found out he was an</v>

743
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was already drunk.</v>

744
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.240
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

745
00:32:56.510 --> 00:33:00.470
<v Speaker 1>this is not the day that he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a veteran back on the wagon.</v>

746
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And I asked him about him and his life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

747
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 1>when was the last time you hung out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>

748
00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just asking him about himself and</v>

749
00:33:07.191 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 1>he seemed to really like the way he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>answering.</v>

750
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:11.300
<v Speaker 1>And it was like no one ever asked me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about me.</v>

751
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

752
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.030
<v Speaker 1>He said it was like the best night of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his life.</v>

753
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:16.400
<v Speaker 1>And then he did mildly grew up</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina.</v>

754
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

755
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.940
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't on the week cookie at that</v>

756
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:23.900
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

757
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.900
<v Speaker 1>I really get groped a lot and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what situation.</v>

758
00:33:26.901 --> 00:33:28.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

759
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I grew up for your service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did he grow up?</v>

760
00:33:32.981 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love how I'm asking Kerryn where and</v>

761
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:40.571
<v Speaker 1>when I got slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a city released from the hug.</v>

762
00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:42.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes like normally when you hug,</v>

763
00:33:42.561 --> 00:33:46.840
<v Speaker 1>you release out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to slide to release a</v>

764
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.670
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

765
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:48.770
<v Speaker 1>He was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

766
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if he even knew what he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

767
00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what he did pretty,</v>

768
00:33:57.501 --> 00:34:02.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty fluent in groping</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of lines,</v>

769
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.930
<v Speaker 1>but she doesn't realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you have the same</v>

770
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:10.490
<v Speaker 1>definitions as her touching someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>breast without them wanting you to</v>

771
00:34:10.491 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 1>touch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is growing,</v>

772
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have someone,</v>

773
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you're holding them on the side and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

774
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to know this guy lose his</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameo on house of cards.</v>

775
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.473
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

776
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember I say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're like,</v>

777
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:31.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the policy.</v>

778
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Hands off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>breast.</v>

779
00:34:34.331 --> 00:34:35.380
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an,</v>

780
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:40.450
<v Speaker 1>it was an area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the areas I do remember going,</v>

781
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.201
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

782
00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:43.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ruin yourself for me,</v>

783
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:46.790
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys were hanging out.</v>

784
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:49.260
<v Speaker 1>You had a few drinks and he got feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

785
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.930
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>

786
00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I was happy that he had a good time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was smiling.</v>

787
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Not because he wasn't smiling because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

788
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully like a spectrum for sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>assault.</v>

789
00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.413
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like not quite touched your breasts,</v>

791
00:35:04.071 --> 00:35:04.980

<v Speaker 1>You using your hands is underwire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right</v>

794
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:18.980
<v Speaker 1>under tick on your hands is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could feel breasts on a hug.</v>

795
00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Chest to chest hugs are good because his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands move to good.</v>

796
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Even though you can feel it with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>

800
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's strange</v>

801
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.490
<v Speaker 3>to hug someone the first time you meet</v>
<v Speaker 3>them without knowing anything about</v>

<v Speaker 4>He was either being silly,</v>

817
00:36:33.431 --> 00:36:36.370
<v Speaker 4>which is andy or he was high as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is Andy.</v>

818
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.320
<v Speaker 4>He was looking to fuck me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also Andy.</v>

819
00:36:39.321 --> 00:36:40.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he should have been a number of</v>

820
00:36:40.811 --> 00:36:43.990
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stephen and I might see him as my</v>

821
00:36:43.991 --> 00:36:44.711
<v Speaker 4>boyfriend and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we've,</v>

822
00:36:44.711 --> 00:36:46.400
<v Speaker 4>we've met Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we hung out with a new bunch of,</v>

823
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.430
<v Speaker 4>and it'll say in front of Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you get to leave your</v>

824
00:36:48.431 --> 00:36:49.950
<v Speaker 4>boyfriend and come fight where to stop.</v>

825
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:52.840
<v Speaker 4>Something like really funny in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steven and I fucking love it.</v>

826
00:36:52.841 --> 00:36:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Like I just get funny dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is,</v>

827
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.630
<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has no filter and he has no control.</v>

828
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.390
<v Speaker 4>And he wants to sometimes and like he'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>go on,</v>

829
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.380
<v Speaker 4>like he did my podcast once and he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about being sober.</v>

830
00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:06.490
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sober now.</v>

831
00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:08.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm really happy I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're going to stay sober.</v>

832
00:37:08.261 --> 00:37:09.340
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

833
00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.270
<v Speaker 4>We'll just have to see how it plays out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

834
00:37:13.271 --> 00:37:14.650
<v Speaker 4>but it was also one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you,</v>

835
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.010
<v Speaker 4>you understand his mindset is not like</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

836
00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:21.850
<v Speaker 4>he's embraced his lack of control and</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of strange way.</v>

837
00:37:21.851 --> 00:37:26.851
<v Speaker 4>Instead of like trying to re formulate</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way he views the parameters that he</v>

838
00:37:28.751 --> 00:37:30.820
<v Speaker 4>establishes what for him to have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy,</v>

839
00:37:30.821 --> 00:37:34.600
<v Speaker 4>happy life because he was living in his</v>
<v Speaker 4>ex wife's shed.</v>

840
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.680
<v Speaker 4>He had a podcast called shed lights like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

841
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turn it into a comedy turn.</v>

842
00:37:41.531 --> 00:37:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Turn your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shit show.</v>

843
00:37:43.271 --> 00:37:46.090
<v Speaker 3>That's what he called it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His programming is great.</v>

844
00:37:46.091 --> 00:37:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Does your also remember that reality TV</v>
<v Speaker 3>show called the ass assistant,</v>

845
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.840
<v Speaker 3>which is to this day one of the funniest</v>
<v Speaker 3>things I've ever seen.</v>

846
00:37:52.841 --> 00:37:55.330
<v Speaker 3>It's right where you like abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>potential assistance.</v>

847
00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.360
<v Speaker 3>Just funny physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

848
00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.010
<v Speaker 3>Back in the days when people could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

849
00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:01.420
<v Speaker 3>just appreciate physical assault for</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it was.</v>

850
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go back to that time.</v>

851
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:09.550
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same with him because he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>so crazy and you know it going in,</v>

852
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.300
<v Speaker 4>but still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're standing next to him and then</v>

853
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.860
<v Speaker 4>he just reaches over and grabs your tit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still wrong.</v>

854
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:20.120
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a love for him in my heart that</v>

855
00:38:20.121 --> 00:38:22.220
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that part of who he is is like kind of</v>

856
00:38:22.221 --> 00:38:24.050
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never know what he's going to do</v>

857
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:25.310
<v Speaker 4>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

858
00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't have it in my hand when I hang</v>
<v Speaker 4>out with them.</v>

859
00:38:26.601 --> 00:38:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Like is it going to assault me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I never,</v>

860
00:38:27.881 --> 00:38:29.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't never think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

861
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.940
<v Speaker 4>what I love about him is he's very</v>
<v Speaker 4>unpredictable.</v>

862
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:34.560
<v Speaker 4>He's a sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

863
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 4>and he's super</v>

864
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 2>talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would do scenes together.</v>

865
00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I would have to Redo the scene over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over again cause I'd cry.</v>

866
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a real problem.</v>

867
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 2>He's really talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

868
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing with him is,</v>

869
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we met him,</v>

870
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.380
<v Speaker 3>he was sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we kind of went into it knowing sober</v>

871
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Andy Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we actually met him at,</v>

872
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's supposed to be called these</v>

873
00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 3>days Rehab facility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a halfway house.</v>

874
00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 3>And we met him and he had just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I reached out and to his agent's</v>

875
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:04.360
<v Speaker 3>assistant and he randomly agreed to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>our podcasts.</v>

876
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:08.590
<v Speaker 3>We met him in the music room of his a</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehab facility.</v>

877
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.640
<v Speaker 3>And he told us the only reason that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>agreed to do the podcast was because he</v>

878
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:13.474
<v Speaker 3>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

879
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.170
<v Speaker 3>in a that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an alcoholic,</v>

880
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 3>he's been really selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasted people's time,</v>

881
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.300
<v Speaker 3>hurt people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he said yes to doing guys we</v>

882
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:27.301
<v Speaker 3>fucked because he was trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>amends for all the bad he had done it.</v>

883
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.650
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought that was really nice.</v>

884
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Like what a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a nice reason to do something.</v>

885
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

886
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.070
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't do any bad to you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds more like you want it to be on</v>

887
00:39:35.071 --> 00:39:36.480
<v Speaker 2>your podcast because it's popular.</v>

888
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

889
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.153
<v Speaker 3>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

890
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.440
<v Speaker 3>he had no fucking idea what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a couple of years ago.</v>

891
00:39:41.441 --> 00:39:41.960
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

892
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.793
<v Speaker 3>I miss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

893
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.653
<v Speaker 3>he was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

894
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:44.740
<v Speaker 3>it was a Karma thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

895
00:39:44.741 --> 00:39:46.090
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we aren't the people he hurt,</v>

896
00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:49.390
<v Speaker 3>but I think he was just trying to put</v>
<v Speaker 3>good out into the universe and I really</v>

897
00:39:49.391 --> 00:39:51.880
<v Speaker 3>believed him and that's not something I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would normally believe is like a year</v>

898
00:39:51.881 --> 00:39:53.230
<v Speaker 3>and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years ago we interviewed,</v>

899
00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:54.550
<v Speaker 3>it was a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

900
00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.090
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

901
00:39:56.091 --> 00:39:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely had these moments of</v>

902
00:39:58.761 --> 00:39:59.930
<v Speaker 2>clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

903
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it was funny when he got fired from</v>

904
00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:06.530
<v Speaker 2>this movie recently for licking somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you said a misconduct is my middle</v>

905
00:40:06.531 --> 00:40:07.364
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>

906
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:13.900
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's such a fucking care.</v>

907
00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Those I think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean he hasn't and we were were brand</v>
<v Speaker 3>new take on it</v>

921
00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.710
<v Speaker 2>is my take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between girl doing</v>

922
00:40:44.711 --> 00:40:46.420
<v Speaker 2>it to a guy because a girl can't rape a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

923
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.640
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a physical advantage over</v>

924
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.580
<v Speaker 2>dry them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do anything shore if you drug</v>

925
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:53.860
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like smacking guy in the ass is very</v>

926
00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:55.840
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were some women who are bigger</v>

927
00:40:55.841 --> 00:40:57.460
<v Speaker 2>than some men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

928
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where those are outliers.</v>

929
00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:03.340
<v Speaker 2>There is absolutely the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between a girl</v>

930
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.380
<v Speaker 2>doing something like that to a guy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the difference.</v>

931
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you're no fear for your life.</v>

932
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.540
<v Speaker 3>It's the physical threats.</v>

933
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a buddy of mine who was sexually</v>

934
00:41:10.461 --> 00:41:14.300
<v Speaker 2>harassed by his boss was a woman and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said it was super fucking disturbing</v>

935
00:41:14.301 --> 00:41:18.290
<v Speaker 2>cause he's kind of introverted and is</v>
<v Speaker 2>his boss would grab his ass when he was</v>

936
00:41:18.291 --> 00:41:21.050
<v Speaker 2>like getting coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh go to the coffee machine and she'd</v>

937
00:41:21.051 --> 00:41:22.730
<v Speaker 2>grab his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd Joel.</v>

938
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:26.990
<v Speaker 2>And he was like really stunned and</v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about being around her and she</v>

939
00:41:26.991 --> 00:41:30.890
<v Speaker 2>would tease him about him being approved</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said it made it really</v>

940
00:41:30.891 --> 00:41:32.060
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

941
00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.020
<v Speaker 2>now I know what like to be a woman.</v>

942
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.730
<v Speaker 4>And it was joking around about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

943
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.450
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever address it with her?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

944
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I think he quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

945
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 4>One up quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a situation where I was like,</v>

946
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

947
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 4>he was below her in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the social food chain of the office.</v>

948
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.990
<v Speaker 4>She was his boss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She could fire him and you know,</v>

949
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:53.990
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't have any money and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 4>would ever believe that she had done</v>

950
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:55.520
<v Speaker 4>that to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no proof there was,</v>

951
00:41:55.521 --> 00:41:58.820
<v Speaker 4>it was a weird sort of reversal of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dynamics.</v>

952
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.290
<v Speaker 5>And then that anxiety got created and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's working environment.</v>

953
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.320
<v Speaker 5>I feel like women with women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like little things happen</v>

954
00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.750
<v Speaker 5>throughout your life when you're a chick</v>
<v Speaker 5>that just,</v>

955
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.910
<v Speaker 5>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't make you feel unsafe.</v>

956
00:42:08.911 --> 00:42:09.744
<v Speaker 5>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

957
00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.640
<v Speaker 5>I just want to go to the God damn</v>
<v Speaker 5>grocery store.</v>

958
00:42:11.641 --> 00:42:13.920
<v Speaker 5>Can you knock off to me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't,</v>

959
00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.350
<v Speaker 5>and then that all adds up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's big things,</v>

960
00:42:16.351 --> 00:42:18.630
<v Speaker 5>little things is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and usually it's a combination of both</v>

961
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.070
<v Speaker 5>and then that adds up to the feeling</v>
<v Speaker 5>unsafe and then you hear stories and</v>

962
00:42:23.071 --> 00:42:24.300
<v Speaker 5>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck is.</v>

963
00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:28.180
<v Speaker 4>Well the cosby thing freaked so many</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking people out,</v>

964
00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.910
<v Speaker 4>but I know a bunch of girls who've been</v>
<v Speaker 4>drugged.</v>

965
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:35.950
<v Speaker 4>I know a bunch of girls who have been at</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bar and then how to drink that someone</v>

966
00:42:35.951 --> 00:42:37.690
<v Speaker 4>gave them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden their legs started</v>

967
00:42:37.691 --> 00:42:38.524
<v Speaker 4>giving out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

968
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.130
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] as far as Ruthie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ruthie,</v>

969
00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.410
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This part ended there though.</v>

970
00:42:44.411 --> 00:42:47.620
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was somehow got,</v>

971
00:42:47.621 --> 00:42:49.120
<v Speaker 5>my friends were with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was at a bar,</v>

972
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:54.150
<v Speaker 5>my own birthday party,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cup maybe when I was like 25 in that</v>

973
00:42:54.791 --> 00:42:56.590
<v Speaker 5>year of 24,</v>
<v Speaker 5>25 and uh,</v>

974
00:42:56.591 --> 00:42:59.260
<v Speaker 5>I was pushed in my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my friends pushed me in a cab because</v>

975
00:42:59.261 --> 00:43:00.550
<v Speaker 5>they just thought I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blackout drunk,</v>

976
00:43:00.551 --> 00:43:02.650
<v Speaker 5>but I really had been roofing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>person's sins.</v>

977
00:43:02.651 --> 00:43:04.030
<v Speaker 5>Committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

978
00:43:04.031 --> 00:43:05.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm not the person who roofie do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

979
00:43:05.951 --> 00:43:07.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm not mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew who it was.</v>

980
00:43:07.241 --> 00:43:08.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not mad about it.</v>

981
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:09.820
<v Speaker 5>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't you angry?</v>

982
00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:10.391
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

983
00:43:10.391 --> 00:43:13.170
<v Speaker 5>That person had demons so much bigger</v>
<v Speaker 5>than me getting roof.</v>

984
00:43:13.171 --> 00:43:15.190
<v Speaker 5>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so thankful that nothing happened to</v>

985
00:43:15.191 --> 00:43:16.560
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>

986
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:18.970
<v Speaker 5>I feel honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's what being a woman,</v>

987
00:43:18.971 --> 00:43:20.620
<v Speaker 5>that when you get roofie to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're lucky,</v>

988
00:43:20.621 --> 00:43:21.820
<v Speaker 5>you don't get raped.</v>

989
00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.770
<v Speaker 5>I feel lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's being a woman.</v>

990
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird to feel lucky that I've never</v>

991
00:43:27.011 --> 00:43:28.370
<v Speaker 5>been raped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

992
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.880
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're really luck because we hear about</v>

993
00:43:30.881 --> 00:43:31.211
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

994
00:43:31.211 --> 00:43:33.730
<v Speaker 5>now the public is hearing about how</v>
<v Speaker 5>often happens at Hollywood,</v>

995
00:43:33.731 --> 00:43:37.870
<v Speaker 5>which a lot of us already knew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it happens in every economic status,</v>

996
00:43:37.871 --> 00:43:40.330
<v Speaker 5>every class of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every eight.</v>

997
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.150
<v Speaker 5>It happens so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>

998
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:45.550
<v Speaker 5>it's to the point where a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 5>times on our podcast,</v>

999
00:43:45.551 --> 00:43:48.910
<v Speaker 5>I've said statistically there has to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>rapists listening to us.</v>

1000
00:43:48.911 --> 00:43:52.000
<v Speaker 5>Somebody listening to us has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has raped somebody and I'm sure so</v>

1001
00:43:52.001 --> 00:43:55.060
<v Speaker 5>fucking sick of hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I hear from the victims all God damn</v>

1002
00:43:55.061 --> 00:43:57.850
<v Speaker 5>day and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't help me get to the bottom of</v>

1003
00:43:57.851 --> 00:43:59.650
<v Speaker 5>why this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm like,</v>

1004
00:43:59.651 --> 00:44:02.750
<v Speaker 5>if you're a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make a fake email and email is,</v>

1005
00:44:02.751 --> 00:44:06.000
<v Speaker 5>because I helped me understand this</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I think about it all the time</v>

1006
00:44:06.001 --> 00:44:10.750
<v Speaker 5>because we are constantly getting really</v>
<v Speaker 5>pourable heartbreaking emails about it.</v>

1007
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.540
<v Speaker 5>And we've had a couple of guys email us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One Guy,</v>

1008
00:44:13.541 --> 00:44:14.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

1009
00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said he was really sick and tired of</v>

1010
00:44:16.781 --> 00:44:19.870
<v Speaker 5>seeing other men be Douche bags to women</v>
<v Speaker 5>lie to women.</v>

1011
00:44:19.871 --> 00:44:23.740
<v Speaker 5>And then they get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by the time he turned 30 he said he</v>

1012
00:44:23.741 --> 00:44:26.770
<v Speaker 5>broke and he started putting ads out on</v>
<v Speaker 5>craigslist and then would rape the</v>

1013
00:44:26.771 --> 00:44:28.030
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then he still does it.</v>

1014
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.060
<v Speaker 5>But I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem there is you felt entitled</v>

1015
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 5>to a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1016
00:44:32.431 --> 00:44:35.580
<v Speaker 5>Because he was acting like an asshole</v>
<v Speaker 5>that has nothing to do with you.</v>

1017
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:39.750
<v Speaker 5>So I think that entitlement thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is an important building block in what,</v>

1018
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:41.760
<v Speaker 5>why people do this?</v>

1019
00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Well people start that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing that does happen,</v>

1020
00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I've seen with men as they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they start to associate women with</v>

1021
00:44:47.711 --> 00:44:52.480
<v Speaker 2>pain because they get rejected and</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't try to hit on girls</v>

1022
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:55.060
<v Speaker 2>and they get shit on and they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>rejected and they get angry.</v>

1023
00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.990
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this antagonistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between women and them.</v>

1024
00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:03.520
<v Speaker 2>They look at women as the enemy and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look at women as the cause of</v>

1025
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:08.020
<v Speaker 2>emotional pain and then they start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>insult them and say nasty shit to them.</v>

1026
00:45:08.021 --> 00:45:09.610
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it happen with guys where</v>

1027
00:45:09.611 --> 00:45:10.331
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1028
00:45:10.331 --> 00:45:14.530
<v Speaker 2>they start off kind of like carefree and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then as they get into their thirties and</v>

1029
00:45:14.531 --> 00:45:16.210
<v Speaker 2>then they start getting more shitty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they,</v>

1030
00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.500
<v Speaker 5>well you see the arc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen the arc.</v>

1031
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:19.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it.</v>

1032
00:45:19.281 --> 00:45:21.140
<v Speaker 5>A couple of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they your friends?</v>

1033
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:22.040
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1034
00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.770
<v Speaker 5>I was going to ask if you've ever talked</v>
<v Speaker 5>to them about that because one thing I</v>

1035
00:45:24.771 --> 00:45:27.260
<v Speaker 5>think would help is if dudes were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1036
00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.213
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't do that.</v>

1037
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reason why I'm not friends</v>

1038
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:32.280
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one guy in particular is because of,</v>

1039
00:45:32.281 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme lack of awareness that became</v>

1040
00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:37.410
<v Speaker 2>more and more apparent as he got older</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you couldn't talk to him about</v>

1041
00:45:37.411 --> 00:45:39.390
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't talk to some about</v>

1042
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:40.970
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're doing something wrong and</v>

1043
00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:43.020
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to ever learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they're not going to ever learn</v>

1044
00:45:43.021 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 2>and grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always gonna have this weird</v>

1045
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:45.820
<v Speaker 2>blockade whenever you talk.</v>

1046
00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.940
<v Speaker 5>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1047
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.580
<v Speaker 5>you can't talk to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not one system because that's</v>

1048
00:45:49.581 --> 00:45:51.260
<v Speaker 5>what that's he should learn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1049
00:45:51.261 --> 00:45:53.780
<v Speaker 5>hopefully if you lose it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if his friends continued to do that and</v>

1050
00:45:53.781 --> 00:45:54.231
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1051
00:45:54.231 --> 00:45:56.540
<v Speaker 5>why the fuck weren't everybody go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people deep</v>

1052
00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 2>seated trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1053
00:45:59.611 --> 00:46:03.300
<v Speaker 2>these defense mechanisms that they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall right into every time.</v>

1054
00:46:03.301 --> 00:46:05.400
<v Speaker 2>And it's almost like they can't stay on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the edges.</v>

1055
00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And whatever for whatever psychological</v>

1056
00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:08.731
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1057
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:10.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's causing it,</v>

1058
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:14.850
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of men that I think as</v>

1059
00:46:14.851 --> 00:46:17.670
<v Speaker 2>time goes on and they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're not attractive,</v>

1060
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:19.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're not successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's both.</v>

1061
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.350
<v Speaker 2>But as time goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get more and more resentful and</v>

1062
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:23.250
<v Speaker 2>angry about women.</v>

1063
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:24.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes man,</v>

1064
00:46:24.491 --> 00:46:26.080
<v Speaker 5>we meet men that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1065
00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.270
<v Speaker 5>and it's not often,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you meet them and you're like,</v>

1066
00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.970
<v Speaker 5>you hate women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hate women.</v>

1067
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:35.110
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of times I've been doing this</v>
<v Speaker 5>lately when we get like shitty things</v>

1068
00:46:35.111 --> 00:46:36.820
<v Speaker 5>said to us on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1069
00:46:36.821 --> 00:46:38.620
<v Speaker 5>all respond back with like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1070
00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:40.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a really nice thing to say,</v>

1071
00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:42.160
<v Speaker 5>like a compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he'll,</v>

1072
00:46:42.161 --> 00:46:43.840
<v Speaker 5>it'll like break them down and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1073
00:46:43.841 --> 00:46:45.040
<v Speaker 5>who's brief on phony?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

1074
00:46:45.041 --> 00:46:45.761
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1075
00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:48.970
<v Speaker 5>and it's because to me when I see a man</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that,</v>

1076
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.290
<v Speaker 5>when they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me personally,</v>

1077
00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:52.090
<v Speaker 5>it's hard not to take it personal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's,</v>

1078
00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.840
<v Speaker 5>it's not a personal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're projecting what they feel</v>

1079
00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:58.340
<v Speaker 2>do that to me all the time and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it because they just want to get a</v>

1080
00:46:58.341 --> 00:47:00.200
<v Speaker 2>reaction out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the best ways to get a</v>

1081
00:47:00.201 --> 00:47:01.850
<v Speaker 2>reaction down to you and make you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

1082
00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1083
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:05.810
<v Speaker 2>If they say something nice to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't respond,</v>

1084
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:06.770
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1085
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:07.860
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I want it to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they try to respond.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1093
00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:27.790
<v Speaker 5>there's always someone who's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>push a button.</v>

1094
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.170
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean mean,</v>

1095
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.130

1096
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 4>do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the only reason cause they're</v>

1097
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:34.780
<v Speaker 4>losers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no one is like a happy,</v>

1098
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:39.130
<v Speaker 4>fulfilled person who hates on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't exist.</v>

1099
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:44.110
<v Speaker 4>Do that exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe you like I'm going to</v>

1100
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:45.740
<v Speaker 4>dedicate five minutes a day to be in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cut.</v>

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna go online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to shit on people.</v>

1102
00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.520
<v Speaker 4>Then I'm might go after cut times over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to just go water the garden</v>

<v Speaker 4>cathartic copies.</v>

1104
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People need to squeeze in some current</v>

1105
00:47:58.871 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 4>time in their day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think</v>

1106
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:07.270
<v Speaker 4>the social media version of a rage room</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's not really hurting anybody</v>

1107
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:09.580
<v Speaker 4>and no it's no one's actual dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're breaking,</v>

1108
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:13.240
<v Speaker 4>someone's just bought at a thrift store</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you can let it out and then you</v>

1109
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 4>can let your punching back cause God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Ronson is one of the smartest</v>

1110
00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:19.840
<v Speaker 4>people we've ever had the honor of</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to him and was super cry and</v>

1111
00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:23.890
<v Speaker 4>he's like when are we going to stop</v>
<v Speaker 4>making people are play thing or what?</v>

1112
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:27.880
<v Speaker 4>What was the quote a week?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are play things or play toys like</v>

1113
00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:32.881
<v Speaker 4>another quote that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It exists in chickens.</v>

1114
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I have chickens and one of the</v>

1115
00:48:35.021 --> 00:48:38.050
<v Speaker 4>things you always hear about chickens is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing called the pecking order.</v>

1116
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.650
<v Speaker 4>That shit is real as fuck and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a big chicken coop,</v>

1117
00:48:41.651 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 4>we have 22 chickens and one things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens is the chickens will find the</v>

1118
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 4>smallest chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fucked that chicken.</v>

1119
00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:50.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other chickens will pile on and</v>

1120
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:54.340
<v Speaker 4>they'll chase the chicken around and</v>
<v Speaker 4>peck it for no reason and sound like the</v>

1121
00:48:54.341 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Speaker 4>chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anything like it's just a smallest</v>

1122
00:48:56.771 --> 00:48:59.170
<v Speaker 4>chicken because the chicken die</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes.</v>

1123
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:02.350
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes chickens die and the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>ones will peck at the whole,</v>

1124
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:03.790
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And try to eat it.</v>

1125
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Pitches being crazy terrifies her dogs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dogs.</v>

1126
00:49:08.621 --> 00:49:09.454
<v Speaker 4>It exists.</v>

1127
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 4>There's the Alpha and then there's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Betas,</v>

1128
00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:12.880
<v Speaker 4>wolf packs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It exists.</v>

1129
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:18.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just a normal thing about</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature where when humans see someone</v>

1130
00:49:18.191 --> 00:49:22.000
<v Speaker 4>who's weak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to work very hard to resist the</v>

1131
00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:25.720
<v Speaker 4>urge to go get the fuck Outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get your shit together,</v>

1132
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop fucking crying like that.</v>

1133
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:32.530
<v Speaker 4>That instinct to be cruel to someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>whose week is like genetically</v>

1134
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:36.310
<v Speaker 4>predisposed and people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a part of what made the genes of</v>

1135
00:49:36.311 --> 00:49:41.140
<v Speaker 4>the stronger people keep moving and ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were weak and they couldn't handle</v>

1136
00:49:41.141 --> 00:49:44.470
<v Speaker 4>emotional stress and then they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>shunned when they were pushed out of the</v>

1137
00:49:44.471 --> 00:49:47.440
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we're finding now with this new</v>

1138
00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:51.790
<v Speaker 4>society that live when we live in where</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are able to gather information</v>

1139
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:55.780
<v Speaker 4>and communicate and doing things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even involve like person to person</v>

1140
00:49:55.781 --> 00:49:59.320
<v Speaker 4>contact is that these people who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>introverts and these people that are shy</v>

1141
00:49:59.321 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 4>and maybe even like socially awkward or</v>
<v Speaker 4>have are a huge problem with</v>

1142
00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:05.140
<v Speaker 4>confrontation and you would consider</v>
<v Speaker 4>them week.</v>

1143
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:09.580
<v Speaker 4>They have a type of creativity that</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't exist in the Alphas.</v>

1144
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.440
<v Speaker 4>They have a type of creativity and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a perspective and it may be in an</v>

1145
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:19.590
<v Speaker 4>introspective way of approaching things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is super valuable to like computer</v>

1146
00:50:20.531 --> 00:50:25.531
<v Speaker 4>coding to a lot of other things that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>would normally think of as being um,</v>

1147
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.090
<v Speaker 4>well they're not even normally think of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's</v>

1148
00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:31.100
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are alternative methods of</v>

1149
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

1150
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:34.640
<v Speaker 3>You would perceive that an outgoing</v>
<v Speaker 3>person would perceive that as like what</v>

1151
00:50:34.641 --> 00:50:35.640
<v Speaker 3>are you an idiot or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1152
00:50:35.641 --> 00:50:36.530
<v Speaker 3>they don't exist in the [inaudible]</v>

1153
00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:37.830
<v Speaker 2>normal paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

1154
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.300
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at human societies up</v>
<v Speaker 2>until like the last couple hundred</v>

1155
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.560
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with people that have</v>

1156
00:50:43.561 --> 00:50:46.650
<v Speaker 2>these hardworking jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few artists,</v>

1157
00:50:46.651 --> 00:50:48.660
<v Speaker 2>musicians and painters and things along</v>
<v Speaker 2>those lines.</v>

1158
00:50:48.661 --> 00:50:51.330
<v Speaker 2>But most of what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not a craftsperson,</v>

1159
00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.940
<v Speaker 2>hard labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult jobs.</v>

1160
00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.980
<v Speaker 2>There's no computer coding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1161
00:50:55.981 --> 00:50:57.630
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's so many of these</v>

1162
00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:03.080
<v Speaker 2>alternative positions as far as like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way the human mind works that were never</v>

1163
00:51:03.391 --> 00:51:06.020
<v Speaker 2>available to someone who lived three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

1164
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:09.330
<v Speaker 2>500 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're finding value,</v>

1165
00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.220
<v Speaker 2>we're finding value in different kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thinking and people with a different</v>

1166
00:51:14.221 --> 00:51:18.030
<v Speaker 2>people that are on the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asperger's and autism artist,</v>

1167
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:21.930
<v Speaker 2>while they have a different sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and we are looking at them</v>

1168
00:51:21.931 --> 00:51:24.450
<v Speaker 2>as if there's something wrong with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't,</v>

1169
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.290
<v Speaker 2>they don't interact with people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same way as most people do emotionally.</v>

1170
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.720
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes they have like a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult funding,</v>

1171
00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.930
<v Speaker 2>difficult time finding emotional and</v>
<v Speaker 2>social bonds with people.</v>

1172
00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.900
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to a lot of other things,</v>

1173
00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:38.340
<v Speaker 2>some of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all of them,</v>

1174
00:51:38.341 --> 00:51:42.600
<v Speaker 2>but some of them excel at those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that a lot of people can't,</v>

1175
00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.910
<v Speaker 2>aren't even capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things they say about</v>

1176
00:51:44.911 --> 00:51:47.310
<v Speaker 2>people in Silicon Valley that work in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of,</v>

1177
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:51.180
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs that involve computer coding and</v>

1178
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:55.140
<v Speaker 2>programming and things along that lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a giant percentage of the</v>

1179
00:51:55.141 --> 00:51:57.560
<v Speaker 2>people that are on the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan like it,</v>

1180
00:51:57.561 --> 00:51:59.820
<v Speaker 2>it might be like 90 [inaudible] works</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1181
00:51:59.821 --> 00:52:00.450
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1182
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:01.690
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is mike much,</v>

1183
00:52:01.691 --> 00:52:04.590
<v Speaker 2>much more social than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not interacting with people a lot</v>

1184
00:52:04.591 --> 00:52:05.600
<v Speaker 2>in that job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1185
00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.680
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That your bullock excel at that they</v>

1186
00:52:07.681 --> 00:52:08.514
<v Speaker 2>want done.</v>

1187
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to realize that this is</v>

1188
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.350
<v Speaker 2>like if it was for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the three of us,</v>

1189
00:52:13.351 --> 00:52:16.290
<v Speaker 2>there'd be no fucking cell phones cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were on a deserted island.</v>

1190
00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:18.960
<v Speaker 2>You could live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The three of us,</v>

1191
00:52:18.961 --> 00:52:20.960
<v Speaker 2>we live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's his or her daughter and</v>

1192
00:52:20.961 --> 00:52:24.000
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The animals.</v>

1193
00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've started a fire.</v>

1194
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'd,</v>

1195
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I'd show you how to kill animals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you guys could show me some</v>

1196
00:52:30.301 --> 00:52:31.460
<v Speaker 2>emotional intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1197
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:33.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about working on feelings.</v>

1198
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I could make you a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a mask for your face.</v>

1199
00:52:35.671 --> 00:52:37.780
<v Speaker 2>You'd have great skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1200
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:43.470
<v Speaker 2>The urge to be cruel to someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>weaker than you has to be resisted in,</v>

1201
00:52:44.191 --> 00:52:47.250
<v Speaker 2>in any sort of a comfortable society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not reinforced enough.</v>

1202
00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:50.430
<v Speaker 3>That should be on a bumper sticker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That trail where I thought you were</v>

1203
00:52:50.431 --> 00:52:52.080
<v Speaker 3>going with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were going to be,</v>

1204
00:52:52.081 --> 00:52:54.510
<v Speaker 3>be like people who call a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1205
00:52:54.511 --> 00:52:59.511
<v Speaker 3>people out in a articles in jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bellin broadly are really meek when</v>

1206
00:52:59.611 --> 00:53:02.120
<v Speaker 3>you meet him in person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I thought that was,</v>

1207
00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:04.580
<v Speaker 3>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I wasn't sure.</v>

1208
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:07.260
<v Speaker 3>And then I was falling and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not at all where he's going with</v>

1209
00:53:07.261 --> 00:53:08.094
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1210
00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.970
<v Speaker 3>I think that's also true though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My experience is</v>

1211
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:13.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of true in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think even what they're doing,</v>

1212
00:53:13.771 --> 00:53:16.440
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to mention anyone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

1213
00:53:16.441 --> 00:53:21.120
<v Speaker 2>but this one particular feminist writer</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know who like will attack and go</v>

1214
00:53:21.121 --> 00:53:24.120
<v Speaker 2>after women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like severely depressed and sad</v>

1215
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:25.243
<v Speaker 2>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

1216
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 4>she's overweight and she's unhappy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>unhealthy and it's,</v>

1217
00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.540
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she aware of that core.</v>

1218
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1219
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.400
<v Speaker 4>I got a mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1220
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.170
<v Speaker 4>and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you for saying that.</v>

1221
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not she revels in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>awareness,</v>

1222
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.440
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's more,</v>

1223
00:53:40.441 --> 00:53:42.570
<v Speaker 4>I guess what a lot of these people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are calling people out,</v>

1224
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.250
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people that are calling people</v>

1225
00:53:44.251 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 4>out there doing the world a service</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're exposing real</v>

1226
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:50.450
<v Speaker 4>problematic behavior that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>expect.</v>

1227
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.960
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look what I was talking about my friend</v>

1228
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:54.180
<v Speaker 4>who gets sexually harassed by a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't experience that.</v>

1229
00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:56.160
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a job where I have a boss</v>

1230
00:53:56.161 --> 00:53:57.360
<v Speaker 4>who's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1231
00:53:57.361 --> 00:54:00.180
<v Speaker 4>But if I was a woman and I had a boss</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a man who was trying to fuck me</v>

1232
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:00.991
<v Speaker 4>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're worried you have to be a certain</v>

1236
00:54:05.071 --> 00:54:08.790
<v Speaker 4>amount of flirtatious with this guy at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain level so that you can maintain</v>

1237
00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:11.550
<v Speaker 4>your position or maybe even like get a</v>
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:28.710
<v Speaker 5>it's not that we wanted to fuck each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>

1246
00:54:28.711 --> 00:54:31.470
<v Speaker 5>but I at least had some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>willing to give you the time of day.</v>

1252
00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:44.490

00:54:59.041 --> 00:54:59.874
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>

1260
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously we're talking about a bunch of</v>

1261
00:55:01.721 --> 00:55:03.820
<v Speaker 4>different exchanges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't always have to be</v>

1262
00:55:03.821 --> 00:55:04.654
<v Speaker 4>negative either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:05.890
<v Speaker 4>You can just be friendly with each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

1264
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1265
00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.060
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last time I dated a female comedian,</v>

1266
00:55:10.061 --> 00:55:13.900
<v Speaker 4>we were both 21 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was when I was in Boston and I</v>

1267
00:55:13.901 --> 00:55:14.910
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is terrible.</v>

1268

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1269
00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:17.800
<v Speaker 5>As I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like a bull fucking crazy.</v>

1270
00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.220
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like the beginning of a bad</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>

1271
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:20.201
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1272
00:55:20.201 --> 00:55:23.440
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think one of the things that</v>

1273
00:55:23.441 --> 00:55:26.270
<v Speaker 5>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we can work comedian Thomson around</v>

<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

1289
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:59.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm more comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a time where I look back,</v>

1290
00:55:59.881 --> 00:56:03.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't not friends with any big female</v>

1291
00:56:03.061 --> 00:56:05.100
<v Speaker 5>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's only male because I feel more</v>

1292
00:56:05.101 --> 00:56:08.940
<v Speaker 5>comfortable going up to the mail cause I</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like there's something of like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I have something to offer only it's only</v>
<v Speaker 5>flirting.</v>

1294
00:56:12.841 --> 00:56:13.621
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not going to,</v>

1295
00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 5>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had been in a relationship as long</v>

1296
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:17.160
<v Speaker 5>as I've been doing standup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1297
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.040
<v Speaker 5>but if not a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have probably fucked a lot</v>

1298
00:56:20.041 --> 00:56:22.230
<v Speaker 5>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a better this way,</v>

1299
00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:23.350
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1300
00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:24.250

1301
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.260
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I think of going up to</v>

1302
00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:29.420
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's great going up to a woman.</v>

1338
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:38.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a different animal when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a woman,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that I'm Eliza brought up when she was</v>

1341
00:57:42.531 --> 00:57:45.110

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1342
00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:49.580
<v Speaker 2>She was talking about how some men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when she first started with</v>

1343
00:57:49.581 --> 00:57:52.100
<v Speaker 2>treat her because she was just starting</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1344

<v Speaker 2>she wasn't very good yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1345
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.200
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone who is established and is</v>

<v Speaker 2>lesser thing than them.</v>

1348
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:08.120
<v Speaker 2>They don't look at you like a peer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to tell this to as many</v>

1349
00:58:08.121 --> 00:58:10.260
<v Speaker 2>young comics as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1350
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:14.090

<v Speaker 2>look at all of us,</v>

1351
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:16.580
<v Speaker 2>all of us that are doing this thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

1353
00:58:18.201 --> 00:58:20.030
<v Speaker 2>days and someone might be doing it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years,</v>

1354
00:58:20.031 --> 00:58:22.370
<v Speaker 2>but we're all doing the same thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>is so vast.</v>

1375
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Any night of the week there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so cool.</v>

1376
00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:12.060
<v Speaker 2>And that's really supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1377
00:59:12.061 --> 00:59:14.550
<v Speaker 2>it is a super support and people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not supportive,</v>

1378
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:15.160
<v Speaker 2>they get pushed.</v>

1379
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love that.</v>

1380
00:59:16.101 --> 00:59:19.640
<v Speaker 1>I think the comedy community in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>too was very supportive and we're very,</v>

1381
00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 1>we do bet we give each other when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when</v>

1382
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.840
<v Speaker 2>we think of goods and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>

1383
00:59:23.841 --> 00:59:25.310
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about comedy,</v>

1384
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:29.270
<v Speaker 2>we live and breathe it and we nerd out</v>
<v Speaker 2>on in the green rooms and we really are</v>

1385
00:59:29.271 --> 00:59:31.010
<v Speaker 2>supportive and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1386
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

1387
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:33.180
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>

1388
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Don't you guys think that now it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to do that too because it's not</v>

1389
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:39.920
<v Speaker 2>like everyone's competing for a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>small amount of spots.</v>

1390
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Like it used to be like there was only</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many spots on a sitcom.</v>

1391
00:59:43.011 --> 00:59:46.550
<v Speaker 2>There's only so many spots to host a</v>
<v Speaker 2>late night show and everybody was like</v>

1392
00:59:46.551 --> 00:59:48.260
<v Speaker 2>hyper competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1393
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

1394
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 3>you're on opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Create your on saying,</v>

1395
00:59:50.241 --> 00:59:52.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's some examples of it guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We fucked one of them.</v>

1396
00:59:52.701 --> 00:59:54.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm broad city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1397
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:58.160
<v Speaker 3>I love the story of broad city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abby and Alana couldn't get on house</v>

1398
00:59:58.161 --> 00:59:59.450
<v Speaker 3>teams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just kept getting rejected from</v>

1399
00:59:59.451 --> 01:00:01.520
<v Speaker 3>house teams at UCB.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

1400
01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:03.830
<v Speaker 3>they started working on this web series</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

1401
01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 3>It blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1402
01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:08.120
<v Speaker 3>the quality of the web series before I</v>
<v Speaker 3>made it to air is phenomenal.</v>

1403
01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:10.190
<v Speaker 3>They just put a lot of hard work into it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they said,</v>

1404
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to take no for an</v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

1405
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.480
<v Speaker 3>And if this community that we've worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>in so long is saying no,</v>

1406
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:16.340
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do it on our own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they did,</v>

1407
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:18.970
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also one of the things is that like</v>

1408
01:00:18.971 --> 01:00:21.010
<v Speaker 2>podcasters and people that do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>online,</v>

1409
01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.080
<v Speaker 2>they support other people to do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

1410
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Like you never see someone from a show</v>
<v Speaker 2>on CBS getting promoted from a show on</v>

1411
01:00:27.701 --> 01:00:28.470
<v Speaker 2>NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1412
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:29.500
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Rare.</v>

1413
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.810
<v Speaker 2>But in the world of podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super common.</v>

1414
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody has everybody on their</v>

1415
01:00:33.461 --> 01:00:35.410
<v Speaker 2>shows and we always talk everybody up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hey,</v>

1416
01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:38.710
<v Speaker 2>go see she's playing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's playing there and you promote</v>

1417
01:00:38.711 --> 01:00:42.100
<v Speaker 2>their dates and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a way more egalitarian,</v>

1418
01:00:42.101 --> 01:00:47.101
<v Speaker 2>way more like supportive community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a win win for everybody because</v>

1419
01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:50.080
<v Speaker 2>it never feels good to be supportive of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people you respect and admire.</v>

1420
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1421
01:00:52.541 --> 01:00:53.351
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it too,</v>

1422
01:00:53.351 --> 01:00:56.170
<v Speaker 1>that's why I love standup because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only one who's going to do your act.</v>

1423
01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't worry about the company.</v>

1424
01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1425
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1426
01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's only one.</v>

1427
01:01:03.131 --> 01:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1428
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:06.740
<v Speaker 2>You and the people that are shitty to</v>
<v Speaker 2>other comedians they get,</v>

1429
01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:09.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a comic,</v>

1430
01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:10.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any comedian friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>

1431
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:12.560
<v Speaker 2>that's a giant problem.</v>

1432
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Just like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous person.</v>

1433
01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of a lot of famous one.</v>

1434
01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:18.574
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1435
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Some famous ones that come to the store</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1436
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.660
<v Speaker 2>the door people get super bummed out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just look past them.</v>

1437
01:01:24.661 --> 01:01:27.240
<v Speaker 2>They don't say hi to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll go straight to bill burr or</v>

1438
01:01:27.241 --> 01:01:30.420
<v Speaker 2>straight to someone famous and only</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to them and they don't talk to</v>

1439
01:01:30.421 --> 01:01:31.254
<v Speaker 2>regular folks,</v>

1440
01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I feel like too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've had interactions with famous</v>

1441
01:01:33.851 --> 01:01:35.230
<v Speaker 1>comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the first one,</v>

1442
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>the person was being a dick and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like looking down and,</v>

1443
01:01:37.941 --> 01:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>and I was being introduced by his friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

1444
01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.100
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing when it had sunglasses</v>

1445
01:01:42.101 --> 01:01:42.970
<v Speaker 1>indoors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1446
01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was La Barf all over.</v>

1447
01:01:49.361 --> 01:01:52.610
<v Speaker 1>You gimme a name they rhyme with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you're going to absolutely know.</v>

1448
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:57.160
<v Speaker 1>But then the second time we met him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some couldn't have been nicer,</v>

1449
01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe going through some weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1450
01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1451
01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Somewhat run into someone like at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1452
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I labeled them.</v>

1453
01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I labeled them an asshole though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going through some shit while</v>

1454
01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>showing pictures of himself to another</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1455
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>But then is that how you act out</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if you're having a bad day or</v>

1456
01:02:14.511 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go right to naked photos.</v>

1457
01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get those modes in baby.</v>

1458
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Only if my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just show them my app.</v>

1459
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do.</v>

1460
01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you take nudes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1461
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking of doing it now?</v>

1462
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Really just from two seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see your recommended it,</v>

1463
01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>but just to be like a close up your</v>
<v Speaker 1>butthole.</v>

1464
01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Let's redefine the nude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any that I need to show</v>

1465
01:02:35.701 --> 01:02:36.534
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1466
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:37.870
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

1467
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>have you ever taken one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to see it.</v>

1468
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I've taken pictures of it.</v>

1469
01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really just for because it was,</v>

1470
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>cause you have a camera.</v>

1471
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Good lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1472
01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>He started taking pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1473
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Take pictures of my policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never taken a picture of my po.</v>

1474
01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I've never taken it as a check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a weird feeling down there</v>

1475
01:02:55.651 --> 01:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>and just make sure everything's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1476
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>it's your own doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was a girl,</v>

1477
01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely take pictures so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would really know what it looks like</v>

1478
01:03:01.261 --> 01:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>cause otherwise you can't really see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a gold squat.</v>

1479
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:04.770
<v Speaker 1>A mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Or you're super flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to like,</v>

1481
01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:09.060
<v Speaker 1>oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them tap around.</v>

1482
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be a contortionist back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See my own pussy from here.</v>

1483
01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't because we were discussed</v>

1484
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>that you've seen the Labia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really sure.</v>

1485
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the whole thing right?</v>

1486
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.500
<v Speaker 1>The giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hugs the Tampon.</v>

1487
01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:24.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the vagina would be the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1488
01:03:24.961 --> 01:03:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I would say the Vaginas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>

1489
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole that we're most concerned</v>

1490
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:30.720

<v Speaker 1>The Pussy is the house,</v>

1491
01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.910
<v Speaker 2>but the vagina is like the living room.</v>

1492
01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He could be right.</v>

1495
01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:40.140

<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1496
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.220
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're relatable.</v>

<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Bring Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean being fingered at 14 is a fucking</v>

1516
01:04:31.831 --> 01:04:34.290
<v Speaker 1>worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like Jack Camera.</v>

1517
01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Like someone's ringing a doorbell</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

1518
01:04:36.451 --> 01:04:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not clean.</v>

1519
01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is no doorbell,</v>

1520
01:04:39.211 --> 01:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1521
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.520
<v Speaker 1>you got to pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1522
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:42.463
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1523
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:43.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sucked.</v>

1524
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Well jackhammer fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1525
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:50.720
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be better now then when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were young and it's gotta be better when</v>

1526
01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:52.490
<v Speaker 2>we were young then when our parents were</v>
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>

1527
01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:54.140
<v Speaker 2>That is very true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

1528
01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and don't think that's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that's with everything.</v>

1529
01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on right now,</v>

1530
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:03.090
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1531
01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:08.110
<v Speaker 2>all this sexual assault stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>making the news is that we're,</v>

1532
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:11.270
<v Speaker 2>we're in the middle of a giant social</v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

1533
01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I feel that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like our hurricane around us</v>

1534
01:05:13.941 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>and fucking bathtubs and are flying</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the</v>

1535
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:21.850
<v Speaker 4>air and we're in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think a lot of times you don't</v>

1536
01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 4>realize how much change is actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking place.</v>

1537
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 4>But if you just try to look at comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the 1980s and look at comedy from</v>

1538
01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:31.630
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what you can get away with then and</v>

1539
01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 4>we you like go watch Eddie Murphy Raw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you would never do that today?</v>

1540
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:39.300
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carla like a lot of them had like a lot</v>

1541
01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.220
<v Speaker 4>homophobic shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know Andrew dice clay would</v>

1542
01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:46.110
<v Speaker 4>never fly today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe because he was a director.</v>

1543
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that that would work.</v>

1544
01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.740
<v Speaker 4>He used to be Andrew Silverstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know Andrew Silverstein was,</v>

1545
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:57.100
<v Speaker 4>he would do straight stand up and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a bunch of characters he would</v>

1546
01:05:57.101 --> 01:05:59.380
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the characters he's just do was</v>

1547
01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:01.270
<v Speaker 4>the dice man dies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1548
01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:06.010
<v Speaker 4>He put the jacket on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do these nursery rhymes.</v>

1549
01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would just light a cigarette.</v>

1550
01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he became the dice man.</v>

1551
01:06:14.111 --> 01:06:16.240
<v Speaker 4>It's like more comfortable to be that</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy all the time.</v>

1552
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.133
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

1553
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:19.150
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's comfortable being in a character.</v>

1554
01:06:19.151 --> 01:06:21.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm not my stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My bits are very,</v>

1555
01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:23.380
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that have done</v>

1556
01:06:23.381 --> 01:06:26.380
<v Speaker 4>that and they got trapped like emo</v>
<v Speaker 4>Phillips got trapped.</v>

1557
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.850
<v Speaker 4>I Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1558
01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:29.950
<v Speaker 4>I just watched a documentary at dying</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing.</v>

1559
01:06:29.951 --> 01:06:34.951
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called and he was on hell</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1560
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.660
<v Speaker 4>he's not like that cause I saw him when</v>
<v Speaker 4>he stopped doing that.</v>

1561
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 4>He stopped doing that for awhile and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then he went back to it.</v>

1562
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:43.270
<v Speaker 4>Bobcat goldthwait talk to me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you talked about it on the podcast.</v>

1563
01:06:43.271 --> 01:06:46.300
<v Speaker 4>It was really hard for him to stop doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it because everybody's like,</v>

1564
01:06:46.301 --> 01:06:47.960
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do the Bob cat thing.</v>

1565
01:06:47.961 --> 01:06:48.311
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1566
01:06:48.311 --> 01:06:49.144
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

1567
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:50.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a person just going to do my</v>
<v Speaker 4>standup.</v>

1568
01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:53.290
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a long time it was like really hard.</v>

1569
01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh that would piss me off because</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody wanted him to go</v>

1570
01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:02.080
<v Speaker 4>this thing for the longest time and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>just got older and it was like,</v>

1571
01:07:02.531 --> 01:07:04.900
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oops.</v>

1572
01:07:04.901 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 4>And it was really funny when he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>younger then it just didn't want to do</v>

1573
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:11.050
<v Speaker 4>it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you have that character,</v>

1574
01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 4>like if you're in a character all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1575
01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:14.610
<v Speaker 4>you get stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1576
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:16.110
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1577
01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean we see hard to perform it never</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like yourself.</v>

1578
01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:22.240
<v Speaker 4>That's what I like about it and that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>why their objections stings that much</v>

1579
01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:26.770
<v Speaker 4>more because like you were rejecting my</v>
<v Speaker 4>soul or rejecting you or what you're</v>

1580
01:07:26.771 --> 01:07:29.350
<v Speaker 4>presenting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you really got to take a second and</v>

1581
01:07:29.351 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1582
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:35.100
<v Speaker 4>I think for sure this is a tumultuous</v>
<v Speaker 4>time of change and I think ultimately</v>

1583
01:07:35.411 --> 01:07:38.890
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be very good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I got some weird ideas on it</v>

1584
01:07:38.891 --> 01:07:39.130
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1585
01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:42.850
<v Speaker 4>I really think that one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that holds us up is the ability of ally</v>

1586
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.180
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is not forever.</v>

1587
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.140
<v Speaker 4>I think the ability to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I think I,</v>

1588
01:07:49.141 --> 01:07:52.420
<v Speaker 4>I believe that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many years away,</v>

1589
01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:55.960
<v Speaker 4>whether it's 10 or 20 we're 20 whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

1590
01:07:56.170 --> 01:08:00.370
<v Speaker 4>years away of some Rosetta stone of</v>
<v Speaker 4>human interaction that takes place</v>

1591
01:08:00.371 --> 01:08:03.130
<v Speaker 4>electronically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're going to figure out some</v>

1592
01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:07.780
<v Speaker 4>way where we can teach children a</v>
<v Speaker 4>language that's a universal language</v>

1593
01:08:07.781 --> 01:08:12.781
<v Speaker 4>that's transmitted through computers or</v>
<v Speaker 4>through some sort of a human internet</v>

1594
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 4>interface,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a neural interface that</v>

1595
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 4>they're</v>

1596
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.060
<v Speaker 2>working on hundreds of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>versions of this right now where there</v>

1597
01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:23.030
<v Speaker 2>they can already send thoughts back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth to people from the Internet.</v>

1598
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.670
<v Speaker 2>They can send images to other people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>

1599
01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:28.460
<v Speaker 2>One person could send an image of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>triangle to your mind.</v>

1600
01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.930
<v Speaker 5>They can currently do that current.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1601
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:35.100
<v Speaker 2>They do it through some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>electrical stimulation of various parts</v>

1602
01:08:35.101 --> 01:08:39.510
<v Speaker 2>of the brain where you send a signal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that signal through your thoughts of</v>

1603
01:08:39.511 --> 01:08:42.390
<v Speaker 2>this object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have this idea like say if you</v>

1604
01:08:42.391 --> 01:08:45.330
<v Speaker 2>think of a bottle of water like well</v>
<v Speaker 2>something really a triangle.</v>

1605
01:08:45.331 --> 01:08:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to that shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very obvious sit symbol,</v>

1606
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:49.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what it looks like.</v>

1607
01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:52.080
<v Speaker 2>I know what it looks like and if I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of that,</v>

1608
01:08:52.081 --> 01:08:55.620
<v Speaker 2>there is a pattern in my brain that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can transmit to you through this very</v>

1609
01:08:55.621 --> 01:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>rudimentary technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1610
01:08:57.870 --> 01:09:00.360
<v Speaker 2>I liken it to like a Morse code machine.</v>

1611
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:02.140
<v Speaker 5>Did do,</v>

1612
01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.400
<v Speaker 2>they used to be able to communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>those as good as you get.</v>

1613
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously you took a video on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

1614
01:09:07.531 --> 01:09:09.060
<v Speaker 2>he sent it to someone New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1615
01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:09.871
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1616
01:09:09.871 --> 01:09:12.420
<v Speaker 2>we're in a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that far away.</v>

1617
01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're talking about just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of hundred years.</v>

1618
01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:17.830
<v Speaker 2>We've gone from the Morse code to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sending a video to New Zealand in real</v>

1619
01:09:17.831 --> 01:09:18.664
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1620
01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:21.640
<v Speaker 5>Well have you ever heard of a Fisher</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wallace stimulator?</v>

1621
01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:22.820
<v Speaker 5>I've heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1622
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:26.350
<v Speaker 5>So my mom has had depression most of her</v>
<v Speaker 5>life and she was,</v>

1623
01:09:26.351 --> 01:09:28.780
<v Speaker 5>has been on 25 different meds and made</v>
<v Speaker 5>her worse.</v>

1624
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:32.500
<v Speaker 5>And as a doctor prescribed a Fisher</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wallace stimulator,</v>

1625
01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:36.010
<v Speaker 5>it's just a little tiny machine with two</v>
<v Speaker 5>pads or sponges.</v>

1626
01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.710
<v Speaker 5>You what the sponge is a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you put them on your temples.</v>

1627
01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:41.380
<v Speaker 5>And she did it twice a day for about 20</v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>

1628
01:09:41.381 --> 01:09:45.160
<v Speaker 5>And her fucking depression went away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I felt,</v>

1629
01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.260
<v Speaker 5>felt like I got my mom like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1630
01:09:47.261 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 5>cause she just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1631
01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:54.450
<v Speaker 5>the meds would just make her so numb and</v>
<v Speaker 5>like emotionless and that would depress</v>

1632
01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:57.760
<v Speaker 5>her and she like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just lived my whole life I've been</v>

1633
01:09:57.761 --> 01:10:02.050
<v Speaker 5>seeing her do these peaks and valleys</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Fisher Wallace stimulator,</v>

1634
01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:05.320
<v Speaker 5>there's no side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If anything she gets a headache but</v>

1635
01:10:05.321 --> 01:10:08.410
<v Speaker 5>there's no mental side effects and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and hurt.</v>

1636
01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:12.220
<v Speaker 5>It's insane how often the chef to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She has it twice a day.</v>

1637
01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.220
<v Speaker 5>The only thing that I've noticed it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it,</v>

1638
01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:18.040
<v Speaker 5>this is a side effect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes her a little bit hyper and not</v>

1639
01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 5>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's getting are both</v>

1640
01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:25.110
<v Speaker 5>hyper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to tell as many people about.</v>

1641
01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:29.080
<v Speaker 5>But I'm wondering if that's similar</v>
<v Speaker 5>types of technology that are already</v>

1642
01:10:29.081 --> 01:10:30.940
<v Speaker 5>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if it'll make you fucking ecstatic?</v>

1643
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:32.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I was wondering.</v>

1644
01:10:32.471 --> 01:10:33.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mako borrow.</v>

1645
01:10:33.371 --> 01:10:36.490
<v Speaker 5>If you slap that bitch on when you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>on that Japanese toilet,</v>

1646
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.750
<v Speaker 5>hot water pumping up your claim like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>molly machine.</v>

1647
01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:41.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

1648
01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.640
<v Speaker 5>Put those babies on a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got to go to the bathroom now.</v>

1649
01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.430
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1650
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:52.450
<v Speaker 5>I just got to go light 20 milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a fan,</v>

1651
01:10:52.451 --> 01:10:55.870
<v Speaker 5>gave us a cookie in San Fran and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was labeled,</v>

1652
01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't know how much he ate and we</v>

1653
01:10:57.251 --> 01:10:58.270
<v Speaker 5>had to go on a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like,</v>

1654
01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:00.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to throw this out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

1655
01:11:00.821 --> 01:11:03.340
<v Speaker 5>at the end of a two week tour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're doing two shows and I was so</v>

1656
01:11:03.341 --> 01:11:04.210
<v Speaker 5>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1657
01:11:04.211 --> 01:11:05.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to get held up on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>plane.</v>

1658
01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:09.300
<v Speaker 5>So I took a little chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ate it and then it kicked in when we</v>

1659
01:11:09.301 --> 01:11:11.260
<v Speaker 5>were at the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And crim was like,</v>

1660
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna go get starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want anything like that?</v>

1661
01:11:13.150 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1662
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.450
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1663
01:11:15.451 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I texted chrome like,</v>

1664
01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:19.500
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hate me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1665
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.050
<v Speaker 3>oof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to die soon.</v>

1666
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:23.700
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not okay.</v>

1667
01:11:23.701 --> 01:11:26.640
<v Speaker 3>And then I just started having a panic</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack is already someone who is not</v>

1668
01:11:26.641 --> 01:11:27.820
<v Speaker 3>going to have flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1669
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have panic attacks all the time.</v>

1670
01:11:29.431 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 3>And then there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was bawling my eyes out in this</v>

1671
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:34.490
<v Speaker 4>little girl came up like two feet in</v>
<v Speaker 4>front of me and she was like,</v>

1672
01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:38.320
<v Speaker 3>and she just tilted her head and stared</v>
<v Speaker 3>at me and my career.</v>

1673
01:11:38.321 --> 01:11:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Why is she doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

1674
01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.171
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

1675
01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1676
01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.520
<v Speaker 3>that's the only time in my life I ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember having the feeling of like,</v>

1677
01:11:45.521 --> 01:11:50.020
<v Speaker 3>you're about to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a nine little girl just came over</v>

1678
01:11:50.021 --> 01:11:52.780
<v Speaker 3>like a normal little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when Christina said,</v>

1679
01:11:52.781 --> 01:11:54.370
<v Speaker 3>why is this little girl looking at me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1680
01:11:54.371 --> 01:11:57.280
<v Speaker 3>probably because she's never seen a</v>
<v Speaker 3>grown woman have a tantrum in an airport</v>

1681
01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:00.730
<v Speaker 3>and anxiety tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1682
01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.960
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting on that plane,</v>

1683
01:12:01.961 --> 01:12:03.760
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was gonna get kicked off</v>

1684
01:12:03.761 --> 01:12:05.070
<v Speaker 3>that plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

1685
01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she almost did because it wants to it,</v>

1686
01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.200
<v Speaker 3>I think in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like saying did,</v>

1687
01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.270
<v Speaker 3>she's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1688
01:12:10.271 --> 01:12:13.870
<v Speaker 3>she's not good at flying like that does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't fly anymore.</v>

1689
01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.753
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1690
01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:17.860
<v Speaker 3>the lady was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does she need to get off?</v>

1691
01:12:17.861 --> 01:12:18.460
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1692
01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.840
<v Speaker 3>she's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to be fine.</v>

1693
01:12:19.841 --> 01:12:22.160
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get through this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get back home.</v>

1694
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:24.310
<v Speaker 3>How far?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far was the flight?</v>

1695
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's from San Fran and New York,</v>

1696
01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:26.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1697
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:27.730
<v Speaker 3>it was all cross country.</v>

1698
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:32.890
<v Speaker 3>An hour after I got home to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment,</v>

1699
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.560
<v Speaker 3>she just put a blanket over her and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1700
01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have like,</v>

1701
01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:38.350
<v Speaker 4>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1702
01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:41.950
<v Speaker 4>well you wrote the Ro the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did and I survived.</v>

1703
01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:42.910
<v Speaker 4>Goddamn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1704
01:12:42.911 --> 01:12:44.290
<v Speaker 4>the edibles fucked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1705
01:12:44.291 --> 01:12:46.960
<v Speaker 4>they're just too God damn strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you just try to eat a</v>

1706
01:12:46.961 --> 01:12:48.430
<v Speaker 4>whole cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could have been hundreds of</v>

1707
01:12:48.431 --> 01:12:50.590
<v Speaker 4>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just took a little chunk of it.</v>

1708
01:12:50.591 --> 01:12:53.110
<v Speaker 4>It was a big ass cookie and I took a</v>
<v Speaker 4>quarter of it.</v>

1709
01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.720
<v Speaker 4>But then also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>

1710
01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.340
<v Speaker 4>quarter but that's why I'm scared like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Corindus psychedelics.</v>

1711
01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:02.500
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like if you have anxiety,</v>

1712
01:13:02.501 --> 01:13:06.220
<v Speaker 4>I've had a lot of anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably not for me it's a different</v>

1713
01:13:06.221 --> 01:13:11.221
<v Speaker 4>thing because the anxiety that you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>from edible marijuana is very peculiar.</v>

1714
01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:14.030
<v Speaker 4>It's intensely introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1715
01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't love edibles either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I much prefer mushrooms,</v>

1716
01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:18.830
<v Speaker 3>acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did DMT recently.</v>

1717
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:21.430
<v Speaker 3>I studied using partially using your</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentaries.</v>

1718
01:13:21.431 --> 01:13:22.690
<v Speaker 3>The thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very important.</v>

1720
01:13:24.681 --> 01:13:26.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean cause that's scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to study.</v>

1721
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely not something you should</v>

1722
01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:29.630
<v Speaker 4>take.</v>

1723
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:30.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely not.</v>

1724
01:13:30.471 --> 01:13:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I studied for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had it sitting on my table and I</v>

1725
01:13:32.451 --> 01:13:35.990
<v Speaker 3>studied for like a good two months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watched a lot of stuff on the Internet.</v>

1726
01:13:35.991 --> 01:13:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1727
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.240
<v Speaker 4>A lot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk to people who had done it.</v>

1728
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.390
<v Speaker 4>What's crazy is a natural part of human</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurochemistry chemistry that exists,</v>

1729
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:46.520
<v Speaker 4>that your brain's making that stuff all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and then you can just extract</v>

1730
01:13:46.521 --> 01:13:49.970
<v Speaker 4>it from a thousand different plants and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you take it,</v>

1731
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:52.730
<v Speaker 4>smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you meet Jesus and aliens and</v>

1732
01:13:52.731 --> 01:13:54.140
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you met Jesus?</v>

1733
01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Meet everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things that are changing.</v>

1734
01:13:57.561 --> 01:13:59.360
<v Speaker 4>So whatever the fuck they were a second</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

1735
01:13:59.361 --> 01:14:02.230
<v Speaker 4>they're not the same thing a second</v>
<v Speaker 4>later shift.</v>

1736
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.520
<v Speaker 4>This is pretty fucking intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Such a curious person and you really try</v>

1737
01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.510
<v Speaker 4>has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has psychedelics made you cause people,</v>

1738
01:14:11.511 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 4>it really makes a</v>

1739
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.190
<v Speaker 5>positive shift in their consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 5>and their curiosity.</v>

1740
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:18.220
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it happen and sometimes it</v>
<v Speaker 5>goes the other way but um,</v>

1741
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.000
<v Speaker 5>is that where we always are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>purposes</v>

1742
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:22.730
<v Speaker 2>curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it made my curiosity,</v>

1743
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.870
<v Speaker 2>it confirmed the need for it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do,</v>

1744
01:14:26.871 --> 01:14:31.871
<v Speaker 2>when you do something like Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is so profoundly bizarre that after</v>

1745
01:14:32.211 --> 01:14:37.070
<v Speaker 2>it's over you are so stunned at how few</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know about this and how you</v>

1746
01:14:37.071 --> 01:14:39.890
<v Speaker 2>didn't know about until that happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how you'll never be the same again.</v>

1747
01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh you'll never be the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1748
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you never going to be the same</v>

1749
01:14:44.301 --> 01:14:45.560
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know that's a real,</v>

1750
01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:50.620
<v Speaker 2>you know that you could go through this</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical portal to what's essentially</v>

1751
01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:54.110
<v Speaker 2>another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean is it sounds like it another</v>

1752
01:14:54.111 --> 01:14:57.980
<v Speaker 2>dimension where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are interacting with ideas that seem</v>

1753
01:14:57.981 --> 01:15:00.380
<v Speaker 2>to be sent in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem to be alive.</v>

1754
01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.251
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1755
01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:04.370
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being inundated with thoughts and</v>

1756
01:15:04.371 --> 01:15:07.460
<v Speaker 2>words that come at you without like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical presence.</v>

1757
01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Like no one's saying a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like if I said to you,</v>

1758
01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.920
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get a cup of coffee,</v>

1759
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:16.370
<v Speaker 2>like that signal goes into your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're hearing my words.</v>

1760
01:15:16.371 --> 01:15:21.050
<v Speaker 2>You interpret them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the same thing from these dmt</v>

1761
01:15:21.051 --> 01:15:23.660
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't actually hear the words.</v>

1762
01:15:23.661 --> 01:15:28.070
<v Speaker 2>But you know what the words are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>titanic.</v>

1763
01:15:28.071 --> 01:15:28.904
<v Speaker 2>Really Bizarre.</v>

1764
01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:31.970
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen a heel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a psych Akilah or have you ever had</v>

1765
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:33.980
<v Speaker 5>I've ever heard a psychic surgery and</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe them,</v>

1766
01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.070
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1767
01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never really talk about this cause I</v>

1768
01:15:37.501 --> 01:15:38.910
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't need people,</v>

1769
01:15:38.911 --> 01:15:41.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to convert anybody to</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe in this shit,</v>

1770
01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.620
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I've had psychic surgery once and I,</v>

1771
01:15:43.621 --> 01:15:45.490
<v Speaker 5>and my mom and I had from this work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1772
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:46.980
<v Speaker 5>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>

1773
01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:49.210
<v Speaker 5>his name was Dr V.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1774
01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.790
<v Speaker 5>and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did,</v>

1775
01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:56.520
<v Speaker 5>I did have my shirt off the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you wake up,</v>

1776
01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:59.550
<v Speaker 5>know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ours is another revolution of another</v>

1777
01:15:59.551 --> 01:16:02.190
<v Speaker 5>sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was conscious the whole time,</v>

1778
01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:03.024
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1779
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:04.970
<v Speaker 5>I like my mom had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1780
01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:08.180
<v Speaker 5>breast tissue that was really hard in</v>
<v Speaker 5>her breast because she had all these</v>

1781
01:16:08.181 --> 01:16:09.660
<v Speaker 5>surgeries for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get little tumors removed,</v>

1782
01:16:09.661 --> 01:16:12.570
<v Speaker 5>they weren't cancerous and it really</v>
<v Speaker 5>hurt or like if you've touched her boob,</v>

1783
01:16:12.571 --> 01:16:14.460
<v Speaker 5>like it would hurt and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1784
01:16:14.461 --> 01:16:18.590
<v Speaker 5>so this doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he used to work for NASA and a,</v>

1785
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.720
<v Speaker 5>he's Russian and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's very mysterious.</v>

1786
01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.250
<v Speaker 5>You looked into his background.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to Google it,</v>

1787
01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:26.100
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have,</v>

1788
01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:27.750
<v Speaker 5>it didn't seem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we're going to new,</v>

1789
01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:30.870
<v Speaker 5>a tiny little apartment and this old</v>
<v Speaker 5>lady was answering and she was like,</v>

1790
01:16:30.871 --> 01:16:31.704
<v Speaker 5>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

1791
01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.260
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he did,</v>

1792
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.280
<v Speaker 5>he didn't touch her and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he kept moving his hands like this and</v>

1793
01:16:38.281 --> 01:16:39.240
<v Speaker 5>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would do this,</v>

1794
01:16:39.241 --> 01:16:42.690
<v Speaker 5>like he was trying to get warm and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would flick it and then he would,</v>

1795
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:47.750
<v Speaker 5>he would circle around her boob and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull out like an imaginary thing and it</v>

1796
01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.070
<v Speaker 5>was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The heart tissue was gone.</v>

1797
01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.730
<v Speaker 5>It's the weirdest fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he did it to me with my knee.</v>

1798
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.140
<v Speaker 5>It was the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I mean it's like seeing a ghost like</v>

1799
01:16:58.141 --> 01:16:58.974
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't,</v>

1800
01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:00.450
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need that just happened.</v>

1801
01:17:00.451 --> 01:17:01.320
<v Speaker 5>That's undeniable.</v>

1802
01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in it,</v>

1803
01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:06.860
<v Speaker 2>your body can produce some pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible results.</v>

1804
01:17:06.861 --> 01:17:08.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the power of suggestion</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1805
01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:12.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what placebo effect is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Placebo effects a hundred percent real</v>

1806
01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:14.930
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't even know that psychic</v>

1807
01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:17.060
<v Speaker 2>surgery was a thing before he actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>

1808
01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not doing anything.</v>

1809
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:22.160
<v Speaker 2>He's just getting you convinced that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing something and by him being</v>

1810
01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:24.020
<v Speaker 2>convincing you that he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1811
01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:27.770
<v Speaker 2>you feel some sort of a positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>response because your body reacts as if</v>

1812
01:17:27.771 --> 01:17:30.320
<v Speaker 2>he's done something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a service in and of itself.</v>

1813
01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:30.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1814
01:17:30.711 --> 01:17:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a service in and of itself,</v>

1815
01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:36.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's also deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird thing that people do,</v>

1816
01:17:36.501 --> 01:17:37.970
<v Speaker 2>like where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1817
01:17:37.971 --> 01:17:41.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of weird healers where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do like Reiki and all this</v>

1818
01:17:41.121 --> 01:17:42.000
<v Speaker 2>different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

1819
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.520
<v Speaker 2>there's no science behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1820
01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.680
<v Speaker 2>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you think that it's doing</v>

1821
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:47.210
<v Speaker 2>something to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can feel better.</v>

1822
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:50.300
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] acupuncture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything.</v>

1823
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had it.</v>

1824
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I've had it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the guy was a quack,</v>

1825
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.790
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean that it's not real.</v>

1826
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:58.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very skeptical,</v>

1827
01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:01.320
<v Speaker 3>but I was working in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was like a receptionist at a</v>

1828
01:18:01.321 --> 01:18:06.321
<v Speaker 3>spa was my day job while pursuing comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was an acupuncturist there and</v>

1829
01:18:07.111 --> 01:18:08.310
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me try it.</v>

1830
01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in a really deep depression and</v>

1831
01:18:10.681 --> 01:18:13.560
<v Speaker 3>like the mind body connection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to say she and she's,</v>

1832
01:18:13.561 --> 01:18:15.600
<v Speaker 3>and she's an md.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not just the person off the</v>

1833
01:18:15.601 --> 01:18:16.830
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This woman's an MD,</v>

1834
01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:19.330
<v Speaker 3>a young woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

1835
01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.010
<v Speaker 3>it changed my life and I hate to even</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that I'm embarrassed to even be like</v>

1836
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I have an acupuncturist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems so hippy dippy mind</v>

1837
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:27.900
<v Speaker 2>body connection is a misnomer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1838
01:18:27.901 --> 01:18:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Because your mind is a part of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1839
01:18:29.641 --> 01:18:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why one of the things with people</v>

1840
01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:33.890
<v Speaker 2>don't have healthy bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:36.720
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't have a healthy body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind's not going to function at its</v>

1842
01:18:36.721 --> 01:18:38.670
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be a brilliant person with an</v>

1843
01:18:38.671 --> 01:18:39.880
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1844
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:44.400
<v Speaker 2>But you will be better if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body functions well.</v>

1845
01:18:44.401 --> 01:18:47.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not giving you trump problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not causing you issues.</v>

1846
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>

1847
01:18:48.911 --> 01:18:51.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a source of stress and concern.</v>

1848
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:56.280
<v Speaker 2>And I think that what these people can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do or there's a lot of different things</v>

1849
01:18:56.281 --> 01:18:59.970
<v Speaker 2>that are not supportive whatsoever by</v>
<v Speaker 2>science and a lot of people that are</v>

1850
01:18:59.971 --> 01:19:01.710
<v Speaker 2>very scientifically minded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ish,</v>

1851
01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:05.460
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shun those things and they think</v>

1852
01:19:05.461 --> 01:19:08.700
<v Speaker 2>those things have zero benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they also put religion in that group</v>

1853
01:19:08.701 --> 01:19:09.060
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1854
01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:13.580
<v Speaker 2>And I think they're very similar in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in certain things like a,</v>

1855
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:17.370
<v Speaker 2>there was a thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a article recently by Robert Sapolsky</v>

1856
01:19:17.371 --> 01:19:18.410
<v Speaker 2>who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1857
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.410
<v Speaker 2>he's a out of state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a professor at Stanford University</v>

1858
01:19:22.411 --> 01:19:24.480
<v Speaker 2>and we had him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about,</v>

1859
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:27.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about primates and he's a really,</v>

1860
01:19:27.841 --> 01:19:29.400
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott,</v>

1861
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:33.390
<v Speaker 2>some amazing studies that he's done on</v>
<v Speaker 2>baboons and primate behavior.</v>

1862
01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:36.930
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about is the stress relieving aspect of,</v>

1863
01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:39.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual religious belief.</v>

1864
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:42.630
<v Speaker 2>So you could say that if you really do</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that everything's going to be</v>

1865
01:19:42.631 --> 01:19:45.030
<v Speaker 2>fine cause God's looking out for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just,</v>

1866
01:19:45.031 --> 01:19:46.590
<v Speaker 2>that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's real or</v>

1867
01:19:46.591 --> 01:19:51.060
<v Speaker 2>scientifically verifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that proof or it is not necessary for</v>

1868
01:19:51.061 --> 01:19:52.110
<v Speaker 2>you to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1869
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean I choose to be a positive person</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's my survival mechanism.</v>

1870
01:19:55.621 --> 01:19:57.640
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have made it through life</v>
<v Speaker 2>without being positive.</v>

1871
01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Positive is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an actual belief that something is</v>

1872
01:20:01.021 --> 01:20:05.820
<v Speaker 2>happening to your body that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientifically possible like that</v>

1873
01:20:05.821 --> 01:20:09.660
<v Speaker 2>someone can rub their right I all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad juju out of your body.</v>

1874
01:20:09.710 --> 01:20:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you believe that though,</v>

1875
01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:16.590
<v Speaker 2>just the belief in that can trigger a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of what human neuro chemistry that</v>

1876
01:20:16.591 --> 01:20:17.640
<v Speaker 2>literally will make you feel.</v>

1877
01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.390
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can now,</v>

1878
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:20.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after that experience,</v>

1879
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 5>that was a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

1880
01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:25.020
<v Speaker 5>if I like lay on my bed and meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really do that cause I don't</v>

1881
01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:26.280
<v Speaker 5>have time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I can,</v>

1882
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:30.210
<v Speaker 5>if I think really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can make certain parts of my body like</v>

1883
01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:33.000
<v Speaker 5>have those pins and needle feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I'm like,</v>

1884
01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:33.834
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>

1885
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:36.920
<v Speaker 2>You should make the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably do have kind of cool.</v>

1886
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's weird like people worry about</v>

1887
01:20:39.771 --> 01:20:41.800
<v Speaker 2>like the discipline of doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1888
01:20:41.801 --> 01:20:42.220
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1889
01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.540
<v Speaker 2>it gets them concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't have time for that.</v>

1890
01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:48.230
<v Speaker 2>And they pushed it off because this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1891
01:20:48.231 --> 01:20:51.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a weird way that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>are programmed that we,</v>

1892
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:54.710
<v Speaker 2>we avoid certain types of strenuous</v>
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

1893
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Avoid getting up early when you know you</v>
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

1894
01:20:56.601 --> 01:21:01.340
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things that we do where</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go towards comfort and a way from</v>

1895
01:21:01.341 --> 01:21:04.160
<v Speaker 2>these uncomfortable feelings and some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those uncomfortable feelings are just</v>

1896
01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.140
<v Speaker 2>sitting alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditating,</v>

1897
01:21:06.141 --> 01:21:08.810
<v Speaker 2>just sitting alone and concentrating on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your breath for 20 minutes a day.</v>

1898
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1899
01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Big benefits to that.</v>

1900
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:13.340
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you get down on yourself and</v>

1901
01:21:13.341 --> 01:21:15.760
<v Speaker 5>then that stress and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa shit.</v>

1902
01:21:15.761 --> 01:21:17.110
<v Speaker 5>And then you're in your room all day and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1903
01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:19.330
<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you go on the Internet and then</v>

1904
01:21:19.331 --> 01:21:21.880
<v Speaker 5>you're saying your room for another week</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you read some bad comments.</v>

1905
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:25.630
<v Speaker 5>He's just masturbate real comments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the key to life.</v>

1906
01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:27.670
<v Speaker 5>Not really give a shit about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>comments.</v>

1907
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't read them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1908
01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I very rarely will like glance through</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look really quickly,</v>

1909
01:21:32.551 --> 01:21:33.630
<v Speaker 2>but if I do it once a day,</v>

1910
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.310
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well sometimes I want to get pissed off</v>

1911
01:21:36.311 --> 01:21:38.830
<v Speaker 5>and then sometimes we just make fun of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it cause it's so hot.</v>

1912
01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.340
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've had like a men's rights activists</v>

1913
01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:44.830
<v Speaker 5>write articles about us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like calling has come dumpsters.</v>

1914
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:46.150
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I didn't know that.</v>

1915
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:51.100
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know the phrase cum dumpster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How'd you make it to this part of life?</v>

1916
01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:54.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you feel least barfed</v>

1917
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:58.450
<v Speaker 5>first sentence in our book is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you a degenerate cum dumpster?</v>

1918
01:21:58.451 --> 01:22:00.790
<v Speaker 5>Unworthy of love and affection,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a zealot.</v>

1919
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:05.800
<v Speaker 5>Somebody called you unworthy of love and</v>
<v Speaker 5>affection that we said that we had sand</v>

1920
01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:06.850
<v Speaker 5>in his cum dumpster.</v>

1921
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1922
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:10.710
<v Speaker 2>If he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would've made it even better</v>

1923
01:22:10.711 --> 01:22:13.070
<v Speaker 2>because then you would know like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken a person.</v>

1924
01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:15.610
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had an inkling.</v>

1925
01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:19.520
<v Speaker 5>That whole article.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1926
01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.770
<v Speaker 5>it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's how I like,</v>

1927
01:22:20.771 --> 01:22:23.800
<v Speaker 5>to me that's the best feeling of like</v>
<v Speaker 5>hate taking control of the situation by</v>

1928
01:22:23.801 --> 01:22:27.820
<v Speaker 5>reading it and then roasting them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human intelligence is far greater than a</v>

1929
01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.460
<v Speaker 5>insulting</v>

1930
01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:29.130
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did.</v>

01:22:55.071 --> 01:22:57.580
<v Speaker 5>We fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's why to say it that way.</v>

1945
01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.640
<v Speaker 5>Fun Park yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But our,</v>

1946
01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:02.570
<v Speaker 5>her we're far definition of feminism is</v>
<v Speaker 5>women can be pieces of shit too.</v>

1947
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:03.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

1948
01:23:03.471 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 5>And I think that for men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a good</v>

1949
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.130
<v Speaker 2>thing to be able to listen to women talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfiltered.</v>

1950
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think and guys avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go to war here with these bitches</v>

1951
01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:14.380
<v Speaker 2>have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should listen.</v>

1952
01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.310
<v Speaker 2>You should listen in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1953
01:23:16.311 --> 01:23:18.490
<v Speaker 2>not saying that you should listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to agree with them,</v>

1954
01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:23.670
<v Speaker 2>but you will gain a more of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of how someone who is very</v>

1955
01:23:23.711 --> 01:23:27.340
<v Speaker 2>different than you views maybe the exact</v>
<v Speaker 2>same interaction and just that,</v>

1956
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:32.500
<v Speaker 2>just that one look at another</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective might make you sit back and</v>

1957
01:23:32.501 --> 01:23:33.334
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1958
01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:34.930
<v Speaker 2>maybe I need to look at it from their</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1959
01:23:34.931 --> 01:23:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1960
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my favorite email is when a guy</v>

1961
01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:39.370
<v Speaker 3>emails on and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta be honest.</v>

1962
01:23:39.371 --> 01:23:41.680
<v Speaker 3>I listen to your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was expecting to like jerk off and</v>

1963
01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:43.470
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I actually learned something.</v>

1964
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:44.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh bless you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Jerk off and shit.</v>

1966
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Sorry to disappoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know that I love that we like</v>

1967
01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:51.700
<v Speaker 3>that's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

1968
01:23:51.701 --> 01:23:54.110
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you surprise somebody I think is,</v>

1969
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:57.130
<v Speaker 3>and the name of the podcast is people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to either go,</v>

1970
01:23:57.131 --> 01:23:59.500
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious or that's discussing or</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1971
01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.990
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the reaction is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to check it out.</v>

1972
01:24:01.991 --> 01:24:05.470
<v Speaker 3>They're going to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're surprised by what they hear</v>

1973
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.390
<v Speaker 3>because it's not what they expected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sticks.</v>

1974
01:24:07.391 --> 01:24:08.080
<v Speaker 3>It's stronger.</v>

1975
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys feel like the podcast has</v>
<v Speaker 2>helped you understand yourselves and</v>

1976
01:24:12.761 --> 01:24:13.594
<v Speaker 2>grow better?</v>

1977
01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1978
01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:17.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had no choice but to grow.</v>

1979
01:24:17.991 --> 01:24:19.760
<v Speaker 3>When you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're sitting down with people who</v>

1980
01:24:19.761 --> 01:24:22.200
<v Speaker 3>you've had these intimate relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1981
01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:26.210
<v Speaker 3>both emotional and sexual with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like holding a mirror up to</v>

1982
01:24:26.211 --> 01:24:27.470
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the concept.</v>

1983
01:24:27.471 --> 01:24:31.130
<v Speaker 3>The concept was kind of to do this</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast much like John cusack and high</v>

1984
01:24:31.131 --> 01:24:35.800
<v Speaker 3>fidelity and just learn about yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>through these people kind of slide you</v>

1985
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.370
<v Speaker 3>human yelp reviews.</v>

1986
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.951
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>

1987
01:24:37.951 --> 01:24:41.070
<v Speaker 2>You also learn about yourself from</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations where you're not looking</v>

1988
01:24:41.071 --> 01:24:43.080
<v Speaker 2>at your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not checking the internet,</v>

1989
01:24:43.081 --> 01:24:45.750
<v Speaker 2>you're not watching television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there for hours</v>

1990
01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:48.300
<v Speaker 2>communicating with each other and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lost art.</v>

1991
01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:51.050
<v Speaker 3>It is an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We forget that the microphones are on.</v>

1992
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:52.520
<v Speaker 3>We forget that we're talking all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1993
01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's changed for me</v>

1994
01:24:54.081 --> 01:24:56.230
<v Speaker 3>is I settle the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1995
01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.500
<v Speaker 3>and that was the first time I ever said</v>
<v Speaker 3>out loud.</v>

1996
01:24:57.501 --> 01:24:59.120
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want to see my boyfriend.</v>

2048
01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.710
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Googling a product.</v>

2049
01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Somebody probably googled it for me and</v>

2051
01:27:08.061 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 4>then made me look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

2052
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:14.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't even orgasm</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2057

<v Speaker 4>You can get obsessed with it.</v>

2058
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 4>People get obsessed with all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and the porn gives you a</v>

2059
01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:31.820
<v Speaker 4>stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2060
01:27:31.821 --> 01:27:34.640
<v Speaker 4>And that stimulation is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're watching two people sexually</v>

2061
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:37.430
<v Speaker 4>interact with each other and you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend you're there.</v>

2062
01:27:37.431 --> 01:27:41.540
<v Speaker 4>You can pretend you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever weird stimulation it is that</v>

2063
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:46.400
<v Speaker 4>that like weird thing that you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People will numb themselves with that if</v>

2064
01:27:46.401 --> 01:27:49.170
<v Speaker 4>they have too much stress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's too much going on their life</v>

2065
01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:51.110
<v Speaker 4>and the it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it becomes almost like a drug.</v>

2066
01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then after you're done jerking off</v>

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.560
<v Speaker 4>and you call me,</v>

<v Speaker 3>using,</v>

2079
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:24.030

2083
01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh like a real hot chick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm like,</v>

2084
01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:34.570
<v Speaker 3>I always think so high other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and normally not my boys,</v>

2085
01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.251
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2086
01:28:35.251 --> 01:28:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I'd never allow my brain to like let's</v>
<v Speaker 3>masturbate to like a that neighbor guy</v>

2087
01:28:39.181 --> 01:28:41.360
<v Speaker 3>that we had or airbnb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn.</v>

2088
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.810
<v Speaker 3>And I did masturbate to him and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fun because cause I'm like,</v>

2089
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:48.250
<v Speaker 3>oh what are you playing a new game?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we got a new kid.</v>

2090
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:49.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like candy crush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2091
01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:52.950
<v Speaker 3>But it's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can go there in your head</v>

2092
01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:55.500
<v Speaker 3>and he doesn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's cool.</v>

2093
01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.900
<v Speaker 3>You didn't hurt him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't hurt your boyfriend and yeah,</v>

2094
01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hurt anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

2095
01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:00.950
<v Speaker 4>doesn't seem the same as if you found</v>
<v Speaker 4>out that a,</v>

2096
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 4>that you know is</v>

2097
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.020
<v Speaker 1>jerking off to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to find out.</v>

2098
01:29:04.021 --> 01:29:05.400
<v Speaker 1>But if you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

2099
01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:09.000
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't dm you and tell you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many men do.</v>

2100
01:29:09.001 --> 01:29:11.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like you keep that to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind if people jerk off to me,</v>

2101
01:29:11.941 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 1>but I should never know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we agree there's a difference</v>

2102
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:17.960
<v Speaker 1>between a girl saying that she plays</v>
<v Speaker 1>with herself to you versus a godsend</v>

2103
01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:22.230
<v Speaker 1>that he plays with them or a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl saying it to a guy is different</v>

2104
01:29:22.231 --> 01:29:26.040
<v Speaker 1>than a guy saying it to a girl came up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me is like I jerked off to once.</v>

2105
01:29:26.041 --> 01:29:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2106
01:29:27.991 --> 01:29:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get excited.</v>

2107
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:33.210
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how much schlage has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were attracted to him probably.</v>

2108
01:29:33.211 --> 01:29:33.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

2109
01:29:33.921 --> 01:29:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's this thing that we liked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend that's not true.</v>

2110
01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2111
01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 1>If he was like this hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexy guy and he told me that,</v>

2112
01:29:39.991 --> 01:29:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well like that article that I was</v>

2113
01:29:41.831 --> 01:29:43.680
<v Speaker 1>pulling the sit on Joe's toilet for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

2114
01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.760
<v Speaker 1>an article that I pulled up before we</v>
<v Speaker 1>started the podcast.</v>

2115
01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Well there was a that a women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and gay men are more attracted</v>

2116
01:29:53.941 --> 01:29:58.530
<v Speaker 1>to good looking muscular men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shows that we're not making any</v>

2117
01:29:58.531 --> 01:30:01.300
<v Speaker 1>progress with sexual gender stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no,</v>

2118
01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:04.620
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was like Newsweek or it's the</v>

2119
01:30:04.621 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This space go to the safest space,</v>

2120
01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.350
<v Speaker 1>which is my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite twitter pages because</v>

2121
01:30:10.351 --> 01:30:15.351
<v Speaker 1>they will retreat the most ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior men with muscles</v>

2122
01:30:15.991 --> 01:30:19.050
<v Speaker 1>and money are more attractive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight women and gay men showing</v>

2123
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.530
<v Speaker 1>gender roles aren't progressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in tech and science.</v>

2124
01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:23.940
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not tax,</v>

2125
01:30:23.941 --> 01:30:27.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's not science that has god to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have nonsense by a male.</v>

2126
01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Sydney are female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to know,</v>

2127
01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it matters not showing gender roles</v>

2128
01:30:37.621 --> 01:30:39.940
<v Speaker 1>aren't progressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2129
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Neither does hot stays hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

2130
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:45.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you use a lighter and you</v>

2131
01:30:45.661 --> 01:30:47.220
<v Speaker 1>burn your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stays hot.</v>

2132
01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:51.780
<v Speaker 1>We're not progressing in our ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>defuse fire with your fucking skin.</v>

2133
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:56.340
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it because that means you're</v>

2134
01:30:56.341 --> 01:30:57.930
<v Speaker 1>driven and you don't sit on your ass all</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2135
01:30:57.931 --> 01:31:00.060
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to fuck a lazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2136
01:31:00.061 --> 01:31:01.220
<v Speaker 1>if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your own thing.</v>

2137
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:03.470
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also muscles.</v>

2138
01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:05.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't like monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say,</v>

2139
01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:07.710
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't surveyed for that,</v>

2140
01:31:10.890 --> 01:31:14.820
<v Speaker 1>but I'm more attracted to somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly like comedian,</v>

2141
01:31:14.821 --> 01:31:16.470
<v Speaker 1>like funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're funny.</v>

2142
01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.860
<v Speaker 1>That is so much hotter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be overweight,</v>

2143
01:31:18.861 --> 01:31:20.190
<v Speaker 1>you can be under what you could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2144
01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:21.750
<v Speaker 1>When you're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2145
01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:25.290
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the thing about what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive is that everybody's got their</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think I like a guy that's bigger than</v>

<v Speaker 1>me though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like physically bigger than me cause I</v>

<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take that back.</v>

2177
01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:06.010
<v Speaker 1>He's got some muscles and he did a song</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Kesha.</v>

2178
01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:09.590
<v Speaker 1>That's an old man too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's impressive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Young</v>

2182
01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.680
<v Speaker 1>man gets so much harder as they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>

2183
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:23.770
<v Speaker 1>There's some women though that just are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we went to this summit that was like</v>

2184
01:33:23.771 --> 01:33:25.690
<v Speaker 1>a lot of females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just female speakers,</v>

2185
01:33:25.691 --> 01:33:29.170
<v Speaker 1>but women of the year summit chick's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing rad shit.</v>

2186
01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this woman Sheila Nevins who's the</v>

2187
01:33:31.811 --> 01:33:34.990
<v Speaker 1>head of documentaries at Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of her.</v>

2188
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:40.060
<v Speaker 1>She is the sexiest woman I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hurt her style and her confidence is</v>

2189
01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:40.960
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's very graceful.</v>

2190
01:33:40.961 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 1>But then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you're a woman doesn't mean</v>

2191
01:33:43.001 --> 01:33:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you're good at shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like she just is very,</v>

2192
01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:47.170
<v Speaker 1>she has this realisticness to her that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2193
01:33:47.171 --> 01:33:50.410
<v Speaker 1>you are so sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck madness.</v>

2194
01:33:50.411 --> 01:33:53.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the only a woman over 50 can have</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful</v>

2195
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:58.200
<v Speaker 1>in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I think sometimes young women use</v>

2196
01:33:58.230 --> 01:34:01.490
<v Speaker 1>like I don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you give so much like Fox and</v>

2197
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:02.320
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2198
01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.910
<v Speaker 1>when you truly don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to announce the person</v>

2199
01:34:06.911 --> 01:34:10.000
<v Speaker 1>posted the most pictures of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship isn't the one in the worst</v>

2200
01:34:10.001 --> 01:34:12.190
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you've got to say it,</v>

2201
01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:15.640
<v Speaker 1>it's sorta like really depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strippers always have instagram pages</v>

2202
01:34:15.641 --> 01:34:17.560
<v Speaker 1>that have a lot of like inspirational</v>
<v Speaker 1>quotes.</v>

2203
01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:19.511
<v Speaker 1>Memes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2204
01:34:19.511 --> 01:34:21.480
<v Speaker 1>a lot of memes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Memes.</v>

2205
01:34:21.481 --> 01:34:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get so depressed at strip clubs I</v>

2206
01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.910
<v Speaker 1>really can't handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Love Strip clubs.</v>

2207
01:34:28.150 --> 01:34:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I love a hot chick dancing on me with</v>
<v Speaker 1>her titties and my face.</v>

2208
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I just want to cry every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have nothing in common except our</v>

2209
01:34:38.471 --> 01:34:40.360
<v Speaker 1>sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

2210
01:34:40.361 --> 01:34:42.270
<v Speaker 1>We like laughing at dark shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2211
01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:45.970
<v Speaker 1>like laughing at something that's real</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up is the best feeling ever.</v>

2212
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.530
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the same relationship I had with</v>

2213
01:34:47.531 --> 01:34:50.170
<v Speaker 1>my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're polar opposites except we share a</v>

2214
01:34:50.171 --> 01:34:52.420
<v Speaker 1>sense of humor and I love that he's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my favorite people in the whole</v>

2215
01:34:52.421 --> 01:34:54.940
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't have to be the same.</v>

2216
01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not that all the same and it's</v>

2217
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.220
<v Speaker 4>nice to see like I think a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>like seeing two women that like just a</v>

2218
01:35:01.221 --> 01:35:02.880
<v Speaker 4>disagree on a lot of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

2219
01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:05.240
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean I don't like her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2220
01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:09.710
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem too is that people get</v>
<v Speaker 4>so married to ideas that you don't like.</v>

2221
01:35:09.711 --> 01:35:11.660
<v Speaker 4>People who don't think the same way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do,</v>

2222
01:35:11.661 --> 01:35:13.340
<v Speaker 4>which just seems to me to be kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

2223
01:35:13.341 --> 01:35:16.990
<v Speaker 4>That is a dumb thing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really ramping,</v>

2224
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Identity politics and this idea that</v>

2225
01:35:19.251 --> 01:35:21.020
<v Speaker 4>like you have to be on one team or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

2226
01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 4>You've fucking just dig your heels in</v>
<v Speaker 4>and fight the other side with tooth claw</v>

2227
01:35:25.041 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 4>and nail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did we see that strongly in?</v>

2228
01:35:27.501 --> 01:35:28.311
<v Speaker 4>Politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2229
01:35:28.311 --> 01:35:31.880
<v Speaker 4>And it's a gigantic issue in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Politics is fucking,</v>

2230
01:35:31.881 --> 01:35:33.260
<v Speaker 4>it's exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't,</v>

2231
01:35:33.261 --> 01:35:35.900
<v Speaker 4>people can't live in the opposites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can be both things.</v>

2232
01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:39.530
<v Speaker 4>You can be a great comedian and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could also sexually assault people.</v>

2233
01:35:39.531 --> 01:35:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Like he can be kind of Shitty in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you still look good.</v>

2234
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:44.270
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you think that the Colussy k thing</v>

2235
01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 4>was extra disturbing because he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it to one of us.</v>

2236
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't just doing it.</v>

2237
01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.540
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey girls,</v>

2238
01:35:51.541 --> 01:35:53.030
<v Speaker 4>stay still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I jerk off in front of you,</v>

2239
01:35:53.031 --> 01:35:55.280
<v Speaker 4>which is gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's also doing it to,</v>

2240
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:57.050
<v Speaker 4>it should be appear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2241
01:35:57.051 --> 01:35:59.600
<v Speaker 4>And that's why it's one of the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me it's a power dynamic.</v>

2242
01:35:59.601 --> 01:36:01.340
<v Speaker 4>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could have had a sex work,</v>

2243
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:04.430
<v Speaker 4>you could've jumped off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sex worker would have been thrilled to</v>

2244
01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:06.890
<v Speaker 4>take your money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you could do a scenario where you're</v>

2245
01:36:06.891 --> 01:36:09.170
<v Speaker 4>blocked the door and you jerk off and</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>

2246
01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.300
<v Speaker 4>but that's a conceptual thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2247
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:14.600
<v Speaker 4>That's why that indicates that meets the</v>
<v Speaker 4>power struggle because that consensual</v>

2248
01:36:14.601 --> 01:36:16.650
<v Speaker 4>thing doesn't give you the buzz that</v>
<v Speaker 4>causes the,</v>

2249
01:36:16.651 --> 01:36:20.480
<v Speaker 4>for Beth thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that also says to me though that Louis</v>

2250
01:36:20.481 --> 01:36:23.720
<v Speaker 4>is so intelligent that he did think it</v>
<v Speaker 4>through a little bit more than he's</v>

2251
01:36:23.721 --> 01:36:25.640
<v Speaker 4>letting on because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2252
01:36:25.641 --> 01:36:29.390
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have to keep this</v>
<v Speaker 4>secret because we're all in this club</v>

2253
01:36:29.391 --> 01:36:30.150
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

2254
01:36:30.150 --> 01:36:33.800
<v Speaker 4>So if you do it to a young comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that.</v>

2255
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 4>There's certain thing about standups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody will agree we're</v>

2256
01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:42.200
<v Speaker 4>impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Standups are impulsive people.</v>

2257
01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:44.320
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the reasons why you'll say</v>
<v Speaker 4>the funny thing before everybody,</v>

2258
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:47.120
<v Speaker 4>some people might even not even</v>
<v Speaker 4>entertained the thought.</v>

2259
01:36:47.121 --> 01:36:49.730
<v Speaker 4>You opened the door and then blurt it</v>
<v Speaker 4>out quicker than everybody else.</v>

2260
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:54.290
<v Speaker 4>There's an impersonal aspect to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you think that could be an impulse?</v>

2261
01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.390
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that he's an impulsive guy.</v>

2262
01:36:56.450 --> 01:37:00.500
<v Speaker 4>I think most comics are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a wild thrill to that</v>

2263
01:37:00.501 --> 01:37:03.740
<v Speaker 4>impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is you're also doing it to a</v>

2264
01:37:03.741 --> 01:37:06.770
<v Speaker 4>person that doesn't want you to do it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2265
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:09.530
<v Speaker 4>And even if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no physical contact.</v>

2266
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:13.910
<v Speaker 4>You're making them watch you beat off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fucked up.</v>

2267
01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:14.810
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2268
01:37:14.811 --> 01:37:18.980
<v Speaker 4>the whole tig notaro thing with tig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Notaro thinks that he started helping</v>

2269
01:37:18.981 --> 01:37:23.060
<v Speaker 4>her to show that he was a nice guy cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like a lesbian and a feminist and</v>

2270
01:37:23.061 --> 01:37:24.170
<v Speaker 4>like he's going to promote her thing.</v>

2271
01:37:24.170 --> 01:37:26.180
<v Speaker 4>And this is like take some of the weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>off of him.</v>

2272
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:30.620
<v Speaker 4>She said that she felt burdened by her</v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with him because she</v>

2273
01:37:30.621 --> 01:37:33.830
<v Speaker 4>believes that he did it on purpose and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he made a conscious decision.</v>

2274
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:35.570
<v Speaker 4>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2275
01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:37.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good,</v>

2276
01:37:37.521 --> 01:37:39.320
<v Speaker 4>it's a good branding move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good,</v>

2277
01:37:39.321 --> 01:37:41.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's try and save the reputation,</v>

2278
01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:44.000
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2279
01:37:44.001 --> 01:37:45.230
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with that though,</v>

2280
01:37:45.231 --> 01:37:47.690
<v Speaker 4>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he hosted snl in the monologues</v>

2281
01:37:47.691 --> 01:37:51.050
<v Speaker 4>about pedophilia and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he related it to like eating a snickers</v>

2282
01:37:51.051 --> 01:37:54.020
<v Speaker 4>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to touch that little kid so bad</v>

2283
01:37:54.021 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 4>and you know how horrible and</v>

2284
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.740
<v Speaker 3>how many lives it ruins and how fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up it makes you,</v>

2285
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:01.680
<v Speaker 3>you know the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still do it.</v>

2286
01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what I think that with what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did,</v>

2287
01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm like you really wanting to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>real bad.</v>

2288
01:38:06.341 --> 01:38:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Cause comics all knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we knew about it current and I knew</v>

2289
01:38:08.521 --> 01:38:10.030
<v Speaker 3>about it five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2290
01:38:10.031 --> 01:38:10.650
<v Speaker 3>I had heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2291
01:38:10.650 --> 01:38:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had heard from someone who knows</v>

2292
01:38:13.651 --> 01:38:15.970
<v Speaker 2>him better than me and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what do you mean?</v>

2293
01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.130
<v Speaker 2>And they gave me like this weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenario where he was joking around,</v>

2294
01:38:20.131 --> 01:38:24.500
<v Speaker 2>they were all joking around together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the story got out and you know,</v>

2295
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:28.420
<v Speaker 2>like he like pulled his dick out like as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a joke and everyone was laughing and it</v>

2296
01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:32.100
<v Speaker 2>was like he was being silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the real story came out.</v>

2297
01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:33.000
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2298
01:38:34.330 --> 01:38:36.780
<v Speaker 3>we've had people like the Ari Shaffir</v>
<v Speaker 3>was our podcast.</v>

2299
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:37.301
<v Speaker 3>He pulled his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2300
01:38:37.301 --> 01:38:38.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did ask,</v>

2301
01:38:38.261 --> 01:38:40.780
<v Speaker 3>but like that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to see his dick.</v>

2302
01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:44.710
<v Speaker 3>I want to see had a vasectomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we wanted to see the scars.</v>

2303
01:38:44.711 --> 01:38:46.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a reason and then also that we</v>

2304
01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:47.870
<v Speaker 3>had never seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2305
01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:52.510
<v Speaker 3>someone who was not circumcised before</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he was like,</v>

2306
01:38:52.511 --> 01:38:54.010
<v Speaker 3>do you want to see it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And where they'd said yes.</v>

2307
01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Does that think about that cutting baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick's is so common that you guys have</v>

2308
01:38:58.531 --> 01:39:01.360

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2348
01:40:25.690 --> 01:40:30.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a baby that was raised and</v>
<v Speaker 2>raised as a woman because they did a</v>

2349
01:40:31.031 --> 01:40:34.600
<v Speaker 2>botched circumcision on the kid when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a baby and the his penis</v>

2350
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:36.760
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a massive infection.</v>

2351
01:40:36.761 --> 01:40:39.880
<v Speaker 2>They had to remove his penis.</v>

01:40:39.930 --> 01:40:41.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2353
01:40:41.681 --> 01:40:45.940
<v Speaker 2>transition this person into a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they transitioned this person to</v>

2354
01:40:45.941 --> 01:40:49.270
<v Speaker 2>a woman and they gave him hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he always wanted to be a man and it</v>

2355
01:40:49.271 --> 01:40:52.300
<v Speaker 2>was like super confusing to him that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually wound up committing suicide</v>

01:40:52.301 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 2>when he was,</v>

<v Speaker 4>create a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take it from a cadaver.</v>

2399
01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.730
<v Speaker 4>circumcision and then when it's not</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it happens when you're a cadaver.</v>

2402
01:42:41.061 --> 01:42:44.120
<v Speaker 4>Who gets your dick taken off to put on</v>
<v Speaker 4>another person?</v>

<v Speaker 3>driver's license to donate your organs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's all right</v>

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2412
01:43:00.450 --> 01:43:04.350
<v Speaker 4>it's probably really hard to get it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>work right?</v>

2413
01:43:04.351 --> 01:43:05.071
<v Speaker 4>To get all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

01:43:05.071 --> 01:43:07.500
<v Speaker 4>it's theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a such a complicated organ.</v>

2415
01:43:07.501 --> 01:43:10.740
<v Speaker 4>There's so much going on in there as far</v>
<v Speaker 4>as all these different connections and</v>

2416
01:43:10.741 --> 01:43:15.150
<v Speaker 4>apparently the operation takes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a long crazy operation.</v>

2417
01:43:15.250 --> 01:43:18.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kicking balls are so mystical to me.</v>

01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever stare at your balls and they</v>

2420
01:43:20.921 --> 01:43:22.630
<v Speaker 3>just think it's like there's an alien in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2421
01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:25.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like they just move like an octopus</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

2422
01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I definitely weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>

2423
01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:29.590
<v Speaker 3>The movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first time I gave a hand job though</v>

2424
01:43:29.591 --> 01:43:31.240
<v Speaker 3>did surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The balls.</v>

2425
01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:33.940
<v Speaker 3>I know the shaft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize it was going to like</v>

<v Speaker 3>move with me.</v>

2428
01:43:38.711 --> 01:43:41.440
<v Speaker 3>but definitely thought at weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The skin moves with you.</v>

2429
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:42.221
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where it's like,</v>

2430
01:43:42.221 --> 01:43:46.150
<v Speaker 3>so I thought I was actually just to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sliding on my hand up and down.</v>

2431
01:43:46.151 --> 01:43:48.880

<v Speaker 3>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you suck a dick you're supposed to</v>

01:45:54.501 --> 01:45:58.220
<v Speaker 3>her flashlight while Hurricane Sandy was</v>
<v Speaker 3>flooding my apartment and curtain was</v>

2482
01:45:58.221 --> 01:46:03.221
<v Speaker 3>over comfort or very uncomfortable life</v>
<v Speaker 3>preserver to them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's not telling you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2484
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:10.820
<v Speaker 3>I picked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a bit about this,</v>

2485
01:46:10.821 --> 01:46:13.100
<v Speaker 3>but I picked it up and I thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a flashlight and I thought he'd thrown</v>

2486
01:46:13.101 --> 01:46:14.330
<v Speaker 3>it away and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the bottle one.</v>

2489
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:21.020
<v Speaker 3>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mold it.</v>

2490
01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously not the internal parts,</v>

2491
01:46:24.261 --> 01:46:26.640
<v Speaker 3>but the outside like they literally like</v>
<v Speaker 3>put like,</v>

2492
01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:30.020
<v Speaker 3>like rubber on and went to the place</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they do stuff.</v>

2493
01:46:30.021 --> 01:46:35.021
<v Speaker 3>We went to the Doc Johnson factory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is in Los Angeles and we saw the</v>

2494
01:46:35.451 --> 01:46:40.220
<v Speaker 3>chair that looks like an ob Gyn chair</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the porn stars and there was like</v>

2495
01:46:40.221 --> 01:46:43.910
<v Speaker 3>remnants of like whatever the stuff this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mentee stuff that they're putting in</v>

2496
01:46:43.911 --> 01:46:45.470
<v Speaker 3>their body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is stuff that we're taking</v>

2497
01:46:45.471 --> 01:46:47.200
<v Speaker 3>picture right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disneyland.</v>

2498
01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 3>It's our Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you jerk off with a fleshlight</v>

2499
01:46:49.921 --> 01:46:50.010

<v Speaker 4>look like an actual policy.</v>

2502
01:46:54.631 --> 01:46:56.790
<v Speaker 4>But if that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I thought.</v>

2503
01:46:57.150 --> 01:47:00.420
<v Speaker 4>They also made it look like an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made an Avatar one at one point in</v>

2504
01:47:00.421 --> 01:47:01.590
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's just the part you need.</v>

2511
01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:19.170
<v Speaker 4>So you unscrewed that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a camp.</v>

2512
01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:22.470
<v Speaker 4>You would have it in the freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2513
01:47:22.471 --> 01:47:24.150
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pussy from your wife.</v>

2514
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.730
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen those little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2515
01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:29.820
<v Speaker 4>we'd be like one of these cavemen Nitros</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you screw the top and you could</v>

2516
01:47:29.821 --> 01:47:34.020
<v Speaker 4>stash money inside</v>
<v Speaker 4>than it used to put my house keys.</v>

2517
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:37.320
<v Speaker 4>It does not look like a rock.</v>

2518
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Classic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rock and [inaudible] leave my key in the</v>

2519
01:47:44.071 --> 01:47:46.590
<v Speaker 4>door and it would be less obvious than</v>
<v Speaker 4>this rock.</v>

2520
01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:49.860
<v Speaker 4>I go one over a friend of mine's house</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he had fake rock speakers in his</v>

2521
01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:55.370
<v Speaker 4>backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fucking do look like rocks here.</v>

2522
01:47:55.371 --> 01:47:57.070
<v Speaker 4>This is not what real rock pressing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one</v>

2523
01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.320
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's those fucking catalogs that they</v>

2524
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:03.380
<v Speaker 4>leave on planes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love those.</v>

2525
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:05.220
<v Speaker 4>Remember those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be going through those.</v>

2526
01:48:08.490 --> 01:48:12.660
<v Speaker 4>I need that six foot big foot statue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My fucking my backyard.</v>

2527
01:48:12.690 --> 01:48:14.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he watches over the garden man.</v>

2528
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make torsos.</v>

2529
01:48:20.131 --> 01:48:22.680
<v Speaker 4>You ever seen one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a chick's torso.</v>

2530
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:27.690
<v Speaker 4>Well it looks like those sex dolls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know those real doll things.</v>

2531
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:32.220
<v Speaker 4>You know they have a brothel in Germany</v>
<v Speaker 4>now where it's like a sex doll brothel</v>

2532
01:48:34.650 --> 01:48:39.570
<v Speaker 4>in your house are</v>
<v Speaker 4>so bizarre.</v>

2533
01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:42.420
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be comfortable with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2534
01:48:42.421 --> 01:48:45.150
<v Speaker 4>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probable Brothel.</v>

2535
01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:46.920
<v Speaker 4>The Johns or getting too weird.</v>

2536
01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:55.420
<v Speaker 4>But that again would come in and pay off</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the same hole.</v>

2537
01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:01.620
<v Speaker 4>Would you ever fuck a sex doll for their</v>
<v Speaker 4>story?</v>

2538
01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:08.100
<v Speaker 4>We could talk about on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not stupid so I wouldn't think it's</v>

2539
01:49:11.281 --> 01:49:15.690
<v Speaker 4>a real person because I think was she</v>
<v Speaker 4>beating off and then like when you're</v>

2540
01:49:15.691 --> 01:49:18.870
<v Speaker 4>going so far that you're fucking this</v>
<v Speaker 4>rubber thing pretending it's a person.</v>

2541
01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:20.870
<v Speaker 4>You're taking it to a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

2542
01:49:21.630 --> 01:49:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not in a fantasy land where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're masturbating or watching porn and</v>

2543
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:28.080
<v Speaker 4>porn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't you thinking our guys,</v>

2544
01:49:28.081 --> 01:49:33.081
<v Speaker 4>when they watch porn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she's sucking my Dick sorta watch</v>

2545
01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.140
<v Speaker 4>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just thinking that the activity is</v>

2546
01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:39.490
<v Speaker 4>exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the activity.</v>

2547
01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.740
<v Speaker 4>Someone sucking a dick as excited and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you would like it if they were</v>

2548
01:49:43.741 --> 01:49:45.270
<v Speaker 4>doing it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not thinking,</v>

2549
01:49:45.271 --> 01:49:46.450
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's doing it to me cause you're not.</v>

2550
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.333
<v Speaker 4>Oh you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

2551
01:49:47.370 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 4>you're not stupid.</v>

2552
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:50.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not their suspension of</v>

2553
01:49:50.621 --> 01:49:52.450
<v Speaker 2>disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you see a movie,</v>

2554
01:49:52.451 --> 01:49:53.500
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're at a theater,</v>

2555
01:49:53.501 --> 01:49:57.130
<v Speaker 2>but if you're like holding onto some</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold rubber and he got her to cold</v>

2556
01:49:57.131 --> 01:50:00.760
<v Speaker 2>rubber feet in the air and you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubber pussy.</v>

2557
01:50:01.110 --> 01:50:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh that was the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Guy told me that I wrote that</v>

2558
01:50:03.491 --> 01:50:05.110
<v Speaker 2>article and I was going back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>

2559
01:50:05.111 --> 01:50:08.050
<v Speaker 2>The guy with a relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said he puts her in the,</v>

2560
01:50:08.051 --> 01:50:10.600
<v Speaker 2>her in the tub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

2561
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:14.680
<v Speaker 2>he fills a tub with hot water to heat up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the temperature of the body.</v>

2562
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2563
01:50:16.241 --> 01:50:18.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2564
01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:21.700
<v Speaker 2>it does seem like real murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>

2565
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:25.270
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go over to his house but not</v>

2566
01:50:25.271 --> 01:50:26.890
<v Speaker 2>hurting any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you guys think?</v>

2567
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Like if there is like this is theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what crispr is</v>

2568
01:50:33.130 --> 01:50:34.190
<v Speaker 2>withdrawing the bottom of me.</v>

2569
01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Your Fridge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Veggies.</v>

2570
01:50:35.831 --> 01:50:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Probably not though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>

2571
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:39.910
<v Speaker 2>It is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also a new thing that they're</v>

2572
01:50:39.911 --> 01:50:41.060
<v Speaker 2>allowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2573
01:50:41.410 --> 01:50:43.960
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to experiment with this</v>

2574
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:47.620
<v Speaker 2>new method of altering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2575
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:49.360
<v Speaker 2>DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're there,</v>

2576
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:54.280
<v Speaker 2>they're figuring out a way to do it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>non-viable human embryos and they're</v>

2577
01:50:54.281 --> 01:50:56.620
<v Speaker 2>starting to do it with humans now that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are alive.</v>

2578
01:50:56.621 --> 01:51:01.621
<v Speaker 2>And one a guy was recently one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first people to be injected with a DNA</v>

2579
01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:06.130
<v Speaker 2>from crispr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as Crispr gets more and more complex</v>

2580
01:51:06.131 --> 01:51:09.070
<v Speaker 2>and more and more effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think in the future,</v>

2581
01:51:09.071 --> 01:51:12.730
<v Speaker 2>you're not only going to be able to pick</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what happens to your children,</v>

2582
01:51:12.731 --> 01:51:14.800
<v Speaker 2>like what your children are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they look like,</v>

2583
01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:17.950
<v Speaker 2>what traits they have and don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally going to have like a</v>

2584
01:51:17.951 --> 01:51:20.170
<v Speaker 2>laundry list of things that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick and choose.</v>

2585
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:22.150
<v Speaker 2>But you might be able to do it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

2586
01:51:22.530 --> 01:51:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Like they might be able to accelerate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2587
01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual capabilities of this</v>

2588
01:51:28.601 --> 01:51:31.690
<v Speaker 2>technology to the point where you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>take you and you'd say,</v>

2589
01:51:31.691 --> 01:51:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a six foot three black</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

2590
01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:36.610
<v Speaker 2>And then they shoot this stuff inside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2591
01:51:36.611 --> 01:51:40.780
<v Speaker 2>And then over the course of like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever long it takes to alter your body,</v>

2592
01:51:40.810 --> 01:51:44.980
<v Speaker 2>this is all speculative cause this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was just the first guy ever to</v>

2593
01:51:45.010 --> 01:51:46.720
<v Speaker 2>this recent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if he could find that,</v>

2594
01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:52.640
<v Speaker 2>makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ton of those people out there.</v>

2595
01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:53.733
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2596
01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:57.340
<v Speaker 2>this technology's not going to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the way you look.</v>

2597
01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 2>It will literally change who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to stretch your legs out.</v>

2598
01:52:00.281 --> 01:52:02.920
<v Speaker 2>It's going to change your features and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's in the way your brain works.</v>

2599
01:52:03.570 --> 01:52:05.560
<v Speaker 2>They think they're going to go knock out</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's.</v>

2600
01:52:05.561 --> 01:52:10.450
<v Speaker 2>They're going mail stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the genes that allow people to</v>

2601
01:52:10.451 --> 01:52:14.140
<v Speaker 2>have Parkinson's and a lot of different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ailments that people have.</v>

2602
01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:16.870
<v Speaker 2>They've isolated those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those genes and they think they can shut</v>

2603
01:52:16.871 --> 01:52:18.280
<v Speaker 2>them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2604
01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:22.780
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to live to be 150 I'd be</v>

2605
01:52:22.781 --> 01:52:24.400
<v Speaker 2>able to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going to get really</v>

2606
01:52:24.401 --> 01:52:26.020
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you might not want to,</v>

2607
01:52:26.021 --> 01:52:28.750
<v Speaker 2>and you might say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe if you're 80 and someone says,</v>

2608
01:52:28.751 --> 01:52:30.820
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be 30 again,</v>

2609
01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:32.200
<v Speaker 2>you might go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2610
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:34.880
<v Speaker 2>he was in good health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't mind it,</v>

2611
01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:38.620
<v Speaker 2>but somebody might be willing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might physically be possible</v>

2612
01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:43.710
<v Speaker 2>for you to not just look 30 but beathard</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally change your cellular</v>

2613
01:52:45.531 --> 01:52:46.364
<v Speaker 2>structure</v>

2614
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.250
<v Speaker 1>to the point where you're a young person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to be the destruction</v>

2615
01:52:49.251 --> 01:52:51.680
<v Speaker 1>of our society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modifying your own jeans is just an</v>

2616
01:52:51.681 --> 01:52:52.550
<v Speaker 1>injection away</v>

2617
01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:55.000
<v Speaker 2>if you're feeling lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause right now it's very experimental.</v>

2618
01:52:55.210 --> 01:52:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a seat,</v>

2619
01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:00.700
<v Speaker 2>but this is just speculative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an article with the very first</v>

2620
01:53:00.701 --> 01:53:02.860
<v Speaker 2>guy had it done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2621
01:53:02.890 --> 01:53:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Very first use of crisper on a living</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

2622
01:53:05.530 --> 01:53:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is like,</v>

2623
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:10.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this body acceptance thing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>

2627
01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:16.810
<v Speaker 2>you're happy until someone comes along</v>
<v Speaker 2>and says,</v>

01:53:23.501 --> 01:53:24.550
<v Speaker 2>you just go to the thor doc.</v>

2633
01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:26.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like Halloween for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Christopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever his name is guy.</v>

2636
01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.570
<v Speaker 1>And could you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you would be able to change</v>

2637
01:53:32.571 --> 01:53:33.890
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like one day I'm thor,</v>

2638
01:53:33.891 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 1>but the other next day I'm Cindy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crawford and might be able to,</v>

2639
01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:38.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably going to take a while for your</v>

2640
01:53:38.151 --> 01:53:40.820
<v Speaker 1>body to shift to whatever form it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to morph.</v>

2641
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:42.680
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if you keep doing it over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over again,</v>

2642
01:53:42.681 --> 01:53:45.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like a vhs tape where you keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>copying it over and over again and just</v>

2643
01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:46.363
<v Speaker 1>scratch.</v>

2644
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:51.680
<v Speaker 1>You might put some errors in your DNA</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grow some extra feet and weird shit.</v>

2645
01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting.</v>

2646
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:54.403
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2647
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:56.690
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be some early adopters</v>

2648
01:53:56.691 --> 01:53:59.360
<v Speaker 1>that are very upset and have buyer's</v>
<v Speaker 1>remorse.</v>

2649
01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:00.880
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2650
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:02.180
<v Speaker 1>And then what do you do when that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>

2651
01:54:02.181 --> 01:54:03.890
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

2652
01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:06.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's like plastic surgery you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>alter,</v>

2653
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't obviously those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's limitations for plastic surgery,</v>

2654
01:54:09.561 --> 01:54:13.100
<v Speaker 1>but that don't seem to be on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically if it goes as far as it's</v>

2655
01:54:13.101 --> 01:54:16.370
<v Speaker 1>like plastic surgery in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one way they used to do it,</v>

2656
01:54:16.371 --> 01:54:18.440
<v Speaker 1>which was awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're way better at it.</v>

2657
01:54:18.441 --> 01:54:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can't tell.</v>

2658
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like boob jobs.</v>

2659
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My boob jobs now they make boobs that</v>

2660
01:54:23.091 --> 01:54:24.780
<v Speaker 1>are soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smushy and you could,</v>

2661
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:26.480
<v Speaker 1>when people's don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met a couple of girls that are</v>

2662
01:54:26.481 --> 01:54:26.751
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>can I touch them?</v>

2665
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:32.960
<v Speaker 1>And then when you touch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like a boob.</v>

2666
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They do not accept fake boy parts.</v>

2675
01:54:57.681 --> 01:54:59.220
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

2682
01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's cause he had it and had a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues and he's getting a lot of weird</v>

2683
01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:15.950
<v Speaker 1>surgery and one of the things he got was</v>

2688
01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:32.400
<v Speaker 1>oil into his muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles larger and bolts and stop.</v>

2689
01:55:32.710 --> 01:55:34.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not healthy,</v>

2697
01:55:46.590 --> 01:55:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Mitch Hedberg before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2698
01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:50.970
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years before he wound up</v>
<v Speaker 2>overdosing.</v>

2699
01:55:51.450 --> 01:55:55.740
<v Speaker 2>We were a stand hope and I were hanging</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and he got the call that Mitch was</v>

2700
01:55:55.741 --> 01:56:00.060
<v Speaker 2>in the hospital for gang green shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin into the same spot over and over</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can't change it.</v>

2708
01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:17.970
<v Speaker 2>The we're getting into is this weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>place in the future.</v>

2709

<v Speaker 2>Do you found that article while you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there?</v>

2710
01:56:19.621 --> 01:56:22.650
<v Speaker 2>Google apps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found I have jumped on that,</v>

2711
01:56:22.651 --> 01:56:27.651
<v Speaker 2>that there was an article from very</v>
<v Speaker 2>resells 16 that said someone in China</v>

<v Speaker 2>really recent.</v>

2715
01:56:36.601 --> 01:56:39.720
<v Speaker 2>crispr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They injected Crispr DNA.</v>

2716
01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.430
<v Speaker 2>What's in it was in the last week or</v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2725
01:56:58.051 --> 01:57:00.030
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genes altered inside a person for the</v>

2726
01:57:00.031 --> 01:57:01.070
<v Speaker 2>first time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

2727
01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a bold experiment that has never been</v>

2728
01:57:03.811 --> 01:57:07.080
<v Speaker 2>done before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A man had his jeans altered permanently</v>

2729
01:57:07.081 --> 01:57:12.081
<v Speaker 2>and attempt to cure a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is one step and this guy had a</v>

2730
01:57:12.781 --> 01:57:17.010
<v Speaker 2>disease and decided to take this chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do this and to scientists for the</v>

2731
01:57:17.011 --> 01:57:18.720
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to editing the gene inside the</v>

2732
01:57:18.721 --> 01:57:22.950
<v Speaker 2>body in a bold attempt to permanently</v>
<v Speaker 2>change a person's DNA to cure a disease.</v>

2733
01:57:22.951 --> 01:57:27.360
<v Speaker 2>The experiment was done Monday in</v>
<v Speaker 2>California on 44 year old Brian Maddix</v>

2734
01:57:27.570 --> 01:57:29.150
<v Speaker 2>met do I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2735
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:32.340
<v Speaker 2>through an ivy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he received billions of copies of a</v>

2736
01:57:32.341 --> 01:57:37.341
<v Speaker 2>corrective gene and genetic tool to cut</v>
<v Speaker 2>his DNA in a precise spot.</v>

2737
01:57:38.370 --> 01:57:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of humbling to be the first</v>

2738
01:57:40.621 --> 01:57:45.030
<v Speaker 2>test said Medu who has a metabolic</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease called Hunter Syndrome.</v>

2739
01:57:45.330 --> 01:57:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to take the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it will help me and other</v>

2740
01:57:47.881 --> 01:57:51.420
<v Speaker 2>people will good for that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for being the first guy to take that</v>

2741
01:57:51.421 --> 01:57:54.540
<v Speaker 2>chance because that's one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they need is they need someone</v>

2742
01:57:54.541 --> 01:57:55.770
<v Speaker 2>who's willing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2743
01:57:55.771 --> 01:57:57.060
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2744
01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:00.360
<v Speaker 2>as an early adopter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll learn from him and maybe be able</v>

2745
01:58:00.361 --> 01:58:02.910
<v Speaker 2>to improve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is this is happening at an</v>

2746
01:58:02.911 --> 01:58:06.030
<v Speaker 2>incredible pace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crispr was just discovered a few years</v>

2747
01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:09.690
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great radio lab podcast on it.</v>

2748
01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:12.810
<v Speaker 2>It's spelled c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>R.</v>

2749
01:58:12.810 --> 01:58:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>S.</v>

2750
01:58:12.810 --> 01:58:12.811
<v Speaker 2>P.</v>
<v Speaker 2>R,</v>

2751
01:58:12.811 --> 01:58:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it has an e in it.</v>

2752
01:58:14.970 --> 01:58:17.460
<v Speaker 2>But if you look up the radio lab</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

2753
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:19.780
<v Speaker 2>it is fucking phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2754
01:58:19.781 --> 01:58:23.910
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy when they explain how they</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered this and what the</v>

2755
01:58:23.911 --> 01:58:26.610
<v Speaker 2>implications are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell my mom about that.</v>

2756
01:58:26.611 --> 01:58:30.090
<v Speaker 2>She's got so many health thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And neurological and every doctor was</v>

2757
01:58:30.091 --> 01:58:32.790
<v Speaker 2>ever in Canada is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

2758
01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

2759
01:58:33.931 --> 01:58:38.660
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was she around like any sort of like a</v>

2760
01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:39.950
<v Speaker 2>farm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2761
01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:41.240
<v Speaker 2>the only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2762
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

2763
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:43.840
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's pretty sure she had lyme disease</v>

2764
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:45.400
<v Speaker 5>and she didn't know I have lymes</v>
<v Speaker 5>disease,</v>

2765
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>

2766
01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:49.870
<v Speaker 5>I got the bullseye right away and I got</v>
<v Speaker 5>the antibiotics.</v>

2767
01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:53.200
<v Speaker 5>Now they give you two weeks antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only had 10 days at the time.</v>

2768
01:58:53.201 --> 01:58:54.820
<v Speaker 5>So I feel like maybe I need to go back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't,</v>

2769
01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:57.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a very sensitive stomach.</v>

2770
01:58:57.340 --> 01:58:59.170
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's all,</v>

2771
01:58:59.290 --> 01:59:02.230
<v Speaker 5>that's all you have is a motherfucker</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you up.</v>

2772
01:59:02.290 --> 01:59:03.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't get any worse and worse and</v>

2773
01:59:03.911 --> 01:59:04.744
<v Speaker 5>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2774
01:59:05.450 --> 01:59:06.620
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2775
01:59:06.621 --> 01:59:07.231
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Good.</v>

2776
01:59:07.231 --> 01:59:07.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2777
01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:10.660
<v Speaker 2>But I need something like 60% of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ticks and the upper Hudson valley have</v>

2778
01:59:10.661 --> 01:59:11.291
<v Speaker 2>lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2779
01:59:11.291 --> 01:59:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2780
01:59:12.191 --> 01:59:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Something insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's really high levels and it's</v>

2781
01:59:15.701 --> 01:59:18.430
<v Speaker 2>all over the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know for a long time doctors</v>

2782
01:59:18.431 --> 01:59:19.100
<v Speaker 2>didn't even know what the fuck</v>

2783
01:59:19.100 --> 01:59:20.320
<v Speaker 5>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2784
01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:23.500
<v Speaker 5>But that's what I'm pretty sure cause</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's neurological for all her shit</v>

2785
01:59:23.501 --> 01:59:26.350
<v Speaker 5>neurological and she has like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she has an Arachnoid cyst and the base</v>

2786
01:59:26.351 --> 01:59:29.060
<v Speaker 5>of our stem but they don't know if it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was there when she was born in</v>

2787
01:59:29.110 --> 01:59:31.280
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] arachnoid cyst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2788
01:59:31.281 --> 01:59:34.030
<v Speaker 5>It's just like a spider says kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a big ball.</v>

2789
01:59:34.031 --> 01:59:38.320
<v Speaker 5>And then it like wraps around her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the base of her skull and the top of her</v>

2790
01:59:38.321 --> 01:59:39.160
<v Speaker 5>spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2791
01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.980
<v Speaker 5>And they think she just got diagnosed</v>
<v Speaker 5>with dementia and they think that</v>

2792
01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:45.220
<v Speaker 5>possibly draining it would do something</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they don't know.</v>

2793
01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:48.190
<v Speaker 5>But then she just got half of her</v>
<v Speaker 5>intestines taken out.</v>

2794
01:59:48.490 --> 01:59:50.920
<v Speaker 5>She has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's the one of the 3% of people who</v>

2795
01:59:50.921 --> 01:59:53.620
<v Speaker 5>gets a bell's palsy and it doesn't go</v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

2796
01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:56.220
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she's trouble get bell's palsy is</v>

2797
01:59:56.221 --> 01:59:57.800
<v Speaker 5>from lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh re.</v>

2798
01:59:57.840 --> 01:59:59.740
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember reading that because I didn't</v>

2799
01:59:59.741 --> 02:00:03.280
<v Speaker 5>know you could get bell's palsy and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>it goes back to normal and it's more</v>

2800
02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:06.100
<v Speaker 5>common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like 97% chance your face is going</v>

2801
02:00:06.101 --> 02:00:08.470
<v Speaker 5>to go back to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That the atrophy that happened.</v>

2802
02:00:08.770 --> 02:00:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2803
02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:10.750
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his son got it.</v>

2804
02:00:10.751 --> 02:00:12.070
<v Speaker 2>He was really young and they brought</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

2805
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:15.880
<v Speaker 2>the son got lyme disease and he brought</v>
<v Speaker 2>the son to the doctor and doctor didn't</v>

2806
02:00:15.881 --> 02:00:19.330
<v Speaker 2>think it was lyme disease and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally the kid had bell's palsy and</v>

2807
02:00:19.331 --> 02:00:21.970
<v Speaker 2>that's when they realized and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>started giving them like the series</v>

2808
02:00:21.971 --> 02:00:24.250
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics and [inaudible] son was very</v>
<v Speaker 2>young too.</v>

2809
02:00:24.251 --> 02:00:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I think he was only four at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2810
02:00:26.231 --> 02:00:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Intense.</v>

2811
02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:28.880
<v Speaker 5>She had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she had a stroke though when she gave</v>

2812
02:00:28.881 --> 02:00:31.750
<v Speaker 5>birth to my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My older brother are first kid and uh,</v>

2813
02:00:31.770 --> 02:00:34.490
<v Speaker 5>that's then after that was when the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bell's palsy happened.</v>

2814
02:00:34.491 --> 02:00:35.590
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2815
02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:37.360
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's the connected to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

2816
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:40.490
<v Speaker 5>she's like a walking health question</v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomenon.</v>

2817
02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:41.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she is.</v>

2818
02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:43.640
<v Speaker 5>She is crispr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2819
02:00:43.641 --> 02:00:45.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm sound like June.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit probably could help</v>

2820
02:00:45.710 --> 02:00:47.030
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows.</v>

2821
02:00:47.031 --> 02:00:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'll see what happens to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy with hunter syndrome boat if this</v>

2822
02:00:50.061 --> 02:00:51.830
<v Speaker 2>really works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is all,</v>

2823
02:00:51.831 --> 02:00:55.190
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this discovery of Crispr is only a</v>

2824
02:00:55.190 --> 02:00:56.180
<v Speaker 2>couple of years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're already starting to use it.</v>

2825
02:00:56.181 --> 02:00:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm living humans.</v>

2826
02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:01.140
<v Speaker 5>She's at the end of her rope to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>point where she would say whatever do</v>

2827
02:01:01.141 --> 02:01:02.640
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care cause I feel like she'd be</v>

2828
02:01:02.641 --> 02:01:04.150
<v Speaker 5>a good candidate for that.</v>

2829
02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:06.370
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about lyme disease too is that</v>

2830
02:01:06.371 --> 02:01:10.690
<v Speaker 2>it has a neurotoxic element to it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it causes like mental disorders.</v>

2831
02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2832
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:14.830
<v Speaker 2>It's also curry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's connected to something called more</v>

2833
02:01:14.831 --> 02:01:16.150
<v Speaker 2>challenge disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2834
02:01:16.151 --> 02:01:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what Joe does is like</v>

2835
02:01:18.010 --> 02:01:20.530
<v Speaker 2>people start thinking they have fibers</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing out of their skin.</v>

2836
02:01:20.531 --> 02:01:22.470
<v Speaker 2>They started scratching themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2837
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:24.490
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hallucinate.</v>

2838
02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I did a TV show about it and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I found that was fascinating</v>

2839
02:01:27.581 --> 02:01:32.581
<v Speaker 2>was there was one doctor who was like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate doctor who had more</v>

2840
02:01:32.741 --> 02:01:35.650
<v Speaker 2>gentleman's disease and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining the hallucinations that he</v>

2841
02:01:35.651 --> 02:01:37.710
<v Speaker 2>would have while he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2842
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:39.560
<v Speaker 2>because he had lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

2843
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:44.830
<v Speaker 2>And he was thinking that when you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit by a bug and that bug has like lyme</v>

2844
02:01:45.141 --> 02:01:49.250
<v Speaker 2>disease and tick diseases are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they vary and they vary in intensity and</v>

2845
02:01:49.251 --> 02:01:52.780
<v Speaker 2>they also vary in how many different</v>
<v Speaker 2>different pathogens that tick and</v>

2846
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:53.623
<v Speaker 2>contain.</v>

2847
02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And so the way he was describing it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2848
02:01:55.701 --> 02:01:58.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're talking about one</v>
<v Speaker 2>symptom,</v>

2849
02:01:58.551 --> 02:02:00.470
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that happens to you when you</v>

2850
02:02:00.471 --> 02:02:04.250
<v Speaker 2>have a host of different pathogens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said some of those pathogens he</v>

2851
02:02:04.251 --> 02:02:09.080
<v Speaker 2>believes contain neurotoxic elements</v>
<v Speaker 2>that causes people to hallucinate and</v>

2852
02:02:09.081 --> 02:02:12.170
<v Speaker 2>why those hallucinations is they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that things are growing on their skin.</v>

2853

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing I've been getting lately,</v>

2876
02:03:05.201 --> 02:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>like the past maybe five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anger attacks like fucking rage</v>

2877
02:03:10.150 --> 02:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>that I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to do something to get it out of</v>

2878
02:03:13.091 --> 02:03:15.650
<v Speaker 1>my body because it's watching that girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck your boys deck.</v>

2879
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:17.320

<v Speaker 1>I liked that though.</v>

2880
02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>But that was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come I was jerking off to it?</v>

2881
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2882
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but it would just come out of nowhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

2883
02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>it feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt like,</v>

2884
02:03:26.921 --> 02:03:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the incredible hulk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you wanted to,</v>

2885
02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>it's some medical issue that something</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going on.</v>

2886
02:03:31.061 --> 02:03:31.894
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2887
02:03:31.930 --> 02:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>like there's like a problem I go because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't,</v>

2888
02:03:35.831 --> 02:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't attached to hormonal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't pms.</v>

2889
02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I also have bad pms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's more anxiety.</v>

2890
02:03:40.151 --> 02:03:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get these like anger attacks and</v>

2891
02:03:43.031 --> 02:03:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I would have to scream,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my poor boyfriend.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I will scream into a pillow until I</v>

2894
02:03:49.301 --> 02:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>can't talk anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I polyps on my vocal cords and I feel</v>

<v Speaker 1>I need to get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't punch somebody,</v>

2897
02:03:56.201 --> 02:03:59.970
<v Speaker 1>but I need to break something or I need</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Pi or you need to hurt myself so I can</v>

2898
02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:02.410

<v Speaker 5>Go Punch a battle cry.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:28.850
<v Speaker 5>like that's why like weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>

3025
02:08:28.851 --> 02:08:33.130
<v Speaker 5>I got up to a point where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was squatting 175 pounds and it was,</v>

3026
02:08:33.190 --> 02:08:35.740
<v Speaker 5>ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It felt so good and it felt like I was,</v>

3027
02:08:35.741 --> 02:08:38.120
<v Speaker 5>every cell in my body was working for</v>
<v Speaker 5>something and it,</v>

3028
02:08:38.121 --> 02:08:41.170
<v Speaker 5>and I got energy out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if I hadn't gotten that energy out,</v>

3029
02:08:41.171 --> 02:08:43.670
<v Speaker 5>I would have just had a fucking angered</v>
<v Speaker 5>right</v>

3030
02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:45.610
<v Speaker 2>sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your whole endocrine system to the thing</v>

3031
02:08:45.611 --> 02:08:49.180
<v Speaker 2>about lifting weights and specifically</v>
<v Speaker 2>like squats and dead lifts and these are</v>

3032
02:08:49.190 --> 02:08:54.100
<v Speaker 2>these big giant complex movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it forces your body to get</v>

3033
02:08:54.101 --> 02:08:57.010
<v Speaker 2>stronger in a way that it excites your</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormonal system.</v>

3034
02:08:57.790 --> 02:09:00.880
<v Speaker 2>It makes your bones denser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the most important things</v>

3035
02:09:00.881 --> 02:09:01.714
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3036
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:04.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a great way to combat osteoporosis</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to lift weights.</v>

3037
02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:07.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just like it because it's the one time</v>

3038
02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:09.250
<v Speaker 5>like I like physical activity because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>

3039
02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.200
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to think about the physical</v>

3040
02:09:11.201 --> 02:09:14.740
<v Speaker 5>activity I'm doing so I can't stress</v>
<v Speaker 5>about my career.</v>

3041
02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:19.390
<v Speaker 5>Is that the only time I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 5>about like getting a head.</v>

3042
02:09:19.391 --> 02:09:21.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like the I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the only time I'm in the moment</v>

3043
02:09:21.371 --> 02:09:23.650
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I love talking to trainers because</v>

3044
02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:27.400
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about next is that too in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the moment,</v>

3045
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:30.130
<v Speaker 5>not just tired of her jaws hurting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hurting.</v>

3046
02:09:30.690 --> 02:09:32.080
<v Speaker 5>My boyfriend said to me the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

3047
02:09:32.110 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 5>you never look me in the eye when we</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

3048
02:09:33.731 --> 02:09:34.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3049
02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:37.810
<v Speaker 5>I guess I don't like we have a sex</v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast.</v>

3050
02:09:37.811 --> 02:09:40.780
<v Speaker 5>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean before before we had this sex pot</v>

3051
02:09:40.810 --> 02:09:42.100
<v Speaker 5>cast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was more freeing for me.</v>

3052
02:09:42.101 --> 02:09:47.101
<v Speaker 5>Now I do think of work when I think of</v>
<v Speaker 5>sex because when you have a sex podcast</v>

3053
02:09:47.531 --> 02:09:49.790
<v Speaker 5>that is pay my rent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3054
02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Well the is the ironic thing about</v>
<v Speaker 2>careers is that especially in a creative</v>

3055
02:09:53.831 --> 02:09:55.660
<v Speaker 2>endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think too much about them,</v>

3056
02:09:55.661 --> 02:09:57.400
<v Speaker 2>you paralyze yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3057
02:09:57.401 --> 02:10:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Like you're paralyzed it creativity</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you're thinking about advancement</v>

3058
02:10:00.251 --> 02:10:04.440
<v Speaker 2>and getting ahead and success instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about creative ideas like you</v>

3059
02:10:04.441 --> 02:10:06.640
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could definitely like have too much</v>

3060
02:10:06.641 --> 02:10:09.400
<v Speaker 2>of one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can only think about creative</v>

3061
02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:11.770
<v Speaker 2>and never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never get your career online because you</v>

3062
02:10:11.771 --> 02:10:14.260
<v Speaker 2>just never figured out how to monetize</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3063
02:10:14.261 --> 02:10:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3064
02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:17.640
<v Speaker 5>And don't put pressure on the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when guys we fucked it just came</v>

3065
02:10:17.641 --> 02:10:19.050
<v Speaker 5>out of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just do this.</v>

3066
02:10:19.051 --> 02:10:19.900
<v Speaker 5>We didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I and I,</v>

3067
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:24.270
<v Speaker 5>and I was nervous to do it because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>name was so brash and I knew it was</v>

3068
02:10:24.271 --> 02:10:24.991
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm like,</v>

3069
02:10:24.991 --> 02:10:26.430
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my mom's going to find out.</v>

3070
02:10:26.610 --> 02:10:29.430
<v Speaker 5>And I was worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hid it from her for two years</v>

3071
02:10:29.431 --> 02:10:30.800
<v Speaker 5>successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>

3072
02:10:30.810 --> 02:10:33.320
<v Speaker 5>It started getting too big though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we honestly,</v>

3073
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:34.940
<v Speaker 5>both of us were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's going to,</v>

3074
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:37.070
<v Speaker 5>wasn't a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's gonna listen to me talk about</v>

3075
02:10:37.071 --> 02:10:39.650
<v Speaker 5>my pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So might as well just talk about it and</v>

3076
02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:41.540
<v Speaker 5>not care and see the lesson.</v>

3077
02:10:41.650 --> 02:10:46.120
<v Speaker 2>That's the way podcasts evolve the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first started doing it,</v>

3078
02:10:46.121 --> 02:10:48.430
<v Speaker 2>me and my friend Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just started fucking around with a</v>

3079
02:10:48.431 --> 02:10:52.870
<v Speaker 2>laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up a laptop and we're doing it on</v>

3080
02:10:52.871 --> 02:10:55.300
<v Speaker 2>ustream and we didn't even have it</v>
<v Speaker 2>uploaded to itunes.</v>

3081
02:10:55.410 --> 02:10:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

3202
02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Every time you mentioned a span of</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiking,</v>

3203
02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:41.010
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

3206
02:16:46.050 --> 02:16:48.930
<v Speaker 3>One time we were above you and Canada</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everyone freaked down.</v>

3207
02:16:48.931 --> 02:16:50.790
<v Speaker 3>They emailed us and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

3208
02:16:50.791 --> 02:16:53.340
<v Speaker 3>And I just felt like we are not worthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3209
02:16:53.580 --> 02:16:56.820
<v Speaker 3>But we appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to earn somebody's respect</v>

3210
02:16:56.821 --> 02:16:58.520
<v Speaker 3>that you respect and it's because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3211
02:16:58.620 --> 02:16:59.650
<v Speaker 3>you have something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

3212
02:16:59.780 --> 02:17:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate you guys too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I appreciate the fact that you guys</v>

3213
02:17:02.421 --> 02:17:04.430
<v Speaker 2>are really good at being yourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3214
02:17:04.431 --> 02:17:06.930
<v Speaker 2>And I think that I'm a professional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3215
02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:07.813
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

3216
02:17:08.470 --> 02:17:10.980
<v Speaker 3>buckets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a huge point though because</v>

3217
02:17:11.010 --> 02:17:12.510
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what half of our book is</v>

3218
02:17:12.511 --> 02:17:16.050
<v Speaker 3>about is about that just being me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

3219
02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:17.010
<v Speaker 3>that's all I'm off.</v>

3220
02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it amazing that that in itself is</v>

3221
02:17:19.471 --> 02:17:20.740
<v Speaker 2>incredibly rare?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

3222
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:22.380
<v Speaker 2>it makes me sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

3223
02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:25.380
<v Speaker 2>but shouldn't make you sad because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's going to be less rare</v>

3224
02:17:25.430 --> 02:17:26.670
<v Speaker 2>hemophilia change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope.</v>

3225
02:17:26.671 --> 02:17:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think human beings,</v>

3226
02:17:28.681 --> 02:17:32.550
<v Speaker 2>and I think our culture is evolving like</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about like the the</v>

3227
02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:35.730
<v Speaker 2>social climate of this happening and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many things are going on right now and</v>

3228
02:17:35.731 --> 02:17:39.120
<v Speaker 2>words that people are not supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use any more and things that people used</v>

3229
02:17:39.121 --> 02:17:42.900
<v Speaker 2>to think of as being commonplace and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought of as being problematic.</v>

3230
02:17:42.901 --> 02:17:45.930
<v Speaker 2>This lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does feel like there's this,</v>

3231
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:47.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel it.</v>

3232
02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:49.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in along with things like this</v>

3233
02:17:49.861 --> 02:17:53.760
<v Speaker 2>crispr technology and a bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably unforeseen technologies that</v>

3234
02:17:53.761 --> 02:17:56.070
<v Speaker 2>are being worked on right now as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak.</v>

3235
02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:58.980
<v Speaker 2>I think some weird shit is going down in</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years.</v>

3236
02:17:58.981 --> 02:18:01.890
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to be like basketball</v>
<v Speaker 2>players and shifts can be fun.</v>
