<v Speaker 1>there's like a spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even cock porn,</v>

54
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>keeping cocked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>porn has a,</v>

55
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of variables they have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take into consideration.</v>

56
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>But I see people calling people cox all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

57
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're calling another man to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cook as an insult,</v>

00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:45.640

<v Speaker 1>I just think it's,</v>

63
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a new thing to call someone to hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>their feelings.</v>

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no other,</v>

65
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>there's no equivalent word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

66
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a new sort of like a classification</v>

67
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>of someone to call someone a cook and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking cook.</v>

<v Speaker 1>calling people that.</v>

70
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

71
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.180

<v Speaker 2>Isn't that kind of thing before and how</v>

72
00:03:08.181 --> 00:03:10.640

82
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Schumer's show when she was getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>accused of plagiarism and all this stuff</v>

83
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 1>was going on and I was seeing all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people calling them a cock and I was</v>

<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

85
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.830

<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

86
00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:43.470
<v Speaker 1>People call people cooks.</v>

98
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.520
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like actually watching your</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

111
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we've run out of insults.</v>

<v Speaker 1>using it so often.</v>

113
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:48.820

<v Speaker 1>it's not really applicable.</v>

114
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>And they're doing it because it's a new</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:00.410
<v Speaker 1>it's like we've got this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just throwing around until,</v>

119
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like they found a new word</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just throw it and around until</v>

120
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:08.971
<v Speaker 1>it's useless and we're promoting it</v>

<v Speaker 1>kickboxer have to say about the world.</v>

133

<v Speaker 1>And then they find out about Cox and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

159
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a new word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting news.</v>

160
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Let him use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people haven't had a new word to</v>

161
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>call people and so long and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to take away so many of them.</v>

162
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>It used to be when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call a kid a Faggot,</v>

163
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you gay bashing.</v>

164
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then it had nothing to do with</v>

165
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 1>being gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's too late.</v>

166
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 1>That's connected to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to use.</v>

167
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Retard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to use.</v>

168
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Retard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No today.</v>

169
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not even a</v>

170
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>classification for mental illness has</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with down syndrome.</v>

171
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Like retarded means slow growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like slow to catch on.</v>

172
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.400
<v Speaker 1>It is literally the perfect word to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>for retards when someone's a retard,</v>

173
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>like calling them a retard is a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

174
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Like you would never say that about</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who has a disease or someone who</v>

175
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 1>has down syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if someone's like it wants trump</v>

176
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.910
<v Speaker 1>wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ward people talking over,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking radar.</v>

179
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It's the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the word.</v>

180
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 1>These goddamn language police</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers,</v>

181
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.520
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've typed sensitive to sensitive</v>

182
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 1>punch of Cox fucking sensitive cucs</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've traded debt catch up.</v>

183
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I do like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking,</v>

184
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 1>we need a new card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>

185
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 1>It's horrendous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually works in the description.</v>

186
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weak little bitch that would let</v>

187
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>some other man fuck his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

188
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Same Person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like,</v>

189
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:54.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't call him a retard.</v>

190
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to be more sensitive about the</v>

191
00:07:57.351 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>way we communicate both they're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do is just control people.</v>

192
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the pussification.</v>

193
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goddamn pussification of America.</v>

194
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I see something in America that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world,</v>

195
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:10.820
<v Speaker 1>the whole world fucking pussification of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

196
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

197
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's also not not being honest about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on.</v>

198
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when something happens,</v>

199
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 1>we have to be real sensitive to who we</v>
<v Speaker 1>insult post post,</v>

200
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 1>like attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with shit that was going on in</v>

201
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Germany where all these women were</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting raped during New Year's eve cut</v>

202
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>because of all these Islamic refugees</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had come in from Syria.</v>

203
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

204
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>that's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] people are coming from a</v>

205
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>completely different culture in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

206
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Women are much more suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come over to this country,</v>

207
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where women are Western eyes,</v>

208
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.780
<v Speaker 1>they're free and they're wearing skirts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their tits or hanging out and way</v>

209
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>they're dressed normal and getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked,</v>

210
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>and so what is the fucking mayor of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it Berlin?</v>

211
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay away from men and dress different,</v>

212
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>stay an arm's length away from men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dress more conservatively.</v>

213
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Like literally this fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are so sensitive and</v>

214
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>worried that they're going to hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's feelings or they're going to</v>

215
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 1>be called Islamophobic or racist in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

216
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 1>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're telling women who've done</v>

217
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>nothing wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they should dress differently</v>

218
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>because they've unfortunately let these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in from another culture that</v>

219
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.230
<v Speaker 1>think about things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

220
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.690
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of Cox fucking Cox sensitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>dazzle,</v>

221
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>the mayor of Berlin or wherever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a woman.</v>

222
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Was it Berlin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when the city was,</v>

223
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's even more confusing.</v>

224
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>But boy did she get fucking raked over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coals online.</v>

225
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>People are getting tired of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pendulum swings both ways.</v>

226
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it swings towards ultra sensitivity and</v>

227
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 1>then people get sick of that and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

228
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they go hard the other way.</v>

229
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one the reasons why trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the republican nominee.</v>

230
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I think Caitlyn Jenner is responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of it.</v>

231
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I think people saw that and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

232
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.490
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.833
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you?</v>

<v Speaker 1>A demasculated millennial liberal male</v>
<v Speaker 1>who often speaks of white privilege and</v>

248
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:42.480
<v Speaker 1>modern feminism blames white men for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world's problems.</v>

249
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the new definition there,</v>

250
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.780
<v Speaker 1>but now</v>

<v Speaker 1>commonly used on twitter to describe</v>

259
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.690
<v Speaker 1>anti white males while it was originally</v>
<v Speaker 1>formed with the original meaning of Kack</v>

260
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Kack hold the use of the word cock does</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily denote a sexual</v>

261
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:23.190
<v Speaker 1>connotation.</v>

262

<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>criticized them for fear of looking</v>

269

271
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:50.670
<v Speaker 1>nationalists vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's still widely used by all.</v>

272
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.713
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>
