WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Does that new band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he mails and uh,</v>

2
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3
00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:15.751
<v Speaker 1>I do a fucking really shitty beat box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling that money coming in </v>

4
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>We got a winning combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to put this shit on wax ready.</v>

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience is brought to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you by [inaudible] dot com.</v>

7
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 1>That's o n n I t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makers of Alpha brain shroom,</v>

8
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>tech sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And You keep doing them.</v>

9
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:46.671
<v Speaker 1>And I was kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just shroom tech immune to do what are </v>

10
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Mood.</v>

11
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Another favorite new mood is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>five htp and l trip to fan a supplement </v>

12
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.250
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aids your body and its ability to </v>

13
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>produce serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it actually can make you happy.</v>

14
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>This is one that is a not to be taken by</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are on antidepressants </v>

15
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're on antidepressants,</v>

16
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>apparently there's an issue with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating too much,</v>

17
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>too much serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much,</v>

18
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:18.771
<v Speaker 1>five htp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should be careful if you're on a </v>

19
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:18.771
<v Speaker 1>few on an Ssri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

20
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take new load.</v>

21
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>But if you are not a safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>

22
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about it.</v>

23
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Nothing dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>all the supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that new mood,</v>

25
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>all of them have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first 30 orders or the first 30 </v>

26
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first order have a 100 percent money</v>

27
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>back guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to return anything.</v>

28
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>You just say this shit didn't work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your money back.</v>

29
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind that is no one's trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rip you off.</v>

30
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>We're only trying to sell you the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>best supplements possible.</v>

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>All supplements that I personally </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>

32
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>all things that I took long before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever got involved in on it.</v>

33
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a vitamin junkie and a </v>

34
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>nutrition junkie for a long time because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

35
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an unquestionable difference in </v>

36
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>how your body responds when you feed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good nutrients and you take care of it.</v>

37
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of science behind all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>

38
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:13.731
<v Speaker 1>especially nootropics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of studies that show </v>

39
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>benefits of nootropics and we're working</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our own now.</v>

40
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm a double blind placebo study and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

41
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:22.671
<v Speaker 1>we'll let all the details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to hook something </v>

42
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:22.671
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it because they're all blind?</v>

43
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a scientific method.</v>

44
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not for blind.</v>

45
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>He seems like it takes a long time for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those double blind blindfolds off </v>

46
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>

47
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you understand what the </v>

48
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we also have kettle bells,</v>

50

52
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:48.531

<v Speaker 1>we sell them literally as cheap as we </v>

<v Speaker 2>down to the bottom of this thing.</v>

92
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Experience my day podcasts by night</v>

93
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.810
<v Speaker 1>when I did a podcast with Robb Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the Paleo Diet Guy,</v>

94
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things that happened </v>

95
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>was that I got an immediate influx of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vegans who had to set Robb Wolf </v>

96
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Straight because rob wolf said some </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>

97
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:56.521
<v Speaker 1>Like I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drank a Kale shake every morning and </v>

98
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:56.521
<v Speaker 1>it makes me feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gives me a lot of energy.</v>

99
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

100
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:01.531
<v Speaker 1>you got to eat bacon and eggs cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you gotta get your Dick Sucked by </v>

101
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 1>truckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't my superhero.</v>

102
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

103
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>he said some awesome shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have bacon,</v>

104
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:11.191
<v Speaker 1>eggs and coffee in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good way to get your day </v>

105
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:14.401
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people didn't want to hear </v>

106
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people felt that it was silly.</v>

107
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:19.681
<v Speaker 1>And you were one of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted me and then I lift up your </v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life goes on and,</v>

119
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to law school and then it's just </v>

120
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.280
<v Speaker 4>about the job and get married and having</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids and you know,</v>

121
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 4>climbing the corporate ladder and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff and you know,</v>

122
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.600
<v Speaker 4>in the wake of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

123
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.660
<v Speaker 4>lost sight of being fit and being </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy and you know,</v>

124
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 4>it was pretty much a couch potato,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed,</v>

125
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 4>lethargic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit lost in life,</v>

126
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it goes.</v>

127
00:05:58.701 --> 00:05:59.350
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

128
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 4>I decided I had to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take it back.</v>

129
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 4>I had a little bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a health scare that kind of triggered</v>

130
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 4>me to take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do something about it.</v>

131
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 4>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what action did you take specifically?</v>

132
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

133
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:13.420
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

134
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 4>say ran off to the library and got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of books and,</v>

135
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:21.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>read all the Paleo books and read all </v>

136
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 4>the Vegan books and did a double blind </v>
<v Speaker 4>study with people with double blindfolds</v>

137
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:22.710
<v Speaker 4>on and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

138
00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring out the right way to do it.</v>

139
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:25.230
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

140
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 4>that's not what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

141
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.900
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fumbled around for awhile trying to </v>

142
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.900
<v Speaker 4>figure out what would work for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the first thing I did,</v>

143
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife is like,</v>

144
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:38.880
<v Speaker 4>she's big into yoga and healing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation and she's like,</v>

145
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's constantly reading like crazy </v>

146
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.631
<v Speaker 4>spiritual texts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's pretty well schooled in </v>

147
00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 4>alternative thinking and lifestyle and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that kind of stuff.</v>

148
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:53.471
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were to open the refrigerator is </v>

149
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 4>pretty clear like kind of food she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating and what I was eating,</v>

150
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:54.980
<v Speaker 4>which was essentially crap.</v>

151
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

152
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 4>but she would do like a juice cleanse </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty much every year,</v>

153
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was fine for her.</v>

154
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 4>But that was definitely not something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was ever interested in doing.</v>

155
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

156
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 4>it was kind of desperate and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

157
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

158
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll try that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I just sort of reached out to her</v>

159
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:12.360
<v Speaker 4>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

160
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 4>I think I want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she hooked me up with,</v>

161
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.800
<v Speaker 4>we got all these crazy herbs and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

162
00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 4>we got a juicer and the whole thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of dialed it in and you know,</v>

163
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 4>I did that for like five days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of a,</v>

164
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.290
<v Speaker 4>not like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

165
00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:30.291
<v Speaker 4>in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people do like the Cayenne </v>

166
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:30.291
<v Speaker 4>pepper thing or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

167
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's like a starvation thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't like that.</v>

168
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.120
<v Speaker 4>It was like I kind of weaned myself off </v>
<v Speaker 4>food for a couple of days and just did </v>

169
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 4>juice for a couple of days and then kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of lean back into food.</v>

170
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 4>But it was a pretty like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eyeopening experience,</v>

171
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:47.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the first couple of days I was </v>

172
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:47.651
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like I was in Rehab,</v>

173
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like buckled over on the couch,</v>

174
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 4>like detox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

175
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could barely move.</v>

176
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.730
<v Speaker 5>What was your diet like before that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what was standard</v>

177
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.210
<v Speaker 4>cheeseburgers?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

178
00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:56.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

179
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.140
<v Speaker 4>fast food all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

180
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dominoes,</v>

181
00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:00.040
<v Speaker 4>Pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pizza Hut,</v>

182
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.020
<v Speaker 4>Wendy's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack in the box late at night,</v>

183
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 4>coming home from work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just it didn't matter.</v>

184
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.850
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of that was because when I was in,</v>

185
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.500
<v Speaker 4>when I was swimming in college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

186
00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:10.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm training like four hours a day and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

187
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:11.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're 19,</v>

188
00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:16.621
<v Speaker 4>20 years old or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just it was just about how many </v>

189
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.490
<v Speaker 4>calories can I put down the throat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to fill myself up,</v>

190
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it didn't really matter and you know,</v>

191
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:22.660
<v Speaker 4>you can get away with that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

192
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:24.100
<v Speaker 4>and I did for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

193
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:25.780
<v Speaker 4>it catches up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But those habits,</v>

194
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 4>you form those habits that carry with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and they're,</v>

195
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're hard to break.</v>

196
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We really are a creature of habit.</v>

197
00:08:32.401 --> 00:08:37.401
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a strange thing that even bad </v>

198
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:39.171
<v Speaker 5>habits like gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people that become gambling </v>

199
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:39.171
<v Speaker 5>addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is some sort of like a,</v>

200
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

201
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.850
<v Speaker 5>like a hijacking of reward systems and </v>
<v Speaker 5>giving you this,</v>

202
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 5>this rush towards something that really </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't make any sense and there's also </v>

203
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.200
<v Speaker 5>the comfort factor that comes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>repeating patterns.</v>

204
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.750
<v Speaker 5>It's like your brain knows how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's done it before.</v>

205
00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 5>Let's fucking around just keep</v>

206
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 6>doing the same shit you've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>and just,</v>

207
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:03.201
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blow off the gym and take a nap and go </v>

208
00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:03.201
<v Speaker 6>beat off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just do,</v>

209
00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:06.950
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do the same stupid shit you've been </v>

210
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.781
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really hard for people to like to </v>

211
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:08.781
<v Speaker 6>move away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

212
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 6>You get these like cemented pathways in </v>
<v Speaker 6>your brain and it's just your default.</v>

213
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:13.160
<v Speaker 6>Like I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

214
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 6>when you were certain behavior patterns </v>
<v Speaker 6>after a while,</v>

215
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 6>you don't even know you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're just like,</v>

216
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 6>it's like your program,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a computer.</v>

217
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 6>You just follow that pattern every time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Change is hard,</v>

218
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:24.200
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is hard and it's,</v>

219
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.440
<v Speaker 6>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's hard to find a healthy meal at like</v>

220
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.450
<v Speaker 6>fucking Burger King or Jack in the box.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to go in there and really get </v>

221
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.310
<v Speaker 6>some nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't happen.</v>

222
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 6>I mean you like you look you like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you got a salad?</v>

223
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 6>You've got to sell over there and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>looked at the salad.</v>

224
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh Jesus.</v>

225
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:44.331
<v Speaker 6>It's all like iceberg lettuce,</v>
<v Speaker 6>assault wilderness and everything's </v>

226
00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:47.391
<v Speaker 6>closed early here in la.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you're working late and coming </v>

227
00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 6>home like it's sometimes it's the only </v>
<v Speaker 6>option.</v>

228
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.130
<v Speaker 6>Subways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>subways though,</v>

229
00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:53.080
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

230
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.550
<v Speaker 6>all that stuff that they can keep on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>shelf for that long.</v>

231
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.270
<v Speaker 6>None of that is good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So much.</v>

232
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.320
<v Speaker 6>It's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would imagine if you just got a </v>

233
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.860

288
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Now it's got to be enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane Sawyer looks pissed as fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to talk shit about you angry faced,</v>

291
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.800
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many cows do you think they use?</v>

292
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Like just in and out a small chain like </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and out.</v>

293
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.730
<v Speaker 1>How many do they use in his day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got To be mind blowing.</v>

294
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

295
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop and think about that.</v>

296
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like the holocaust of cows over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

297
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is,</v>

298
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:59.691
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We figured out how to make this society </v>

299
00:12:59.691 --> 00:13:02.031
<v Speaker 1>work without people hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feel like this weird notion that we </v>

300
00:13:02.551 --> 00:13:05.340
<v Speaker 1>have zero connection with how the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>is gathered.</v>

301
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a really fucking crazy way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>

302
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.600
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

303
00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:14.601
<v Speaker 1>I'd like meat like meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to do any of the </v>

304
00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:15.780
<v Speaker 1>stuff that makes you respect the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to hunt it down.</v>

305
00:13:15.781 --> 00:13:19.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to kill it enough to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>be thankful that you got it and bring it</v>

306
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:20.310
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's none of that anymore.</v>

307
00:13:20.311 --> 00:13:20.670
<v Speaker 1>The system</v>

308
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.600
<v Speaker 4>stem is set up to prevent you from </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it.</v>

309
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:28.630
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like grocery stores in a </v>

310
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.521
<v Speaker 4>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's analogous to like a Vegas casino </v>

311
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:30.521
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

312
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 4>the casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they're pumping the air </v>

313
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 4>conditioning and there's no clocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't find the exit door.</v>

314
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.960
<v Speaker 4>It's disorienting and the same way like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a grocery store,</v>

315
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.540
<v Speaker 4>everything's perfectly packaged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks clean or what,</v>

316
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:38.920
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

317
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.180
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to think about that.</v>

318
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I was at a grocery store that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>butcher shop in the back and uh,</v>

319
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:50.050
<v Speaker 1>they were sawing through a side of beef </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't really see that,</v>

320
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really rarely see that.</v>

321
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would usually get is you get like,</v>

322
00:13:55.390 --> 00:14:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have these packages and the state </v>

323
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:00.390
<v Speaker 1>because already nice and wrapped up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

324
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.070
<v Speaker 1>this one is a full pound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good size state.</v>

325
00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

326
00:14:04.191 --> 00:14:04.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

327
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:07.250
<v Speaker 1>This dude had saw and he was running </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet through the,</v>

328
00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:08.060
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

329
00:14:08.061 --> 00:14:10.030
<v Speaker 1>that's real life son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

330
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 1>that's our body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a steak.</v>

331
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a body that has to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>chopped up and become sex when we're so </v>

332
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.271
<v Speaker 1>separated from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actual experience of seeing the </v>

333
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 1>animal lose its life and understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means to eat it.</v>

334
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>We're completely separated from really </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

335
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if your job was the guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughterhouse,</v>

336
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.410
<v Speaker 1>like doing that cutting throats or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

337
00:14:31.411 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got a tad emotional gotta be mad.</v>

338
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be madness all day.</v>

339
00:14:36.431 --> 00:14:41.431
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing terrified animals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're giving them the very thing that </v>

340
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:43.030
<v Speaker 1>they're terrified of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrified of losing their lives.</v>

341
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Fucking horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>It's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you know,</v>

343
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

344
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 4>know I think you can appreciate is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>deep thinker,</v>

345
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>food is energy,</v>

346
00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:54.960
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

347
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 4>it carries a vibration and so when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>put something in your mouth and you know</v>

348
00:14:58.641 --> 00:15:02.580
<v Speaker 4>you're making a decision to take that </v>
<v Speaker 4>vibration into you and so you know what,</v>

349
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 4>what is that vibration?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

350
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 4>when you're taking in a terrorized </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal,</v>

351
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 4>does that affect you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>

352
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:11.670
<v Speaker 4>Does that change your perception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your decision making,</v>

353
00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 4>your outlook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it not?</v>

354
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

355
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.240
<v Speaker 1>It's very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

356
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you know the solution though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be it's not as simple as </v>

357
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.900
<v Speaker 1>don't eat meat because even if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat meat,</v>

358
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.640
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do with all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cows?</v>

359
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to stop them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>breeding?</v>

360
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to let them starve to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and die off?</v>

361
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Or they're going to go extinct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how are we going to regulate these </v>

362
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.701
<v Speaker 1>cows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're either going to shoot them or </v>

363
00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:35.701
<v Speaker 1>you're going to castrate a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

364
00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:39.720
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to shoot some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because otherwise you're going to </v>

365
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:39.720
<v Speaker 1>have cows wandering through the streets </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

366
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to deal with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to deal with the fact that </v>

367
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:44.340
<v Speaker 1>you've created a species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

368
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.281
<v Speaker 1>essentially we've bred cows to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic form from wild cows and you </v>

369
00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:52.690
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

370
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.540
<v Speaker 1>we've done it for so long that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much helpless.</v>

371
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Without us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be bad cows.</v>

372
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.300
<v Speaker 1>There's no predators out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we live in fucking Africa </v>

373
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.730
<v Speaker 1>and there's lions running around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>could take care of the cow problem.</v>

374
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have a real problem with cows </v>

375
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.020
<v Speaker 1>if we stopped eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the fucking sheer numbers that </v>

376
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.020
<v Speaker 1>exist now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

377
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.420
<v Speaker 1>unless you could absolutely keep them </v>
<v Speaker 1>from breeding and then you would have to</v>

378
00:16:16.421 --> 00:16:21.421
<v Speaker 1>figure out what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to just let the old ones </v>

379
00:16:21.421 --> 00:16:21.421
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to let some of them breed,</v>

380
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:22.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

381
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:22.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

382
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

383
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no easy solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Vegan solution of not eating the</v>

384
00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:32.650
<v Speaker 1>meat at least removes Karma from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

385
00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:36.820
<v Speaker 1>It moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It removes you from interacting with the</v>

386
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.910
<v Speaker 1>terrified animals last moments into for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to be.</v>

387
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say profiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefiting from that.</v>

388
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

389
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I just</v>

390
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.010
<v Speaker 4>speak to my own experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

391
00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:49.280
<v Speaker 4>and I know I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel more energized.</v>

392
00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 4>I feel like my energy is even in good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

393
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 4>my mood and my outlook is positive and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that,</v>

394
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

395
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.260
<v Speaker 4>when you talk about Vegan and the word </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vegan and what that means,</v>

396
00:17:01.261 --> 00:17:03.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean that means different things to </v>
<v Speaker 4>different people.</v>

397
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:04.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a tricky word.</v>

398
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:04.730
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

399
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.210
<v Speaker 1>no what it means for a lot of people.</v>

400
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it means,</v>

401
00:17:08.321 --> 00:17:08.800
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

402
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means it means,</v>

403
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

404
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.620
<v Speaker 1>you run a high risk of them being </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>

405
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.120
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that they're ignoring a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of friends that are awesome.</v>

406
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Mac Danzig is a Vegan and he's a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

407
00:17:23.431 --> 00:17:28.431
<v Speaker 1>great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's going to be on the podcast </v>

408
00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:30.731
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fucked up and the big disaster for </v>

409
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:34.070
<v Speaker 1>this park and I just sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My twitter feed won't still being a lazy</v>

410
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:36.650
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are so silly.</v>

411
00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:37.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Max,</v>

412
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.900
<v Speaker 1>a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome guy,</v>

413
00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:40.170
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:45.250
<v Speaker 1>he's got his reasons and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent or reasons for being a </v>

415
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

416
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 1>there are a few people that do it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sanctimonious starting point.</v>

417
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.240
<v Speaker 1>They do it as like,</v>

418
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.250
<v Speaker 5>you like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are claiming a moral high ground </v>

419
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 5>with this new position and they flaunt </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and it's like,</v>

420
00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:01.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really annoying self satisfying kind of </v>

421
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.360
<v Speaker 5>in your face way.</v>

422
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.440
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's defeatist for what they're trying </v>

423
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.440
<v Speaker 4>to say as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that,</v>

424
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.850
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

425
00:18:06.851 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 4>it's a very emotionally</v>

426
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.100
<v Speaker 5>recharge work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Food in general as well be religious,</v>

427
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.730
<v Speaker 4>talking about food in general is </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotionally charged.</v>

428
00:18:13.731 --> 00:18:18.731
<v Speaker 4>I mean just look at the twitter feed is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to explode over this and that's </v>

429
00:18:18.731 --> 00:18:21.080
<v Speaker 4>your barometer of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

430
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's right up there with religion and </v>

431
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 4>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

432
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:26.390
<v Speaker 4>And when you say Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it immediately,</v>

433
00:18:26.391 --> 00:18:31.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people snap into a preconceived idea of </v>

434
00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:32.450
<v Speaker 4>what that is and what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they have a visual image of a person</v>

435
00:18:32.451 --> 00:18:33.260
<v Speaker 4>in their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

436
00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:36.980
<v Speaker 4>it's a guy with dreadlocks kicking a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hacky sack up in Humboldt.</v>

437
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.550
<v Speaker 5>Always blowing a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

438
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>

439
00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:44.090
<v Speaker 5>somebody has that imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

440
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.160
<v Speaker 5>so that word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

441
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.940
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people have different reasons for </v>

442
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:51.940
<v Speaker 4>getting into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

443
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.641
<v Speaker 4>you have the people who are into it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the compassion and the saving the </v>

444
00:18:54.641 --> 00:18:58.511
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a very different crowd and </v>

445
00:18:58.511 --> 00:19:01.331
<v Speaker 4>attitude from the people that get into </v>
<v Speaker 4>it for health reasons or because they </v>

446
00:19:01.331 --> 00:19:01.331
<v Speaker 4>don't want to have a heart attack or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

447
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

448
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.620
<v Speaker 4>they both are I guess are technically </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegans but they're also,</v>

449
00:19:06.621 --> 00:19:08.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different.</v>

450
00:19:08.061 --> 00:19:11.240
<v Speaker 4>And just because you choose to not eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>meat or whatever it doesn't,</v>

451
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:16.300
<v Speaker 4>does that mean that you're automatically</v>
<v Speaker 4>a democrat or what is your political </v>

452
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.000
<v Speaker 4>point of view and all of these things </v>
<v Speaker 4>get woven together and it.</v>

453
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.080
<v Speaker 4>And it makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes it challenging to even talk </v>

454
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.360
<v Speaker 4>about it with an open mind.</v>

455
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a quite interesting situation and </v>

456
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 5>there is the very real issue of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we are at the top of the food chain</v>

457
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 5>and when you're at the top of the food </v>
<v Speaker 5>chain of bear,</v>

458
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:36.210
<v Speaker 5>some responsibility and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

459
00:19:36.211 --> 00:19:41.211
<v Speaker 5>we're the only animals that can really </v>
<v Speaker 5>decide and choose how to alter other </v>

460
00:19:41.211 --> 00:19:44.070
<v Speaker 5>animals' lives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like on purpose and figure out how to do</v>

461
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you look at how we choose to do</v>

462
00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:48.570
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at like food inc and you see</v>

463
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:52.230
<v Speaker 5>factory farming and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is a,</v>

464
00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:57.231
<v Speaker 5>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a damning statement about like </v>

465
00:19:57.231 --> 00:19:58.770
<v Speaker 5>where we're at like spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like as a race,</v>

466
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.980
<v Speaker 5>like we're getting away with this really</v>
<v Speaker 5>heinous shit because we can because it's</v>

467
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:07.440
<v Speaker 5>easy to just not pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's uh,</v>

468
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the worst case scenario.</v>

469
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 5>The best case scenario you would think </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have it set up.</v>

470
00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:19.410
<v Speaker 5>So these animals live like they're on a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an open prairie and they all just live a</v>

471
00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:22.620
<v Speaker 5>natural life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you call them from the herd and</v>

472
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:23.520
<v Speaker 5>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do it,</v>

473
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>easily.</v>

474
00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:29.241
<v Speaker 5>So they live a natural life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no different than any other cow in a </v>

475
00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:32.151
<v Speaker 5>large environment where they get to roam</v>
<v Speaker 5>around and eat grass instead of being </v>

476
00:20:32.151 --> 00:20:33.030
<v Speaker 5>forced fed corn and then you just kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

477
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's like the best case </v>
<v Speaker 5>scenario if you're going to eat cows.</v>

478
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:41.390
<v Speaker 5>But the way we do it is it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>damning that human beings in the idea of</v>

479
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.520
<v Speaker 5>maximizing profit have decided to run </v>
<v Speaker 5>these ridiculous places where you're </v>

480
00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:48.430
<v Speaker 5>packing pigs</v>

481
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.330
<v Speaker 6>right next to each other in these little</v>
<v Speaker 6>boxes and you,</v>

482
00:20:51.331 --> 00:20:54.620
<v Speaker 6>you see the chickens all stuffed in </v>
<v Speaker 6>together with each other and pecking and</v>

483
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.410
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking gnarly,</v>

484
00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:56.800
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

485
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.320
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

486
00:20:57.321 --> 00:20:59.480
<v Speaker 4>When you see food inc and you see the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken coop,</v>

487
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty tough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty disturbing</v>

488
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.430
<v Speaker 4>connection because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to go,</v>

489
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:06.810
<v Speaker 4>well chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chickens,</v>

490
00:21:06.811 --> 00:21:09.540
<v Speaker 4>the healthier option or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you see that it makes you,</v>

491
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.460
<v Speaker 4>it makes you think twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I also think,</v>

492
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've created this system that </v>

493
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.000
<v Speaker 4>ultimately is not sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

494
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.871
<v Speaker 4>like an insane amount of our agriculture</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes to produce grain to feed these to </v>

495
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 4>feed livestock like something like 90 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent or something like that.</v>

496
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.860
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>High,</v>

497
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.050
<v Speaker 4>crazy high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

498
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.060
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>

499
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.660
<v Speaker 4>and then it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

500
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brings up all the ecological arguments </v>

501
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.870
<v Speaker 4>about greenhouse gasses.</v>

502
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.470
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they fill up a fucking storm.</v>

503
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.910
<v Speaker 6>Those goddamn animals ruined India.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know they do.</v>

504
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.070
<v Speaker 6>They fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they caused global warming.</v>

505
00:21:43.071 --> 00:21:44.270
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bullshit and farting.</v>

506
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.350
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do it.</v>

507
00:21:45.351 --> 00:21:47.660
<v Speaker 6>It's not bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds silly,</v>

508
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.330
<v Speaker 6>but they fought so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're dealing with in India,</v>

509
00:21:50.331 --> 00:21:55.331
<v Speaker 6>you have so many fucking cows that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>really have pollution issues because of </v>

510
00:21:55.331 --> 00:21:59.801
<v Speaker 6>cows farting in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard the grass fed beef parks even </v>

511
00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 6>more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

512
00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.080
<v Speaker 6>I don't know where I wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's hilarious.</v>

513
00:22:03.081 --> 00:22:05.510
<v Speaker 6>Well that makes sense because envy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it would be much more grass fed.</v>

514
00:22:05.511 --> 00:22:06.770
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're the ones who have the,</v>

515
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 6>the big issue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they also have the issue in that </v>

516
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 6>they don't kill cows or at least the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hindus.</v>

517
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.370
<v Speaker 6>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Apparently Ken buy beef in India.</v>

518
00:22:13.371 --> 00:22:18.371
<v Speaker 6>It's not uncommon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just there's a huge group of them </v>

519
00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:19.640
<v Speaker 6>that won't fuck with the cows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that why they don't wear deodorant?</v>

520
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.660
<v Speaker 6>So it smells like deodorant or armpits </v>
<v Speaker 6>more than poop and Fart.</v>

521
00:22:23.661 --> 00:22:26.540
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like you're building your field.</v>

522
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.230
<v Speaker 6>Maybe your own body smell cancel out the</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

523
00:22:30.231 --> 00:22:31.070
<v Speaker 6>Smell in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

524
00:22:31.071 --> 00:22:32.840
<v Speaker 6>That's like way better than fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

525
00:22:32.841 --> 00:22:37.841
<v Speaker 6>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's like the worst case scenario is </v>

526
00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:40.721
<v Speaker 6>like you're living around animals who </v>
<v Speaker 6>stink up the air constantly with their </v>

527
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:44.720
<v Speaker 6>fart gas and you can't kill them because</v>
<v Speaker 6>dog fart are fucking nasty.</v>

528
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.490
<v Speaker 6>Big Cow Farts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's way be sniffing our pits all day </v>

529
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.561
<v Speaker 6>long.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're hungry and you know there's </v>

530
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:56.261
<v Speaker 6>people starving and they're just letting</v>
<v Speaker 6>these delicious cows just wander around </v>

531
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:56.990
<v Speaker 6>the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did that ever happen?</v>

532
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.480
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it goes back to religion.</v>

533
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.880
<v Speaker 6>What a bunch of silly bitches they are </v>
<v Speaker 6>in India.</v>

534
00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:04.220
<v Speaker 6>That is the one of the silliest choices </v>
<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>

535
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:09.550
<v Speaker 6>What do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want to starve to death or what you </v>

536
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:09.550
<v Speaker 6>eat these fucking delicious cows.</v>

537
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.630
<v Speaker 6>Let's just sit around some other farts </v>
<v Speaker 6>and complain and have more people's </v>

538
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.030
<v Speaker 6>cultural mores though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

539
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.040
<v Speaker 6>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are cultures that think that we're</v>

540
00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:18.860
<v Speaker 6>insane for having dogs in our houses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>

541
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting how,</v>

542
00:23:20.211 --> 00:23:25.211
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we just sort of adopt a pattern of </v>

543
00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:27.941
<v Speaker 6>behavior based on our surroundings and </v>
<v Speaker 6>what's existed in that area for the </v>

544
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:30.320
<v Speaker 6>Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess what it is the cow is sacred and</v>

545
00:23:30.321 --> 00:23:35.321
<v Speaker 6>the Hindu culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it is God or something like that or </v>

546
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:35.321
<v Speaker 6>relatives come back to life or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

547
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:36.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

548
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.040
<v Speaker 6>when I worked at an Indian company,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a steering wheel.</v>

549
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:45.110
<v Speaker 6>My,</v>
<v Speaker 6>me and my ex girlfriend used to share a </v>

550
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.110
<v Speaker 6>cart and her steering wheel cover.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a cow,</v>

551
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 6>a</v>

552
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:51.430
<v Speaker 2>print and they saw me drive up tonight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had a meeting and they told me to </v>

553
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.210
<v Speaker 2>please remove that from their steering </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel because uh,</v>

554
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.000
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they respect cows.</v>

555
00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Why real Indian company was called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>software people.</v>

556
00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you showed up with like murdered </v>

557
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.140
<v Speaker 4>scanning vote piece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just filled with,</v>

558
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:11.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just be nice and God's got to be a weird</v>

559
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a strange thing to just choose to </v>

560
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.080
<v Speaker 4>really worship and lock onto it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows you.</v>

561
00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:19.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what they did in India,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

562
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.640
<v Speaker 4>he someplace else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was Buddha someplace else.</v>

563
00:24:21.641 --> 00:24:26.641
<v Speaker 4>It was Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's were so fascinating when it comes </v>

564
00:24:26.641 --> 00:24:26.641
<v Speaker 4>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human beings are really,</v>

565
00:24:26.641 --> 00:24:28.750
<v Speaker 4>really bizarre animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your,</v>

566
00:24:28.751 --> 00:24:33.751
<v Speaker 4>your story was that you were an athlete </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you got unhealthy and then you </v>

567
00:24:34.091 --> 00:24:38.200
<v Speaker 4>had a little bit of a health scare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's when you decided to go vegan.</v>

568
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:39.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I did.</v>

569
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:41.460
<v Speaker 4>So I did that juice cleanse and then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

570
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.270
<v Speaker 4>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the fifth day of that,</v>

571
00:24:43.271 --> 00:24:45.220
<v Speaker 4>I just felt unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

572
00:24:45.221 --> 00:24:50.221
<v Speaker 4>like my energy level was through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>roof and all I had been doing it was </v>

573
00:24:50.221 --> 00:24:53.041
<v Speaker 4>drinking like fruit and vegetable juice </v>
<v Speaker 4>and drinking this like beet root broth </v>

574
00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:54.760
<v Speaker 4>and some teas and stuff like that.</v>

575
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.110
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>

576
00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.920
<v Speaker 4>it was amazing because I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had abused my body for so long with </v>

577
00:25:02.411 --> 00:25:06.970
<v Speaker 4>terrible food and terrible lifestyle and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm also a recovering alcoholic.</v>

578
00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:10.450
<v Speaker 4>So I used to drink like a shitload.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hit it on both ends.</v>

579
00:25:10.451 --> 00:25:11.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was hitting,</v>

580
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.570
<v Speaker 4>I was hitting it hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I just,</v>

581
00:25:12.571 --> 00:25:15.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not treat myself well and the idea</v>

582
00:25:15.221 --> 00:25:17.830
<v Speaker 4>that like within five days I could feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>that good.</v>

583
00:25:17.831 --> 00:25:22.831
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't know that I could feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>that good or I hadn't felt that good in </v>

584
00:25:22.831 --> 00:25:22.831
<v Speaker 4>15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years.</v>

585
00:25:22.831 --> 00:25:26.770
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The body is incredibly resilient,</v>

586
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you treat it right.</v>

587
00:25:28.451 --> 00:25:30.640
<v Speaker 4>So when I was done with that I thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

588
00:25:30.641 --> 00:25:32.030
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

589
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.280
<v Speaker 4>like I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to keep feeling this good like,</v>

590
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.390
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to do next.</v>

591
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.720
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

592
00:25:37.721 --> 00:25:41.170
<v Speaker 4>I wish I'd gone out and read a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>books or something,</v>

593
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.570
<v Speaker 4>but I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

594
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.660
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll try a vegetarian diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't do any education or </v>

595
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:48.660
<v Speaker 4>research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>

596
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.630
<v Speaker 4>it just seemed like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that sounds,</v>

597
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:54.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy or healthier than what I'm </v>

598
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.491
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But kind of coming from an addiction </v>

599
00:25:56.491 --> 00:25:59.191
<v Speaker 4>perspective and a recovery perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I went to rehab 14 years ago and so</v>

600
00:25:59.321 --> 00:26:04.321
<v Speaker 4>a lot of like the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I sort of rewired my brain and the </v>

601
00:26:04.321 --> 00:26:06.790
<v Speaker 4>way I think is kind of in the context of</v>
<v Speaker 4>addiction and recovery.</v>

602
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:12.180
<v Speaker 4>It just seemed like something I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrap my brain around because you're </v>

603
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.540
<v Speaker 4>either eating meat or you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

604
00:26:13.541 --> 00:26:18.541
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very black and white just like </v>

605
00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:18.541
<v Speaker 4>you're using drugs and you're drinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>or you're not,</v>

606
00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:20.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're either sober or you're using,</v>

607
00:26:20.291 --> 00:26:20.590
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

608
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:24.160
<v Speaker 4>And so that made more sense to me then </v>
<v Speaker 4>hey I'm going to eat better.</v>

609
00:26:24.161 --> 00:26:26.890
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm just going to eat healthy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the gym because it's so vague,</v>

610
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't know what that means,</v>

611
00:26:28.511 --> 00:26:30.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I would for like a week or two,</v>

612
00:26:30.461 --> 00:26:35.350
<v Speaker 4>but I would definitely fall back into my</v>
<v Speaker 4>regular old behavior patterns.</v>

613
00:26:35.351 --> 00:26:40.351
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I started doing that but it wasn't </v>

614
00:26:40.351 --> 00:26:40.390
<v Speaker 4>long before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

615
00:26:40.391 --> 00:26:45.391
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking for the loopholes or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever because you can eat like shit </v>

616
00:26:45.391 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Speaker 4>on a vegetarian diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can eat like shit on a Vegan Diet.</v>

617
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>

618
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.450
<v Speaker 4>I could eat pizza hut cheese pizza and </v>
<v Speaker 4>get Nachos in,</v>

619
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat McDonald's French fries and I'm a </v>

620
00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:55.550
<v Speaker 4>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

621
00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:55.550
<v Speaker 4>So certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

622
00:26:55.550 --> 00:27:00.230
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I did that for like six months and </v>

623
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.631
<v Speaker 4>of course I didn't lose any weight about</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 pounds heavier than I have now and </v>

624
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:08.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was kind of back on the couch and </v>

625
00:27:08.271 --> 00:27:08.271
<v Speaker 4>lethargic and I was ready to just bag </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

626
00:27:08.271 --> 00:27:08.271
<v Speaker 4>But I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

627
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.310
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what would happen if I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of went that extra step and got rid</v>

628
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:15.630
<v Speaker 4>of the dairy and cut out the processed </v>
<v Speaker 4>foods and I didn't really think it would</v>

629
00:27:15.631 --> 00:27:20.631
<v Speaker 4>make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I almost did it to prove that it </v>

630
00:27:20.631 --> 00:27:20.631
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't or to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

631
00:27:20.631 --> 00:27:22.170
<v Speaker 4>proven my wife that it wouldn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

632
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:24.560
<v Speaker 4>so I could kind of keep doing what I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing and,</v>

633
00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and feel free about it.</v>

634
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:28.890
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I tried that and within a week,</v>

635
00:27:28.891 --> 00:27:32.220
<v Speaker 4>like I was back to that energy level </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I felt when I did the cleanse,</v>

636
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.890
<v Speaker 4>like my energy level was through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>roof.</v>

637
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:39.891
<v Speaker 4>Like it was so high that I could only </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep like a couple hours a night and I </v>

638
00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 4>was like bouncing off the walls and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>really did.</v>

639
00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:44.950
<v Speaker 4>It did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it made a huge debt.</v>

640
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:50.030
<v Speaker 4>It made a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think getting rid of the dairy </v>

641
00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.331
<v Speaker 4>made a much bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not eating the meat wasn't that </v>

642
00:27:53.331 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 4>hard for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but getting rid of the dairy in my diet,</v>

643
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:58.970
<v Speaker 4>that was a lot harder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was almost like another detox </v>

644
00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:02.010
<v Speaker 4>because dairies in so many foods so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I crave it man,</v>

645
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

646
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:05.790
<v Speaker 4>So it was very difficult to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>break that.</v>

647
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Do you have cheat days?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have cheat days.</v>

648
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 6>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your attitude is essentially the same </v>

649
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.420
<v Speaker 6>attitude that you have about like </v>
<v Speaker 6>recovery because.</v>

650
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.820
<v Speaker 6>Well that's the thing like I know</v>

651
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.850
<v Speaker 4>you know like Tim Ferris is big on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheat day with his slow car up and all </v>

652
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.990
<v Speaker 4>of that and it seems to work for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people and it makes sense for me.</v>

653
00:28:24.991 --> 00:28:29.760
<v Speaker 4>Like for me it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to like the addiction model</v>

654
00:28:29.761 --> 00:28:34.761
<v Speaker 4>because I do crave this stuff man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know if I had a cheeseburger like </v>

655
00:28:34.761 --> 00:28:38.541
<v Speaker 4>once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'd start eating cheeseburgers all </v>

656
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:38.541
<v Speaker 4>the time because it would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

657
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 4>you break the cycle and now I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it that much.</v>

658
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.570
<v Speaker 4>Like every once in a while I'll smell it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it smells good to me,</v>

659
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:45.420
<v Speaker 4>but I don't go around like creating it </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

660
00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:47.730
<v Speaker 4>But if I was to have it every once in </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile then you're kind of,</v>

661
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.490
<v Speaker 4>you keep your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're still kinda like fertilizing that</v>

662
00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:51.270
<v Speaker 4>little seed.</v>

663
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.390
<v Speaker 6>I respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anthony Bourdain loves pork so much.</v>

664
00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:00.750
<v Speaker 6>He loves pork so much that they gave him</v>
<v Speaker 6>the option of quit eating pork or take </v>

665
00:29:01.211 --> 00:29:04.690
<v Speaker 6>medicine to lower your blood pressure </v>
<v Speaker 6>and your cholesterol rather.</v>

666
00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.680
<v Speaker 6>And he took the medicine so they'll take</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fucking medicine.</v>

667
00:29:08.681 --> 00:29:11.530
<v Speaker 6>I need pork.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Talked about it on the show,</v>

668
00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.650
<v Speaker 6>like being addicted to food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And for him it's work.</v>

669
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.510
<v Speaker 6>Fatty pork.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's willing to sacrifice health because</v>

670
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.020
<v Speaker 6>he likes to eat pork.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's,</v>

671
00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.930
<v Speaker 6>that's pretty heavy man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking intense.</v>

672
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I don't know how good that anti </v>

673
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.550
<v Speaker 6>cholesterol medication is for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that okay for you?</v>

674
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

675
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:31.860
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

676
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.900
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty of side effects from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

677
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:36.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

678
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine there are a crazy number</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people that are on these drugs and </v>

679
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.560
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing the extent to which the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

680
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.390
<v Speaker 4>the healthcare system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

681
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.160
<v Speaker 4>the doctors just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

682
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:53.161
<v Speaker 4>they just need your prescribed this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and they're not that educated </v>

683
00:29:53.161 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 4>about nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's Paleo or Vegan or whatever.</v>

684
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not really part of the medical </v>
<v Speaker 4>school curriculum.</v>

685
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm shocked talking to doctors about </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition.</v>

686
00:30:01.561 --> 00:30:03.150
<v Speaker 5>I've been shocked to having </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations.</v>

687
00:30:03.151 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

688
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Very few are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not their fault.</v>

689
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:06.580
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

690
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 4>they're studying all sorts of stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

691
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:13.471
<v Speaker 4>maybe there's an elective here or there </v>
<v Speaker 4>like one required course that they have </v>

692
00:30:13.471 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 4>to take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not really that school.</v>

693
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:18.430
<v Speaker 4>And in our system where we're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>grown and raised to believe that,</v>

694
00:30:18.431 --> 00:30:23.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doctor knows best and you go to the </v>

695
00:30:23.431 --> 00:30:24.480
<v Speaker 4>doctor and the doctor knows everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's kind of alarming and eyeopening</v>

696
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.980
<v Speaker 4>to realize that that's not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>the case.</v>

697
00:30:26.981 --> 00:30:28.420
<v Speaker 4>At least with respect to nutrition,</v>

698
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.080
<v Speaker 5>there should most certainly be a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

699
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.040
<v Speaker 5>a doctor of nutrition that you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a doctor who is a,</v>

700
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.610
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a full fledge Dr at the top of,</v>

701
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:43.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the information that's available </v>

702
00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.071
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's on top of all of it and his job is </v>

703
00:30:46.071 --> 00:30:49.251
<v Speaker 5>just to check your blood and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and give you a detailed writeup of </v>

704
00:30:49.251 --> 00:30:51.140
<v Speaker 5>what's wrong with you nutritionally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

705
00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:52.920
<v Speaker 5>So you don't have any [inaudible] in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your body.</v>

706
00:30:52.921 --> 00:30:54.360
<v Speaker 5>You don't have this in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have,</v>

707
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 5>you're missing nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know what,</v>

708
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.490
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is that he could show you </v>
<v Speaker 5>what your optimum levels of your various</v>

709
00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:00.870
<v Speaker 5>nutrients should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>

710
00:31:00.871 --> 00:31:03.900
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very few people you know,</v>

711
00:31:03.901 --> 00:31:05.430
<v Speaker 5>ever get that done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

712
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:10.490
<v Speaker 4>And they do exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that should be part of your </v>

713
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:10.490
<v Speaker 4>physical.</v>

714
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:10.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it shouldn't be.</v>

715
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:11.860
<v Speaker 5>It should be a regular thing because </v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

716
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:13.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talk about on the show all the time,</v>

717
00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:18.991
<v Speaker 5>how much it changed me when I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I started drinking Kale shakes in </v>

718
00:31:18.991 --> 00:31:21.220
<v Speaker 5>the morning and I'm not Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still a,</v>

719
00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:23.680
<v Speaker 5>I drink milk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still eat meat,</v>

720
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:29.610
<v Speaker 5>but in a massively increasing the amount</v>
<v Speaker 5>of plant nutrients I get into my body </v>

721
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:35.710
<v Speaker 5>and especially it seems like starting my</v>
<v Speaker 5>day with them that I,</v>

722
00:31:35.711 --> 00:31:40.711
<v Speaker 5>I usually I don't eat like right when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>wake up I like to exercise sometimes or </v>

723
00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:42.730
<v Speaker 5>just get up and do some stuff and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll eat.</v>

724
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.760
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my first meal is always really light.</v>

725
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.600
<v Speaker 5>It's always either some sort of a hemp </v>
<v Speaker 5>protein shake or it's this,</v>

726
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this a Kale shake thing that I have.</v>

727
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:57.360
<v Speaker 5>But the difference is the Kale shake </v>
<v Speaker 5>gives me this fucking steady energy.</v>

728
00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.500
<v Speaker 5>Like I can feel my body responding to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the nutrients.</v>

729
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:05.320
<v Speaker 5>Like you can literally feel it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no.</v>

730
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:09.490
<v Speaker 5>The only negative about it at all is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you have to ship more,</v>

731
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.760
<v Speaker 5>but that's just like cleaning out your </v>
<v Speaker 5>pipes and you actually look forward to </v>

732
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.320
<v Speaker 5>it because they're there are wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These poops or like a ride,</v>

733
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.980
<v Speaker 4>like you can feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can feel it in the way that you </v>

734
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.771
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you have that First Cup of </v>

735
00:32:26.771 --> 00:32:26.800
<v Speaker 4>coffee and you can feel your spine </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting tickled by the caffeine.</v>

736
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.300
<v Speaker 4>It's a similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a similar thing.</v>

737
00:32:29.301 --> 00:32:30.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it jacks you up.</v>

738
00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:35.261
<v Speaker 4>I could not live without the vitamix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's an amazing creation.</v>

739
00:32:35.671 --> 00:32:37.100
<v Speaker 4>We got to town,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we bring it with.</v>

740
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.930
<v Speaker 4>We'd like travel with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an animal which</v>

741
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.200
<v Speaker 6>are part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

742
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:47.260
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a heavy thing because it's </v>

743
00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:47.260
<v Speaker 6>expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

744
00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 6>And things like 500 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>450 bucks or whatever.</v>

745
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:54.551
<v Speaker 6>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a tough pill to swallow for a lot </v>

746
00:32:54.551 --> 00:32:54.551
<v Speaker 6>of people to tell them they ought to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>

747
00:32:54.551 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 6>but it's a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Once you have it,</v>

748
00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.600
<v Speaker 6>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't imagine not having it.</v>

749
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.970
<v Speaker 6>It's a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a beast.</v>

750
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:04.270
<v Speaker 6>That thing's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's such a great thing to stuff </v>

751
00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.320
<v Speaker 6>everything in there and plunge it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then just turn that bitch on.</v>

752
00:33:05.321 --> 00:33:06.730
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

753
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blended in avocado pit wants,</v>

754
00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.810
<v Speaker 6>drank it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

755
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.230
<v Speaker 6>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>While I had a bunch of other stuff.</v>

756
00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.990
<v Speaker 6>Is that good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But just wanted to see if I could do it.</v>

757
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.780
<v Speaker 6>That's how the condo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even the pip,</v>

758
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:25.790
<v Speaker 6>but that's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that the poison that's got like a </v>

759
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:26.080
<v Speaker 6>night traits in it or something crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>

760
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.830
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it has,</v>

761
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.630
<v Speaker 6>it has a front back to the future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking nuclear.</v>

762
00:33:31.631 --> 00:33:34.790
<v Speaker 6>It's like those sneakers that light up </v>
<v Speaker 6>when you step on them so that stuff.</v>

763
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:36.820
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't,</v>

764
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.680
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't recommend doing it all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

765
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:44.350
<v Speaker 6>I just wanted to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The point is that I couldn't believe </v>

766
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.850
<v Speaker 6>that it was so powerful that it could </v>
<v Speaker 6>get actually blend that into.</v>

767
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.800
<v Speaker 6>For folks who don't know what a vitamix </v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

768
00:33:47.801 --> 00:33:52.801
<v Speaker 6>it's essentially a really high powered </v>
<v Speaker 6>blender that's designed to make like </v>

769
00:33:52.801 --> 00:33:56.761
<v Speaker 6>vegetable smoothies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it also has like a top with a hole </v>

770
00:33:56.761 --> 00:34:00.271
<v Speaker 6>in it and you have like a plunger and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the plunger drops down to like right </v>

771
00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:04.471
<v Speaker 6>above the blade.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it shoves everything into the blades </v>

772
00:34:04.471 --> 00:34:04.471
<v Speaker 6>and matches.</v>

773
00:34:04.471 --> 00:34:05.800
<v Speaker 6>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It never breaks the fucking thing.</v>

774
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.260
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>indestructible.</v>

775
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.730
<v Speaker 6>It's like a World War II relic kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

776
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.180
<v Speaker 6>Even the design of it looks like it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>been around forever.</v>

777
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.320
<v Speaker 6>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

778
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.920
<v Speaker 6>I think I tweeted you this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you,</v>

779
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:19.090
<v Speaker 6>have you tried putting beets in there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

780
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have.</v>

781
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.040
<v Speaker 6>My recipe is so fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to mess with it too much.</v>

782
00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.460
<v Speaker 6>I meshed with it by chain beat stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sound good.</v>

783
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:32.470
<v Speaker 6>But I changed the pairs to a pineapple,</v>
<v Speaker 6>put like a half of Eden and the Beet </v>

784
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:33.900
<v Speaker 6>Greens because the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

785
00:34:33.901 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 6>the nitrites nitrites and nitrates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always get that wrong or whatever.</v>

786
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.530
<v Speaker 6>It's been shown to have significant </v>
<v Speaker 6>impact on,</v>

787
00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:47.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the efficiency of your oxygen </v>

788
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:47.610
<v Speaker 6>utilization.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it really,</v>

789
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:47.610
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's an,</v>

790
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.060
<v Speaker 6>it's a pretty significant like energy </v>
<v Speaker 6>booster.</v>

791
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:50.870
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

792
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:55.871
<v Speaker 6>So the Greens as well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the Greens in and then it'll turn </v>

793
00:34:55.871 --> 00:35:00.221
<v Speaker 6>everything read like even if you put a </v>
<v Speaker 6>tiny amount of bed and the whole shake </v>

794
00:35:00.221 --> 00:35:00.221
<v Speaker 6>will be read and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

795
00:35:00.221 --> 00:35:04.781
<v Speaker 6>you want to put some other stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 6>there because it has kind of a heavy </v>

796
00:35:04.781 --> 00:35:05.060
<v Speaker 6>taste but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you'll notice a difference.</v>

797
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.870
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

798
00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 6>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would definitely do that.</v>

799
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:09.330
<v Speaker 6>I'll try that shit tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The same way that um,</v>

800
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:14.380
<v Speaker 6>the quarter's eps work because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the quarter steps are so good at </v>

801
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.260
<v Speaker 6>boosting your oxygen uptake and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>efficiency of your oxygen utilization as</v>

802
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.240
<v Speaker 6>a similar effect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the quarter steps are crazy.</v>

803
00:35:20.241 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 6>Awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 6>amazing.</v>

804
00:35:21.021 --> 00:35:21.830
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

805
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:24.560
<v Speaker 6>Well that's what the main ingredient of </v>
<v Speaker 6>shroom tech sport is.</v>

806
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.910
<v Speaker 6>I take four of those before Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 6>glass and even if I'm,</v>

807
00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't been training recently like,</v>

808
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.390
<v Speaker 6>so it's amazing how much more energy you</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to make significant feeling of like</v>

809
00:35:35.391 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 6>an extra little boost that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you've</v>

810
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.980
<v Speaker 4>been training at altitude and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>come down to sea level like you feel </v>

811
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:42.980
<v Speaker 4>like you don't get winded,</v>

812
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't go into the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

813
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:49.851
<v Speaker 1>And people who have gone to altitudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've had to change attitudes </v>

814
00:35:49.851 --> 00:35:51.000
<v Speaker 1>rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like move up to boulder,</v>

815
00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 1>like real quick and that normally would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have issues with that.</v>

816
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:58.731
<v Speaker 1>They've found that if they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>cordyceps mushrooms it can can settle </v>

817
00:35:58.731 --> 00:36:00.570
<v Speaker 1>them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>settle them in quicker because for a lot</v>

818
00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:02.790
<v Speaker 1>of people that altitude sickness is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking joke.</v>

819
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I read this thing about babies being </v>
<v Speaker 1>born in Colorado that like a record </v>

820
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.080
<v Speaker 1>number of babies are born prematurely </v>
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

821
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.360
<v Speaker 1>in Colorado because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high altitude,</v>

822
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 1>but it totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a harder way to live.</v>

823
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:20.890
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is tougher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxygen Utilization is fucking </v>

824
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.950
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

825
00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:25.280
<v Speaker 1>It's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everything and it's in beats.</v>

826
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Beats Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>

827
00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.770
<v Speaker 1>She got some rhubarb while you're at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe also.</v>

828
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.250
<v Speaker 1>So you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do you miss meat at all?</v>

829
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you miss the smell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a neighbor who's </v>

830
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.760
<v Speaker 1>barbecuing and you had nightmares about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fogo de Chao.</v>

831
00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a human being,</v>

832
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.610
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

833
00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

834
00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:47.830
<v Speaker 4>I ate that stuff for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

835
00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:53.010
<v Speaker 4>I like the smell of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are certain you can people </v>

836
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.990
<v Speaker 4>that will say discuss them or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

837
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it does or whatever.</v>

838
00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:57.660
<v Speaker 4>But for me I smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It smell.</v>

839
00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.250
<v Speaker 4>That's my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smells good.</v>

840
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:02.630
<v Speaker 4>I drive by Jack in the box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that smells good and it's.</v>

841
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see that's,</v>

842
00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:09.220
<v Speaker 4>that's like my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I can't have a cheat day for </v>

843
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:09.220
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand.</v>

844
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.440
<v Speaker 1>So how did you get involved in endurance</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletics?</v>

845
00:37:12.441 --> 00:37:13.160
<v Speaker 1>What happened there?</v>

846
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:18.450
<v Speaker 4>It was another kind of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like organic thing that just evolved </v>

847
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:18.850
<v Speaker 4>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when I,</v>

848
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.290
<v Speaker 4>when I got on the plant based Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started exercising again,</v>

849
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:29.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mainly because I just had all this </v>

850
00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:29.110
<v Speaker 4>energy I had to burn off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't,</v>

851
00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.320
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have any designs on going back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to being an athlete or being competitive</v>

852
00:37:32.321 --> 00:37:37.321
<v Speaker 4>in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to lose a little weight </v>

853
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.260
<v Speaker 4>and I want it to be able to enjoy my </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids at their energy level,</v>

854
00:37:38.261 --> 00:37:39.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have four kids now,</v>

855
00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.930
<v Speaker 4>so it was really just about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

856
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.870
<v Speaker 4>connecting with that part of myself that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of lost touch with,</v>

857
00:37:46.871 --> 00:37:48.220
<v Speaker 4>but nothing crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

858
00:37:48.221 --> 00:37:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I would go to the pool and swim a couple</v>
<v Speaker 4>times a week and you know,</v>

859
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:56.640
<v Speaker 4>do a light jog here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife bought me a bike for my </v>

860
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:56.640
<v Speaker 4>birthday.</v>

861
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.900
<v Speaker 4>I'd never really ridden a bike before </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this was when I turned 40,</v>

862
00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 4>but then I had like a inexperience after</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd been doing this for maybe four </v>

863
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.820
<v Speaker 4>months or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really moderate exercise.</v>

864
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.110
<v Speaker 4>I went out for a morning run out at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

865
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where a mulholland drive,</v>

866
00:38:14.531 --> 00:38:19.531
<v Speaker 4>the dirt road part of it that dumps out </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the bottom of Topanga on the valley </v>

867
00:38:19.531 --> 00:38:19.531
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there,</v>

868
00:38:19.531 --> 00:38:21.310
<v Speaker 4>there's a trail that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can literally go like all the way to</v>

869
00:38:21.311 --> 00:38:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Brentwood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

870
00:38:22.151 --> 00:38:25.450
<v Speaker 4>Goes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just went out there one morning on</v>

871
00:38:25.451 --> 00:38:27.790
<v Speaker 4>a weekday for a morning run and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

872
00:38:27.791 --> 00:38:32.791
<v Speaker 4>you have those days and I'm sure you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have it in Jujitsu where you just feel </v>

873
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:33.370
<v Speaker 4>unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can just keep going forever.</v>

874
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 4>I just started running and I just felt </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing,</v>

875
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:41.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just kept going and going and say </v>

876
00:38:41.221 --> 00:38:41.221
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to be back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

877
00:38:41.221 --> 00:38:41.221
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going.</v>

878
00:38:41.221 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 4>I ended up running like the better part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a marathon,</v>

879
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:50.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I think 24 miles or something like </v>

880
00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:50.330
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that morning,</v>

881
00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.470
<v Speaker 4>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got back and I was like,</v>

882
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.960
<v Speaker 4>what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some forest gumption.</v>

883
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:55.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

884
00:38:55.981 --> 00:38:58.980
<v Speaker 4>it was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'd never been a runner,</v>

885
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:04.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like I had a background in </v>

886
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.010
<v Speaker 4>running or had any proficiency in it </v>
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>

887
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.340
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't like I was going fast that</v>
<v Speaker 4>day either,</v>

888
00:39:05.341 --> 00:39:10.341
<v Speaker 4>but it was just the idea that I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep going and I thought something's </v>

889
00:39:10.341 --> 00:39:10.341
<v Speaker 4>going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

890
00:39:10.341 --> 00:39:14.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know whether it's the nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 4>change or I've just unlocked some </v>

891
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.120
<v Speaker 4>dormant gene inside me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

892
00:39:15.121 --> 00:39:16.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this felt good,</v>

893
00:39:16.501 --> 00:39:17.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I was like,</v>

894
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:22.460
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to challenge myself and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>started looking for something to do and </v>

895
00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're 40 it's like,</v>

896
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bucket list item or what's the midlife</v>

897
00:39:26.371 --> 00:39:27.720
<v Speaker 4>crisis thing you want to do?</v>

898
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.720
<v Speaker 4>And started thinking about doing an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ironman because that's pretty typical </v>

899
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.960
<v Speaker 4>goal for a 40 year old guy who wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

900
00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.340
<v Speaker 4>conquer a mountain or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

901
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.410
<v Speaker 4>and started trading a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 4>and more.</v>

902
00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:42.540
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 4>triathlon.</v>

903
00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:45.030
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know anything about ironman or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything like that.</v>

904
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:50.540
<v Speaker 4>But I figured it seems like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those ironman races are like every </v>

905
00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:50.820
<v Speaker 4>weekend somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like tons of people are doing it.</v>

906
00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.670
<v Speaker 4>It can't be that hard to get in one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just pick a city and you know,</v>

907
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.380
<v Speaker 4>a ways out and trained for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Myself and I went on the website one day</v>

908
00:39:58.381 --> 00:39:59.910
<v Speaker 4>and realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>

909
00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:01.860
<v Speaker 4>they all sell out like a year ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

910
00:40:01.861 --> 00:40:03.530
<v Speaker 4>Like they're like youtube tickets like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

911
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.970
<v Speaker 4>after the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after one of those races the next day.</v>

912
00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.220
<v Speaker 4>And they just sell out like in a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>of hours.</v>

913
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 4>So I couldn't get into any of those.</v>

914
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

915
00:40:12.311 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

916
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:14.180
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

917
00:40:14.181 --> 00:40:19.181
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And nothing seemed to excite me and I </v>

918
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:19.510
<v Speaker 4>kind of lost my Mojo for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

919
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:22.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was at Jamba juice one morning,</v>

920
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:27.310
<v Speaker 4>like maybe a month after that experience</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting a juice and you know,</v>

921
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:28.250
<v Speaker 4>how they have those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

922
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:32.630
<v Speaker 4>like competitor magazines that you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>in like running shoe stores or whatever,</v>

923
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.290
<v Speaker 4>like running shoe reviews or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just laying around.</v>

924
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:36.790
<v Speaker 4>And I picked it up and started looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>

925
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.960
<v Speaker 4>And there was an article about this dude</v>
<v Speaker 4>named,</v>

926
00:40:39.961 --> 00:40:41.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>David Goggins,</v>

927
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 4>who is this bad ass navy seal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like guy had been like a football player</v>

928
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:48.340
<v Speaker 4>and a power lifter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like big strapping guy.</v>

929
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:53.370
<v Speaker 4>I think he was up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had weighed like 275 pounds at one </v>

930
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:54.560
<v Speaker 4>point and had seen some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

931
00:40:54.561 --> 00:40:56.200
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a navy seal.</v>

932
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.480
<v Speaker 4>And had lost a lot of friends in </v>
<v Speaker 4>inaction.</v>

933
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.200
<v Speaker 4>And he decided that he was going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was going to find the 10 most </v>

934
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.330
<v Speaker 4>difficult endurance races in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and do them all to raise money for.</v>

935
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.670
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't the wounded warriors </v>
<v Speaker 4>foundation,</v>

936
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:10.950
<v Speaker 4>but it was something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

937
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:11.800
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

938
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.940
<v Speaker 4>so that he could raise money for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>families of these,</v>

939
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.420
<v Speaker 4>these friends of his that had fallen and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had.</v>

940
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 4>He had just done this race called </v>
<v Speaker 4>Badwater,</v>

941
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:25.050
<v Speaker 4>which is 135 mile run through death </v>
<v Speaker 4>valley that goes up like Mount Whitney </v>

942
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.730
<v Speaker 4>at the end like this and it's like crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>hot,</v>

943
00:41:27.731 --> 00:41:31.210
<v Speaker 4>like 110,</v>
<v Speaker 4>120 degrees out in the desert and he had</v>

944
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:36.211
<v Speaker 4>just done really well in that and he had</v>
<v Speaker 4>never really done much endurance sports </v>

945
00:41:36.211 --> 00:41:40.901
<v Speaker 4>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you literally had fallen into it </v>

946
00:41:40.901 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 4>and he had just put in an incredible </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>

947
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.450
<v Speaker 4>And then like a month later he did this </v>
<v Speaker 4>race called ultra man,</v>

948
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:50.320
<v Speaker 4>which is this insane double ironman </v>
<v Speaker 4>distance race in Hawaii where over the </v>

949
00:41:50.451 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 4>course of three days you circumnavigate </v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire big island of Hawaii,</v>

950
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 4>which is like a big island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the size of Connecticut.</v>

951
00:41:57.321 --> 00:42:02.321
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was reading about this and it just </v>

952
00:42:02.321 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 4>seemed like such a cool event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it.</v>

953
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 4>Not only was it longer than iron man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I didn't think was possible.</v>

954
00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a broken up into stages.</v>

955
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:17.050
<v Speaker 4>So the first day is six point two mile </v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean swim followed by a 90 mile bike </v>

956
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.570
<v Speaker 4>and the last part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last 20 miles of that bike,</v>

957
00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 4>you go up to volcano national park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a 40,000</v>

958
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:28.751
<v Speaker 4>foot gain and the second day you ride </v>
<v Speaker 4>170 miles around the eastern side of the</v>

959
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:34.091
<v Speaker 4>island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like up through Hilo and you end up in </v>

960
00:42:34.091 --> 00:42:34.091
<v Speaker 4>this little town called Havi.</v>

961
00:42:34.091 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 4>On the third day you run 52 point four </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles,</v>

962
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.120
<v Speaker 4>double marathon from Havi back into Kona</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the race started.</v>

963
00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.090
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>

964
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 4>And it was cool because they limited it </v>
<v Speaker 4>to just 35,</v>

965
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 4>like invitation only competitors like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to apply to get into this race.</v>

966
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:57.630
<v Speaker 4>They don't close any of the roads and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was almost like this family affair.</v>

967
00:42:57.631 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 4>We have to bring your own crew and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of take care of you.</v>

968
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:05.471
<v Speaker 4>And feed you out of a van while you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing this race and the crews kind of </v>

969
00:43:05.471 --> 00:43:07.010
<v Speaker 4>help each other out and the competitors </v>
<v Speaker 4>help each other out.</v>

970
00:43:07.011 --> 00:43:08.000
<v Speaker 4>So it's a race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

971
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 4>it seemed almost like this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>spiritual odyssey,</v>

972
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:15.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this experiment in expansion,</v>

973
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more than a race.</v>

974
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.800
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was what I was looking for,</v>

975
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:23.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like I was looking for a race </v>

976
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.801
<v Speaker 4>to go see how fast I could go or how </v>
<v Speaker 4>many guys I could be like it resonated </v>

977
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:32.560
<v Speaker 4>with me because it seemed more like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to learn more about myself </v>

978
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 4>in a way that was unique.</v>

979
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:40.150
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was a like this crazy down the </v>

980
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.120
<v Speaker 4>rabbit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like spiritual adventure.</v>

981
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.920
<v Speaker 4>And so it just captivated me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

982
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:48.110
<v Speaker 4>it was one of those things where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

983
00:43:48.111 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 4>when you come across something and </v>
<v Speaker 4>something just clicks inside you and you</v>

984
00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:56.201
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's the direction you're </v>

985
00:43:56.201 --> 00:43:56.201
<v Speaker 4>supposed to go in or you're on the right</v>
<v Speaker 4>path.</v>

986
00:43:56.201 --> 00:43:56.201
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

987
00:43:56.201 --> 00:44:00.580
<v Speaker 4>maybe you've had that in stand up or at </v>
<v Speaker 4>some point in your life where you just </v>

988
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.370
<v Speaker 4>feel like you're directed in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

989
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:07.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where everything just kind of seems in </v>

990
00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:07.060
<v Speaker 4>alignment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

991
00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 4>I just knew I wasn't going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>race.</v>

992
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:12.371
<v Speaker 4>Like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know how and I hadn't done </v>

993
00:44:12.371 --> 00:44:13.700
<v Speaker 4>anything of note to Merritt getting into</v>
<v Speaker 4>it or anything like that.</v>

994
00:44:13.701 --> 00:44:16.160
<v Speaker 4>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to find a way to do that.</v>

995
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.590
<v Speaker 4>Like I've got to do that and I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop thinking about it.</v>

996
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:23.650
<v Speaker 4>And I ended up calling up the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a race director and it was some months </v>

997
00:44:24.771 --> 00:44:27.860
<v Speaker 4>before you could even send in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>application because I was like,</v>

998
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't stop thinking about it and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>needed to like just if she going to tell</v>

999
00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 4>me like there's no way I was getting in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I could at least put that to bed.</v>

1000
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.880
<v Speaker 4>So I just call her up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1001
00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.860
<v Speaker 4>I read about this race and I can't stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it and I'd really like to</v>

1002
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:41.430
<v Speaker 4>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1003
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:42.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm crazy because,</v>

1004
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:47.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I'm even calling you </v>

1005
00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:47.900
<v Speaker 4>because I haven't really done very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1006
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she said,</v>

1007
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:49.610
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have you done?</v>

1008
00:44:49.611 --> 00:44:52.080
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>done anything barely,</v>

1009
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:53.770
<v Speaker 4>barely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1010
00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:55.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm just getting back into being fit </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1011
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.330
<v Speaker 4>And she had every reason to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1012
00:44:57.331 --> 00:45:02.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you call me in a couple of </v>

1013
00:45:02.331 --> 00:45:02.331
<v Speaker 4>years and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1014
00:45:02.331 --> 00:45:02.331
<v Speaker 4>we'll see what you've done that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll let you into this race.</v>

1015
00:45:02.331 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 4>But she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1016
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1017
00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Speaker 4>it means a lot that you called early and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1018
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:12.350
<v Speaker 4>why don't you just touch base with me in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of months and we'll evaluate </v>

1019
00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:15.351
<v Speaker 4>your training and we'll go from there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she kinda like left the cracking the </v>

1020
00:45:15.351 --> 00:45:15.351
<v Speaker 4>door open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1021
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 4>So it was enough to like give me a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit of hope.</v>

1022
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:21.390
<v Speaker 4>Like the pilot light was lit a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit and I was like,</v>

1023
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get into that race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1024
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:24.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to find a way to get into that</v>
<v Speaker 4>race.</v>

1025
00:45:24.511 --> 00:45:27.150
<v Speaker 4>And I hired a coach and I started </v>
<v Speaker 4>training as if I was already in.</v>

1026
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:32.420
<v Speaker 4>This was back in early 2008 and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a long story,</v>

1027
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:37.761
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately she ended up relenting </v>
<v Speaker 4>and letting me in and I ended up doing </v>

1028
00:45:37.761 --> 00:45:39.810
<v Speaker 4>that race in 2008 and I hadn't done an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ironman before that.</v>

1029
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:43.530
<v Speaker 4>I tried to do a half ironman the year </v>
<v Speaker 4>before and I didn't even finish.</v>

1030
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1031
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:47.760
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't going in with some crazy like </v>
<v Speaker 4>endurance pedigree.</v>

1032
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.260
<v Speaker 4>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1033
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:52.080
<v Speaker 4>it was a cool experience though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I ended up doing pretty well in that</v>

1034
00:45:52.081 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 4>race.</v>

1035
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.490
<v Speaker 7>How well did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got 11th that year.</v>

1036
00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.460
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's amazing.</v>

1037
00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:01.740
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You couldn't finish and then a year </v>

1038
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.630
<v Speaker 7>later you get 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 7>11th in 2008.</v>

1039
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.360
<v Speaker 7>And then [inaudible] at that time really</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1040
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.810
<v Speaker 7>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1041
00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.080
<v Speaker 4>bad news bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had no idea what I was doing.</v>

1042
00:46:08.081 --> 00:46:13.081
<v Speaker 4>Like my dad came out to like help me </v>
<v Speaker 4>crew and a couple buddies from out here </v>

1043
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:15.610
<v Speaker 4>and none of us knew anything about </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything and I just wanted to finish,</v>

1044
00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just wanted to like not die.</v>

1045
00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:22.650
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I approached it like very </v>

1046
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:24.241
<v Speaker 4>conservatively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I ended up exceeding my </v>

1047
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:27.541
<v Speaker 4>expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought I wonder what would happen </v>

1048
00:46:27.541 --> 00:46:29.110
<v Speaker 4>if I spent a year like preparing to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and actually race it,</v>

1049
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:34.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than just trying to finish and </v>

1050
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:36.481
<v Speaker 4>kind of being timid about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for 2009 I trained my ass off and I </v>

1051
00:46:36.941 --> 00:46:41.320
<v Speaker 4>went back and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I ended up getting out.</v>

1052
00:46:41.321 --> 00:46:46.321
<v Speaker 4>I got out of the swim with a 10 minute </v>
<v Speaker 4>lead on the next guy and then I held </v>

1053
00:46:46.321 --> 00:46:48.790
<v Speaker 4>that lead for the rest of that day </v>
<v Speaker 4>through that 90 mile bike.</v>

1054
00:46:48.791 --> 00:46:51.020
<v Speaker 4>So I finished the first day with a 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minute lead on,</v>

1055
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:51.790
<v Speaker 4>on the field.</v>

1056
00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:52.920
<v Speaker 7>Ten minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.710
<v Speaker 7>Hugely going into detail.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that was a race car though.</v>

1058
00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.310
<v Speaker 7>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He must have thought I was crazy because</v>

1059
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.560
<v Speaker 7>I didn't see anyone else all day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1060
00:47:02.561 --> 00:47:03.850
<v Speaker 7>like as I was out in front</v>

1061
00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.420
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife and my kids were crewing me </v>

1062
00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.781
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was having to kind of like tell </v>

1063
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:15.301
<v Speaker 4>them what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were great but it wasn't like </v>

1064
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:15.301
<v Speaker 4>they had experienced</v>

1065
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:16.120
<v Speaker 7>anything like this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which made me very nervous.</v>

1066
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.770
<v Speaker 7>So what is a crew person that I do well </v>
<v Speaker 7>there in,</v>

1067
00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 7>each competitor has to bring a van and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that van is filled with like all your </v>

1068
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:28.711
<v Speaker 7>shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you gotta have all your food that </v>

1069
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:28.711
<v Speaker 7>you're gonna eat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like while you're racing and then,</v>

1070
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:30.060
<v Speaker 7>and then afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you</v>

1071
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ice for ice baths afterwards and they're</v>

1072
00:47:33.161 --> 00:47:35.400
<v Speaker 4>filling your bottles and feeding them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding,</v>

1073
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.590
<v Speaker 4>bu they kind of leapfrog you in park and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you do bottle handoff.</v>

1074
00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.560
<v Speaker 4>So you always have nutrition on the bike</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1075
00:47:41.561 --> 00:47:43.450
<v Speaker 4>and they keep you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make sure you don't take any wrong.</v>

1076
00:47:43.451 --> 00:47:48.451
<v Speaker 4>Turns like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're in charge of navigating and </v>

1077
00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:48.451
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1078
00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:49.360
<v Speaker 4>and if you have anything mechanically </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes wrong with your bike or whatever,</v>

1079
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.830
<v Speaker 4>extra parts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1080
00:47:50.831 --> 00:47:53.410
<v Speaker 4>and it's filled with all your clothes </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're going around the island,</v>

1081
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 4>you're not going back to where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>started that day.</v>

1082
00:47:55.781 --> 00:47:57.520
<v Speaker 4>You're going to stay in a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>place each night,</v>

1083
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 4>so you have to have all your stuff with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1084
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:03.040
<v Speaker 4>So these vans are like packed from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Florida ceiling with stuff.</v>

1085
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would've never thought that much </v>

1086
00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:08.460
<v Speaker 4>involved in racing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:08.460
<v Speaker 4>Logistically it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1088
00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:09.070
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1089
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.830
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot that goes into it to pull </v>
<v Speaker 4>it off and everything.</v>

1090
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.980
<v Speaker 4>Now is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does everybody know how to apply </v>

1091
00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.330
<v Speaker 4>nutrition to these races?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it like a consensus or do some people</v>

1092
00:48:19.331 --> 00:48:24.331
<v Speaker 4>try to do them without eating?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you can do it without </v>

1093
00:48:24.331 --> 00:48:24.331
<v Speaker 4>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you got along the way.</v>

1094
00:48:24.331 --> 00:48:28.920
<v Speaker 4>You got to be taking in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the consensus is you got to take </v>

1095
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.501
<v Speaker 4>in about two to 300 calories an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's stomachs different and the </v>

1096
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:36.601
<v Speaker 4>intensity with which you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going will depend upon how well </v>

1097
00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:40.741
<v Speaker 4>you can digest the food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're on the rivet and going </v>

1098
00:48:40.741 --> 00:48:43.681
<v Speaker 4>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be harder to digest calories </v>

1099
00:48:43.681 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 4>and the kind of calories become more </v>
<v Speaker 4>important because you can't,</v>

1100
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna be able to eat solid </v>
<v Speaker 4>food if you're hammering,</v>

1101
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.600
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

1102
00:48:49.601 --> 00:48:51.490
<v Speaker 4>what do you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do eat fruits.</v>

1103
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 4>So I eat what I eat is probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>different than,</v>

1104
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:56.320
<v Speaker 4>than certain other.</v>

1105
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.120
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has their own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1106
00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:04.020
<v Speaker 4>I like to stay away from the shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of endurance athletes run or </v>

1107
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:04.020
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1108
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.860
<v Speaker 4>usually kind of Gatorade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>econ of stuff like cytomax and the,</v>

1109
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.250
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that real high sugar stuff.</v>

1110
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:14.640
<v Speaker 4>But when you're going all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're going to be out on a </v>

1111
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.340
<v Speaker 4>racecourse for eight or nine hours and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you've got to do it the next day.</v>

1112
00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 4>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your system can't handle that.</v>

1113
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:22.381
<v Speaker 4>So I try to eat a more like a lower </v>
<v Speaker 4>glycaemic higher carbohydrate,</v>

1114
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.170
<v Speaker 4>a fuel source.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have this stuff called par carbo</v>

1115
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:30.430
<v Speaker 4>pro or something called perpetuum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like Maltodextrin powders.</v>

1116
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:35.730
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a like a low-glycemic kind of </v>

1117
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:35.730
<v Speaker 4>carpet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>complex carbohydrate fuel source.</v>

1118
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.860
<v Speaker 4>And you can put like 900 calories in one</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottle and you can kind of sip off that.</v>

1119
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:42.670
<v Speaker 4>It's like pancake batter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taste terrible.</v>

1120
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.650
<v Speaker 4>But I'll eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll eat bananas.</v>

1121
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:47.680
<v Speaker 4>I'll put like a lightly baked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yams are good.</v>

1122
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Dates are good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then how come only lightly baked.</v>

1123
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:56.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if they're overcooked that like </v>

1124
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.510
<v Speaker 4>fries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the nutrition out of them.</v>

1125
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:59.530
<v Speaker 4>But you want a soft enough like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're almost like you can squeeze them</v>

1126
00:49:59.531 --> 00:50:04.531
<v Speaker 4>into your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are easy to digest when you're riding a </v>

1127
00:50:04.531 --> 00:50:04.531
<v Speaker 4>bike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1128
00:50:04.531 --> 00:50:04.531
<v Speaker 4>And they have most of the nutrition in </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1129
00:50:04.531 --> 00:50:06.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're great for nutrition.</v>

1130
00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

1131
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.970
<v Speaker 4>what is it the kills in determining if </v>
<v Speaker 4>it breaks down the tissue like that?</v>

1132
00:50:09.971 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 4>How come it doesn't kill the nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it makes it all soft and mushy?</v>

1133
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:14.210
<v Speaker 4>Well you just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

1134
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:19.230
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you like completely fry it and </v>

1135
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.360
<v Speaker 4>overcook it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes like a dead thing.</v>

1136
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:22.650
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they know exactly what temperature it</v>

1137
00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.420
<v Speaker 4>down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1138
00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:27.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean somebody probably does so don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always wondered about like cooking,</v>

1139
00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

1140
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:29.450
<v Speaker 6>killing vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like at when,</v>

1141
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.790
<v Speaker 6>like they say if you lightly sauteed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're okay.</v>

1142
00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you sure you know?</v>

1143
00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.760
<v Speaker 6>At what level does it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it really that bad to eat them raw </v>

1144
00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 6>that we have to fucking jazz everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>up with,</v>

1145
00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.130
<v Speaker 6>with fire and hot metal?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1146
00:50:42.131 --> 00:50:42.970
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1147
00:50:42.971 --> 00:50:44.630
<v Speaker 6>we're the only animals that cook our </v>
<v Speaker 6>food,</v>

1148
00:50:44.631 --> 00:50:47.230
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're also the only animals with tvs are</v>

1149
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:52.240
<v Speaker 6>the only animals that drive cars were </v>
<v Speaker 6>the only owls that talk to each other.</v>

1150
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.510
<v Speaker 6>Disagree with how good shit tastes when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you cook it.</v>

1151
00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:01.040
<v Speaker 6>We talked to each other dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking shit.</v>

1152
00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:06.041
<v Speaker 6>Taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When he could have hit that is the </v>

1153
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:06.041
<v Speaker 6>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It does taste better.</v>

1154
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:06.041
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like um,</v>

1155
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:10.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's even vegetable dishes that are </v>

1156
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.510
<v Speaker 6>absolutely delicious because they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>cooked,</v>

1157
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:14.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's just not as good for your </v>

1158
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:14.620
<v Speaker 6>body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1159
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:19.241
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems like there's differing schools </v>

1160
00:51:19.241 --> 00:51:19.241
<v Speaker 6>of thought on that.</v>

1161
00:51:19.241 --> 00:51:19.460
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that,</v>

1162
00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have the really hardcore raw is they</v>

1163
00:51:21.621 --> 00:51:23.930
<v Speaker 6>would just eat everything raw and </v>
<v Speaker 6>certainly I think it's,</v>

1164
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.110
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's great to eat lots of raw foods.</v>

1165
00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:28.070
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the raw foods you put in your,</v>

1166
00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 6>in your vitamix or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I eat a lot of raw foods,</v>

1167
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 6>but I still eat cooked foods,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1168
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:34.710
<v Speaker 6>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to have me a little cook food just</v>

1169
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:36.950
<v Speaker 6>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the feeling of it.</v>

1170
00:51:36.951 --> 00:51:37.970
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Comfort food.</v>

1171
00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you eat pastas at all?</v>

1172
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:44.570
<v Speaker 6>I'll eat brown rice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pasta,</v>

1173
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:48.000
<v Speaker 6>like the gluten free kind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The cql u of M is eat Kale.</v>

1174
00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:49.760
<v Speaker 6>Zucchini bread too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:50.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.730
<v Speaker 6>I mean I try not to overdo it on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>pasta.</v>

1177
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.140
<v Speaker 6>I'm usually have more like brown rice </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff instead.</v>

1178
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.250
<v Speaker 6>Brown rice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>steamed veggies,</v>

1179
00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.000
<v Speaker 6>sauteed and top it off with the Coca </v>
<v Speaker 6>Cola or perhaps a Pepsi Cola.</v>

1180
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:03.740
<v Speaker 6>Red Bull.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Red Bull.</v>

1181
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:06.010
<v Speaker 6>Do you take any caffeine?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do,</v>

1182
00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:07.000
<v Speaker 6>what are you thoughts on that?</v>

1183
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.920
<v Speaker 6>I've gone back and forth on caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

1184
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:14.180
<v Speaker 6>I've gone periods without it and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've used it as well.</v>

1185
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:15.830
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that,</v>

1186
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:16.930
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1187
00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:21.940
<v Speaker 6>when you're using it compulsively and </v>
<v Speaker 6>addictively it's not a good thing and </v>

1188
00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:22.940
<v Speaker 6>fries your adrenals and makes you tired </v>
<v Speaker 6>ultimately.</v>

1189
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:28.240
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a cup of coffee in the morning </v>

1190
00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:28.240
<v Speaker 6>is not the worst thing is particularly </v>
<v Speaker 6>for an athlete.</v>

1191
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:30.320
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's definitely a performance </v>
<v Speaker 6>enhancer,</v>

1192
00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:32.540
<v Speaker 6>like if I'm going out for a long bike </v>
<v Speaker 6>ride,</v>

1193
00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:38.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a nice little strong cup of coffee </v>

1194
00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.901
<v Speaker 6>before my ride.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Definitely I can definitely feel the </v>

1195
00:52:40.901 --> 00:52:40.901
<v Speaker 6>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

1196
00:52:40.901 --> 00:52:40.901
<v Speaker 6>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1197
00:52:40.901 --> 00:52:42.920
<v Speaker 6>you can't be just hammering coffee all </v>
<v Speaker 6>day long.</v>

1198
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 6>I like a Nice Cup of coffee before a </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast and a Nice Cup of coffee before </v>

1199
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like to get a little bit.</v>

1200
00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 6>It's really a crutch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is,</v>

1201
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 6>it is this week,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I've gone periods when I,</v>

1202
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:58.400
<v Speaker 6>when I don't drink coffee at all and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>feel fine and you know,</v>

1203
00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:00.680
<v Speaker 6>mental lapse back into drinking it from </v>
<v Speaker 6>time to time.</v>

1204
00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.700
<v Speaker 6>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1205
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:04.340
<v Speaker 6>during periods of heavy writing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1206
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:07.220
<v Speaker 6>I will drink a lot of fucking coughing </v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

1207
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:10.990
<v Speaker 6>I had one day where I was working on </v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1208
00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:16.050
<v Speaker 6>this piece and I was up til like 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the morning just just wired with </v>

1209
00:53:16.311 --> 00:53:21.311
<v Speaker 6>coffee and then the next day I tried no </v>
<v Speaker 6>coffee and boy was that a trip?</v>

1210
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:24.200
<v Speaker 6>Like I had a headache all day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like my body was like,</v>

1211
00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's just a cup of coffee.</v>

1212
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:29.940
<v Speaker 5>Let's just feed the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The demon given a little.</v>

1213
00:53:29.941 --> 00:53:31.480
<v Speaker 5>It's like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to be careful.</v>

1214
00:53:31.481 --> 00:53:33.730
<v Speaker 5>Like this is how you get addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful drug.</v>

1215
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 5>And I was setting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was setting the stage for addiction.</v>

1216
00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:39.600
<v Speaker 5>I was like also I had a headache.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I didn't,</v>

1217
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.720
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to not have the caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1218
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:47.950
<v Speaker 5>so just was taking too much and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>over a course of a few days where I was </v>

1219
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:51.780
<v Speaker 5>like really hitting it hard writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be careful because fucking I</v>

1220
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:53.430
<v Speaker 5>had headaches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had withdrawals,</v>

1221
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:57.990
<v Speaker 5>but I found that a really strenuous </v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise.</v>

1222
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:02.310
<v Speaker 5>Like if I have anything wrong with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I have a jet lag,</v>

1223
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:07.460
<v Speaker 5>if I'm a little out of it from landing </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere and I can't shake the cobwebs </v>

1224
00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.100
<v Speaker 5>loose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just really intense,</v>

1225
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:11.290
<v Speaker 5>strenuous exercise just seems to reset </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing.</v>

1226
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:13.560
<v Speaker 5>Snaps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wrote back snaps you right back.</v>

1227
00:54:13.561 --> 00:54:18.561
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really feel bad for people who don't </v>

1228
00:54:18.561 --> 00:54:19.710
<v Speaker 5>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who tried to travel a lot because I hear</v>

1229
00:54:19.711 --> 00:54:23.220
<v Speaker 5>people tell me that they're fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 5>for like two weeks and they're like,</v>

1230
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:24.840
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been traveling</v>

1231
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:26.690
<v Speaker 4>a lot lately and that's the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1232
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:29.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't sleep great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And hotel rooms and just,</v>

1233
00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:31.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that first night in a new environment or</v>

1234
00:54:31.061 --> 00:54:33.280
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always a little off and you know,</v>

1235
00:54:33.281 --> 00:54:36.450
<v Speaker 4>the first thing when I get there just </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to work out or whatever.</v>

1236
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.350
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly what it is.</v>

1237
00:54:38.351 --> 00:54:40.360
<v Speaker 4>You got to wipe the slate clean and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

1238
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.050
<v Speaker 4>it really helps with the jet lag and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep and acclimating and everything.</v>

1239
00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:44.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

1240
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:46.830
<v Speaker 5>And it's one of those things we just got</v>
<v Speaker 5>to start it,</v>

1241
00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.950
<v Speaker 5>just get it going and then once you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>it going,</v>

1242
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.920
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of takes care of itself and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in the middle of it.</v>

1243
00:54:50.921 --> 00:54:55.921
<v Speaker 5>It feels great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like that first step of doing </v>

1244
00:54:55.921 --> 00:54:56.710
<v Speaker 5>that first squat during that first </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

1245
00:54:56.711 --> 00:54:57.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1246
00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:00.310
<v Speaker 5>come on now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you can overcome that,</v>

1247
00:55:00.311 --> 00:55:05.311
<v Speaker 5>it gives you that feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like lately I've got a lot of shit done </v>

1248
00:55:05.311 --> 00:55:07.660
<v Speaker 5>that I wanted to get done and I got this</v>
<v Speaker 5>great feeling because of that,</v>

1249
00:55:07.661 --> 00:55:09.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got a lot like momentum,</v>

1250
00:55:09.611 --> 00:55:14.611
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever I feel like that I'm </v>

1251
00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:14.740
<v Speaker 5>accomplishing things that I wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1252
00:55:14.741 --> 00:55:15.640
<v Speaker 5>do like a I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1253
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:18.190
<v Speaker 5>I set out to do x today and I got it all</v>
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

1254
00:55:18.191 --> 00:55:19.090
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

1255
00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:24.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next day I feel like a little more </v>

1256
00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:24.310
<v Speaker 5>charged up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I've gotten,</v>

1257
00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:25.330
<v Speaker 5>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing what I'm trying to get done.</v>

1258
00:55:25.331 --> 00:55:26.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting it done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm feeling great about it.</v>

1259
00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.850
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of people I think don't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1260
00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.580
<v Speaker 5>They don't build that momentum enough in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their life.</v>

1261
00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:35.500
<v Speaker 5>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pick a few goals,</v>

1262
00:55:35.501 --> 00:55:37.600
<v Speaker 5>lock onto them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go with it,</v>

1263
00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.850
<v Speaker 5>and then let it build up to something </v>
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>

1264
00:55:39.851 --> 00:55:42.130
<v Speaker 5>Let it build up to more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let it build up to the next thing.</v>

1265
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.620
<v Speaker 5>And also I think that there's this weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing</v>

1266
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:49.630
<v Speaker 4>equation with exercise because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>easy to say you don't have time or busy </v>

1267
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:50.750
<v Speaker 4>or whatever and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go through that a lot and,</v>

1268
00:55:50.751 --> 00:55:54.050
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's easy to justify not doing it,</v>

1269
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:58.670
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately when I just quiet that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought and do it anyway,</v>

1270
00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:03.910
<v Speaker 4>I ended up getting more done and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that I needed to get done </v>

1271
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920
<v Speaker 4>ends up getting done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if I don't do it,</v>

1272
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:07.520
<v Speaker 4>I ended up wasting time and I'm less </v>
<v Speaker 4>productive and I'm not thinking clearly.</v>

1273
00:56:07.521 --> 00:56:10.340
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of like down wasted </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1274
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.120
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody has a different sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of biology and uh,</v>

1275
00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:16.990
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know this for sure.</v>

1276
00:56:16.991 --> 00:56:20.830
<v Speaker 5>People have different needs so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>say that everybody needs it,</v>

1277
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think it benefits,</v>

1278
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.970
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know that everybody needs </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1279
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:27.400
<v Speaker 5>but I certainly know that I need it when</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have it.</v>

1280
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 5>It makes a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like the way I feel.</v>

1281
00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:35.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't like to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like getting annoyed at things </v>

1282
00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:37.201
<v Speaker 5>too easily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like this weird testosterone </v>

1283
00:56:37.201 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 5>buildup that happens after a few days of</v>
<v Speaker 5>not exploding on something,</v>

1284
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:43.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like my body's become most </v>

1285
00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.871
<v Speaker 5>certainly addicted to that release and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it knows that it can navigate social </v>

1286
00:56:45.871 --> 00:56:50.791
<v Speaker 5>water's better when it's just totally </v>
<v Speaker 5>drained of all the Monkey Dna,</v>

1287
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I don't get that out at the gym,</v>

1288
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel like I'm as nice a person.</v>

1289
00:56:55.100 --> 00:57:00.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel like I'm as balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My wife will just kick me out of the </v>

1290
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.451
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He needed to go ride your bike or do </v>

1291
00:57:03.451 --> 00:57:03.451
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't come back until you do.</v>

1292
00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.970
<v Speaker 5>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a crazy gym in my house.</v>

1293
00:57:06.971 --> 00:57:11.971
<v Speaker 5>It's in the garage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like half of the garage was done for a </v>

1294
00:57:11.971 --> 00:57:12.770
<v Speaker 5>company called Garage Mahal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1295
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 5>So my garage has set up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got mats.</v>

1296
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:17.050
<v Speaker 5>I've got a grappling dummy that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>strangle.</v>

1297
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:22.100
<v Speaker 5>I like to Jujitsu on a dummy and I have </v>
<v Speaker 5>a kickboxing bags and ropes to climb so </v>

1298
00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.220
<v Speaker 5>I never have to go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's always right there.</v>

1299
00:57:24.221 --> 00:57:29.221
<v Speaker 5>So there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That cuts out a lot of the fucking </v>

1300
00:57:29.221 --> 00:57:30.430
<v Speaker 5>bullshit and procrastination with a 20 </v>
<v Speaker 5>minute ride to the gym.</v>

1301
00:57:30.431 --> 00:57:35.431
<v Speaker 5>And then I only have 40 minutes to work </v>
<v Speaker 5>out because if I just took a nap right </v>

1302
00:57:35.431 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I would perform better tonight and</v>

1303
00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:39.130
<v Speaker 5>they can just do some working out at </v>
<v Speaker 5>home tonight.</v>

1304
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.350
<v Speaker 5>I haven't been in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>

1305
00:57:41.351 --> 00:57:43.570
<v Speaker 5>it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ability to just go outside.</v>

1306
00:57:43.571 --> 00:57:46.090
<v Speaker 5>And even when I was broke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always had a heavy bag,</v>

1307
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:51.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tied something to the rafters in the </v>

1308
00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:51.120
<v Speaker 5>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1309
00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.990
<v Speaker 5>having something like that is to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>having just a place where you can lease,</v>

1310
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.020
<v Speaker 5>release it's some way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know,</v>

1311
00:57:57.070 --> 00:58:02.070
<v Speaker 5>get that fucking blow out in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So important for maximizing sanity.</v>

1312
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.330
<v Speaker 5>I need it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1313
00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:05.890
<v Speaker 5>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people don't need it.</v>

1314
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:07.740
<v Speaker 5>I just sneezed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1315
00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:09.130
<v Speaker 5>Brian's fine without it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

1316
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:14.380
<v Speaker 5>it's not even an angry guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1317
00:58:14.381 --> 00:58:15.250
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1318
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:16.500
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

1319
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.390
<v Speaker 5>it's a great benefit to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People can get through life without that</v>

1320
00:58:19.391 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 5>benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just silly,</v>

1321
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.420
<v Speaker 5>silly to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I tell him.</v>

1322
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:23.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're silly.</v>

1323
00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:29.010
<v Speaker 5>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he got really skinny at one point in </v>

1324
00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:30.781
<v Speaker 5>time though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian was like way fat at one point in </v>

1325
00:58:30.781 --> 00:58:33.661
<v Speaker 5>time and then he went crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>weightwatchers and he shrunk down to </v>

1326
00:58:33.671 --> 00:58:36.190
<v Speaker 5>like a tiny man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Strange.</v>

1327
00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you at now?</v>

1328
00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about halfway back to what I used </v>

1329
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.380
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now it's more just a.</v>

1330
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I eat barely little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I eat only at like nine or 10:00</v>

1331
00:58:50.021 --> 00:58:55.021
<v Speaker 2>at night until I go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not like I eat crazy bad.</v>

1332
00:58:55.300 --> 00:59:00.300
<v Speaker 2>It's more like I'll go home and eat lean</v>
<v Speaker 2>pockets in a salad or something and they</v>

1333
00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:05.290
<v Speaker 2>don't eat until nine at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally known any food all day and</v>

1334
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:07.240
<v Speaker 2>it's mostly because of starbucks.</v>

1335
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:14.150
<v Speaker 5>That's double shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gets Trenta double shots,</v>

1336
00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.050
<v Speaker 5>which is basically cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just cancer in a liquid form.</v>

1337
00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:18.310
<v Speaker 5>Go</v>

1338
00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:19.630
<v Speaker 2>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day.</v>

1339
00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:22.020
<v Speaker 2>And then you hit the lean pockets at and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

1340
00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:23.440
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's fucking super good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're on the right track.</v>

1342
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:30.800
<v Speaker 4>So here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a,</v>

1343
00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.660

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you got really what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the lightest you got?</v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1347
00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:48.450
<v Speaker 4>You don't think this mother fucker </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to hear about Rick Rolling </v>

1348
00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:50.420
<v Speaker 4>when you name is rich roll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How annoying is that everyday,</v>

1349
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So fucking day.</v>

1350
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:54.950
<v Speaker 4>That's so rude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it came out of nowhere too.</v>

1351
00:59:54.951 --> 00:59:57.920
<v Speaker 4>You lived most of your life without a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without a rick roll.</v>

1352
00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.830
<v Speaker 4>And then all the sudden this one fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>song.</v>

1353
01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:03.830
<v Speaker 4>The Internet is so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Bane of my existence,</v>

1354
01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny too.</v>

1355
01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1356
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this rapper Nipsey Hussle,</v>

1357
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:12.230
<v Speaker 4>Nipsey Hussle and he has a song called </v>
<v Speaker 4>rich roll,</v>

1358
01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

1359
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.160
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1360
01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 4>it's all about the rich roll and the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so my twitter feed fills up with all</v>

1361
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:23.501
<v Speaker 4>this crazy insanity from people re </v>
<v Speaker 4>tweeting the song that I guess it's a </v>

1362
01:00:23.501 --> 01:00:23.501
<v Speaker 4>pretty popular song.</v>

1363
01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:24.930
<v Speaker 4>And so I have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1364
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:28.460
<v Speaker 4>like I'm getting confused with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should embrace it.</v>

1365
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 4>You should go like the opposite of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rick Ross did.</v>

1366
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.810
<v Speaker 4>You should do a music video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should claim the real rich roll son,</v>

1367
01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1368
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe you can like hip hop </v>
<v Speaker 4>people into being vegans.</v>

1369
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:44.390
<v Speaker 4>It's so close to being to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to Rick Ross too,</v>

1370
01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.270
<v Speaker 4>so it's all confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

1371
01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:46.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1372
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.320
<v Speaker 4>it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right next door.</v>

1373
01:00:48.321 --> 01:00:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Neighbors just by a lot of trench coats </v>
<v Speaker 4>or you'll be good.</v>

1374
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1375
01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.990
<v Speaker 4>fuck around with probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you?</v>

1376
01:00:53.991 --> 01:00:54.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1377
01:00:54.731 --> 01:00:55.940
<v Speaker 4>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1378
01:00:55.941 --> 01:01:00.941
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some pretty good like plant </v>

1379
01:01:00.941 --> 01:01:00.941
<v Speaker 4>based ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this,</v>

1380
01:01:00.941 --> 01:01:04.730
<v Speaker 4>a nutrition guru,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my buddy compton rom,</v>

1381
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:07.220
<v Speaker 4>he's got a name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his name is Compton Rom.</v>

1382
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:12.250
<v Speaker 4>You should actually playing on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would make an incredible guest like </v>

1383
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.040
<v Speaker 4>blow your mind.</v>

1384
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.140
<v Speaker 4>You can come watch videos of him on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Youtube.</v>

1385
01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:17.530
<v Speaker 4>You've talked about some crazy stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1386
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.910
<v Speaker 4>Just like the energy of food and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>super into like he said,</v>

1387
01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:26.911
<v Speaker 4>he has a phd in microbiology and so he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>helped me a lot with like my nutrition </v>

1388
01:01:26.911 --> 01:01:31.460
<v Speaker 4>and spent a little bit of a mentor and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a startup company called </v>

1389
01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.481
<v Speaker 4>ascended health and he's all about </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to find the best superfoods all </v>

1390
01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:37.460
<v Speaker 4>over the world and provide them to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to customers.</v>

1391
01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:40.750
<v Speaker 4>And he's traveling all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to like Thailand,</v>

1392
01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:45.770
<v Speaker 4>all these crazy places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trying to find places where he can grow </v>

1393
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:48.641
<v Speaker 4>this stuff and so I would go to his </v>
<v Speaker 4>house and his house look like in his </v>

1394
01:01:48.641 --> 01:01:49.310
<v Speaker 4>kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like a,</v>

1395
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:54.340
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a giant meth labs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got all these tubes everywhere and </v>

1396
01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:54.340
<v Speaker 4>all this crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1397
01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:54.380
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta try this.</v>

1398
01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.280
<v Speaker 4>I just got this reservoir trollin from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's from the finest Bordeaux grapes,</v>

1399
01:01:58.281 --> 01:01:59.840
<v Speaker 4>Scans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stuff's amazing.</v>

1400
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:01.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make up A.</v>

1401
01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:02.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make some powder for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

1402
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:06.860
<v Speaker 4>he's always trying to like help me with </v>
<v Speaker 4>my like training and racing nutrition by</v>

1403
01:02:06.861 --> 01:02:11.180
<v Speaker 4>giving me some of this crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so his whole thing is,</v>

1404
01:02:11.181 --> 01:02:16.181
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's super knowledgeable about </v>

1405
01:02:16.181 --> 01:02:17.470
<v Speaker 4>probiotics and microbes because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>studied microbes and like,</v>

1406
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:22.930
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the Gi tract microbial activity </v>

1407
01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 4>forever and ever and knows more about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>than anyone I've ever met.</v>

1408
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:29.280
<v Speaker 4>And it's fascinating because I talk a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit about this in my book too,</v>

1409
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:31.600
<v Speaker 4>that we think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1410
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:33.660
<v Speaker 4>we're made up of trillions of cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1411
01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:38.661
<v Speaker 4>And we think we're these sentient beings</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we have control over what we think </v>

1412
01:02:38.661 --> 01:02:39.270
<v Speaker 4>and our decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all of that,</v>

1413
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.260
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time we have to realize </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're,</v>

1414
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:48.320
<v Speaker 4>we have like 10 times the number of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>cells and microbes in our gut alone,</v>

1415
01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:52.540
<v Speaker 4>like our microbial ecology in our Gi </v>
<v Speaker 4>tract has like,</v>

1416
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:57.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 times the number of microorganisms </v>

1417
01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:01.850
<v Speaker 4>compared to all of our cells in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire body and there's been these </v>

1418
01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:05.211
<v Speaker 4>studies that have come out and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to come out where they're </v>

1419
01:03:05.211 --> 01:03:05.340
<v Speaker 4>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1420
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:10.790
<v Speaker 4>the extent to which your microbial </v>
<v Speaker 4>ecology in your gut can trigger your </v>

1421
01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:15.240
<v Speaker 4>nervous system and actually impulse you </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a decision making way.</v>

1422
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:20.570
<v Speaker 4>And they've discovered like links </v>
<v Speaker 4>between what kind of microbial ecology </v>

1423
01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 4>do you have in your gut and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>foods that you crave.</v>

1424
01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:24.930
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:25.470
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1426
01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:30.550
<v Speaker 4>and so like having like probiotics are </v>
<v Speaker 4>all about improving the health of your,</v>

1427
01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:32.280
<v Speaker 4>your flora in your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1428
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:37.650
<v Speaker 4>And if you have healthy flora it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it craves and feeds on healthy foods.</v>

1429
01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:42.651
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you go to Jack in the box every </v>

1430
01:03:42.651 --> 01:03:43.410
<v Speaker 4>day or you eat lean pockets every night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to have,</v>

1431
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:47.010
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna have like a different kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of microbial ecology,</v>

1432
01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:50.610
<v Speaker 4>like the microbes that are in that food </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts to propagate in your gut and that</v>

1433
01:03:50.611 --> 01:03:55.611
<v Speaker 4>takes over and that becomes the ecology </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're realizing that that ecology </v>

1434
01:03:55.611 --> 01:03:58.410
<v Speaker 4>then sends signals to your brain that </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you crave more of those foods.</v>

1435
01:03:58.411 --> 01:04:01.050
<v Speaker 4>So it's that craving cycle that I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about earlier.</v>

1436
01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.170
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy and it sounds insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then I was thinking about that.</v>

1437
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:07.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you saw,</v>

1438
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.690
<v Speaker 4>remember I'm the documentary super size </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1439
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.950
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1440
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:13.890
<v Speaker 4>so Morgan spurlock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he first starts out,</v>

1441
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.530
<v Speaker 4>remember he's like getting sick when </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's eating McDonald's.</v>

1442
01:04:16.531 --> 01:04:21.531
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he barfs out the window one day </v>

1443
01:04:21.531 --> 01:04:21.930
<v Speaker 4>when he's a couple of days in like </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot manage.</v>

1444
01:04:21.931 --> 01:04:24.240
<v Speaker 4>He's like a can't imagine going back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mcdonald's.</v>

1445
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.240
<v Speaker 4>He's only like three days in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's getting sick all the time.</v>

1446
01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:32.100
<v Speaker 4>And then fast forward like a couple days</v>
<v Speaker 4>later and he wakes up with headaches and</v>

1447
01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:37.101
<v Speaker 4>he's like creating the food and he and </v>
<v Speaker 4>his headaches won't go away until he </v>

1448
01:04:37.101 --> 01:04:41.301
<v Speaker 4>goes to Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you can make the argument </v>

1449
01:04:41.301 --> 01:04:44.910
<v Speaker 4>that that could be attributable to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>change in his microbial ecology,</v>

1450
01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:50.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like now he's replaced as healthy </v>

1451
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:50.060
<v Speaker 4>because I think his wife or his </v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend at the time,</v>

1452
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:54.321
<v Speaker 4>it was like a Vegan chef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was eating really clean and then he </v>

1453
01:04:54.321 --> 01:04:57.171
<v Speaker 4>just starts eating this Mcdonald's and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he replaced is that microbial ecology </v>

1454
01:04:57.171 --> 01:04:59.880
<v Speaker 4>and his gut with the kind that feeds on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mcdonald's and suddenly it's creating it</v>

1455
01:04:59.881 --> 01:04:59.960
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1456
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Did you imagine if they found out that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mcdonald's actually had implanted </v>

1457
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.680
<v Speaker 5>microbial biology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they,</v>

1458
01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:10.900
<v Speaker 5>that they created in a lab that </v>
<v Speaker 5>specifically makes you want their shitty</v>

1459
01:05:10.901 --> 01:05:15.901
<v Speaker 5>cheeseburgers?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just just fucking crave that </v>

1460
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:16.480
<v Speaker 5>cheeseburger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1461
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 5>Mcdonald's that</v>

1462
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a thing online where it dude left </v>

1463
01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>one out for six months and it never rot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It saw that and I was like,</v>

1464
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>check please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1465
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm done no more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only filet of fishes which are </v>

1466
01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:34.321
<v Speaker 1>nutritious and delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he let out that it was the burger </v>

1467
01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and the fries too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even.</v>

1468
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I saw that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the fries rod either.</v>

1469
01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:41.690
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1470
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's just filler.</v>

1471
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like gut filler.</v>

1472
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can live on it for short </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods of time.</v>

1473
01:05:49.721 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>It's better than starving to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1474
01:05:52.451 --> 01:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>That stuff is fucking bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1475
01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.290
<v Speaker 7>calm and it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And his numbers from that movie,</v>

1476
01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:01.660
<v Speaker 7>like just after 30 days,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's doctor was like,</v>

1477
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.400
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is bad.</v>

1478
01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:09.270
<v Speaker 7>Crazy bat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it took him like a couple of years </v>

1479
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.550
<v Speaker 7>to like lose the weight and get back to </v>
<v Speaker 7>his baseline.</v>

1480
01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.600
<v Speaker 7>Did it really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1481
01:06:10.601 --> 01:06:12.520
<v Speaker 7>I mean it said it took them a really </v>
<v Speaker 7>long time.</v>

1482
01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:17.610
<v Speaker 7>Well that sounds like he's a lazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lost weight curriculum a couple of </v>

1483
01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:21.561
<v Speaker 7>years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think if it wasn't just his </v>

1484
01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:23.131
<v Speaker 7>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was like as cholesterol levels and </v>

1485
01:06:23.131 --> 01:06:23.131
<v Speaker 7>all that kind of really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did he try to go Vegan after that?</v>

1486
01:06:23.131 --> 01:06:25.240
<v Speaker 7>Or heavy vegetable dye?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1487
01:06:25.241 --> 01:06:30.241
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know his girlfriend who was a Vegan </v>

1488
01:06:30.241 --> 01:06:31.831
<v Speaker 7>chef,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I would imagine he returned to </v>

1489
01:06:31.831 --> 01:06:31.831
<v Speaker 7>something along that lines,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't know.</v>

1490
01:06:31.831 --> 01:06:35.690
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do you think of when you hear guys </v>

1491
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.800
<v Speaker 7>like Rob Wolf say eat bacon and eggs for</v>
<v Speaker 7>breakfast?</v>

1492
01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:41.220
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the first thing I would say is </v>

1493
01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:41.220
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1494
01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:41.220
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have a lot of respect for rob.</v>

1495
01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:41.710
<v Speaker 7>I think rob,</v>
<v Speaker 7>great guy.</v>

1496
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.400
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I love the interview and you know,</v>

1497
01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:47.320
<v Speaker 7>Robin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have the same goal.</v>

1498
01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.330
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like we're both working towards the same</v>

1499
01:06:49.331 --> 01:06:52.780
<v Speaker 7>thing which is trying to get people </v>
<v Speaker 7>healthier and more fit.</v>

1500
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:57.781
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we differ on a couple subcategories of </v>

1501
01:06:57.781 --> 01:06:57.781
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But like I think rob is,</v>

1502
01:06:57.781 --> 01:06:59.190
<v Speaker 7>is doing good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean I,</v>

1503
01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:04.480
<v Speaker 7>I definitely disagree when he says you </v>
<v Speaker 7>should eat bacon and eggs for breakfast </v>

1504
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.340
<v Speaker 7>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1505
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:11.400
<v Speaker 7>and I remember your reaction to that </v>
<v Speaker 7>even you were like surprised that that </v>

1506
01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:11.780
<v Speaker 7>was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that I'd never heard.</v>

1507
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.320
<v Speaker 7>I never heard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've never heard anyone say that myself.</v>

1508
01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anyone say that Kale </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakes.</v>

1509
01:07:16.581 --> 01:07:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Like don't eat kale shakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need.</v>

1510
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1511
01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1512
01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:24.550
<v Speaker 7>a lot about Paleo that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 7>fantastic,</v>

1513
01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:25.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

1514
01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:30.390
<v Speaker 7>they issued dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they shoe process foods and the oil that</v>

1515
01:07:30.431 --> 01:07:33.670
<v Speaker 7>they say is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is Olive oil in moderation?</v>

1516
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:35.130
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1517
01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:36.670
<v Speaker 7>we disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a very,</v>

1518
01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:40.180
<v Speaker 7>like the idea is low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1519
01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:45.160
<v Speaker 7>Like it's low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 7>high protein and I think that that works</v>

1520
01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 7>really well for losing weight and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 7>works for some people in terms of energy</v>

1521
01:07:48.641 --> 01:07:52.210
<v Speaker 7>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But my perspective on the whole thing is</v>

1522
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:57.840
<v Speaker 7>I'm coming from looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 7>healthcare crisis in America where like </v>

1523
01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.130
<v Speaker 7>people are just keeling over with heart </v>
<v Speaker 7>attacks constantly.</v>

1524
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:02.410
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Heart disease is rampant,</v>

1525
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.560
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and people are getting diabetes like </v>

1526
01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:07.690
<v Speaker 7>crazy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even children are getting diabetes.</v>

1527
01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:12.691
<v Speaker 7>I mean when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 7>diabetes wasn't really a thing right </v>

1528
01:08:12.691 --> 01:08:12.691
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like diabetes is a huge thing.</v>

1529
01:08:12.691 --> 01:08:15.470
<v Speaker 7>Like obesity and obesity figures are </v>
<v Speaker 7>insane.</v>

1530
01:08:15.471 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 7>Like 40 percent</v>

1531
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:21.250
<v Speaker 4>of Americans are going to be obese by </v>
<v Speaker 4>2014 and childhood obesity rates are </v>

1532
01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 4>crazy and school lunches are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1533
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:26.060
<v Speaker 4>and when I look at it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I think that,</v>

1534
01:08:26.061 --> 01:08:28.220
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1535
01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:33.700
<v Speaker 4>I can't get around the fact that when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>read the studies on plant based </v>

1536
01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:34.220
<v Speaker 4>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1537
01:08:34.221 --> 01:08:39.221
<v Speaker 4>when you read the China study or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>read Dr Russell Austin's book prevent </v>

1538
01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:44.501
<v Speaker 4>and reverse heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a pretty clear correlation </v>

1539
01:08:44.501 --> 01:08:45.680
<v Speaker 4>between getting rid of the meat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dairy and eating a whole food,</v>

1540
01:08:45.681 --> 01:08:50.681
<v Speaker 4>plant based diet and your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>repair your body from these conditions </v>

1541
01:08:50.811 --> 01:08:53.650
<v Speaker 4>that are plaguing us unnecessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1542
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.550
<v Speaker 4>heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a foodborne illness,</v>

1543
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:57.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can not only prevent it,</v>

1544
01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:59.230
<v Speaker 4>you can actually reverse it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

1545
01:08:59.231 --> 01:09:00.580
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Nelson,</v>

1546
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:01.970
<v Speaker 4>have you ever heard of this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1547
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:07.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for maybe your listeners who don't </v>

1548
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:07.330
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is a,</v>

1549
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:07.430
<v Speaker 4>he's a bad ass.</v>

1550
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:08.400
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy was,</v>

1551
01:09:08.530 --> 01:09:13.530
<v Speaker 4>he's Yale educated in these Olympic gold</v>
<v Speaker 4>medalist in rowing and like 1968 and I </v>

1552
01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:15.050
<v Speaker 4>think it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's uh,</v>

1553
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:16.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was a Vietnam.</v>

1554
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:19.160
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a Vietnam veteran also.</v>

1555
01:09:19.161 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then he became a surgeon and he was,</v>

1556
01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:23.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1557
01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:25.160
<v Speaker 4>the head surgeon at the Cleveland </v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinic,</v>

1558
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.920
<v Speaker 4>which is if you have heart disease or </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart problems,</v>

1559
01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:29.630
<v Speaker 4>like that's where you want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like those.</v>

1560
01:09:29.631 --> 01:09:31.070
<v Speaker 4>But Cleveland Clinic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cleveland Clinic,</v>

1561
01:09:31.071 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those ones you're feeling like shit,</v>

1562
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.460
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go to Cleveland.</v>

1563
01:09:34.461 --> 01:09:34.970
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1564
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:37.610
<v Speaker 4>They know what's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like back in the seventies,</v>

1565
01:09:37.611 --> 01:09:40.440
<v Speaker 4>he started to realize that when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>treated his patients with,</v>

1566
01:09:40.441 --> 01:09:42.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a plant based whole food diet,</v>

1567
01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 4>that they were able to reverse their </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart disease without surgery.</v>

1568
01:09:46.221 --> 01:09:48.500
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was starting to look at the,</v>

1569
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:50.140
<v Speaker 4>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you?</v>

1570
01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm having a brain fart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>

1571
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:54.770
<v Speaker 4>what are those pictures of the heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the angiograms.</v>

1572
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:58.370
<v Speaker 4>So you'd see these before and after </v>
<v Speaker 4>angiograms and you could clearly see,</v>

1573
01:09:58.730 --> 01:10:03.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the clogged arteries becoming clear </v>

1574
01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:03.730
<v Speaker 4>again and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1575
01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:05.330
<v Speaker 4>and it working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was not a popular thing like in</v>

1576
01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:07.700
<v Speaker 4>the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the 19 eighties.</v>

1577
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:09.620
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a large degree,</v>

1578
01:10:09.621 --> 01:10:11.220
<v Speaker 4>it's still not popular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1579
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.420
<v Speaker 4>it didn't make him a popular surgeon </v>
<v Speaker 4>there because.</v>

1580
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:16.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they make money off of surgery,</v>

1581
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:21.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're saying the putting that </v>

1582
01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.401
<v Speaker 4>information out that you can heal </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself through vegetables was not </v>

1583
01:10:24.401 --> 01:10:25.220
<v Speaker 4>popular because they literally wanted </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to be sicker.</v>

1584
01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.290
<v Speaker 4>It's not that they will make money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

1585
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:29.250
<v Speaker 4>It's not that they wanted people to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>sicker,</v>

1586
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:32.470
<v Speaker 4>it's just that the system is set up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1587
01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:37.540
<v Speaker 4>the way that you profit is by performing</v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive surgery.</v>

1588
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:43.270
<v Speaker 4>That is the way they profit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a big leap between that and </v>

1589
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:44.510
<v Speaker 4>being upset at something that heals </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1590
01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:45.230
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

1591
01:10:45.231 --> 01:10:47.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that it was that they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>upset.</v>

1592
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:52.690
<v Speaker 4>It was that it was new and there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough evidence at that time to fully </v>

1593
01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:56.660
<v Speaker 4>substantiate what he was doing and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had their sort of,</v>

1594
01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:01.690
<v Speaker 4>this is what we do here and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody comes in and they're in this </v>

1595
01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:04.691
<v Speaker 4>condition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we prescribe this procedure and he was </v>

1596
01:11:04.691 --> 01:11:04.691
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do that.</v>

1597
01:11:04.691 --> 01:11:07.640
<v Speaker 4>I want to do this like intensive diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing with them and counsel them and see</v>

1598
01:11:07.641 --> 01:11:10.010
<v Speaker 4>if I can avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was not.</v>

1599
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:13.100
<v Speaker 4>That was not a popular option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1600
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 4>That that makes</v>

1601
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.120
<v Speaker 5>more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

1602
01:11:15.121 --> 01:11:16.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially the,</v>

1603
01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:21.291
<v Speaker 5>the doctors had a very specific path </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they would follow when you had x </v>

1604
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:27.261
<v Speaker 5>wrong with you and that that path </v>
<v Speaker 5>usually lead to some sort of surgery and</v>

1605
01:11:27.811 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 5>he was trying to avoid that with </v>
<v Speaker 5>festivals.</v>

1606
01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.480
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1607
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.140
<v Speaker 7>And I think that's still true today.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And we were talking about statens you go</v>

1608
01:11:33.141 --> 01:11:36.260
<v Speaker 7>in with high cholesterol or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 7>your doctor is,</v>

1609
01:11:36.261 --> 01:11:39.260
<v Speaker 7>most likely you're going to prescribe </v>
<v Speaker 7>you statens he may say,</v>

1610
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:44.530
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>change your diet or do this and then </v>

1611
01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:44.530
<v Speaker 7>you'll come back and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it doesn't change.</v>

1612
01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:44.600
<v Speaker 7>And then he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1613
01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:47.900
<v Speaker 7>it's genetic and you need to take this </v>
<v Speaker 7>medicine when in fact,</v>

1614
01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.440
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1615
01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:50.330
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe that it actually,</v>

1616
01:11:50.331 --> 01:11:53.480
<v Speaker 7>you can lower your cholesterol if you </v>
<v Speaker 7>change your diet properly,</v>

1617
01:11:53.481 --> 01:11:58.481
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the point getting back to Dr </v>

1618
01:11:58.481 --> 01:11:58.481
<v Speaker 7>Esselstyn is that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1619
01:11:58.481 --> 01:11:59.810
<v Speaker 7>he was sort of blazing this trail a long</v>
<v Speaker 7>time ago back when,</v>

1620
01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.920
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not too many people were listening and </v>

1621
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.241
<v Speaker 7>it's taken many,</v>
<v Speaker 7>many years to kind of get traction with </v>

1622
01:12:07.241 --> 01:12:07.241
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's taken,</v>

1623
01:12:07.241 --> 01:12:07.980
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the China study and,</v>

1624
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.880
<v Speaker 7>and his book.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the documentary forks over knives to</v>

1625
01:12:10.881 --> 01:12:15.881
<v Speaker 7>get people sort of paying attention and </v>
<v Speaker 7>listening now and now there's kind of </v>

1626
01:12:15.881 --> 01:12:18.731
<v Speaker 7>like an awareness that didn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 7>before and that the scientific studies </v>

1627
01:12:19.281 --> 01:12:21.510
<v Speaker 7>are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are pretty compelling that when you,</v>

1628
01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.600
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you remove the animal proteins,</v>

1629
01:12:23.601 --> 01:12:28.601
<v Speaker 7>you remove the processed foods and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>remove the dairy that you can really </v>

1630
01:12:28.601 --> 01:12:28.601
<v Speaker 7>heal yourself.</v>

1631
01:12:28.601 --> 01:12:29.800
<v Speaker 5>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1632
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:31.580
<v Speaker 5>cut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is what it has.</v>

1633
01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:34.070
<v Speaker 5>Has it been proven that that is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>order that works,</v>

1634
01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:37.880
<v Speaker 5>hasn't been proven that if you cut out </v>
<v Speaker 5>the dairy,</v>

1635
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:43.270
<v Speaker 5>cut out the processed food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cut out the meat specifically on </v>

1636
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:44.360
<v Speaker 5>vegetable live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>off of vegetables,</v>

1637
01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:46.790
<v Speaker 5>vegetable nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that is the only way to go.</v>

1638
01:12:46.791 --> 01:12:50.960
<v Speaker 5>Or have they done vegetable nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 5>and grass fed meat and natural meat?</v>

1639
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:52.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's plenty of studies out there.</v>

1640
01:12:52.551 --> 01:12:54.320
<v Speaker 5>And what do they show?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the differences between</v>

1641
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:55.400
<v Speaker 7>that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the,</v>

1642
01:12:55.401 --> 01:12:58.050
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the actual animal protein is the,</v>

1643
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.080
<v Speaker 7>is the activator of have a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>congenital diseases really?</v>

1644
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:03.900
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:06.820
<v Speaker 5>And what do they attribute that to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just even,</v>

1646
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:10.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even game or is it fatty meats</v>

1647
01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.820
<v Speaker 7>even even game?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1648
01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.900
<v Speaker 7>certainly the saturated fat doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>help,</v>

1649
01:13:13.901 --> 01:13:18.901
<v Speaker 7>but there's something about the animal </v>
<v Speaker 7>proteins themselves and in particular </v>

1650
01:13:18.901 --> 01:13:18.901
<v Speaker 7>the Casein,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is the,</v>

1651
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:22.040
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the protein in the dairy that,</v>

1652
01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.900
<v Speaker 7>that proves problematic and what does it</v>
<v Speaker 7>do specifically to the human body?</v>

1653
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:27.210
<v Speaker 7>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have,</v>

1654
01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:31.540
<v Speaker 7>which I wish Dr Esselstyn was here to </v>
<v Speaker 7>answer that are starting to get a little</v>

1655
01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:33.040
<v Speaker 7>too technical.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want,</v>

1656
01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:35.380
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to speak out of school or </v>
<v Speaker 7>say the wrong or or</v>

1657
01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:40.610
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they found though essentially was </v>

1658
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:42.531
<v Speaker 5>that a lot of ailments are started and </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the activator for starting these </v>

1659
01:13:43.171 --> 01:13:46.140
<v Speaker 5>ailments and diseases is animals to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>eat animals,</v>

1660
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:51.350
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get certain diseases </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you would avoid if you just ate </v>

1661
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.350
<v Speaker 5>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1662
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.350
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1663
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:54.490
<v Speaker 7>And the China study originated around </v>
<v Speaker 7>studying cultures where there really </v>

1664
01:13:55.131 --> 01:14:00.131
<v Speaker 7>wasn't any animal products or animal </v>
<v Speaker 7>proteins in their diet and looking at </v>

1665
01:14:00.131 --> 01:14:02.210
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at the extent of cardiovascular disease.</v>

1666
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:03.920
<v Speaker 7>So there was a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1667
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:09.430
<v Speaker 7>area in China where a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it had a huge population of 260,000</v>

1668
01:14:10.671 --> 01:14:11.890
<v Speaker 7>people or something like that.</v>

1669
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.830
<v Speaker 4>The incidence of heart disease was </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost zero.</v>

1670
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

1671
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:22.110
<v Speaker 4>And so here again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this long epidemiological study where </v>

1672
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:23.020
<v Speaker 4>they really took a hard look at it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

1673
01:14:23.021 --> 01:14:23.650
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>

1674
01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:25.800
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number zero,</v>

1675
01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:28.200
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was zero,</v>

1676
01:14:28.201 --> 01:14:29.760
<v Speaker 1>but it was close as you're always very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1677
01:14:29.761 --> 01:14:31.080
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do,</v>

1678
01:14:31.081 --> 01:14:31.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1679
01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.420
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1680
01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:38.540
<v Speaker 1>how do they make sure that they get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper amount of protein and the proper </v>

1681
01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.440
<v Speaker 1>amount of amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But from what I understand,</v>

1682
01:14:40.441 --> 01:14:45.441
<v Speaker 1>the real issue with the Vegan Diet is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be really diligent about </v>

1683
01:14:45.441 --> 01:14:45.441
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1684
01:14:45.441 --> 01:14:49.890
<v Speaker 1>the proper proteins that you get because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all the various pr,</v>

1685
01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>like even Broccoli has protein in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have like a complete </v>

1686
01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>protein like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say meat does,</v>

1687
01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:58.740
<v Speaker 1>but there's keenwah and hemp is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete protein.</v>

1688
01:14:58.741 --> 01:15:01.260
<v Speaker 1>But how do you make sure that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right amount?</v>

1689
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:06.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of misconceptions </v>

1690
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:09.091
<v Speaker 4>about that and there's been a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of deepened king of the complete </v>

1691
01:15:09.091 --> 01:15:11.050
<v Speaker 4>versus incomplete argument that gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty technical.</v>

1692
01:15:11.051 --> 01:15:14.320
<v Speaker 4>But I think that if you're eating a well</v>
<v Speaker 4>rounded,</v>

1693
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:19.090
<v Speaker 4>balanced plant based diet with lots of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

1694
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're essentially,</v>

1695
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:22.870
<v Speaker 4>if you're eating grains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>legumes,</v>

1696
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.520
<v Speaker 4>fruits and vegetables and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>different colors and you know,</v>

1697
01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.370
<v Speaker 4>you're rotating them through or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1698
01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:31.030
<v Speaker 4>then you're not going to have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like nature is rigged.</v>

1699
01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:36.031
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to have a protein </v>

1700
01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:36.031
<v Speaker 4>deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1701
01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:36.670
<v Speaker 4>just speaking from my own experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this,</v>

1702
01:15:36.671 --> 01:15:40.150
<v Speaker 4>when I first started on the Vegan Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1703
01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:41.530
<v Speaker 4>I was nervous about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was scared about,</v>

1704
01:15:41.531 --> 01:15:45.100
<v Speaker 4>especially as I was starting to train </v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more and uh,</v>

1705
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:49.330
<v Speaker 4>my cabinet was full of all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy supplements,</v>

1706
01:15:49.331 --> 01:15:52.420
<v Speaker 4>just tons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like just mounds and mounds of</v>

1707
01:15:52.421 --> 01:15:57.421
<v Speaker 4>plant based proteins in my shakes </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was nervous that I was going </v>

1708
01:15:57.421 --> 01:16:01.961
<v Speaker 4>to injure myself or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was going to get sick or something </v>

1709
01:16:01.961 --> 01:16:04.861
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And over the last couple of years I've </v>

1710
01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:07.180
<v Speaker 4>slowly started weaning myself off of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of that stuff where I use very,</v>

1711
01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:10.840
<v Speaker 4>very little now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I haven't noticed a difference in my</v>

1712
01:16:10.841 --> 01:16:15.841
<v Speaker 4>ability to one recover in between </v>
<v Speaker 4>workouts or build lean muscle mass or </v>

1713
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:22.570
<v Speaker 4>endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my endurance is continuing to </v>

1714
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:22.570
<v Speaker 4>improve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I do use,</v>

1715
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:23.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use hemp protein,</v>

1716
01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:24.700
<v Speaker 4>I love him protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1717
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:27.360
<v Speaker 4>I usually combine it with like pea </v>
<v Speaker 4>protein or,</v>

1718
01:16:27.361 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 4>or sprouted brown rice protein.</v>

1719
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what protein?</v>

1720
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some today in honor of this </v>

1721
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:36.060
<v Speaker 1>podcast that's different from urine </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

1722
01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ps,</v>

1723
01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:41.330
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very high in protein.</v>

1724
01:16:41.690 --> 01:16:43.220
<v Speaker 1>So what is the fucking do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1725
01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:48.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't even do it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I only do it when I'm training </v>

1726
01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:48.260
<v Speaker 4>really hard or I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1727
01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:48.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1728
01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:53.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holes in the house or something like </v>

1729
01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.981
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always trying to source my proteins </v>

1730
01:16:54.981 --> 01:16:55.500
<v Speaker 4>from whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the misconception is that you gotta,</v>

1731
01:16:55.501 --> 01:16:59.220
<v Speaker 4>you gotta eat tons and tons of protein </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can only get,</v>

1732
01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:04.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real good protein quality protein from </v>

1733
01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.071
<v Speaker 4>animal products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I just don't believe that to be </v>

1734
01:17:07.071 --> 01:17:07.071
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>

1735
01:17:07.071 --> 01:17:09.500
<v Speaker 1>You remember when that dude wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>Travis Barker got into a,</v>

1736
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

1737
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.160
<v Speaker 5>plane crash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he got burned and he needed a </v>

1738
01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:15.160
<v Speaker 5>drummer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1739
01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:15.360
<v Speaker 5>He needed a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1740
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.950
<v Speaker 5>a skin graft and when he had a skin </v>
<v Speaker 5>graft,</v>

1741
01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:21.890
<v Speaker 5>his body was not healing until he </v>
<v Speaker 5>started eating meat again.</v>

1742
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:24.530
<v Speaker 5>And we started eating meat again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It started healing rapidly.</v>

1743
01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:27.040
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said that was a,</v>

1744
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:29.450
<v Speaker 5>he was a vegan before that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he had to stop being a Vegan.</v>

1745
01:17:29.451 --> 01:17:34.451
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to paraphrase this guy's </v>

1746
01:17:34.451 --> 01:17:34.451
<v Speaker 5>story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1747
01:17:34.451 --> 01:17:35.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure that is a,</v>

1748
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.480
<v Speaker 5>how he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there any possible benefit in your </v>

1749
01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.000
<v Speaker 5>eyes to eating animal protein for as far</v>
<v Speaker 5>as performance,</v>

1750
01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:49.120
<v Speaker 5>physical performance as far as a mean </v>
<v Speaker 5>even though it may be the catalyst to a,</v>

1751
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:53.780
<v Speaker 5>triggering certain ailments in certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals and that can be documented.</v>

1752
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:56.320
<v Speaker 5>Is it also possible that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>benefit to it too?</v>

1753
01:17:56.650 --> 01:17:59.390
<v Speaker 5>And from a performance perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1754
01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:01.670
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's certainly possible.</v>

1755
01:18:01.671 --> 01:18:04.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially in the fast twitch sports.</v>

1756
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1757
01:18:05.331 --> 01:18:10.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I do is so long it's a very </v>

1758
01:18:10.331 --> 01:18:11.450
<v Speaker 4>specific kind of sport that's very </v>
<v Speaker 4>different from Jujitsu or sprint running</v>

1759
01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:16.480
<v Speaker 4>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there are plenty of athletes out </v>

1760
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:16.520
<v Speaker 4>there in various disciplines that seem </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be,</v>

1761
01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:18.170
<v Speaker 4>that seemed to be doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1762
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:20.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has there been a double blind,</v>

1763
01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:22.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of case study on the difference.</v>

1764
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:24.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1765
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:26.300
<v Speaker 4>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1766
01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1767
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.170
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to um,</v>

1768
01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:32.150
<v Speaker 4>the reason that I started doing this to </v>
<v Speaker 4>begin with,</v>

1769
01:18:32.151 --> 01:18:32.990
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1770
01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.240
<v Speaker 4>really longterm wellness and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1771
01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:40.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not having a heart attack like heart </v>

1772
01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:41.951
<v Speaker 4>disease runs in my family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My grandfather who was a champion </v>

1773
01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:42.200
<v Speaker 4>swimmer died of a heart attack in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>early fifties.</v>

1774
01:18:42.201 --> 01:18:43.020
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1775
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:46.610
<v Speaker 4>I have to constantly remind myself that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was what motivated me to do this,</v>

1776
01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:48.710
<v Speaker 4>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't performance reasons.</v>

1777
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the same time,</v>

1778
01:18:50.361 --> 01:18:55.361
<v Speaker 4>if I felt like I was missing something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if I started to feel like I wasn't </v>

1779
01:18:55.641 --> 01:18:57.620
<v Speaker 4>recovering or it wasn't improving or I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't,</v>

1780
01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:01.250
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't able to get stronger or I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't feeling good,</v>

1781
01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:06.340
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would certainly entertain the </v>

1782
01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.901
<v Speaker 4>possibility of eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of eating meat if I thought my health </v>

1783
01:19:07.901 --> 01:19:11.111
<v Speaker 4>was suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I just haven't had that experience </v>

1784
01:19:11.111 --> 01:19:11.111
<v Speaker 4>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1785
01:19:11.111 --> 01:19:11.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just try to stick to,</v>

1786
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1787
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to speak for anyone else or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1788
01:19:15.411 --> 01:19:15.740
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1789
01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:21.060
<v Speaker 5>how do you feel about that idea that </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's got a different sort of </v>

1790
01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.310
<v Speaker 5>nutritional requirement and that some </v>
<v Speaker 5>people really shouldn't eat red meat and</v>

1791
01:19:24.311 --> 01:19:26.470
<v Speaker 5>some people really should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetarians.</v>

1792
01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:27.750
<v Speaker 5>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's uh,</v>

1793
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:32.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>based on your blood or where your </v>

1794
01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:35.101
<v Speaker 5>families origins are geographically and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the kind of genes that you're </v>

1795
01:19:35.101 --> 01:19:35.101
<v Speaker 5>carrying around.</v>

1796
01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:38.850
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really buy into any of that.</v>

1797
01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:39.940
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1798
01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:46.740
<v Speaker 5>But has there been evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 5>different people that grow up in </v>

1799
01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.280
<v Speaker 5>different parts of the world have </v>
<v Speaker 5>different nutritional requirements?</v>

1800
01:19:48.281 --> 01:19:53.281
<v Speaker 5>Like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that live in like Eskimos are </v>

1801
01:19:53.281 --> 01:19:56.551
<v Speaker 5>inuits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't like to be called escalade </v>

1802
01:19:56.551 --> 01:19:56.551
<v Speaker 5>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1803
01:19:56.551 --> 01:19:56.551
<v Speaker 5>inuits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1804
01:19:56.551 --> 01:19:59.230
<v Speaker 5>they have no issues as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 5>scurvy or anything,</v>

1805
01:19:59.231 --> 01:20:02.030
<v Speaker 5>but they're not getting any vitamin C </v>
<v Speaker 5>than samples.</v>

1806
01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:02.370
<v Speaker 5>I have</v>

1807
01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:05.040
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a relatively high incidence of</v>

1808
01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:05.820
<v Speaker 4>heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1809
01:20:05.821 --> 01:20:07.150
<v Speaker 4>do they really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1810
01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1811
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.000
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1812
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.180
<v Speaker 6>I thought the whole deal I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it cancer that they,</v>

1813
01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:14.130
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you almost never see?</v>

1814
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:16.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And annually population.</v>

1815
01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:18.930
<v Speaker 6>And they were attributing that to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the uh,</v>

1816
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.050
<v Speaker 6>nutrition that they got from fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you,</v>

1817
01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:24.710
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do substitute with any animal?</v>

1818
01:20:24.711 --> 01:20:26.550
<v Speaker 6>I'm like fish oil or anything like that.</v>

1819
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1820
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:30.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think getting your Omega threes is,</v>

1821
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:31.850
<v Speaker 4>is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1822
01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fish oil is really popular with a lot of</v>

1823
01:20:34.161 --> 01:20:39.161
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can essentially do the same </v>

1824
01:20:39.161 --> 01:20:39.470
<v Speaker 4>thing with flax seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground flax seeds.</v>

1825
01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.330
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't use flax oil,</v>

1826
01:20:41.331 --> 01:20:44.300
<v Speaker 4>but like ground flax seeds or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put in a vitamix all the time.</v>

1827
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:46.170
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't choose the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1828
01:20:46.190 --> 01:20:48.920
<v Speaker 4>actual oil?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The oil has been linked to.</v>

1829
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:53.950
<v Speaker 4>There's some evidence that suggests that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's linked to incidents of prostate </v>

1830
01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:54.890
<v Speaker 4>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for some reason the seeds aren't,</v>

1831
01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.620
<v Speaker 4>took the seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the seeds have like the case,</v>

1832
01:20:57.621 --> 01:21:02.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they have that casing on them or </v>

1833
01:21:02.621 --> 01:21:04.391
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to grind them up because </v>

1834
01:21:04.391 --> 01:21:04.391
<v Speaker 4>otherwise they'll just pass right </v>
<v Speaker 4>through you.</v>

1835
01:21:04.391 --> 01:21:07.380
<v Speaker 6>So I'm a kind of like a vitamix.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1836
01:21:07.381 --> 01:21:07.950
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or You can,</v>

1837
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.260
<v Speaker 6>you can buy them ground or you can put </v>
<v Speaker 6>them in like a,</v>

1838
01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:13.500
<v Speaker 6>a coffee grinder or like a cuisinart or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

1839
01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:18.710
<v Speaker 6>What about hemp oil?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's supposed to be pretty neutral oil </v>

1840
01:21:18.710 --> 01:21:19.690
<v Speaker 6>and all that stuff has the same benefits</v>
<v Speaker 6>as fish oil and.</v>

1841
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:24.980
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>flax seeds are the closest from my </v>

1842
01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.100
<v Speaker 6>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does it have the same benefits as far as</v>

1843
01:21:26.101 --> 01:21:31.101
<v Speaker 6>like a joint inflammation relief?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because fish oil is incredible for,</v>

1844
01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:31.890
<v Speaker 6>for that.</v>

1845
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:32.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1846
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:36.050
<v Speaker 4>I think it's important when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>joint relief and,</v>

1847
01:21:36.051 --> 01:21:41.051
<v Speaker 4>and looking at inflammation is looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the acidic or alkaline nature of the </v>

1848
01:21:41.051 --> 01:21:41.720
<v Speaker 4>foods that you're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1849
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:42.980
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1850
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:44.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>animal products,</v>

1851
01:21:44.211 --> 01:21:44.860
<v Speaker 4>dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dairy,</v>

1852
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:48.140
<v Speaker 4>meat tend to be very acid forming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your body has a certain Ph,</v>

1853
01:21:48.141 --> 01:21:48.770
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's trying to,</v>

1854
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:51.890
<v Speaker 4>it's trying to maintain that sort of Ph </v>
<v Speaker 4>right in the middle.</v>

1855
01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1856
01:21:54.711 --> 01:21:59.711
<v Speaker 4>the foods we eat and the toxins we </v>
<v Speaker 4>breathe in the air and stress of our </v>

1857
01:21:59.711 --> 01:22:00.900
<v Speaker 4>lives or whatever can all put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1858
01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.890
<v Speaker 4>try to push that one way or the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that our body has to kind of go into</v>

1859
01:22:03.891 --> 01:22:06.440
<v Speaker 4>hyperdrive to bring it back to its </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal state.</v>

1860
01:22:06.441 --> 01:22:11.441
<v Speaker 4>So the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that most people that are eating a </v>

1861
01:22:11.441 --> 01:22:12.740
<v Speaker 4>standard American diet and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>living in North American way of life,</v>

1862
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:18.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are eating a predominantly acidic acid </v>

1863
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:20.900
<v Speaker 4>forming diet and they're in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's called chronic acidosis.</v>

1864
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:24.080
<v Speaker 4>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a state in which you know,</v>

1865
01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:29.150
<v Speaker 4>you're constantly bombarding your body </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a very asset based diet and your </v>

1866
01:22:29.150 --> 01:22:30.050
<v Speaker 4>body has to kind of go into hyperdrive </v>
<v Speaker 4>to bring it,</v>

1867
01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:35.140
<v Speaker 4>to bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's an environment where you </v>

1868
01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:35.750
<v Speaker 4>become very rife for getting injured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for getting sick.</v>

1869
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:37.070
<v Speaker 4>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1870
01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.640
<v Speaker 4>an environment that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you more prone to those congenital</v>

1871
01:22:40.641 --> 01:22:43.400
<v Speaker 4>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you're eating a more plant based</v>

1872
01:22:43.401 --> 01:22:44.150
<v Speaker 4>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are,</v>

1873
01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:47.090
<v Speaker 4>those tend to be not every plant food or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1874
01:22:47.091 --> 01:22:49.240
<v Speaker 4>but it tends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tends to be in balance,</v>

1875
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:53.870
<v Speaker 4>more alkaline forming and when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in a more alkaline state,</v>

1876
01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 4>you're not getting sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're recovering more quickly because </v>

1877
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.950
<v Speaker 4>inflammation is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is sort of the root cause for a zillion </v>

1878
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:03.890
<v Speaker 4>diseases and it's like the enemy of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>athlete,</v>

1879
01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're always trying to like,</v>

1880
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:10.410
<v Speaker 4>if you can reduce your inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your muscles are going to repair </v>

1881
01:23:10.410 --> 01:23:13.111
<v Speaker 4>themselves more quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna be able to bounce back </v>

1882
01:23:13.111 --> 01:23:13.111
<v Speaker 4>quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be able to train harder.</v>

1883
01:23:13.111 --> 01:23:14.440
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't necessarily make you a better</v>
<v Speaker 4>athlete,</v>

1884
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:15.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1885
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:20.551
<v Speaker 4>in a short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But protracted over the course of the </v>

1886
01:23:20.551 --> 01:23:23.011
<v Speaker 4>season,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a much more </v>

1887
01:23:23.011 --> 01:23:24.451
<v Speaker 4>efficient and effective training period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's gonna result in performance </v>

1888
01:23:24.451 --> 01:23:25.480
<v Speaker 4>gains in the long run.</v>

1889
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:31.010
<v Speaker 1>So you're essentially saying that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of taking fish oil,</v>

1890
01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you could get those same benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would just changing your diet to a </v>

1891
01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:38.220
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian diet that you don't need fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil with respect</v>

1892
01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.170
<v Speaker 4>fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1893
01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:42.410
<v Speaker 4>the purpose of fish oil is to get those </v>
<v Speaker 4>omega threes,</v>

1894
01:23:42.411 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 4>those essential fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1895
01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:45.410
<v Speaker 4>That are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are important.</v>

1896
01:23:45.411 --> 01:23:46.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1897
01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:48.170
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1898
01:23:48.171 --> 01:23:51.740
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of talk about the fas and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Omega six and the Omega three and we</v>

1899
01:23:51.741 --> 01:23:54.500
<v Speaker 4>get plenty of Omega six and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>foods we eat or whatever,</v>

1900
01:23:54.501 --> 01:23:58.430
<v Speaker 4>but the problem comes when the ratio of </v>
<v Speaker 4>six to three is kind of off.</v>

1901
01:23:58.431 --> 01:24:03.431
<v Speaker 4>And most people don't get enough Omega </v>
<v Speaker 4>three in their diets and fish oil is </v>

1902
01:24:03.431 --> 01:24:05.070
<v Speaker 4>great for kind of rectifying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just the,</v>

1903
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:10.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my point is only that it's not the only </v>

1904
01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:10.200
<v Speaker 4>way of dealing with that.</v>

1905
01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.920
<v Speaker 1>What are the other vegetarian options </v>
<v Speaker 1>besides a hemp oil,</v>

1906
01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.050
<v Speaker 1>flax seed</v>

1907
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.490
<v Speaker 4>oil and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1908
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.690
<v Speaker 4>walnuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe there's some nuts that are,</v>

1909
01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.370
<v Speaker 4>that are pretty high in how many do you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to eat?</v>

1910
01:24:20.371 --> 01:24:22.380
<v Speaker 4>Hemp seeds?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that many.</v>

1911
01:24:22.410 --> 01:24:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>

1912
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.720
<v Speaker 4>you don't need like a ton of this stuff</v>

1913
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:27.280
<v Speaker 1>with fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1914
01:24:27.281 --> 01:24:31.450
<v Speaker 1>I've been on like a really high fish oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet for a long time now.</v>

1915
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I'd take like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000,</v>

1916
01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:38.170
<v Speaker 1>500 milligrams mill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand milligram pill.</v>

1917
01:24:38.171 --> 01:24:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I take five of those in the morning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>five of those at night.</v>

1918
01:24:40.630 --> 01:24:45.630
<v Speaker 1>And when I don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed a difference in how my joints </v>

1919
01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:47.110
<v Speaker 1>feel like from doing a lot of Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially</v>

1920
01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.250
<v Speaker 4>I think interested in if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you switched it up to um,</v>

1921
01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.400
<v Speaker 4>ground flax seeds if you felt a </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference or not.</v>

1922
01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be willing to try it.</v>

1923
01:24:54.171 --> 01:24:57.960
<v Speaker 1>But I always thought that it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like there was like lubricating.</v>

1924
01:24:57.961 --> 01:25:02.961
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that it was like deputy for doing </v>

1925
01:25:02.961 --> 01:25:02.961
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1926
01:25:02.961 --> 01:25:02.961
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>

1927
01:25:02.961 --> 01:25:04.350
<v Speaker 1>how much oil would you need to move up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking.</v>

1928
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I thought it in my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was such a correlation </v>

1929
01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:13.611
<v Speaker 1>between taking these pills and joint </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain relief that I've found that a lot.</v>

1930
01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot of great things about fish </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil and studies on fish oil and there's </v>

1931
01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:21.960
<v Speaker 1>absolutely some nutritional benefit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking it.</v>

1932
01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:27.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why you wouldn't take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it was because of the fact that </v>

1933
01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:27.680
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1934
01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.920
<v Speaker 1>not have anything animal in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to just subscribe to.</v>

1935
01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1936
01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:36.560
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be careful with the toxins </v>

1937
01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:36.560
<v Speaker 4>that are in marine life too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1938
01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all filtered by Ebola,</v>

1939
01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Carlson's fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they,</v>

1940
01:25:40.501 --> 01:25:43.440
<v Speaker 1>they test that stuff and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>filtered out and there's nothing.</v>

1941
01:25:43.441 --> 01:25:48.441
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are the very high end </v>

1942
01:25:48.441 --> 01:25:48.441
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1943
01:25:48.441 --> 01:25:48.441
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1944
01:25:48.441 --> 01:25:51.420
<v Speaker 1>they test all their stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't see why there would be,</v>

1945
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you were into it strictly from </v>

1946
01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.870
<v Speaker 1>the point of view of staying Vegan or </v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing no animal into your body at </v>

1947
01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:03.921
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like there's any thing </v>

1948
01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:03.921
<v Speaker 1>that you lose from taking fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's um,</v>

1949
01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1950
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:07.970
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because anytime you say</v>
<v Speaker 4>this food is good,</v>

1951
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
<v Speaker 4>then you can immediately go on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet and find some reason why shot </v>

1952
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:13.400
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can fall into any category that.</v>

1953
01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:14.150
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1954
01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:19.540
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are some studies out there that </v>

1955
01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.221
<v Speaker 4>show that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the fish oil thing is a little </v>

1956
01:26:21.221 --> 01:26:21.221
<v Speaker 4>overhyped and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1957
01:26:21.221 --> 01:26:25.060
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to quantify like who's right </v>

1958
01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:25.060
<v Speaker 4>and who's wrong and all that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1959
01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you been to a,</v>

1960
01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:26.030
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1961
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:29.210
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a guy named Dr Michael Greger.</v>

1962
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:31.730
<v Speaker 4>He's got a site called nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 4>facts.org</v>

1963
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:33.580
<v Speaker 4>and it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

1964
01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:38.630
<v Speaker 4>The guy has like a zillion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he puts up videos like almost every day </v>

1965
01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:41.921
<v Speaker 4>and they're short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like two to five minutes at Max </v>

1966
01:26:41.921 --> 01:26:43.880
<v Speaker 4>and you can look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can enter in any food or any disease</v>

1967
01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:48.881
<v Speaker 4>or whatever and most likely as a short </v>
<v Speaker 4>video on it and it's all based on peer </v>

1968
01:26:48.881 --> 01:26:50.630
<v Speaker 4>reviewed scientific studies or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I always go to that one.</v>

1969
01:26:50.631 --> 01:26:52.390
<v Speaker 4>I have a question about this food or </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1970
01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:53.810
<v Speaker 4>It's a really good resource.</v>

1971
01:26:54.570 --> 01:26:59.570
<v Speaker 5>I went to a nutrition for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was like 17 and I was losing </v>

1972
01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:04.491
<v Speaker 5>weight for martial arts competitions and</v>
<v Speaker 5>those fucking my body up and I was </v>

1973
01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:06.150
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out how to monitor my </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition,</v>

1974
01:27:06.151 --> 01:27:06.810
<v Speaker 5>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1975
01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:08.940
<v Speaker 5>ilene myself out in the healthiest way </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible,</v>

1976
01:27:08.941 --> 01:27:11.490
<v Speaker 5>but drop the most weight before I had to</v>
<v Speaker 5>dehydrate myself.</v>

1977
01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:17.360
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was Nancy Clark who is pretty </v>

1978
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:17.360
<v Speaker 5>famous for working with athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was in Boston at the time.</v>

1979
01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:20.550
<v Speaker 5>She's got a bunch of books on that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think she's worked with,</v>

1980
01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:25.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other mma athletes to now this is way </v>

1981
01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:25.580
<v Speaker 5>after.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1982
01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:26.240
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I must've done it,</v>

1983
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:28.770
<v Speaker 5>did it with her and 85 or something like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1984
01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:34.100
<v Speaker 5>But that's when I first became,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was from martial arts competition </v>

1985
01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:35.490
<v Speaker 5>before I had to worry about my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>

1986
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.260
<v Speaker 5>I didn't watch what I ate at all.</v>

1987
01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:39.810
<v Speaker 5>I just ate what I felt like eating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even when I was competing,</v>

1988
01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:44.820
<v Speaker 5>I had no emphasis or focus on nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't until I got older that I do,</v>

1989
01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:50.580
<v Speaker 5>I just through trial and error and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1990
01:27:50.581 --> 01:27:53.120
<v Speaker 5>just going on a whim and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want this.</v>

1991
01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:58.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to juice all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to have beet juice and </v>

1992
01:27:58.220 --> 01:27:58.220
<v Speaker 5>carrot juice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>celery juice,</v>

1993
01:27:58.220 --> 01:27:59.870
<v Speaker 5>and I've done that a few times and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1994
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:04.900
<v Speaker 5>you get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a weird kind of energy that you </v>

1995
01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:07.530
<v Speaker 5>get from that intense plant nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you don't get from anything else.</v>

1996
01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:12.650
<v Speaker 5>You really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the same feeling that you get </v>

1997
01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:15.261
<v Speaker 5>when you have the satisfaction of a fat </v>
<v Speaker 5>rib eye and it's just perfectly cooked </v>

1998
01:28:15.261 --> 01:28:16.720
<v Speaker 5>and sliced into that medium.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rare,</v>

1999
01:28:19.410 --> 01:28:21.570
<v Speaker 5>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that satisfaction,</v>

2000
01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 5>but it is this weird sort of a vibrancy </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you get like you're injecting.</v>

2001
01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:32.120
<v Speaker 5>You're ingesting live live plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean essentially they've just died a </v>

2002
01:28:32.881 --> 01:28:37.881
<v Speaker 5>short period of time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're still vibrant with energy and </v>

2003
01:28:37.881 --> 01:28:42.170
<v Speaker 5>you don't get that from anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>processed and there's a lot of people </v>

2004
01:28:42.170 --> 01:28:44.730
<v Speaker 5>out there that are miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are depressed,</v>

2005
01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:49.760
<v Speaker 5>that are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I have friends that shit fucking </v>

2006
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.151
<v Speaker 5>diets and their.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their way of dealing with is take </v>

2007
01:28:53.151 --> 01:28:53.151
<v Speaker 5>antidepressants and it's like there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2008
01:28:53.151 --> 01:28:54.480
<v Speaker 5>You've got to know exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Terrible sleep shit.</v>

2009
01:28:54.481 --> 01:28:56.190
<v Speaker 5>Di You feel terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take a pill.</v>

2010
01:28:56.191 --> 01:28:57.420
<v Speaker 5>You feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

2011
01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.190
<v Speaker 5>You've got to clean up all that other </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>

2012
01:28:59.191 --> 01:29:04.191
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then see how you feel if you have </v>

2013
01:29:04.191 --> 01:29:04.191
<v Speaker 5>all these goddamn issues as far as your </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet,</v>

2014
01:29:04.191 --> 01:29:05.550
<v Speaker 5>as far as your sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as far as,</v>

2015
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:08.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stress levels get cleaned up.</v>

2016
01:29:08.641 --> 01:29:12.060
<v Speaker 5>That shit first before you go take a gun</v>
<v Speaker 5>damn pill.</v>

2017
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:13.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're a nation of,</v>

2018
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.780
<v Speaker 5>of crazy people who are addicted to all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these weird new,</v>

2019
01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:23.010
<v Speaker 5>not natural non native chemicals that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're introducing into our body.</v>

2020
01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.150
<v Speaker 5>And that would become addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2021
01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.600
<v Speaker 5>if we could just look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you could have a,</v>

2022
01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:28.270
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2023
01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:33.290
<v Speaker 5>an overlay of the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's on the influence of any sort of a </v>

2024
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.010
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical drug right now.</v>

2025
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:38.570
<v Speaker 4>It's like the Matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2026
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:39.690
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2027
01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:40.450
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2028
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:45.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to spend too much of a new age </v>

2029
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:45.500
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2030
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:50.500
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right at the food carries a </v>

2031
01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:51.180
<v Speaker 4>vibrancy and an energy to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very specific.</v>

2032
01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:56.280
<v Speaker 4>And in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been on this crazy amazing journey </v>

2033
01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:00.441
<v Speaker 4>that I would've never predicted and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>honestly started with changing my diet </v>

2034
01:30:00.441 --> 01:30:03.270
<v Speaker 4>and so I look at it with like a respect </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a reverence and I go,</v>

2035
01:30:03.271 --> 01:30:05.670
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what catalyzed this path.</v>

2036
01:30:05.671 --> 01:30:09.300
<v Speaker 4>And it opened me like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it opened my heart to the possibility of</v>

2037
01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:12.840
<v Speaker 4>living differently and to doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things than I was doing.</v>

2038
01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:14.250
<v Speaker 4>And Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2039
01:30:14.251 --> 01:30:16.110
<v Speaker 4>people are sicker than they've ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>been.</v>

2040
01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:21.111
<v Speaker 4>We're the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're such a prosperous nation and </v>

2041
01:30:21.111 --> 01:30:21.150
<v Speaker 4>people are just overmedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fat,</v>

2042
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:24.590
<v Speaker 4>they're unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for the most part they're people.</v>

2043
01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:25.530
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the,</v>

2044
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:30.590
<v Speaker 4>what do you think the level of happiness</v>
<v Speaker 4>is now compared to what it was like 100 </v>

2045
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.590
<v Speaker 4>years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think we're happier?</v>

2046
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:32.700
<v Speaker 4>Do you think we're more unhappy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2047
01:30:32.701 --> 01:30:35.700
<v Speaker 4>I think obviously it's an individual's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy as fuck.</v>

2048
01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:36.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2049
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.810
<v Speaker 4>the thing is you're doing what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>meant to be doing.</v>

2050
01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:40.890
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're on,</v>

2051
01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:44.640
<v Speaker 4>you're on a path that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been blazing for a long time,</v>

2052
01:30:44.641 --> 01:30:45.360
<v Speaker 4>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2053
01:30:45.361 --> 01:30:48.060
<v Speaker 4>you've made something happen that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>passionate about.</v>

2054
01:30:48.061 --> 01:30:52.170
<v Speaker 4>But most people unfortunately don't live</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of life.</v>

2055
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:57.550
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think they could live their own </v>

2056
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:57.550
<v Speaker 5>version of it</v>

2057
01:30:58.380 --> 01:30:58.940
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2058
01:30:58.970 --> 01:31:03.970
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know this because I was a </v>

2059
01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:03.970
<v Speaker 4>corporate lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was miserable.</v>

2060
01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:08.341
<v Speaker 4>I was doing the 80 hour weeks and I had </v>
<v Speaker 4>done everything right my whole life </v>

2061
01:31:08.341 --> 01:31:09.670
<v Speaker 4>makes sense to do spine chill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2062
01:31:09.671 --> 01:31:12.270
<v Speaker 4>I studied hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got into the good schools and I,</v>

2063
01:31:12.610 --> 01:31:13.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I played the game,</v>

2064
01:31:14.050 --> 01:31:15.100
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

2065
01:31:15.101 --> 01:31:18.970
<v Speaker 4>and I got to the place that was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be the brass ring,</v>

2066
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:20.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

2067
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:24.670
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like not happy and I felt lost and</v>

2068
01:31:24.710 --> 01:31:28.030
<v Speaker 4>it's like a feeling of being in free </v>
<v Speaker 4>fall and you have a choice,</v>

2069
01:31:28.031 --> 01:31:29.350
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2070
01:31:29.351 --> 01:31:31.720
<v Speaker 4>I was making a decent amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2071
01:31:31.810 --> 01:31:33.700
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people in that situation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll just,</v>

2072
01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:36.610
<v Speaker 4>they'll just killed themselves with </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff they can't afford.</v>

2073
01:31:36.611 --> 01:31:37.600
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I'll,</v>

2074
01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:40.210
<v Speaker 4>I'll lease that car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a little bit out of my reach.</v>

2075
01:31:40.211 --> 01:31:41.800
<v Speaker 4>And rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2076
01:31:41.801 --> 01:31:44.020
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when you're unhappy,</v>

2077
01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:45.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need something to solve that,</v>

2078
01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:50.940
<v Speaker 4>that wound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you do that long enough and </v>

2079
01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.420
<v Speaker 4>then you're stuck and you can't make a </v>
<v Speaker 4>change or it becomes too difficult.</v>

2080
01:31:52.421 --> 01:31:54.310
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

2081
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:59.430
<v Speaker 4>it was Henry David Thoreau that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mass of men lead lives of quiet </v>

2082
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 4>desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's very,</v>

2083
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.870
<v Speaker 7>very true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One of my favorite quotes ever.</v>

2084
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:04.300
<v Speaker 7>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's sad,</v>

2085
01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:05.320
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's sad.</v>

2086
01:32:05.321 --> 01:32:07.000
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I look at you,</v>

2087
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:09.130
<v Speaker 7>you've built this thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're doing what you love.</v>

2088
01:32:09.131 --> 01:32:11.860
<v Speaker 7>You spend your day last Brian below.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I mean,</v>

2089
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:12.940
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

2090
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.350
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

2091
01:32:14.351 --> 01:32:15.700
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in your Juju.</v>

2092
01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:16.780
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.460
<v Speaker 7>And most people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most people aren't.</v>

2094
01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.780
<v Speaker 7>I think that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So He's,</v>

2095
01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:20.760
<v Speaker 7>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he knows Jews.</v>

2096
01:32:22.890 --> 01:32:23.220
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2097
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:24.850
<v Speaker 7>most people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But they could be,</v>

2098
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think one of those heart,</v>

2099
01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:27.690
<v Speaker 7>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2100
01:32:27.710 --> 01:32:30.640
<v Speaker 7>you think it's hard to change your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2101
01:32:30.641 --> 01:32:33.370
<v Speaker 7>try overhauling your entire lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:34.120
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>believe me.</v>

2103
01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:37.180
<v Speaker 7>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very difficult and scary.</v>

2104
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:38.380
<v Speaker 7>It's terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2105
01:32:38.381 --> 01:32:40.600
<v Speaker 7>and we live in a fear based culture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

2106
01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:42.940
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I did it,</v>

2107
01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:48.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went from being a martial arts </v>

2108
01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:48.260
<v Speaker 5>instructor to being a standup comedian </v>
<v Speaker 5>and got my car repossessed,</v>

2109
01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:49.510
<v Speaker 5>went broke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lost all my critical.</v>

2110
01:32:49.511 --> 01:32:50.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a,</v>

2111
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:54.460
<v Speaker 5>a loser for like years that you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to double down to do that.</v>

2112
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:59.770
<v Speaker 5>I just didn't want to get brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw a future in kickboxing and I was </v>

2113
01:32:59.770 --> 01:33:00.340
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

2114
01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:01.260
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2115
01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:06.300
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this stuff is not good for your fucking </v>

2116
01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:06.300
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was meeting guys that Jim,</v>

2117
01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.980
<v Speaker 5>the newer were punchy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just was too one.</v>

2118
01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:14.210
<v Speaker 5>I did too many hard sparring sessions </v>
<v Speaker 5>where I never got knocked out in </v>

2119
01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:18.521
<v Speaker 5>sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I definitely got my bell rung </v>

2120
01:33:18.521 --> 01:33:18.521
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2121
01:33:18.521 --> 01:33:22.050
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got hit with hard shots before we </v>

2122
01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:22.050
<v Speaker 5>would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would trade,</v>

2123
01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:25.801
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I worked out at a particularly heavy </v>

2124
01:33:25.801 --> 01:33:25.801
<v Speaker 5>duty.</v>

2125
01:33:25.801 --> 01:33:29.610
<v Speaker 5>Jim and these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the different gyms have different </v>

2126
01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:29.710
<v Speaker 5>philosophies as far as borrowing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And our,</v>

2127
01:33:29.711 --> 01:33:32.800
<v Speaker 5>Jim's philosophy was he put on big </v>
<v Speaker 5>gloves and you fucking go at it.</v>

2128
01:33:32.801 --> 01:33:33.430
<v Speaker 5>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was,</v>

2129
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:38.470
<v Speaker 5>it was basically kickboxing bouts with </v>
<v Speaker 5>big giant gloves on and headgear and </v>

2130
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:39.250
<v Speaker 5>Shin Pads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And stuff like that.</v>

2131
01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:42.370
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew that it was not good for you.</v>

2132
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:45.970
<v Speaker 5>So for me it was like I had this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>like I got to jump ship,</v>

2133
01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:50.080
<v Speaker 5>I got a job because this is a path of </v>
<v Speaker 5>deteriorating brain function.</v>

2134
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.560
<v Speaker 5>Like I would have moments where I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 5>lying in bed and it wasn't even like </v>

2135
01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:56.770
<v Speaker 5>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a goal,</v>

2136
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.900
<v Speaker 5>like it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no ufc back then.</v>

2137
01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 5>So it was just kickboxing and in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinion,</v>

2138
01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:07.230
<v Speaker 5>like mixed martial arts is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all it's just way more options </v>

2139
01:34:07.230 --> 01:34:08.560
<v Speaker 5>and just because there's more options </v>
<v Speaker 5>you could protect yourself,</v>

2140
01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:09.040
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

2141
01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:14.070
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could say that mixed martial </v>

2142
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:15.340
<v Speaker 5>arts fighters have damaged too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'll tell you some do,</v>

2143
01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:20.370
<v Speaker 5>but there's some that don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some that rarely get hit and </v>

2144
01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:20.400
<v Speaker 5>that is possible as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

2145
01:34:20.401 --> 01:34:25.401
<v Speaker 5>the ability to mix up between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>striking and the grappling and the fact </v>

2146
01:34:25.401 --> 01:34:29.371
<v Speaker 5>that you have so many different options </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a creative and spontaneous </v>

2147
01:34:29.371 --> 01:34:34.320
<v Speaker 5>approach as well as being able to drill </v>
<v Speaker 5>things over and over again until they </v>

2148
01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.410
<v Speaker 5>become zen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you reach a certain level,</v>

2149
01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:39.280
<v Speaker 5>you can get away with way less damaged </v>
<v Speaker 5>than any boxer does.</v>

2150
01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:44.520
<v Speaker 5>Like you'll see a certain guys fight in </v>
<v Speaker 5>a five round UFC fight and take very </v>

2151
01:34:44.741 --> 01:34:49.741
<v Speaker 5>little damage like a George St Pierre </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he's so fucking good and his </v>

2152
01:34:49.741 --> 01:34:53.530
<v Speaker 5>plan is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But with boxing and kickboxing,</v>

2153
01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.410
<v Speaker 5>you're standing in front of each other </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're hitting each other period and</v>

2154
01:34:56.411 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 5>there's no downs and there's no.</v>

2155
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:03.010
<v Speaker 5>There's no rear naked choke for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>finish and the first round does none of </v>

2156
01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:03.010
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

2157
01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:06.020
<v Speaker 5>there's slamming bones into your head </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to shut that Mellon off,</v>

2158
01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.030
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And ultimately for me,</v>

2159
01:35:08.031 --> 01:35:11.420
<v Speaker 5>I knew that I had to do something </v>
<v Speaker 5>differently as I was terrified and there</v>

2160
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:12.970
<v Speaker 5>was no future in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2161
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:18.310
<v Speaker 5>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because of that I developed a real </v>

2162
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 5>compassion for understanding like how </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult it is.</v>

2163
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:23.330
<v Speaker 5>I was 21,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had no children.</v>

2164
01:35:23.331 --> 01:35:28.331
<v Speaker 5>I had no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they'd repossessed my car so I </v>

2165
01:35:28.331 --> 01:35:28.331
<v Speaker 5>had no car anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

2166
01:35:28.331 --> 01:35:30.440
<v Speaker 5>it was really like I could live on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheap,</v>

2167
01:35:30.650 --> 01:35:35.650
<v Speaker 5>I could scratch by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you're a person who is trying to </v>

2168
01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:39.221
<v Speaker 5>change careers and you have a family and</v>
<v Speaker 5>your mortgage and you have a car that </v>

2169
01:35:39.221 --> 01:35:43.670
<v Speaker 5>you lease and you've got to pay for your</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids' afterschool activities and that is</v>

2170
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:45.500
<v Speaker 5>unbelievably hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very hard.</v>

2171
01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:47.830
<v Speaker 5>So then at the same time it's like,</v>

2172
01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:49.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life's short man,</v>

2173
01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:50.710
<v Speaker 4>and it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people are not,</v>

2174
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:53.090
<v Speaker 4>are not doing what they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they want to be doing,</v>

2175
01:35:53.091 --> 01:35:55.010
<v Speaker 4>or maybe even what they're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be doing.</v>

2176
01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:56.520
<v Speaker 5>So what did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did you,</v>

2177
01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:00.030
<v Speaker 5>how did you just exit yourself out from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the machine?</v>

2178
01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2179
01:36:01.051 --> 01:36:02.100
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2180
01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:07.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I left corporate law firm life and </v>

2181
01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:07.340
<v Speaker 4>started my own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my own little thing and you know,</v>

2182
01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.130
<v Speaker 4>because I just couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't live that way anymore.</v>

2183
01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.420
<v Speaker 4>What little thing that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about?</v>

2184
01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Just a solo entertainment law practice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2185
01:36:13.690 --> 01:36:18.690
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made a lot less money but was able to </v>

2186
01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:20.350
<v Speaker 4>control my time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was just a little bit before,</v>

2187
01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:25.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I changed the Diet and started getting </v>

2188
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:27.181
<v Speaker 4>back into fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because I had control over my day </v>

2189
01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:30.841
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't have a boss anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could set up my work schedule the way </v>

2190
01:36:30.841 --> 01:36:30.841
<v Speaker 4>that I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Tim ferriss style.</v>

2191
01:36:31.230 --> 01:36:33.730
<v Speaker 4>Then it allowed me to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2192
01:36:33.731 --> 01:36:38.731
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>train at odd hours that wouldn't </v>

2193
01:36:38.731 --> 01:36:38.980
<v Speaker 4>necessarily flow with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2194
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:44.070
<v Speaker 4>nine to five job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I was able to structure my life so </v>

2195
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.830
<v Speaker 4>that I could make that possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

2196
01:36:44.831 --> 01:36:46.270
<v Speaker 4>it was just feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2197
01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:51.570
<v Speaker 4>when you feel like you're guided to move</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a certain direction in a certain </v>

2198
01:36:51.570 --> 01:36:51.570
<v Speaker 4>path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2199
01:36:51.570 --> 01:36:53.470
<v Speaker 4>when your car was repossessed and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were starting to,</v>

2200
01:36:53.490 --> 01:36:56.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do stand up and move into that world.</v>

2201
01:36:56.651 --> 01:37:01.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you felt like this is what you </v>

2202
01:37:01.651 --> 01:37:01.651
<v Speaker 4>want it to be doing what you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be doing.</v>

2203
01:37:01.651 --> 01:37:04.390
<v Speaker 4>Even if there was no kind of real world </v>
<v Speaker 4>material affirmation of that.</v>

2204
01:37:04.391 --> 01:37:04.990
<v Speaker 4>Initially</v>

2205
01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:08.260
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of apprehension.</v>

2206
01:37:08.261 --> 01:37:10.150
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of thinking that I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking up,</v>

2207
01:37:10.151 --> 01:37:11.480
<v Speaker 5>but I was doing the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2208
01:37:11.481 --> 01:37:13.300
<v Speaker 5>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was not much confidence.</v>

2209
01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.600
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew this was my path,</v>

2210
01:37:16.601 --> 01:37:19.420
<v Speaker 5>like I had an idea that this was </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that I could do,</v>

2211
01:37:19.421 --> 01:37:21.940
<v Speaker 5>but I was terrified because I sucked at </v>
<v Speaker 5>it too.</v>

2212
01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.520
<v Speaker 5>There was no evidence that I could ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>be really good at it.</v>

2213
01:37:24.850 --> 01:37:29.850
<v Speaker 5>When I quit teaching martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I was teaching at Boston </v>

2214
01:37:29.850 --> 01:37:31.950
<v Speaker 5>University.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had my own school and um,</v>

2215
01:37:32.110 --> 01:37:32.650
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2216
01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:37.670
<v Speaker 5>it was making a living,</v>
<v Speaker 5>teaching taekwondo and then delivered </v>

2217
01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:39.760
<v Speaker 5>newspapers sometimes in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>occasionally take newspaper routes.</v>

2218
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:43.660
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took to switch from that,</v>

2219
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:47.640
<v Speaker 5>give up training and teaching entirely </v>
<v Speaker 5>altogether to,</v>

2220
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:52.810
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do something that I wasn't very good </v>

2221
01:37:52.810 --> 01:37:52.810
<v Speaker 5>at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking terrible.</v>

2222
01:37:52.810 --> 01:37:54.430
<v Speaker 5>That was a terrifying movie that I would</v>
<v Speaker 5>only make when I was 21.</v>

2223
01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're 21</v>

2224
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.760
<v Speaker 6>year old fucking cocky with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know this like if I was going to</v>

2225
01:37:59.761 --> 01:38:04.761
<v Speaker 6>do that in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that really one of those old school </v>

2226
01:38:04.761 --> 01:38:04.761
<v Speaker 6>alarms right outside</v>

2227
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:07.230
<v Speaker 8>you?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dumb motherfucker.</v>

2228
01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:10.710
<v Speaker 6>But it'd be very hard for me to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that today.</v>

2229
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:11.670
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2230
01:38:11.671 --> 01:38:13.650
<v Speaker 6>it's different when you're 21,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean is,</v>

2231
01:38:14.610 --> 01:38:16.560
<v Speaker 6>does anybody pay attention to car alarms</v>
<v Speaker 6>ever?</v>

2232
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:17.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Open the door,</v>

2233
01:38:17.941 --> 01:38:19.530
<v Speaker 6>Brian and make it louder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good move.</v>

2234
01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:21.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your instinct is never.</v>

2235
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.160
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody stealing a car.</v>

2236
01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:28.530
<v Speaker 6>No fucking alarm is ruining our </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation.</v>

2237
01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.330
<v Speaker 6>Is anybody anybody in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in standup good in the beginning?</v>

2238
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:35.820
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I heard that everybody says they</v>

2239
01:38:35.821 --> 01:38:36.180
<v Speaker 6>were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2240
01:38:36.190 --> 01:38:37.980
<v Speaker 6>they were awful when they can think that</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're good.</v>

2241
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:39.540
<v Speaker 8>What are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man?</v>

2242
01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:40.950
<v Speaker 8>Shut up my microphone off.</v>

2243
01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.140
<v Speaker 6>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2244
01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:45.710
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might think you're good.</v>

2245
01:38:45.711 --> 01:38:50.711
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've heard people say that they were </v>

2246
01:38:50.711 --> 01:38:50.711
<v Speaker 6>good right from the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they are either full of shit or they</v>

2247
01:38:50.711 --> 01:38:51.950
<v Speaker 6>were stealing jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just doesn't make sense that you were</v>

2248
01:38:51.951 --> 01:38:56.951
<v Speaker 6>good right from the beginning unless you</v>
<v Speaker 6>had some experience as something else </v>

2249
01:38:56.951 --> 01:38:56.951
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One,</v>

2250
01:38:56.951 --> 01:38:59.300
<v Speaker 6>one group of people that were actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty decent,</v>

2251
01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.200
<v Speaker 6>not bad for beginners was a alcoholics </v>
<v Speaker 6>anonymous people,</v>

2252
01:39:03.810 --> 01:39:06.020
<v Speaker 6>because this is driving people in </v>
<v Speaker 6>itunes.</v>

2253
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:08.250
<v Speaker 6>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guarantee you,</v>

2254
01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.700
<v Speaker 6>you want to take a quick five minute </v>
<v Speaker 6>break.</v>

2255
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:13.310
<v Speaker 6>You might keep going right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How long do these things keep going?</v>

2256
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:19.390
<v Speaker 6>We'll just pause this folks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to pause this for a couple </v>

2257
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.390
<v Speaker 6>minutes and let this shit stop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

2258
01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:37.260
<v Speaker 6>This ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're very vulnerable folks technically.</v>

2259
01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:51.900
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we were in the middle of talking </v>

2260
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:51.900
<v Speaker 6>about this shows off air.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There it goes.</v>

2261
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:56.340
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were in the middle of talking about </v>

2262
01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:56.360
<v Speaker 6>changing your life and changing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2263
01:39:56.390 --> 01:40:01.390
<v Speaker 6>changing your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>changing your path into something that </v>

2264
01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:03.791
<v Speaker 6>you love.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's something that we stress on this </v>

2265
01:40:03.791 --> 01:40:03.791
<v Speaker 6>show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2266
01:40:03.791 --> 01:40:07.820
<v Speaker 6>like as much as possible because it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that someone doesn't tell you </v>

2267
01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:09.380
<v Speaker 6>when you're growing up and the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>formative period of your life.</v>

2268
01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.930
<v Speaker 6>They don't say you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're different than me.</v>

2269
01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.450
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to find what you're drawn to.</v>

2270
01:40:14.451 --> 01:40:17.000
<v Speaker 6>Find what you love and then go chase.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That.</v>

2271
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:22.330
<v Speaker 6>I love when I see is this mic on Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's working because I don't hear the </v>

2272
01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:27.490
<v Speaker 6>young people that like latch onto </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that they love doing when </v>

2273
01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:27.490
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they're young,</v>

2274
01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:31.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's playing the guitar or </v>

2275
01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:31.360
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is that they're just </v>
<v Speaker 6>passionate about.</v>

2276
01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:35.621
<v Speaker 6>And then they just become very self </v>
<v Speaker 6>directed about it and I'm like so </v>

2277
01:40:35.621 --> 01:40:35.621
<v Speaker 6>jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish I had when I was a kid.</v>

2278
01:40:35.621 --> 01:40:36.580
<v Speaker 6>I wish I had that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2279
01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:40.370
<v Speaker 6>I'd never,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I spent my whole life kind of doing what</v>

2280
01:40:40.371 --> 01:40:43.340
<v Speaker 6>I was supposed to and didn't never </v>
<v Speaker 6>really stopped to think like,</v>

2281
01:40:43.341 --> 01:40:43.940
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do I,</v>

2282
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:46.790
<v Speaker 6>what do I want or what makes me happy or</v>
<v Speaker 6>what am I passionate about?</v>

2283
01:40:46.791 --> 01:40:50.270
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just wasn't really part of my equation,</v>

2284
01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:53.120
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that just seems so wrong.</v>

2285
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:53.830
<v Speaker 6>So it's like,</v>

2286
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:55.420
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's terrible.</v>

2287
01:40:55.421 --> 01:40:56.100
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2288
01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:57.170
<v Speaker 7>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

2289
01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.530
<v Speaker 7>it almost like it doesn't even matter </v>
<v Speaker 7>what it is,</v>

2290
01:40:59.531 --> 01:41:02.050
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody has something inside them that</v>

2291
01:41:02.051 --> 01:41:03.190
<v Speaker 7>they probably,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2292
01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:07.160
<v Speaker 7>love doing or could be passionate about </v>
<v Speaker 7>or could be good at or whatever.</v>

2293
01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:07.470
<v Speaker 7>And</v>

2294
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:10.370
<v Speaker 1>for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's some people</v>

2295
01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.250
<v Speaker 7>stickers?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not Listen,</v>

2296
01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:17.280
<v Speaker 7>I think that not look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not everyone can be an nba basketball </v>

2297
01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.180
<v Speaker 7>player or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So not everyone is innately gifted,</v>

2298
01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:24.300
<v Speaker 7>but I think everybody in signed the </v>
<v Speaker 7>inside of themselves has something that </v>

2299
01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:27.511
<v Speaker 7>makes them happy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think that if you pursue what </v>

2300
01:41:27.511 --> 01:41:28.390
<v Speaker 7>makes you happy without getting so </v>
<v Speaker 7>caught up in,</v>

2301
01:41:28.391 --> 01:41:30.860
<v Speaker 7>how am I going to make money doing this </v>
<v Speaker 7>or there's no career in it,</v>

2302
01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.600
<v Speaker 7>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and living a little bit more faith based</v>

2303
01:41:34.601 --> 01:41:38.570
<v Speaker 7>with what you're doing and focusing more</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the passion that you know,</v>

2304
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:40.690
<v Speaker 7>we'd probably be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we'd probably be better off.</v>

2305
01:41:40.691 --> 01:41:43.740
<v Speaker 7>I think people would be happier if that </v>
<v Speaker 7>was a priority.</v>

2306
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:47.350
<v Speaker 1>There will also be cultural people </v>
<v Speaker 1>already trying to borrow money.</v>

2307
01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:52.410
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a lot more people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Hollywood's full of these kinds of </v>

2308
01:41:52.410 --> 01:41:57.061
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there'll be a lot more people </v>

2309
01:41:57.061 --> 01:41:59.881
<v Speaker 1>that need a loan to try to get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>this next thing that they're trying to </v>

2310
01:41:59.881 --> 01:42:02.281
<v Speaker 1>fucking get launch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kickstarter would have got it done in a </v>

2311
01:42:02.281 --> 01:42:02.281
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>begging.</v>

2313
01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:08.970

<v Speaker 1>So you've figured out a way to put a </v>

2314

2327
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:34.690

<v Speaker 1>for money.</v>

2348
01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:16.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like the people that enjoyed the </v>

2352
01:43:20.281 --> 01:43:21.270
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2353
01:43:21.271 --> 01:43:24.540
<v Speaker 1>we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in the most strange times.</v>

2354
01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.050
<v Speaker 1>This is a really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like that,</v>

2355
01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:28.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2357
01:43:29.731 --> 01:43:31.260
<v Speaker 1>you could do that and you can make a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money.</v>

2358
01:43:31.261 --> 01:43:36.261
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at these fucking guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made millions of dollars of this.</v>

2359
01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Where did that go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way?</v>

2360
01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:43.520
<v Speaker 1>That fucking was the quickest out fad </v>
<v Speaker 1>that coney fad man,</v>

2361
01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:47.460
<v Speaker 1>that's almost like an alien blip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just tested us for retardation,</v>

2362
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:51.770
<v Speaker 1>like a Ph test from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the heavens in the same way that is</v>

2363
01:43:51.771 --> 01:43:52.550
<v Speaker 1>accelerating.</v>

2364
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:55.640
<v Speaker 7>Our attention spans are shrinking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

2365
01:43:55.670 --> 01:44:00.670
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The rapidity with which stuff comes and </v>

2366
01:44:00.670 --> 01:44:01.450
<v Speaker 7>goes now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like it's immediate like it be.</v>

2367
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:03.920
<v Speaker 7>It can be the biggest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then it's immediately.</v>

2368
01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine though Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his email box?</v>

2369
01:44:07.330 --> 01:44:09.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like nothing thin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thin,</v>

2370
01:44:12.090 --> 01:44:16.770
<v Speaker 1>millions of emails stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just nothing,</v>

2371
01:44:16.810 --> 01:44:19.030
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not getting the emails today.</v>

2372
01:44:19.150 --> 01:44:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Kony doesn't even get Nigerian </v>
<v Speaker 1>scammer emails today.</v>

2373
01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.640
<v Speaker 1>That was just viral marketing for Peter </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pan on Blu Ray.</v>

2374
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:25.610
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>totally.</v>

2375
01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.800
<v Speaker 7>And yet at the same time you do this </v>
<v Speaker 7>podcast and you hold people's attention </v>

2376
01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:31.800
<v Speaker 7>for three hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Man,</v>

2377
01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:34.720
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people need to get outside,</v>

2378
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:37.860
<v Speaker 1>stop listening to this fucking show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go mow your lawn sign.</v>

2379
01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:42.870
<v Speaker 1>But they're probably willing to ask a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people do it while they're </v>

2380
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:46.560
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is cool as fuck because then they </v>

2381
01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.260
<v Speaker 1>get to be a part of a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of just be sitting there,</v>

2382
01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:49.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screwing widgets together.</v>

2383
01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:54.700
<v Speaker 7>I got on my long training rides.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just stack it with podcasts because I </v>

2384
01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:55.490
<v Speaker 7>cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't if I'm going out to ride my bike</v>

2385
01:44:55.650 --> 01:45:00.650
<v Speaker 7>for a long day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>eight hour training ride or something </v>

2386
01:45:00.650 --> 01:45:00.650
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't listen to music the whole time,</v>

2387
01:45:00.650 --> 01:45:01.490
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd go insane.</v>

2388
01:45:01.491 --> 01:45:02.070
<v Speaker 7>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2389
01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:07.540
<v Speaker 7>I'll listen to your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a couple other podcasts and I just </v>

2390
01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:07.540
<v Speaker 7>stopped and I just lose myself in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>conversation.</v>

2391
01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:08.930
<v Speaker 7>So for me it's like the longer the </v>
<v Speaker 7>better man.</v>

2392
01:45:08.931 --> 01:45:09.350
<v Speaker 7>I love it.</v>

2393
01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will.</v>

2394
01:45:10.241 --> 01:45:15.241
<v Speaker 1>When we first started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was telling him we were crazy </v>

2395
01:45:15.241 --> 01:45:15.241
<v Speaker 1>for doing an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our Ari Shapiro was constantly go,</v>

2396
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:17.530
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a job.</v>

2397
01:45:17.630 --> 01:45:18.940
<v Speaker 1>More than older people are not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

2398
01:45:19.210 --> 01:45:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2399
01:45:19.810 --> 01:45:21.610
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This don't listen to the rest.</v>

2400
01:45:21.670 --> 01:45:23.290
<v Speaker 1>They just shut it off at any point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2401
01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what fucking difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

2402
01:45:24.970 --> 01:45:26.710
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two hours,</v>

2403
01:45:26.711 --> 01:45:27.970
<v Speaker 1>three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to listen.</v>

2404
01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I get bummed out that a radio shows </v>

2405
01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:33.120
<v Speaker 1>in four hours long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only was in my car for an hour.</v>

2406
01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:34.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen to whatever the fuck you want</v>

2407
01:45:34.451 --> 01:45:39.451
<v Speaker 1>to listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the key is just giving people </v>

2408
01:45:39.451 --> 01:45:39.670
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep keeping it coming.</v>

2409
01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the most important thing is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum,</v>

2410
01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:47.340
<v Speaker 1>keeping it coming and then you become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of people's sort of daily routine.</v>

2411
01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:51.280
<v Speaker 1>And when you become a part of people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>daily routine,</v>

2412
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:54.010
<v Speaker 1>then you have an obligation and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to keep it coming,</v>

2413
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:59.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like now you're bombing a bunch </v>

2414
01:45:59.390 --> 01:46:01.741
<v Speaker 1>of people out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple as you put something </v>

2415
01:46:01.741 --> 01:46:01.741
<v Speaker 1>out and they enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2416
01:46:01.741 --> 01:46:02.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't put it out and you bummed them</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2417
01:46:02.471 --> 01:46:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

2418
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Fucking angry with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking jewelry expectation.</v>

2419
01:46:07.050 --> 01:46:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

2420
01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:08.350
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2421
01:46:08.370 --> 01:46:10.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making junkies and you,</v>

2422
01:46:10.081 --> 01:46:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you have to feed those junkies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2423
01:46:11.771 --> 01:46:14.860
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you're keeping the quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>really high.</v>

2424
01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:18.080
<v Speaker 7>That David Seaman interview was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd never,</v>

2425
01:46:18.110 --> 01:46:19.700
<v Speaker 7>I'd never even heard of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

2426
01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.580
<v Speaker 7>why is he having like a guy's running </v>
<v Speaker 7>for Congress on his show?</v>

2427
01:46:22.581 --> 01:46:23.720
<v Speaker 7>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I listened to it.</v>

2428
01:46:23.721 --> 01:46:24.920
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that is amazing.</v>

2429
01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:27.590
<v Speaker 7>I immediately started following him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's coming back,</v>

2430
01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:32.090
<v Speaker 7>he's doing it to gas and dating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's a real interesting.</v>

2431
01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:37.180
<v Speaker 7>I was thinking about it the other day </v>
<v Speaker 7>because he's the first guy from like </v>

2432
01:46:37.641 --> 01:46:40.170
<v Speaker 7>that generation to be in this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2433
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:42.420
<v Speaker 7>a political candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2434
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:47.470
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the generation gap is very palpable </v>

2435
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:51.840
<v Speaker 7>president,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a very different place and his </v>

2436
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:51.840
<v Speaker 7>priorities</v>

2437
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.040
<v Speaker 1>and perspectives and all of that or so </v>
<v Speaker 1>just in the way he speaks or so </v>

2438
01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.460
<v Speaker 1>different from what we're used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2439
01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:57.900
<v Speaker 1>But he's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart kid.</v>

2440
01:46:58.110 --> 01:47:01.080
<v Speaker 1>He's like 26 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond my shit he is.</v>

2441
01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:03.990
<v Speaker 1>But it's beyond that too because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2442
01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:08.530
<v Speaker 1>he is interested in things and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about things that no one in,</v>

2443
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:13.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditional political stratosphere </v>

2444
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.680
<v Speaker 1>want to get anywhere near,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wild.</v>

2445
01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:17.550
<v Speaker 1>It could either he'll wind up being </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed or he'll be the new king.</v>

2446
01:47:17.670 --> 01:47:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

2447
01:47:18.421 --> 01:47:20.050
<v Speaker 1>we got your backs on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2448
01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2449
01:47:20.871 --> 01:47:21.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2450
01:47:21.531 --> 01:47:26.531
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important that the only way </v>

2451
01:47:26.531 --> 01:47:29.301
<v Speaker 1>this future is going to be any brighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>is if it's very important that we </v>

2452
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:33.240
<v Speaker 1>enlightened young people coming up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative paths of thinking.</v>

2453
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:38.340
<v Speaker 1>But you telling your story that you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone down the exact correct path,</v>

2454
01:47:38.630 --> 01:47:39.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2455
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:42.300
<v Speaker 1>in some sort of a predetermined pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>to success,</v>

2456
01:47:42.301 --> 01:47:44.730
<v Speaker 1>which would equal happiness supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

2457
01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:47.880
<v Speaker 1>And then reaching that point of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2458
01:47:48.090 --> 01:47:53.090
<v Speaker 1>you're not speculating ema,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were one of the rare people that </v>

2459
01:47:53.090 --> 01:47:55.200
<v Speaker 1>actually made it to the end of the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>and went,</v>

2460
01:47:55.201 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 1>this is horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2461
01:47:57.210 --> 01:47:59.730
<v Speaker 1>let's get outta here and you can't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped here.</v>

2462
01:47:59.731 --> 01:48:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Let's get the fuck out of here and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>

2463
01:48:02.161 --> 01:48:07.161
<v Speaker 1>It has to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That message when that message is in </v>

2464
01:48:07.161 --> 01:48:09.270
<v Speaker 1>some kid's ear bud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's on the train headed to his job</v>

2465
01:48:09.271 --> 01:48:14.271
<v Speaker 1>or or headed to school or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that message can resonate and </v>

2466
01:48:14.271 --> 01:48:18.291
<v Speaker 1>change thousands of people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have had more fucking people come up </v>

2467
01:48:18.961 --> 01:48:23.961
<v Speaker 1>to me in the past two years and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast changed my life then than </v>

2468
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:29.900
<v Speaker 1>any than any one thing that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>said to me other than fear is not a </v>

2469
01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:30.870
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably said that anything else,</v>

2470
01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:32.070
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that key,</v>

2471
01:48:32.071 --> 01:48:34.020
<v Speaker 1>that fucking theme keeps happening.</v>

2472
01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:37.590
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it is nutrition and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it is exercise,</v>

2473
01:48:37.591 --> 01:48:42.591
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it also is just this </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that you're not alone in </v>

2474
01:48:42.591 --> 01:48:45.330
<v Speaker 1>thinking like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the standard path seems like shit.</v>

2475
01:48:45.570 --> 01:48:47.610
<v Speaker 1>You're not alone in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your,</v>

2476
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:52.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of other people like us </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and we could all get pigeon </v>

2477
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:56.561
<v Speaker 1>holed into some ridiculous patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were created without individual </v>

2478
01:48:56.561 --> 01:49:00.951
<v Speaker 1>personalities and unique traits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic intentions and qualities in </v>

2479
01:49:00.951 --> 01:49:01.710
<v Speaker 1>mind of that stuff in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just,</v>

2480
01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:04.680
<v Speaker 1>this is a plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a vacuum salesman.</v>

2481
01:49:04.681 --> 01:49:06.510
<v Speaker 1>This is go down that path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

2482
01:49:06.511 --> 01:49:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll be an electrician and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2483
01:49:09.230 --> 01:49:11.640
<v Speaker 1>we're disconnected from our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartbeat.</v>

2484
01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:13.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could say,</v>

2485
01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:14.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2486
01:49:14.041 --> 01:49:14.970
<v Speaker 1>most people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2487
01:49:14.971 --> 01:49:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2488
01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:21.410
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're disassociated from like a higher </v>

2489
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.410
<v Speaker 1>version of ourself.</v>

2490
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:26.330
<v Speaker 1>More authentic version that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out is locked down so deep that </v>

2491
01:49:26.581 --> 01:49:28.420
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like the key is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2492
01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:30.660
<v Speaker 1>unfindable well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've become a.</v>

2493
01:49:30.810 --> 01:49:34.320
<v Speaker 1>We become a victim of our own culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own creation,</v>

2494
01:49:34.321 --> 01:49:39.321
<v Speaker 1>the culture of our own creation as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture of predetermined patterns and </v>

2495
01:49:39.321 --> 01:49:43.140
<v Speaker 1>obligations and things that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>must do that a lot of them suck and we </v>

2496
01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:47.941
<v Speaker 1>become a prisoner to that and this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you do those things somehow or </v>

2497
01:49:47.941 --> 01:49:48.910
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be happier.</v>

2498
01:49:49.090 --> 01:49:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It's ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

2499
01:49:50.831 --> 01:49:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also,</v>

2500
01:49:52.571 --> 01:49:55.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay your fucking rent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you want to drive.</v>

2501
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Cars is expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gas is expensive.</v>

2502
01:49:58.070 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do you gotta you </v>

2503
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 1>gotta get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

2504
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It's finding the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to pay yourself,</v>

2505
01:50:04.330 --> 01:50:08.200
<v Speaker 1>feed yourself and on top of that still </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue a dream.</v>

2506
01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:13.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the hardest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You going to do it before you develop </v>

2507
01:50:13.590 --> 01:50:14.580
<v Speaker 1>any fucking baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live lean.</v>

2508
01:50:14.670 --> 01:50:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're young.</v>

2509
01:50:15.521 --> 01:50:17.830
<v Speaker 1>That I could've done one thing when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was young.</v>

2510
01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:22.860
<v Speaker 1>It was just the live as lean as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep all those doors and options </v>

2511
01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:25.210
<v Speaker 1>open so you don't get stuck in someplace</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be and and,</v>

2512
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:27.700
<v Speaker 1>and make it more difficult for yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out.</v>

2513
01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got out,</v>

2514
01:50:28.601 --> 01:50:30.340
<v Speaker 1>but I could have easily just not gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:42.520
<v Speaker 1>things to be around is someone who never</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the saddest thing in the world,</v>

2532
01:51:10.541 --> 01:51:11.060
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2534
01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:17.120

01:51:21.850 --> 01:51:26.850
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it always feels like one of the </v>

2538
01:51:26.850 --> 01:51:28.360
<v Speaker 1>big things of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of happiness.</v>

2539
01:51:28.361 --> 01:51:33.361
<v Speaker 1>It's like seeing improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either seeing improvement in stuff that </v>

2540
01:51:33.361 --> 01:51:37.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like comedy stuff or seeing improvement </v>

<v Speaker 1>playing pool A,</v>

2543
01:51:41.081 --> 01:51:45.820
<v Speaker 1>anything to me it's like if I don't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement and things then I get like,</v>

2544
01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I get really bummed out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I feel lazy.</v>

2546

<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm just getting by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2547
01:51:52.150 --> 01:51:54.130

2548
01:51:54.131 --> 01:51:57.670
<v Speaker 1>like at least actively working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>improving some aspect of my life,</v>

2549
01:51:57.970 --> 01:52:02.970

<v Speaker 1>He might've had a pager when you met </v>

2601
01:54:11.230 --> 01:54:14.960
<v Speaker 1>deep into his history on a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>had given up the ghost in the pager.</v>

2602
01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how these things just haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>been around that long and yet you can't </v>

2603
01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:22.940
<v Speaker 1>even imagine not having them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the transitionary period</v>

2604
01:54:22.941 --> 01:54:27.941
<v Speaker 1>where a lot of a lot of folks in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>urban community had those little pagers </v>

2605
01:54:28.311 --> 01:54:29.600
<v Speaker 1>that would send messages?</v>

2606
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:33.350
<v Speaker 1>You could send like a little message to </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody meet me at the club.</v>

2607
01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:37.040
<v Speaker 1>They would that the black folks were way</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of the curve on that.</v>

2608
01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:42.670
<v Speaker 1>They were way ahead of the curve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought that would have caught </v>

2609
01:54:42.670 --> 01:54:42.670
<v Speaker 1>on like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys doing?</v>

2610
01:54:42.670 --> 01:54:45.551
<v Speaker 1>You're texting a white tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even say texting wasn't even </v>

2611
01:54:45.551 --> 01:54:45.551
<v Speaker 1>called texting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2612
01:54:45.551 --> 01:54:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you're writing each other letters like,</v>

2613
01:54:46.190 --> 01:54:47.780
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

2614
01:54:47.781 --> 01:54:49.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets loud in the club.</v>

2615
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:50.000

2616
01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:51.620
<v Speaker 1>it gets loud in the club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

2617
01:54:51.650 --> 01:54:55.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what started it all for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it was too loud in the club.</v>

2618
01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:58.400

<v Speaker 1>I found not only that,</v>

2619
01:54:58.401 --> 01:54:59.770
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2620
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:05.310
<v Speaker 1>there's another thing that is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena in the urban community that </v>

2621
01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:05.310
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to talk on speakerphone.</v>

2622
01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:06.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's up with that.</v>

2623
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this on his podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people have accused me of being </v>

2624
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:14.951
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touching that right after they accused </v>

2625
01:55:14.951 --> 01:55:17.831

2626
01:55:17.831 --> 01:55:20.291
<v Speaker 1>and there's a dude standing right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of the place talking on his phone </v>

2627
01:55:20.291 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Hell No.</v>

2628
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh Hell No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do.</v>

2629
01:55:22.461 --> 01:55:27.461
<v Speaker 1>Was talking loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could hear the other dude like </v>

2630
01:55:27.461 --> 01:55:29.030
<v Speaker 1>silver loud and he's maybe he liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard the sheryl crow story and is </v>

2631
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.840
<v Speaker 1>worried about brain tumors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think so.</v>

2632
01:55:29.841 --> 01:55:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they even had a commercial.</v>

2633
01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Remember that commercial for boost </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile.</v>

2634
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:36.650
<v Speaker 1>They would have their cell phones like </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you at?</v>

2635
01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:38.600
<v Speaker 1>They would talk into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not doing this.</v>

2636
01:55:38.601 --> 01:55:40.250
<v Speaker 1>You're not treating it like a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>person phone.</v>

2637
01:55:40.450 --> 01:55:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Now they're holding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You at that was the,</v>

2638
01:55:43.441 --> 01:55:45.930
<v Speaker 1>that was the commercial they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>urban style.</v>

2639
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that didn't work.</v>

2640
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:51.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones and clubs.</v>

2641
01:55:51.190 --> 01:55:52.920
<v Speaker 1>It's when you're on gone speakerphone </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

2642
01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:56.040
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking chaos.</v>

2643
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine,</v>

2644
01:55:58.570 --> 01:56:03.570
<v Speaker 1>remember I used to have jokes in my act </v>
<v Speaker 1>about text messages were stupid before,</v>

2645
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:05.940
<v Speaker 1>like in 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my showtime special.</v>

2646
01:56:05.941 --> 01:56:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I totally marked text messaging like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes you four presses to get an ass.</v>

2647
01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was before anybody had keyboards.</v>

2648
01:56:12.421 --> 01:56:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would like,</v>

2649
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:15.720
<v Speaker 1>they were starting out with that crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2650
01:56:15.721 --> 01:56:18.660
<v Speaker 1>We would have to press four times to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that ladder.</v>

2651
01:56:18.661 --> 01:56:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2652
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.650
<v Speaker 1>That was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that were dinosaurs.</v>

2653
01:56:22.710 --> 01:56:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I remember when the texting plans were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 25 texts per month.</v>

2654
01:56:26.101 --> 01:56:29.060
<v Speaker 1>50 texts per month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2655
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:31.560
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go through the day.</v>

2656
01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:36.090
<v Speaker 1>No girls love texting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are dying and crashing their cars</v>

2657
01:56:36.091 --> 01:56:37.660
<v Speaker 1>because they just can't keep their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers off it.</v>

2658
01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real issue.</v>

2659
01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:43.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say it's one of the worst </v>

2660
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:45.630
<v Speaker 1>distractions ever that you literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot focus on your phone.</v>

2661
01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like zooming in on something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and intently is like,</v>

2662
01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:52.830
<v Speaker 1>it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so non peripheral.</v>

2663
01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:57.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't see anything peripheral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've completely concentrated on that </v>

2664
01:56:57.860 --> 01:56:57.860
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2665
01:56:57.860 --> 01:56:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Some lady almost ran into me at the mall</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>

2666
01:56:58.290 --> 01:57:01.290
<v Speaker 1>She was on her phone and she was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and she looked up and I was like,</v>

2667
01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:03.870
<v Speaker 1>right in the crosswalk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are fucking nuts man.</v>

2668
01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:09.200
<v Speaker 1>They're nuts and we've created this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird culture again that were prisoner </v>

2669
01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:10.860
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the prisons is technology.</v>

2670
01:57:10.861 --> 01:57:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we benefit from it,</v>

2671
01:57:12.661 --> 01:57:17.661
<v Speaker 1>no question about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are also locked into this really </v>

2672
01:57:17.661 --> 01:57:20.700
<v Speaker 1>weird symbiotic relationship with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I am.</v>

2673
01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I do not leave my house without my phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2674
01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:23.730
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2675
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.130
<v Speaker 1>if I don't have my phone on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel weird.</v>

2676
01:57:26.150 --> 01:57:27.090
<v Speaker 1>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Family.</v>

2677
01:57:27.091 --> 01:57:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Where's my fucking phone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll panic.</v>

2678
01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's like all you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you buy a new phone and you stick it </v>

2679
01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:36.440
<v Speaker 1>in your computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your contacts.</v>

2680
01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:38.010
<v Speaker 1>It takes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you lost your phone,</v>

2681
01:57:38.011 --> 01:57:41.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other people,</v>

2682
01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out there on my own with no,</v>

2683
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.000
<v Speaker 1>no tether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they were afraid to be in a </v>

2684
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:50.900
<v Speaker 1>fucking town without a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2685
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I feel bizarre if I leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

2686
01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:58.580
<v Speaker 1>if I'm in a town like say in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a place where you could walk </v>

2687
01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:01.881
<v Speaker 1>around and I leave my phone in my hotel </v>
<v Speaker 1>room and then I'll go downstairs and </v>

2688
01:58:01.881 --> 01:58:01.881
<v Speaker 1>I'll just walk to a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down.</v>

2689
01:58:01.890 --> 01:58:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I feel fucking strange.</v>

2690
01:58:04.770 --> 01:58:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like I can't talk to anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

2691
01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gets even crazier with all the </v>

2692
01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:15.600
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have this compulsion to check </v>

2693
01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:16.770
<v Speaker 1>twitter and see what certain people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that you don't even.</v>

2694
01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:18.640
<v Speaker 1>These are people you don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2695
01:58:18.650 --> 01:58:23.650
<v Speaker 1>some people have it hooked up to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone where they get a text message </v>

2696
01:58:23.650 --> 01:58:25.740
<v Speaker 1>every time someone tweets any sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mention of their name,</v>

2697
01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:26.530
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2698
01:58:27.090 --> 01:58:29.220
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Benson has that.</v>

2699
01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:32.520
<v Speaker 1>So does dot Merera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted a instagram the other day,</v>

2700
01:58:32.521 --> 01:58:37.521
<v Speaker 1>a picture of Don Merera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sexy pool boobs was shooting pool </v>

2701
01:58:37.521 --> 01:58:38.100
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it showed up on his phone.</v>

2702
01:58:38.101 --> 01:58:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly bitch.</v>

2703
01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Turn that shit off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have people just read.</v>

2704
01:58:42.810 --> 01:58:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I think I already have do that now your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone is going to blow up tomorrow.</v>

2705
01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:51.730
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just scrolls like crazy.</v>

2706
01:58:51.730 --> 01:58:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't read all that stuff.</v>

2707
01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I read as much as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is some people think I </v>

2708
01:58:59.730 --> 01:58:59.730
<v Speaker 1>read it all and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you respond to my [inaudible]?</v>

2709
01:58:59.770 --> 01:59:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Get Mad at you responding to tweet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2710
01:59:01.701 --> 01:59:06.701
<v Speaker 1>doors tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What tweet do you want me to really go </v>

2711
01:59:06.701 --> 01:59:06.701
<v Speaker 1>into your thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people here.</v>

2712
01:59:06.701 --> 01:59:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Do just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had the chance to say it again right</v>

2713
01:59:07.991 --> 01:59:08.770
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't.</v>

2714
01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:12.670
<v Speaker 1>You just said bullet foods do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond.</v>

2715
01:59:12.671 --> 01:59:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Foods dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2716
01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:16.810
<v Speaker 1>the negative approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the guilt move.</v>

2717
01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always good.</v>

2718
01:59:18.370 --> 01:59:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I was here in Howard stern talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

2719
01:59:20.231 --> 01:59:23.110
<v Speaker 1>about how many people are nasty to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter and how evil they are.</v>

2720
01:59:23.670 --> 01:59:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get that.</v>

2721
01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I really don't get this pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly positive compared to </v>

2722
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:33.070
<v Speaker 1>other platforms that I've found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get overwhelmingly positive.</v>

2723
01:59:33.190 --> 01:59:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's always a few cons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so easy to block them,</v>

2724
01:59:36.311 --> 01:59:37.300
<v Speaker 1>my wife and bring them on it.</v>

2725
01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really rare and I think a lot of </v>

2726
01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:43.240
<v Speaker 1>people on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you look at their names,</v>

2727
01:59:43.241 --> 01:59:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's their real name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2728
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:49.150
<v Speaker 1>it's more than a St message boards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>message boards.</v>

2729
01:59:49.151 --> 01:59:54.151
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt like we have a message </v>
<v Speaker 1>board on Joe Rogan Dot Net and I've </v>

2730
01:59:54.151 --> 01:59:57.070
<v Speaker 1>always felt like prior to the problem is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anonymity that it provides.</v>

2731
01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>In a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good because people can talk about </v>

2732
02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.891
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like people that have </v>

2733
02:00:04.891 --> 02:00:04.891
<v Speaker 1>sensitive jobs and people that are at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

2734
02:00:04.891 --> 02:00:05.740
<v Speaker 1>they can get away with talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and there's no way to google them</v>

2735
02:00:05.741 --> 02:00:09.700
<v Speaker 1>and data reference their name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a way it's bad because people say</v>

2736
02:00:09.701 --> 02:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>shit without any reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't worry about the,</v>

2737
02:00:13.241 --> 02:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social repercussions of looking at a</v>

2738
02:00:15.461 --> 02:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>person's eye and calling them a country </v>
<v Speaker 1>Douche bag,</v>

2739
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>

2740
02:00:18.821 --> 02:00:20.110
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't like that.</v>

2741
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:23.800
<v Speaker 1>That negativity is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just these verbal barb's.</v>

2742
02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I think with twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of times people have their </v>

2743
02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:31.951
<v Speaker 1>photo that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not everybody but a good </v>

2744
02:00:31.951 --> 02:00:32.080
<v Speaker 1>percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm looking at my,</v>

2745
02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>my twitter feed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of these are people's names.</v>

2746
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2747
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a few that aren't because a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>like weird names or you know,</v>

2748
02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.580
<v Speaker 1>it's like maybe one of them's Divo </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

2749
02:00:42.581 --> 02:00:44.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not Divo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2750
02:00:44.350 --> 02:00:47.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's depo is me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is his twitter name to Divo son.</v>

2751
02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might like diva but you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not divo and who are you really?</v>

2752
02:00:51.150 --> 02:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the name is Mike Callahan </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the fuck his name is.</v>

2753
02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:59.840
<v Speaker 1>When I think the more we have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more we have like a sort of a </v>

2754
02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:04.621
<v Speaker 1>transparency about who I think people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are less likely to just lash out and </v>

2755
02:01:04.621 --> 02:01:05.170
<v Speaker 1>have it become super.</v>

2756
02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:06.210
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's true.</v>

2757
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:10.110
<v Speaker 7>I mean I think like a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 7>ago when you had,</v>

2758
02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:13.170
<v Speaker 7>you retreated like a video I made of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>Kale shake or something like that.</v>

2759
02:01:13.171 --> 02:01:16.350
<v Speaker 7>We had a back and forth over Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 7>vitamix or something like that,</v>

2760
02:01:16.351 --> 02:01:21.351
<v Speaker 7>so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you retweeted this stupid little </v>

2761
02:01:21.351 --> 02:01:24.411
<v Speaker 7>video that I made of just me making a a </v>
<v Speaker 7>drink after a run and I got slammed with</v>

2762
02:01:26.210 --> 02:01:28.830
<v Speaker 7>desk squad,</v>
<v Speaker 7>army full of fact.</v>

2763
02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.280
<v Speaker 7>Just like if I saw that guy on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>street I would,</v>

2764
02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:34.820
<v Speaker 7>I would stab him in the face and like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is it?</v>

2765
02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.140
<v Speaker 7>Like the most benign thing my face for </v>
<v Speaker 7>me,</v>

2766
02:01:37.170 --> 02:01:38.310
<v Speaker 7>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2767
02:01:38.311 --> 02:01:39.500
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2768
02:01:39.570 --> 02:01:44.570
<v Speaker 7>really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean there were some that were fine </v>

2769
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.570
<v Speaker 7>too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I was like suddenly out of the blue,</v>

2770
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:48.791
<v Speaker 7>like all these comments popped up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so it's clearly as a result of you </v>

2771
02:01:48.791 --> 02:01:49.000
<v Speaker 7>having this huge following or whatever.</v>

2772
02:01:50.110 --> 02:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Have you though for your dietary choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very threatened by the Kale Joe?</v>

2773
02:01:55.100 --> 02:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they don't know what to do </v>

2774
02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>with me because I enjoy the Kale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the Kale.</v>

2775
02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2776
02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pure vegetable,</v>

2777
02:02:01.670 --> 02:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>just meals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just food is just food,</v>

2778
02:02:04.371 --> 02:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>but the people need to be on a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

2779
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's now during the desk about army and </v>

2780
02:02:13.450 --> 02:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they feel like they're being attacked</v>

2781
02:02:13.450 --> 02:02:17.620
<v Speaker 1>by vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll fucking throw out all their </v>

2782
02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>

2783
02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:23.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all just get along to quote Rodney </v>

2784
02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:24.740
<v Speaker 1>King for drown on PCP and a swimming </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool.</v>

2785
02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that,</v>

2786
02:02:27.981 --> 02:02:29.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is annoying people.</v>

2787
02:02:29.850 --> 02:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not vegetarian meat eaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2788
02:02:33.110 --> 02:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is annoying people or </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are ignoring that.</v>

2789
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not your different ideology or </v>

2790
02:02:41.470 --> 02:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>different desire.</v>

2791
02:02:41.470 --> 02:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I know people that legitimately really </v>
<v Speaker 1>love classical music and they can't wait</v>

2792
02:02:43.971 --> 02:02:47.630
<v Speaker 1>to get home to put on headphones and sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in front of some shit.</v>

2793
02:02:47.631 --> 02:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a drive me out of my head.</v>

2794
02:02:50.571 --> 02:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I can listen to classical music for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple minutes and then I go,</v>

2795
02:02:53.631 --> 02:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you know what I can be listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now led Zepplin.</v>

2796
02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Why am I listening to this stupid shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I can hear a whole lot of love?</v>

2797
02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:00.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

2798
02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't like classical music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that it's not </v>

2799
02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:05.920
<v Speaker 1>awesome to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2800
02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:08.300
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with dietary </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

2801
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Same thing that the way you dress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had it,</v>

2802
02:03:11.061 --> 02:03:13.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just enjoy your life.</v>

2803
02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 1>We've lost a little bit of a tolerance,</v>

2804
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:18.650
<v Speaker 7>dense intolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2805
02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:21.550
<v Speaker 7>it's one of the dumbest things to lose </v>
<v Speaker 7>its,</v>

2806
02:03:21.610 --> 02:03:24.610
<v Speaker 7>you know that diversity is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Huge.</v>

2807
02:03:24.650 --> 02:03:25.630
<v Speaker 7>So why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2808
02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:29.390
<v Speaker 7>why are you taking a dump on somebody </v>
<v Speaker 7>else's preference that has nothing to do</v>

2809
02:03:29.391 --> 02:03:29.810
<v Speaker 7>with you?</v>

2810
02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

2811
02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:36.020
<v Speaker 1>tolerance and acceptance of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits your life very much directly.</v>

2812
02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:41.280
<v Speaker 1>It benefits the way you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more tolerant and accepting you are </v>

2813
02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.710
<v Speaker 1>a people and the more you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just cool with people.</v>

2814
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:45.500
<v Speaker 1>The more positive interactions you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

2815
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:47.660
<v Speaker 1>the more positive interactions you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

2816
02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.470
<v Speaker 1>the better your your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your feeling in life will be.</v>

2817
02:03:51.710 --> 02:03:54.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's like a real direct thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2818
02:03:54.110 --> 02:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative shit that a lot of people </v>

2819
02:03:59.110 --> 02:04:00.980
<v Speaker 1>project at people for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it really is,</v>

2820
02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:04.790
<v Speaker 1>is your own shortcomings and magnified </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your personality traits.</v>

2821
02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's being projected.</v>

2822
02:04:07.101 --> 02:04:12.101
<v Speaker 1>A very rarely does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely does he just choose them to </v>

2823
02:04:12.101 --> 02:04:12.890
<v Speaker 1>for your eye or the target of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>

2824
02:04:13.190 --> 02:04:15.860
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is you wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bullshit.</v>

2825
02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to explain this to a guy once who </v>

2826
02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>was a heckler.</v>

2827
02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2828
02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a loser.</v>

2829
02:04:21.621 --> 02:04:23.750
<v Speaker 1>There's no way it can be a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2830
02:04:23.751 --> 02:04:28.751
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really think that Michael Jordan </v>

2831
02:04:28.751 --> 02:04:31.511
<v Speaker 1>would go to a comedy club and haggle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think anybody who'd be really </v>

2832
02:04:31.511 --> 02:04:34.061
<v Speaker 1>good at anything would interrupt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance and just try to interject </v>

2833
02:04:34.061 --> 02:04:36.110
<v Speaker 1>now you have no appreciation for things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are good.</v>

2834
02:04:36.111 --> 02:04:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

2835
02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:37.590
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2836
02:04:37.610 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>a dire moment for you where you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize this.</v>

2837
02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who would try to fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's time,</v>

2838
02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to fuck up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyment,</v>

2839
02:04:47.161 --> 02:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got something wrong with you,</v>

2840
02:04:49.621 --> 02:04:54.621
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got something wrong with you 100 </v>

2841
02:04:54.621 --> 02:04:54.621
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around it.</v>

2842
02:04:54.621 --> 02:04:57.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to be fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you weren't that way,</v>

2843
02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:59.340
<v Speaker 1>you would be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>

2844
02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:02.460
<v Speaker 1>like that energy that you put out is </v>
<v Speaker 1>palpable.</v>

2845
02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:06.360
<v Speaker 1>The energy that you put out being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole is real and it does come.</v>

2846
02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It does flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your light comes back.</v>

2847
02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for you,</v>

2848
02:05:11.941 --> 02:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>you feel that's a dietary as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2849
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:18.320
<v Speaker 1>So what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean?</v>

2850
02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean as far as like putting out energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean you're taking in vegetables,</v>

2851
02:05:21.550 --> 02:05:24.630
<v Speaker 1>you're almost like a pure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2852
02:05:24.631 --> 02:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>that that existence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2853
02:05:26.261 --> 02:05:31.230
<v Speaker 1>of only eating vegetables and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not being connected to animal farming or</v>

2854
02:05:31.530 --> 02:05:34.920
<v Speaker 1>any of that horrible shit that you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're still all connected to it,</v>

2855
02:05:35.010 --> 02:05:40.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just by virtue of living here and </v>

2856
02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:40.010
<v Speaker 1>all the other things that we have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you drive a prius posts?</v>

2857
02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I know if you drive a van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking muscle cars,</v>

2858
02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>we're very proud of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could fucking.</v>

2859
02:05:48.731 --> 02:05:53.731
<v Speaker 1>What are we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have we been talking about these </v>

2860
02:05:53.731 --> 02:05:53.731
<v Speaker 1>past two hours?</v>

2861
02:05:53.731 --> 02:05:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I really wish you really wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it needed to get a kickstart,</v>

2862
02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:59.250
<v Speaker 1>tapped out and to get a CTO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A muscle car.</v>

2863
02:06:01.230 --> 02:06:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2864
02:06:01.591 --> 02:06:02.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2865
02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2866
02:06:05.521 --> 02:06:09.360
<v Speaker 1>it sounds weird to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's definitely like a feeling of</v>

2867
02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:13.530
<v Speaker 1>like greater harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The environment makes sense.</v>

2868
02:06:13.770 --> 02:06:15.990
<v Speaker 1>It sounds really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

2869
02:06:15.991 --> 02:06:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2870
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going hunting for the first time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>October with Steve Rinella.</v>

2871
02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:25.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who had a TV show on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel channel called the wow within and</v>

2872
02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:30.000
<v Speaker 1>now he's got a new one called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediator and his show is essentially his</v>

2873
02:06:30.001 --> 02:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>original show was all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2874
02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:37.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of like living off the land </v>

2875
02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>and he would do a lot of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like really similar to what like,</v>

2876
02:06:38.110 --> 02:06:39.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2877
02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:43.620
<v Speaker 1>people had to do in the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would kill a water buffalo with</v>

2878
02:06:43.621 --> 02:06:44.940
<v Speaker 1>a musket and shit like that.</v>

2879
02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And his new show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about,</v>

2880
02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you call like fair chase hunting.</v>

2881
02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:54.560
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really paying attention to a lot </v>

2882
02:06:54.931 --> 02:06:59.931
<v Speaker 1>lately is the idea of a hunter gatherer </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle being I'm actually,</v>

2883
02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:03.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2884
02:07:03.901 --> 02:07:08.901
<v Speaker 1>like a physically benefiting experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people and that there are certain </v>

2885
02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>amounts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain system or a reward </v>

2886
02:07:15.110 --> 02:07:18.201
<v Speaker 1>system that's a in our bodies that is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with growing your own food.</v>

2887
02:07:20.490 --> 02:07:25.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain reward system that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with the hunting and fishing </v>

2888
02:07:25.490 --> 02:07:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and that our bodies are essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same as the bodies of people that lived,</v>

2889
02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:29.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>

2890
02:07:29.971 --> 02:07:34.971
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's very little genetic change and </v>

2891
02:07:34.971 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 1>that we still have these reward systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these primal feelings</v>

2892
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.210
<v Speaker 5>of satisfaction that are built into our </v>
<v Speaker 5>very being as a human being in order to,</v>

2893
02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:45.620
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to motivate us to do the correct things </v>

2894
02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:46.900
<v Speaker 5>to survive and to carry on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm at,</v>

2895
02:07:46.901 --> 02:07:49.480
<v Speaker 5>me personally as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a person who is a mediator.</v>

2896
02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:51.970
<v Speaker 5>I've never killed an animal ever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2897
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.580
<v Speaker 5>except accidentally like car accidents </v>
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>

2898
02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:57.040
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never like went hunting.</v>

2899
02:07:57.041 --> 02:08:02.041
<v Speaker 5>I've never actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I shot a squirrel with a bb when I was </v>

2900
02:08:02.041 --> 02:08:04.670
<v Speaker 5>little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I might've killed that little </v>

2901
02:08:04.670 --> 02:08:04.670
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

2902
02:08:04.670 --> 02:08:04.670
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Squirrel.</v>

2903
02:08:04.670 --> 02:08:06.700
<v Speaker 5>But what I'm saying is I've never hunted</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything and killed what I,</v>

2904
02:08:06.701 --> 02:08:09.550
<v Speaker 5>you know what I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know how I'm going to feel,</v>

2905
02:08:09.730 --> 02:08:10.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might,</v>

2906
02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.430
<v Speaker 5>I might shoot a deer and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2907
02:08:12.431 --> 02:08:17.431
<v Speaker 5>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to get some beats because I'm </v>

2908
02:08:17.431 --> 02:08:17.431
<v Speaker 5>done with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or I might go,</v>

2909
02:08:17.431 --> 02:08:17.431
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

2910
02:08:17.431 --> 02:08:20.650
<v Speaker 5>if I didn't shoot that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would probably get hit by a car or it</v>

2911
02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:23.240
<v Speaker 5>would get killed by a coyote or you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2912
02:08:23.570 --> 02:08:24.280
<v Speaker 5>it's going to die.</v>

2913
02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.050
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to live forever and </v>
<v Speaker 5>become magical.</v>

2914
02:08:26.051 --> 02:08:27.880
<v Speaker 5>What's the term you used?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fair,</v>

2915
02:08:28.270 --> 02:08:29.650
<v Speaker 5>fair chase,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fair chase.</v>

2916
02:08:29.651 --> 02:08:31.720
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That means you don't set a bait.</v>

2917
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:36.840
<v Speaker 5>You don't put out like bait and leave </v>
<v Speaker 5>food and very certain certain spot over </v>

2918
02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:38.380
<v Speaker 5>and over again so that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the animals will be there.</v>

2919
02:08:38.590 --> 02:08:43.590
<v Speaker 5>In Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they actually have feeders where they </v>

2920
02:08:43.590 --> 02:08:44.560
<v Speaker 5>have these giant drums that dispense </v>
<v Speaker 5>food on a timer.</v>

2921
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:49.890
<v Speaker 5>So in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the deer just start walking in because </v>

2922
02:08:49.890 --> 02:08:52.711
<v Speaker 5>they know they're going to get fed </v>
<v Speaker 5>because most of the time you're not </v>

2923
02:08:52.711 --> 02:08:54.661
<v Speaker 5>hunting there because they have giant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they call high fence ranches and </v>

2924
02:08:54.661 --> 02:08:56.890
<v Speaker 5>these high fence ranches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's essentially like they've converted.</v>

2925
02:08:56.950 --> 02:09:01.950
<v Speaker 5>They've done like a mixture of farming </v>
<v Speaker 5>and hunting because it's like,</v>

2926
02:09:02.471 --> 02:09:05.020
<v Speaker 5>it's really like farming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're just harvesting,</v>

2927
02:09:05.021 --> 02:09:07.120
<v Speaker 5>meet the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're in a blind.</v>

2928
02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:09.670
<v Speaker 5>The animal walks out the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes to every day,</v>

2929
02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:14.860
<v Speaker 5>goes to get his food above bloomy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His heart blows out of his chest and </v>

2930
02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:15.510
<v Speaker 5>he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He lives there with his legs kick in.</v>

2931
02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:17.320
<v Speaker 5>You turned them into meat and you cook </v>
<v Speaker 5>them up.</v>

2932
02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:22.380
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a way more humane solution for </v>

2933
02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:24.460
<v Speaker 5>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>than a factory farm.</v>

2934
02:09:24.461 --> 02:09:26.530
<v Speaker 5>No doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not criticizing it,</v>

2935
02:09:26.770 --> 02:09:29.480
<v Speaker 5>but that's not what Steven Rinella does </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Steven Nella does he,</v>

2936
02:09:29.481 --> 02:09:34.481
<v Speaker 5>he believes that the real satisfaction </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes from like stocking the game,</v>

2937
02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:39.820
<v Speaker 5>finding the right place to be when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2938
02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:43.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>upwind or downwind and getting away from</v>

2939
02:09:43.121 --> 02:09:47.770
<v Speaker 5>the area where the animal can detect you</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2940
02:09:47.771 --> 02:09:52.480
<v Speaker 5>and stalking and hunting an animal the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way people did thousands and thousands</v>

2941
02:09:52.670 --> 02:09:54.170
<v Speaker 7>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you read,</v>

2942
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:55.910
<v Speaker 7>did you read that book?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Born to run?</v>

2943
02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:58.490
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what is it?</v>

2944
02:09:58.530 --> 02:10:00.890
<v Speaker 7>It's called born to run by Christopher </v>
<v Speaker 7>mcdougall.</v>

2945
02:10:00.891 --> 02:10:05.891
<v Speaker 7>It's an amazing book.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's a contributing writer to I think </v>

2946
02:10:05.891 --> 02:10:10.241
<v Speaker 7>men's journal or outside magazine or </v>
<v Speaker 7>something like that was a hugely </v>

2947
02:10:10.241 --> 02:10:11.770
<v Speaker 7>successful book that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that uh,</v>

2948
02:10:12.090 --> 02:10:13.790
<v Speaker 7>let me shut this door.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's people in our.</v>

2949
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:20.030
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>sorry.</v>

2950
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:23.920
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy went down to,</v>

2951
02:10:23.921 --> 02:10:26.560
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the Copper Canyon in Mexico,</v>

2952
02:10:26.561 --> 02:10:31.561
<v Speaker 7>which is this really remote area and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>think it's in the northern part of </v>

2953
02:10:31.561 --> 02:10:32.020
<v Speaker 7>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but below that,</v>

2954
02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:33.800
<v Speaker 7>the Arizona board or somewhere</v>

2955
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:39.100
<v Speaker 6>and it's like a land lost in time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's impossible to get in and out </v>

2956
02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:42.641
<v Speaker 6>of there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there are these tribes in there </v>

2957
02:10:42.641 --> 02:10:42.680
<v Speaker 6>called the Tarahumara and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're like this,</v>

2958
02:10:42.681 --> 02:10:45.020
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this uh,</v>

2959
02:10:46.070 --> 02:10:51.070
<v Speaker 6>population of endurance runners that </v>
<v Speaker 6>essentially run barefoot with these </v>

2960
02:10:51.070 --> 02:10:51.860
<v Speaker 6>little,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have little sandals or whatever,</v>

2961
02:10:51.861 --> 02:10:56.861
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they'll run incredible distances </v>

2962
02:10:56.861 --> 02:10:59.171
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and in the course of the book he gets </v>

2963
02:10:59.171 --> 02:11:02.301
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he gets to sort of commune with these </v>

2964
02:11:02.301 --> 02:11:04.511
<v Speaker 6>people and it goes into kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 6>ultra running and the barefoot running </v>

2965
02:11:04.511 --> 02:11:05.360
<v Speaker 6>movement and the history of how they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>running.</v>

2966
02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:10.520
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how Nike sort of created this business </v>

2967
02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:10.520
<v Speaker 6>around running shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's fascinating.</v>

2968
02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:13.550
<v Speaker 6>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things he talks about is this</v>

2969
02:11:13.551 --> 02:11:18.530
<v Speaker 6>theory that man evolved as a persistent </v>
<v Speaker 6>hunter as and that and that we were,</v>

2970
02:11:18.710 --> 02:11:23.710
<v Speaker 6>we evolved to be endurance runners </v>
<v Speaker 6>because we would go to chase down these </v>

2971
02:11:23.991 --> 02:11:28.991
<v Speaker 6>animals that were better,</v>
<v Speaker 6>faster than us that have much more fast </v>

2972
02:11:28.991 --> 02:11:28.991
<v Speaker 6>twitch muscle.</v>

2973
02:11:28.991 --> 02:11:29.690
<v Speaker 6>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't run as fast as them,</v>

2974
02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:32.200
<v Speaker 6>but eventually they just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get exhausted.</v>

2975
02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.360
<v Speaker 6>They can't run days at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And these humans would just patiently </v>

2976
02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:40.580
<v Speaker 6>like sort of track them and just follow </v>
<v Speaker 6>them and follow them and follow them.</v>

2977
02:11:40.581 --> 02:11:43.730
<v Speaker 6>And then just wait until the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like keeled over out of dehydration,</v>

2978
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:47.480
<v Speaker 6>exhaustion and that's how they would </v>
<v Speaker 6>conquer the animal and bring it back to,</v>

2979
02:11:47.630 --> 02:11:50.000
<v Speaker 6>to eat people still do it today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2980
02:11:50.001 --> 02:11:52.220
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the idea that we were sort of bred to</v>

2981
02:11:52.221 --> 02:11:56.210
<v Speaker 6>be endurance athletes or runners out as </v>
<v Speaker 6>a result of this,</v>

2982
02:11:56.580 --> 02:12:01.580
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thousands of however many thousands of </v>

2983
02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:01.580
<v Speaker 6>years of doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's fascinating.</v>

2984
02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:01.580
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2985
02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:02.320
<v Speaker 6>did they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2986
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:07.390
<v Speaker 6>did they use weapons when they first did</v>
<v Speaker 6>it or did they just strangle them and </v>

2987
02:12:07.390 --> 02:12:07.530
<v Speaker 6>hit them with a rock once they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2988
02:12:07.610 --> 02:12:09.350
<v Speaker 6>I think it was sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was a really.</v>

2989
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:10.790
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these animals,</v>

2990
02:12:11.850 --> 02:12:15.440
<v Speaker 6>they'd be so exhausted that there wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>much need to do anything severe.</v>

2991
02:12:15.441 --> 02:12:18.890
<v Speaker 6>Like they'd kill over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get him with a rock or if we really</v>

2992
02:12:18.891 --> 02:12:23.891
<v Speaker 6>knew for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like really funny when you have </v>

2993
02:12:23.891 --> 02:12:24.350
<v Speaker 6>like things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how did we develop disability to do</v>

2994
02:12:24.351 --> 02:12:29.351
<v Speaker 6>this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When did they figure out about </v>

2995
02:12:29.351 --> 02:12:29.351
<v Speaker 6>persistence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hunting and running.</v>

2996
02:12:29.351 --> 02:12:29.480
<v Speaker 6>It will be really amazing if we could </v>
<v Speaker 6>know for sure.</v>

2997
02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:34.780
<v Speaker 6>It's so funny about how much of like the</v>
<v Speaker 6>past of human beings is like this weird </v>

2998
02:12:36.170 --> 02:12:41.170
<v Speaker 6>ideas where you're trying to like piece </v>
<v Speaker 6>it together and like formulate a vision </v>

2999
02:12:41.170 --> 02:12:45.881
<v Speaker 6>of how things went down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really hard to just extrapolate </v>

3000
02:12:45.881 --> 02:12:46.070
<v Speaker 6>that across,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3001
02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:51.200
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and apply it to a certain nutritional </v>

3002
02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:51.200
<v Speaker 6>way of living.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3003
02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:51.200
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with Paleo,</v>

3004
02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:52.610
<v Speaker 6>it's sort of all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well Paleolithic,</v>

3005
02:12:52.611 --> 02:12:53.930
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many,</v>

3006
02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.960
<v Speaker 6>how many thousands of years ago are we </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about are millions of years ago </v>

3007
02:12:58.960 --> 02:12:58.960
<v Speaker 6>for a million,</v>
<v Speaker 6>40 million,</v>

3008
02:12:58.960 --> 02:12:59.780
<v Speaker 6>40,000,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3009
02:12:59.870 --> 02:13:01.250
<v Speaker 6>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where your body,</v>

3010
02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:07.550
<v Speaker 6>what part of the world and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>certain people's evolved to had an </v>

3011
02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:11.770
<v Speaker 6>approach to food because of what was </v>
<v Speaker 6>available to them in a different way </v>

3012
02:13:11.770 --> 02:13:11.770
<v Speaker 6>than somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3013
02:13:11.770 --> 02:13:16.210
<v Speaker 6>and piecing that puzzle together is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's tricky and they've just </v>

3014
02:13:16.491 --> 02:13:21.491
<v Speaker 6>started finding some really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 6>things that show that you might be </v>

3015
02:13:21.531 --> 02:13:24.800
<v Speaker 6>dealing with far,</v>
<v Speaker 6>far older societies than we think in the</v>

3016
02:13:24.801 --> 02:13:29.801
<v Speaker 6>first place I could.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were always pushing the dates back </v>

3017
02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:29.801
<v Speaker 6>of like when people figured certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>things out,</v>

3018
02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:32.460
<v Speaker 6>like there's some cave art that they've </v>
<v Speaker 6>discovered</v>

3019
02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:34.530
<v Speaker 1>now that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at like 40,000</v>

3020
02:13:34.531 --> 02:13:36.300
<v Speaker 1>plus years ago and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3021
02:13:36.301 --> 02:13:38.700
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just throws things way back,</v>

3022
02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3023
02:13:40.710 --> 02:13:45.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really a fascinating thing trying </v>

3024
02:13:45.710 --> 02:13:48.201
<v Speaker 1>to piece together what human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we become what we are right now and </v>

3025
02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:50.600
<v Speaker 1>what led us to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3026
02:13:50.601 --> 02:13:55.601
<v Speaker 1>this apex of 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole process of hunter and </v>

3027
02:13:55.601 --> 02:13:56.280
<v Speaker 1>gathering of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's where people,</v>

3028
02:13:56.281 --> 02:13:59.640
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people say the thing went wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we developed agriculture.</v>

3029
02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:04.820
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the thing went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we figured out how to have a </v>

3030
02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:07.191
<v Speaker 1>surplus because then we had to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>that surplus and then we had this big </v>

3031
02:14:07.191 --> 02:14:09.891
<v Speaker 1>fucking forte,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was also sort of the birth of </v>

3032
02:14:09.891 --> 02:14:12.120
<v Speaker 1>civilization and the and the intellect </v>
<v Speaker 1>to where it went wrong.</v>

3033
02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:13.590
<v Speaker 1>What went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3034
02:14:13.591 --> 02:14:14.960
<v Speaker 1>we fucked it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked it up.</v>

3035
02:14:14.961 --> 02:14:19.961
<v Speaker 1>I thinking we could have been having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great time back in the spending a week </v>

3036
02:14:19.961 --> 02:14:23.550
<v Speaker 1>chasing down one because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video where the guy does it,</v>

3037
02:14:23.551 --> 02:14:24.600
<v Speaker 1>he does it in Africa.</v>

3038
02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>The video that I saw and he's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>persistent.</v>

3039
02:14:27.401 --> 02:14:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Haunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he just lit.</v>

3040
02:14:28.650 --> 02:14:31.260
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take him forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a long day.</v>

3041
02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:36.520
<v Speaker 1>He just kept chasing this fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the end he was so tired and the </v>

3042
02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:37.410
<v Speaker 1>they said that the guy doesn't even eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3043
02:14:37.411 --> 02:14:42.411
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who kills the animal didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it out of respect for the process or</v>

3044
02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the connection that he has to the </v>

3045
02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:48.740
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we.</v>

3046
02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:52.611
<v Speaker 1>That's the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the weirdest things </v>

3047
02:14:52.611 --> 02:14:55.050
<v Speaker 1>about human beings is our lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to what food is.</v>

3048
02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:56.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are,</v>

3049
02:14:56.780 --> 02:14:59.940
<v Speaker 1>they get upset if you want to go hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet they're wearing leather.</v>

3050
02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:03.510
<v Speaker 1>People that eat meat but would never </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill it themselves.</v>

3051
02:15:03.511 --> 02:15:08.511
<v Speaker 1>It's like we've really like figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to completely disconnect people </v>

3052
02:15:09.181 --> 02:15:10.710
<v Speaker 1>from the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I just can't.</v>

3053
02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't see that being natural while </v>
<v Speaker 1>still living with this ignorance denial.</v>

3054
02:15:15.691 --> 02:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>And disassociation are very powerful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3055
02:15:18.291 --> 02:15:21.960
<v Speaker 1>they're powerful defense mechanisms for </v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting through the day.</v>

3056
02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you fix that?</v>

3057
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:26.280
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

3058
02:15:26.281 --> 02:15:27.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a way to,</v>

3059
02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:32.960
<v Speaker 1>to inspire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspire in the classroom some,</v>

3060
02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:37.350
<v Speaker 1>a different way of looking at things so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't grow up to be the same</v>

3061
02:15:37.590 --> 02:15:40.500
<v Speaker 1>fucked up pattern monkeys over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again?</v>

3062
02:15:41.070 --> 02:15:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because in some ways I feel </v>

3063
02:15:46.070 --> 02:15:48.771
<v Speaker 1>like it's changing and it's getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and in an otherwise I feel like </v>

3064
02:15:48.771 --> 02:15:48.771
<v Speaker 1>it's moving backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3065
02:15:48.771 --> 02:15:52.971
<v Speaker 1>when you have the Internet and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this unbelievable amount of </v>

3066
02:15:52.971 --> 02:15:56.391
<v Speaker 1>information available to you where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can find out anything in an instant and </v>

3067
02:15:56.391 --> 02:15:59.640
<v Speaker 1>you can get to the bottom of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in subject x,</v>

3068
02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:01.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a good thing,</v>

3069
02:16:01.891 --> 02:16:02.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3070
02:16:02.190 --> 02:16:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pulls the covers on a lot of people </v>

3071
02:16:07.190 --> 02:16:07.190
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of organizations and what have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3072
02:16:07.190 --> 02:16:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And yet at the same time you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional media that's becoming even </v>

3073
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.370
<v Speaker 1>more and more entrenched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3074
02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:15.750
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like remember when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids it was like the local news and that</v>

3075
02:16:15.751 --> 02:16:20.751
<v Speaker 1>was how you got your news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to believe what they tell </v>

3076
02:16:20.751 --> 02:16:22.290
<v Speaker 1>you and and now it's with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3077
02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:27.320
<v Speaker 1>you watch the news and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know if that's the whole </v>

3078
02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:27.860
<v Speaker 1>story and saying this and it's easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go online and,</v>

3079
02:16:28.230 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extrapolate upon that</v>

3080
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:33.130
<v Speaker 4>and find out more and figure out why </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not telling you this part of the</v>

3081
02:16:33.131 --> 02:16:35.470
<v Speaker 4>story or that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas he didn't have that before.</v>

3082
02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:41.040
<v Speaker 4>Yet at the same time I feel like we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more entrenched in this fear </v>

3083
02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:44.410
<v Speaker 4>based culture in which there's a clamp </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and so where does that lead us?</v>

3084
02:16:44.411 --> 02:16:48.030
<v Speaker 4>Like is it ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does that like implode on itself or like</v>

3085
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.660
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3086
02:16:48.670 --> 02:16:50.650
<v Speaker 4>how does it all play out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does that all play out?</v>

3087
02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:51.520
<v Speaker 4>That's the question,</v>

3088
02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:53.420
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is playing out and I think,</v>

3089
02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:55.940
<v Speaker 5>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without sounding grandiose,</v>

3090
02:16:56.450 --> 02:16:59.900
<v Speaker 5>conversations like this are a part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the decision making process.</v>

3091
02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:02.740
<v Speaker 5>It's a part of how society looks at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

3092
02:17:02.970 --> 02:17:06.140
<v Speaker 5>about how we approach it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's a lot of people that are</v>

3093
02:17:06.141 --> 02:17:09.260
<v Speaker 5>like you that realizes this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this is not natural,</v>

3094
02:17:09.261 --> 02:17:14.261
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this whole thing is bizarre and it </v>

3095
02:17:14.261 --> 02:17:15.170
<v Speaker 5>can go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can all go wrong.</v>

3096
02:17:15.171 --> 02:17:17.330
<v Speaker 5>The whole fear based culture that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>brought up,</v>

3097
02:17:17.331 --> 02:17:18.380
<v Speaker 5>the idea of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3098
02:17:18.490 --> 02:17:21.560
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lack of civil liberties,</v>

3099
02:17:21.630 --> 02:17:26.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lack of privacy that we really have </v>

3100
02:17:26.630 --> 02:17:29.081
<v Speaker 5>in this country now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the laws that are being passed over and </v>

3101
02:17:29.081 --> 02:17:31.181
<v Speaker 5>over again that allow people to look </v>
<v Speaker 5>into your stuff because you might be a </v>

3102
02:17:31.181 --> 02:17:31.181
<v Speaker 5>terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3103
02:17:31.181 --> 02:17:33.140
<v Speaker 5>how did we not learn from the mccarthy </v>
<v Speaker 5>era?</v>

3104
02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:37.360
<v Speaker 5>How did we not learn that the way is not</v>
<v Speaker 5>to crack district.</v>

3105
02:17:37.810 --> 02:17:41.670
<v Speaker 4>We're distracted by our iphones and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kardashians and you know what I mean,</v>

3106
02:17:41.671 --> 02:17:45.330
<v Speaker 4>like people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a malays know and,</v>

3107
02:17:45.331 --> 02:17:47.050
<v Speaker 4>and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3108
02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:50.570
<v Speaker 4>plays a huge part in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in distracting us.</v>

3109
02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Like again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the Matrix,</v>

3110
02:17:52.291 --> 02:17:53.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

3111
02:17:53.930 --> 02:17:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said it's weird because you used to </v>

3112
02:17:58.930 --> 02:18:02.691
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were to talk about this kind of </v>

3113
02:18:02.691 --> 02:18:04.341
<v Speaker 4>stuff or propose any of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were just a crazy conspiracy </v>

3114
02:18:04.341 --> 02:18:04.341
<v Speaker 4>theorist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now it's,</v>

3115
02:18:04.341 --> 02:18:09.110
<v Speaker 4>there's too many crazy things going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>too to not realize that there's a lot of</v>

3116
02:18:11.161 --> 02:18:16.161
<v Speaker 4>truth to all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everything from like the the </v>

3117
02:18:16.161 --> 02:18:17.910
<v Speaker 4>label on the front of a food product </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you buy that's telling you this and</v>

3118
02:18:17.911 --> 02:18:22.911
<v Speaker 4>that when you turn around and look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the nutrition facts panel and you </v>

3119
02:18:22.911 --> 02:18:26.211
<v Speaker 4>realize it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or how about genetically modified foods </v>

3120
02:18:26.211 --> 02:18:26.211
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

3121
02:18:26.211 --> 02:18:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Have you had looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

3122
02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:28.250
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3123
02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:29.820
<v Speaker 5>so I mean the people that are making </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3124
02:18:29.821 --> 02:18:32.730
<v Speaker 5>Have you looked down the road 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 5>and found out what people are gonna?</v>

3125
02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.410
<v Speaker 5>What's gonna happen when peanut elite </v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

3126
02:18:34.490 --> 02:18:37.720
<v Speaker 5>what's going to alter the environment </v>
<v Speaker 5>like your past.</v>

3127
02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:40.240
<v Speaker 5>You're developing a fucking thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>has a natural pessimist</v>

3128
02:18:40.510 --> 02:18:45.510
<v Speaker 4>and humans are not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not wired to be forward thinking </v>

3129
02:18:45.510 --> 02:18:47.550
<v Speaker 4>or to consider the long play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3130
02:18:47.710 --> 02:18:51.950
<v Speaker 4>we're a bunch of scary creeps button </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing these monkeys banks.</v>

3131
02:18:51.970 --> 02:18:55.420
<v Speaker 4>Until recently somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember where I heard this,</v>

3132
02:18:55.421 --> 02:18:59.890
<v Speaker 4>but if all the insects died that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if all,</v>

3133
02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:02.090
<v Speaker 4>if all the insects died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3134
02:19:02.091 --> 02:19:07.091
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole earth would be dead in 50 </v>

3135
02:19:07.091 --> 02:19:07.091
<v Speaker 4>years or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if all the humans died,</v>

3136
02:19:07.091 --> 02:19:10.450
<v Speaker 4>the earth would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd repair itself.</v>

3137
02:19:10.510 --> 02:19:11.080
<v Speaker 4>I believe that.</v>

3138
02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:12.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense.</v>

3139
02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:13.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3140
02:19:13.430 --> 02:19:16.370
<v Speaker 5>just the massive ants and the jobs that </v>
<v Speaker 5>ants do.</v>

3141
02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:20.600
<v Speaker 5>People don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>know gazelles have to be there.</v>

3142
02:19:20.630 --> 02:19:22.070
<v Speaker 5>Then that means you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheetahs.</v>

3143
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:23.810
<v Speaker 5>You have to have something that cleans </v>
<v Speaker 5>things up.</v>

3144
02:19:24.170 --> 02:19:29.170
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ants play a very important role in the </v>

3145
02:19:29.170 --> 02:19:29.170
<v Speaker 5>of shit that</v>

3146
02:19:29.170 --> 02:19:29.480
<v Speaker 1>we leave around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3147
02:19:29.490 --> 02:19:30.710
<v Speaker 1>aunts have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3148
02:19:30.711 --> 02:19:33.050
<v Speaker 1>when you leave something on the table </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ants swarm it,</v>

3149
02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:35.570
<v Speaker 1>that's they're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find shit on the ground.</v>

3150
02:19:35.571 --> 02:19:37.250
<v Speaker 1>They find dead bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find everything.</v>

3151
02:19:37.251 --> 02:19:42.251
<v Speaker 1>They and they go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about all of this craziness with </v>

3152
02:19:42.251 --> 02:19:42.251
<v Speaker 1>the bees?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

3153
02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:47.440
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because there's a bunch of </v>

3154
02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:47.990
<v Speaker 1>different theories and no one seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what the fuck it is.</v>

3155
02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Some people say it's cell phones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the extra cell phone signals are </v>

3156
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:56.681
<v Speaker 1>fucking with the bees and I've talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experts and they say there's no doubt </v>

3157
02:19:56.681 --> 02:19:56.840
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it has an effect on the bees,</v>

3158
02:19:57.080 --> 02:20:02.080
<v Speaker 1>that the frequency that they operate in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can pick up bands of radio </v>

3159
02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:05.360
<v Speaker 1>waves and things because their antenna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they communicate with each other.</v>

3160
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:09.860
<v Speaker 1>We had a thing on fear factor once where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cover these people and bees and uh,</v>

3161
02:20:09.890 --> 02:20:10.760
<v Speaker 1>when we were.</v>

3162
02:20:10.890 --> 02:20:15.890
<v Speaker 1>We were out in this place called Sable </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranch and it's a huge ranch and natural </v>

3163
02:20:16.131 --> 02:20:21.131
<v Speaker 1>hive of bees was at the ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there they have all these bees on </v>

3164
02:20:21.131 --> 02:20:25.181
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These local bees came flying in like a </v>

3165
02:20:25.181 --> 02:20:28.130
<v Speaker 1>giant group of them and they all made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge cloud in the sky.</v>

3166
02:20:28.131 --> 02:20:30.290
<v Speaker 1>And the a b handlers like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right everybody,</v>

3167
02:20:30.291 --> 02:20:32.450
<v Speaker 1>let's back away from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody get way back.</v>

3168
02:20:32.700 --> 02:20:35.150
<v Speaker 1>They've got to work this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they worked it out.</v>

3169
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:38.030
<v Speaker 1>They communicated with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they found out who was who.</v>

3170
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:41.280
<v Speaker 1>And then the local bees like separated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they let the law,</v>

3171
02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:44.560
<v Speaker 1>the bees that were this guy's honeybees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the train be,</v>

3172
02:20:44.810 --> 02:20:45.940
<v Speaker 1>they're never trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3173
02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:50.960
<v Speaker 1>the contained bs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you would say let them go about </v>

3174
02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:54.011
<v Speaker 1>their business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like there was some </v>

3175
02:20:54.011 --> 02:20:54.590
<v Speaker 1>communication going on and this guy said</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to work this out.</v>

3176
02:20:54.830 --> 02:20:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how he described it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

3177
02:20:56.811 --> 02:20:57.900
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean work it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3178
02:20:57.920 --> 02:20:59.180
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

3179
02:20:59.210 --> 02:21:01.430
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing because I,</v>

3180
02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's amazing is that nobody seemed</v>

3181
02:21:04.221 --> 02:21:05.750
<v Speaker 1>to give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3182
02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

3183
02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:10.100
<v Speaker 1>I was baffled by like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they up there talking?</v>

3184
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Are they talking right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His bees were like,</v>

3185
02:21:13.690 --> 02:21:18.020
<v Speaker 1>they all got together and I was amazed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this guy knew what was going on,</v>

3186
02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:23.140
<v Speaker 1>that he knew that some local bees came </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and he knew that that's all they had </v>

3187
02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:23.950
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just had to get together and talk.</v>

3188
02:21:23.951 --> 02:21:25.190
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often does this happen?</v>

3189
02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens all the time that bees find </v>

3190
02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:31.040
<v Speaker 1>out there's some other bs in their area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck are they finding out?</v>

3191
02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:33.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess they send scouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have one.</v>

3192
02:21:33.470 --> 02:21:34.460
<v Speaker 1>God's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3193
02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:37.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking hundred guys I never </v>
<v Speaker 1>met before.</v>

3194
02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:42.160
<v Speaker 1>How does this come out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then come back and communicate that </v>

3195
02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:42.470
<v Speaker 1>information to get everyone else to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3196
02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say they do it through pheromones.</v>

3197
02:21:44.860 --> 02:21:45.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3198
02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:50.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of confusion about how </v>

3199
02:21:50.530 --> 02:21:54.371
<v Speaker 1>they do it and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what level of communication they </v>

3200
02:21:54.371 --> 02:21:54.371
<v Speaker 1>actually have because they're so alien </v>
<v Speaker 1>to us.</v>

3201
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3202
02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:56.930
<v Speaker 1>what they fascinating because it using </v>
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>

3203
02:21:57.090 --> 02:21:59.630
<v Speaker 1>One of our cell phone networks are part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this texting each other.</v>

3204
02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just getting jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our cell phone networks like </v>

3205
02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Jackhammers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't,</v>

3206
02:22:05.390 --> 02:22:07.180
<v Speaker 1>they can't find them either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3207
02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:08.540
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well where are they?</v>

3208
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Where are they going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3209
02:22:10.491 --> 02:22:12.200
<v Speaker 1>they're not disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dying.</v>

3210
02:22:12.201 --> 02:22:13.750
<v Speaker 1>They're not breathing properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3211
02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3212
02:22:15.290 --> 02:22:17.030
<v Speaker 1>And if we don't have bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

3213
02:22:17.031 --> 02:22:18.770
<v Speaker 1>honeybees were really fucked.</v>

3214
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:22.850
<v Speaker 1>We need to come up with little robot </v>
<v Speaker 1>bees that do a better job than B's.</v>

3215
02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Little tiny microscopic robots that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and pollinate.</v>

3216
02:22:26.431 --> 02:22:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

3217
02:22:27.751 --> 02:22:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So hard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3218
02:22:28.531 --> 02:22:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have to have drones to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in Pakistan?</v>

3219
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:35.630
<v Speaker 1>But some drone bees so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we have this bad ass be that's less </v>

3220
02:22:35.671 --> 02:22:37.530
<v Speaker 1>complex and we control that little </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

3221
02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:39.900
<v Speaker 1>All it has to do is pollinate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3222
02:22:39.901 --> 02:22:41.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can make our own hunting.</v>

3223
02:22:41.221 --> 02:22:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure we don't need base for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3224
02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:48.021
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we figure out a way to make </v>

3225
02:22:48.021 --> 02:22:49.401
<v Speaker 1>artificial honey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not like they say that local </v>

3226
02:22:49.401 --> 02:22:50.700
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the area that you are,</v>

3227
02:22:50.850 --> 02:22:55.850
<v Speaker 1>contains a of protection from the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>ailments.</v>

3228
02:22:56.250 --> 02:23:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Like say if there's local colds going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would be a good anti a </v>

3229
02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:06.500
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant or what not not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a good prevention from a,</v>

3230
02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:12.080
<v Speaker 1>from catching local colds that a raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>honey raw food really is where it's at.</v>

3231
02:23:12.541 --> 02:23:17.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem with milk for a lot of </v>

3232
02:23:17.541 --> 02:23:17.541
<v Speaker 1>people is the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

3233
02:23:17.541 --> 02:23:18.690
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you have to get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>homogenize it.</v>

3234
02:23:18.691 --> 02:23:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Pasteurize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get raw milk,</v>

3235
02:23:20.821 --> 02:23:24.180
<v Speaker 1>it's way easier to digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily know.</v>

3236
02:23:24.190 --> 02:23:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3237
02:23:26.310 --> 02:23:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3238
02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:29.460
<v Speaker 7>went down in Santa Monica.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think they're still in.</v>

3239
02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:34.520
<v Speaker 7>What happened there was that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>Santa Monica co-op or there some place </v>

3240
02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:39.381
<v Speaker 7>in Santa Monica that was selling raw </v>
<v Speaker 7>milk and a government like clamped down </v>

3241
02:23:39.381 --> 02:23:40.680
<v Speaker 7>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They like rated the place.</v>

3242
02:23:40.681 --> 02:23:45.681
<v Speaker 7>I guess they'd given him a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 7>warnings or maybe a donor like a mellow </v>

3243
02:23:45.681 --> 02:23:49.431
<v Speaker 7>rate earlier and they kept,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they kept trying to sell raw milk and </v>

3244
02:23:49.431 --> 02:23:50.790
<v Speaker 7>then they finally went in guns blazing </v>
<v Speaker 7>and shut them down.</v>

3245
02:23:50.791 --> 02:23:51.990
<v Speaker 7>And there's always lawsuits now.</v>

3246
02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get the kind of sound like a </v>

3247
02:23:57.170 --> 02:23:57.170
<v Speaker 1>million dollars bail or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3248
02:23:57.170 --> 02:23:57.170
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3249
02:23:57.170 --> 02:23:59.250
<v Speaker 1>what I have found out those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that raw milk is still legal.</v>

3250
02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.830
<v Speaker 1>You can buy raw milk in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this state.</v>

3251
02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:06.980
<v Speaker 1>What did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did the guy do that with some </v>

3252
02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:09.351
<v Speaker 1>regulatory issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sprouts in woodland hills has raw </v>

3258
02:24:18.740 --> 02:24:19.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3259
02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:20.540
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

3260
02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:21.740
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a famous,</v>

3261
02:24:21.741 --> 02:24:24.530
<v Speaker 1>a raw milk company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3265
02:24:34.271 --> 02:24:37.510
<v Speaker 1>And we need to find the law on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a raw milk.</v>

3266
02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I was under the mistaken impression that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was illegal because they pulled it </v>

3267
02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:47.731
<v Speaker 1>out of whole foods foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raw Milk Los Angeles.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Monica?</v>

3272
02:24:55.961 --> 02:25:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Because that was a gnarly situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a raw milk,</v>

3273
02:25:00.490 --> 02:25:05.440
<v Speaker 1>a store in Hollywood shout out to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old PDC hub,</v>

3274
02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:09.220
<v Speaker 1>a raw milk store where you can buy raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>milk and La.</v>

3275
02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oops.</v>

3276
02:25:10.631 --> 02:25:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then it sickens 10 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>raw milk seconds.</v>

3277
02:25:14.861 --> 02:25:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Ten people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3278
02:25:15.791 --> 02:25:17.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about raw milk is,</v>

3279
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:22.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like thing you're not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to take milk and it sits on the </v>

3280
02:25:22.190 --> 02:25:22.840
<v Speaker 1>couch or it sits rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3281
02:25:22.841 --> 02:25:24.850
<v Speaker 1>in frigerator for a fucking week</v>

3282
02:25:24.850 --> 02:25:26.350
<v Speaker 5>and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's still good.</v>

3283
02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:29.320
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that doesn't exist in nature.</v>

3284
02:25:29.321 --> 02:25:31.990
<v Speaker 5>You can't take a steak and leave it in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your fridge for a week.</v>

3285
02:25:31.991 --> 02:25:36.991
<v Speaker 5>And a half,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like shit smells terrible </v>

3286
02:25:36.991 --> 02:25:36.991
<v Speaker 5>because it's rotting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3287
02:25:36.991 --> 02:25:40.921
<v Speaker 5>and that's that that's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 5>your milk to like at a certain point in </v>

3288
02:25:40.921 --> 02:25:40.921
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's not going to be good anymore.</v>

3289
02:25:40.921 --> 02:25:43.420
<v Speaker 5>You can't just put that homogenized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pasteurized shit.</v>

3290
02:25:43.421 --> 02:25:46.770
<v Speaker 5>You just leave it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weeks later stays good for you,</v>

3291
02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:48.430
<v Speaker 5>open the top,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks later you smell it.</v>

3292
02:25:48.730 --> 02:25:50.410
<v Speaker 5>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

3293
02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:55.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've figured out a way to preserve </v>

3294
02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:58.081
<v Speaker 5>things and make them all fucking funky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you have a Milkman when you were a </v>

3295
02:25:58.081 --> 02:25:58.540
<v Speaker 5>kid?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For a very brief point in time?</v>

3296
02:25:58.541 --> 02:26:01.300
<v Speaker 5>I think my grandparents did because I do</v>
<v Speaker 5>remember it,</v>

3297
02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:03.220
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was our house,</v>

3298
02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:05.650
<v Speaker 5>but I do remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think it was my grandparents,</v>

3299
02:26:05.651 --> 02:26:08.370
<v Speaker 5>but they had like a glass bottle with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>foil top.</v>

3300
02:26:08.430 --> 02:26:09.120
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

3301
02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:11.190
<v Speaker 7>Does mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>does that even exist anymore?</v>

3302
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:14.650
<v Speaker 5>Somebody must offer that service.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always these,</v>

3303
02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:18.460
<v Speaker 5>like small companies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like grass fed is a big issue now with a</v>

3304
02:26:18.461 --> 02:26:19.910
<v Speaker 5>lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3305
02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:25.380
<v Speaker 5>specifically before we end this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to find out what is wrong with </v>

3306
02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:27.280
<v Speaker 5>what the Paleo guys are saying and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your opinion,</v>

3307
02:26:27.281 --> 02:26:28.740
<v Speaker 5>and like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3308
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:31.180
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is faulty about their thinking,</v>

3309
02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:34.300
<v Speaker 7>what's faulty about they're thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3310
02:26:34.301 --> 02:26:39.301
<v Speaker 7>I think that that was problematic for me</v>
<v Speaker 7>is this idea that it's this low,</v>

3311
02:26:42.490 --> 02:26:44.710
<v Speaker 7>it's a low carb focus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3312
02:26:44.711 --> 02:26:46.660
<v Speaker 7>It's low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 7>high protein.</v>

3313
02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:51.700
<v Speaker 5>I think the focus is to eat like people </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight thousands of years ago because </v>

3314
02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:54.290
<v Speaker 5>that's how our body set up essentially </v>
<v Speaker 5>like just vegetables,</v>

3315
02:26:54.970 --> 02:26:55.550
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3316
02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:56.290
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3317
02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:59.690
<v Speaker 7>the research on how we ate thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 7>years ago.</v>

3318
02:26:59.691 --> 02:27:04.691
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>going back to what we talked about </v>

3319
02:27:04.691 --> 02:27:04.691
<v Speaker 7>before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3320
02:27:04.691 --> 02:27:04.691
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

3321
02:27:04.691 --> 02:27:04.691
<v Speaker 7>there's holes in that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So is there.</v>

3322
02:27:04.691 --> 02:27:07.130
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean we were hunters and gatherers,</v>

3323
02:27:07.131 --> 02:27:12.131
<v Speaker 7>so there's a gathering part to that that</v>
<v Speaker 7>gets overlooked in favor of the hunting </v>

3324
02:27:12.131 --> 02:27:13.630
<v Speaker 7>part because that's a little sexier,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess it is.</v>

3325
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:16.340
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3326
02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:18.770
<v Speaker 7>the idea of eating,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3327
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:20.320
<v Speaker 7>such a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>such a low,</v>

3328
02:27:20.350 --> 02:27:23.300
<v Speaker 7>like the no grain thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the no fruit thing,</v>

3329
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:25.180
<v Speaker 7>all of that to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3330
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:27.890
<v Speaker 7>focus on the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the saturated fat,</v>

3331
02:27:27.891 --> 02:27:30.700
<v Speaker 7>the high protein,</v>
<v Speaker 7>low carbohydrate is,</v>

3332
02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:36.080
<v Speaker 7>is sort of in a certain respect is kind </v>
<v Speaker 7>of an extrapolation of the Atkins Diet,</v>

3333
02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:39.170
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is where this whole idea of,</v>

3334
02:27:39.290 --> 02:27:41.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this way of eating,</v>

3335
02:27:41.001 --> 02:27:43.580
<v Speaker 7>which helps you lose weight relatively </v>
<v Speaker 7>quickly,</v>

3336
02:27:43.581 --> 02:27:44.980
<v Speaker 7>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3337
02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:49.790
<v Speaker 7>can cause you problems with ketosis and </v>
<v Speaker 7>eating too much protein which can,</v>

3338
02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:51.080
<v Speaker 7>which can be damaging.</v>

3339
02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:52.860
<v Speaker 7>And so as a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3340
02:27:52.970 --> 02:27:56.120
<v Speaker 7>as an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I don't know how you're supposed to</v>

3341
02:27:56.121 --> 02:27:58.340
<v Speaker 7>function without eating more </v>
<v Speaker 7>carbohydrates.</v>

3342
02:27:58.341 --> 02:28:03.341
<v Speaker 7>Like I couldn't do it without eating </v>
<v Speaker 7>plenty of grains and fruit and that's </v>

3343
02:28:03.341 --> 02:28:04.790
<v Speaker 7>just speaking from my own experience.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

3344
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:07.520
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my biggest thing is again,</v>

3345
02:28:07.521 --> 02:28:09.140
<v Speaker 7>going back to what we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 7>earlier,</v>

3346
02:28:09.141 --> 02:28:14.141
<v Speaker 7>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is this incredible incidents of </v>

3347
02:28:16.940 --> 02:28:18.950
<v Speaker 7>western disease that we have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 7>with here.</v>

3348
02:28:19.130 --> 02:28:24.130
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and when people are dropping dead of </v>

3349
02:28:24.130 --> 02:28:24.290
<v Speaker 7>heart attacks left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's a gigantic problem.</v>

3350
02:28:24.291 --> 02:28:24.920
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3351
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:27.140
<v Speaker 7>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>obesity,</v>

3352
02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:28.910
<v Speaker 7>Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all these kinds of things,</v>

3353
02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:34.120
<v Speaker 7>and there are studies that link animal </v>
<v Speaker 7>products to the incidence of these </v>

3354
02:28:34.191 --> 02:28:38.480
<v Speaker 7>diseases and that to me it makes more </v>
<v Speaker 7>sense to eat,</v>

3355
02:28:38.481 --> 02:28:41.600
<v Speaker 7>plant based and the studies show that </v>
<v Speaker 7>when you eat a plant based diet,</v>

3356
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:46.630
<v Speaker 7>you can actually prevent yourself from </v>
<v Speaker 7>contracting these essentially foodborne </v>

3357
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:47.660
<v Speaker 7>illnesses.</v>

3358
02:28:47.930 --> 02:28:49.920
<v Speaker 7>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's not that I'm,</v>

3359
02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:55.020
<v Speaker 7>I have some huge beef with Paleo per se.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3360
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:57.710
<v Speaker 7>I'm just more plant based Diet and </v>
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>

3361
02:28:57.711 --> 02:28:58.440
<v Speaker 7>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3362
02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:03.480
<v Speaker 7>a lot of cool stuff about Paleo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I love the evolutionary fitness </v>

3363
02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:03.680
<v Speaker 7>aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3364
02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:08.740
<v Speaker 7>those sort of returned to moving your </v>
<v Speaker 7>body and the kettle balls and the focus </v>

3365
02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:11.000
<v Speaker 7>on core strength and how that birth </v>
<v Speaker 7>cross fit and all of that.</v>

3366
02:29:11.001 --> 02:29:14.000
<v Speaker 7>I think that's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3367
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:14.600
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3368
02:29:14.601 --> 02:29:16.180
<v Speaker 7>and it's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3369
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:21.190
<v Speaker 7>I think that a plant based diet and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Paleo Diet have a lot more in common </v>

3370
02:29:21.591 --> 02:29:26.300
<v Speaker 7>than they do differences when compared </v>
<v Speaker 7>to a standard American diet for sure.</v>

3371
02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:29.090
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>standard American diet isn't even really</v>

3372
02:29:29.091 --> 02:29:30.980
<v Speaker 7>a diet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just a filler.</v>

3373
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:36.190
<v Speaker 7>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the problem is that if you ask </v>

3374
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.190
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>90 percent of people,</v>

3375
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:38.000
<v Speaker 7>if you ask them will tell you they eat </v>
<v Speaker 7>healthy,</v>

3376
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:43.030
<v Speaker 7>when in fact it's probably like one </v>
<v Speaker 7>percent of people that actually eat </v>

3377
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:44.300
<v Speaker 7>healthy or everybody wouldn't be keeling</v>
<v Speaker 7>over with heart disease.</v>

3378
02:29:44.330 --> 02:29:49.330
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I think that heart disease starts </v>

3379
02:29:49.330 --> 02:29:49.330
<v Speaker 7>when you're a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3380
02:29:49.330 --> 02:29:53.460
<v Speaker 7>you start clogging those arteries at a </v>
<v Speaker 7>very young age and you hear these </v>

3381
02:29:53.460 --> 02:29:53.460
<v Speaker 7>stories of like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

3382
02:29:53.460 --> 02:29:55.250
<v Speaker 7>I had no symptoms and then I killed over</v>
<v Speaker 7>from a heart attack.</v>

3383
02:29:55.251 --> 02:30:00.251
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've been working on that disease for </v>

3384
02:30:00.251 --> 02:30:00.251
<v Speaker 7>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

3385
02:30:00.251 --> 02:30:03.440
<v Speaker 7>And it's a real problem and it just </v>
<v Speaker 7>doesn't need to exist.</v>

3386
02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:08.620
<v Speaker 7>And so from everything I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the best way to prevent that is to cut </v>

3387
02:30:08.931 --> 02:30:10.620
<v Speaker 7>the meat and dairy out of your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3388
02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:15.640
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how to say it any other </v>

3389
02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:15.640
<v Speaker 7>way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So why did the Paleo guys deny this?</v>

3390
02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:19.070
<v Speaker 7>Paleo guys seem to point to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 7>that there's an actual benefit to eating</v>

3391
02:30:19.071 --> 02:30:24.071
<v Speaker 7>meat and that a vegetarian diet or Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 7>Diet does not have all the nutritional </v>

3392
02:30:24.071 --> 02:30:27.110
<v Speaker 7>benefits of a mediating protein eating </v>
<v Speaker 7>diets.</v>

3393
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:28.700
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why they say that because I</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't.</v>

3394
02:30:28.850 --> 02:30:30.380
<v Speaker 7>I don't believe that to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3395
02:30:30.381 --> 02:30:32.300
<v Speaker 7>if they're saying that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't,</v>

3396
02:30:32.330 --> 02:30:34.610
<v Speaker 7>you can't thrive on a Vegan Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's just,</v>

3397
02:30:34.630 --> 02:30:36.680
<v Speaker 7>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's an ill founded.</v>

3398
02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:38.520
<v Speaker 7>It's an ill founded statement.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3399
02:30:38.521 --> 02:30:40.880
<v Speaker 7>I think even rob himself said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3400
02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:45.910
<v Speaker 7>lots of guys do well on a Vegan diet and</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said he tried a Vegan diet and it </v>

3401
02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:48.680
<v Speaker 7>ultimately he lost a ton of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think he said he lost a whole bunch of</v>

3402
02:30:48.681 --> 02:30:53.681
<v Speaker 7>weight or whatever and I can't remember </v>
<v Speaker 7>why he said he decided to not do it </v>

3403
02:30:53.681 --> 02:30:57.671
<v Speaker 7>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether he wasn't feeling good or </v>

3404
02:30:57.671 --> 02:30:57.671
<v Speaker 7>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'd be interested in knowing what it</v>

3405
02:30:57.671 --> 02:30:59.180
<v Speaker 7>was that he was eating because I think </v>
<v Speaker 7>most people that say,</v>

3406
02:30:59.181 --> 02:31:01.030
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I tried a Vegan Diet didn't work for me.</v>

3407
02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:02.090
<v Speaker 7>I felt lousy.</v>

3408
02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:03.650
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what that means.</v>

3409
02:31:03.651 --> 02:31:08.651
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean you can be a junk food vegan and </v>

3410
02:31:08.651 --> 02:31:09.470
<v Speaker 7>eat terribly and being the nutrient </v>
<v Speaker 7>deprived for sure.</v>

3411
02:31:09.500 --> 02:31:10.610
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so it's not about,</v>

3412
02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.020
<v Speaker 7>it's not about eating tofurkey and fake </v>
<v Speaker 7>chicken fingers,</v>

3413
02:31:15.050 --> 02:31:16.780
<v Speaker 7>it's about the whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3414
02:31:16.820 --> 02:31:21.820
<v Speaker 7>the whole food,</v>
<v Speaker 7>plant based Diet and that means you </v>

3415
02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:22.200
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>similar to Paleo,</v>

3416
02:31:22.560 --> 02:31:24.180
<v Speaker 7>getting rid of the oils,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3417
02:31:24.181 --> 02:31:25.260
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or you know,</v>

3418
02:31:26.130 --> 02:31:28.650
<v Speaker 7>reducing the oil as well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not the saturated fats,</v>

3419
02:31:28.651 --> 02:31:30.600
<v Speaker 7>but the other fats,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean this most,</v>

3420
02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:32.400
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most of the plant based oils aren't,</v>

3421
02:31:32.430 --> 02:31:35.250
<v Speaker 7>don't have saturated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean coconut oil does or a couple that</v>

3422
02:31:35.251 --> 02:31:35.610
<v Speaker 7>do,</v>

3423
02:31:36.890 --> 02:31:38.640
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's actually still.</v>

3424
02:31:39.430 --> 02:31:40.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

3425
02:31:40.311 --> 02:31:45.311
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but those are those also contribute to </v>

3426
02:31:45.311 --> 02:31:45.840
<v Speaker 6>arthrosclerosis and stuff like that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3427
02:31:46.250 --> 02:31:50.650
<v Speaker 6>just oils and oils in general.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Coconut oil can continue if you are.</v>

3428
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:55.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there is a certain contingent of </v>

3429
02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:57.020
<v Speaker 6>the whole food plant based Diet movement</v>
<v Speaker 6>that basically say no oils,</v>

3430
02:31:57.250 --> 02:31:59.050
<v Speaker 6>no oils in your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

3431
02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:03.010
<v Speaker 6>But I thought that essential oils are </v>
<v Speaker 6>essential for brain function and</v>

3432
02:32:03.020 --> 02:32:06.560
<v Speaker 7>for there are these are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these are the people that are.</v>

3433
02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:09.290
<v Speaker 7>This is like the Dr Esselstyn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The t Colin Campbell,</v>

3434
02:32:09.291 --> 02:32:12.530
<v Speaker 7>like the cores or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they're speaking to people that have</v>

3435
02:32:12.531 --> 02:32:17.531
<v Speaker 7>suffered heart attacks or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are in seriously poor health and are in </v>

3436
02:32:17.531 --> 02:32:19.850
<v Speaker 7>a position where they really need to </v>
<v Speaker 7>reverse the condition that they're in.</v>

3437
02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:22.700
<v Speaker 7>So it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's an extreme situation.</v>

3438
02:32:22.701 --> 02:32:23.660
<v Speaker 7>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3439
02:32:23.690 --> 02:32:24.580
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I eat oils,</v>

3440
02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:29.670
<v Speaker 7>I put coconut oil on my morning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>vitamax I like olive oil on my dressing </v>

3441
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:30.330
<v Speaker 7>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I try not to Overdo it,</v>

3442
02:32:30.331 --> 02:32:35.331
<v Speaker 7>I judicious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I feel like I need that in order to </v>

3443
02:32:35.331 --> 02:32:37.760
<v Speaker 7>get the calories that I need to train </v>
<v Speaker 7>the way that I want to train.</v>

3444
02:32:38.310 --> 02:32:43.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because there's a lot of people that </v>

3445
02:32:43.310 --> 02:32:43.830
<v Speaker 6>believe that fats and oils are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're critical to,</v>

3446
02:32:43.831 --> 02:32:44.820
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to brain function.</v>

3447
02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:50.950
<v Speaker 7>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there are a very efficient source of </v>

3448
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.950
<v Speaker 7>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially in endurance sports because,</v>

3449
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:54.920
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>every gram of fat has much more whatever</v>

3450
02:32:54.921 --> 02:32:56.710
<v Speaker 7>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>kilojoules of energy than,</v>

3451
02:32:56.750 --> 02:33:00.620
<v Speaker 7>than a gram of sugar or carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 7>really.</v>

3452
02:33:01.120 --> 02:33:01.780
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3453
02:33:01.900 --> 02:33:03.970
<v Speaker 6>you're better when it's metabolized in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>different way,</v>

3454
02:33:03.970 --> 02:33:04.990
<v Speaker 7>way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

3455
02:33:04.991 --> 02:33:08.350
<v Speaker 7>Like it in an endurance sports,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're always looking at,</v>

3456
02:33:08.410 --> 02:33:09.190
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sort of what,</v>

3457
02:33:09.340 --> 02:33:14.340
<v Speaker 7>what zone of exertion your training in </v>
<v Speaker 7>and that can be calculated by heart </v>

3458
02:33:15.191 --> 02:33:20.191
<v Speaker 7>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like wearing a heart rate monitor or on </v>

3459
02:33:20.191 --> 02:33:20.191
<v Speaker 7>a bike by a power meter that measures </v>
<v Speaker 7>the amount of watts,</v>

3460
02:33:20.191 --> 02:33:22.030
<v Speaker 7>like the force that you're exerting on </v>
<v Speaker 7>the pedal.</v>

3461
02:33:22.510 --> 02:33:27.510
<v Speaker 7>And you can be very specific about what </v>
<v Speaker 7>your exertion level is and how that </v>

3462
02:33:27.821 --> 02:33:31.150
<v Speaker 7>correlates to which energy mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're using.</v>

3463
02:33:31.151 --> 02:33:36.151
<v Speaker 7>And so when you're an endurance athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you want to really emphasize the fat </v>

3464
02:33:36.151 --> 02:33:37.570
<v Speaker 7>burning zone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is like the lower intensity of the</v>

3465
02:33:37.571 --> 02:33:42.040
<v Speaker 7>aerobic anaerobic zone of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is kind of like just below that,</v>

3466
02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:45.340
<v Speaker 7>that level where you feel like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're getting a little too winded,</v>

3467
02:33:45.370 --> 02:33:46.390
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's,</v>

3468
02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:50.770
<v Speaker 7>it's a certain level of exertion in </v>
<v Speaker 7>which you're metabolizing fat for energy</v>

3469
02:33:50.771 --> 02:33:55.771
<v Speaker 7>as opposed to glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you're metabolizing fat for </v>

3470
02:33:55.771 --> 02:33:55.771
<v Speaker 7>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can essentially go all day.</v>

3471
02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:57.490
<v Speaker 7>The more you train that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that mechanism,</v>

3472
02:33:57.491 --> 02:33:59.150
<v Speaker 7>it gets more and more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3473
02:33:59.410 --> 02:34:04.410
<v Speaker 7>but if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if your exertion ramps up and you're </v>

3474
02:34:04.410 --> 02:34:04.840
<v Speaker 7>burning glycogen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all of a sudden for energy,</v>

3475
02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:08.530
<v Speaker 7>you're only going to be able to go about</v>
<v Speaker 7>90 minutes before you run out of fuel.</v>

3476
02:34:08.531 --> 02:34:13.531
<v Speaker 7>You can deplete your glycogen stores.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're Never gonna Deplete your fat </v>

3477
02:34:13.531 --> 02:34:14.620
<v Speaker 7>stores.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's just too much of it.</v>

3478
02:34:15.210 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 6>So you can train your body to burn off </v>
<v Speaker 6>fat.</v>

3479
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:20.920
<v Speaker 7>Instead of training your body to burn </v>
<v Speaker 7>off carbohydrates,</v>

3480
02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:25.150
<v Speaker 7>you're training,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're training your body to utilize fat</v>

3481
02:34:25.151 --> 02:34:26.890
<v Speaker 7>for energy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's not like you're,</v>

3482
02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:28.180
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3483
02:34:28.181 --> 02:34:29.920
<v Speaker 7>there's a difference between dietary </v>
<v Speaker 7>fat,</v>

3484
02:34:29.921 --> 02:34:31.570
<v Speaker 7>subcutaneous fat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we all have,</v>

3485
02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:33.370
<v Speaker 7>no matter how lean you are and how </v>
<v Speaker 7>matter,</v>

3486
02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:34.330
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've gotten very,</v>

3487
02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:39.331
<v Speaker 7>very lean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You still have a lot of fat in your </v>

3488
02:34:39.331 --> 02:34:39.820
<v Speaker 7>system that's available as an energy </v>
<v Speaker 7>resource.</v>

3489
02:34:40.330 --> 02:34:42.850
<v Speaker 7>And how do you train your body to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>that by,</v>

3490
02:34:42.910 --> 02:34:47.910
<v Speaker 7>by being very specific about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>training zones and the exertion levels </v>

3491
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:48.190
<v Speaker 7>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you're,</v>

3492
02:34:48.191 --> 02:34:50.080
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you're,</v>

3493
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:51.580
<v Speaker 7>that you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether it's running,</v>

3494
02:34:51.581 --> 02:34:53.710
<v Speaker 7>swimming or biking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So for example,</v>

3495
02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:58.740
<v Speaker 7>cycling is like a perfect machine for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for the human because you can rig it all</v>

3496
02:34:59.771 --> 02:35:03.760
<v Speaker 7>up to a computer and you can be very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very specific about what your output is.</v>

3497
02:35:03.761 --> 02:35:06.760
<v Speaker 7>You have a heart rate monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have the bikes these days,</v>

3498
02:35:06.761 --> 02:35:07.960
<v Speaker 7>have a computer on it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3499
02:35:08.140 --> 02:35:13.140
<v Speaker 7>So you have your power meter which </v>
<v Speaker 7>registers the force you're exerting on </v>

3500
02:35:13.140 --> 02:35:16.051
<v Speaker 7>the pedals and watts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then you can extrapolate that out </v>

3501
02:35:16.051 --> 02:35:19.411
<v Speaker 7>after a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what your average watts are for that </v>

3502
02:35:19.411 --> 02:35:22.171
<v Speaker 7>ride.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then you balance that against what </v>

3503
02:35:22.171 --> 02:35:22.171
<v Speaker 7>your heart rate was at that particular </v>
<v Speaker 7>watts,</v>

3504
02:35:22.171 --> 02:35:22.900
<v Speaker 7>what the grade,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3505
02:35:22.901 --> 02:35:26.260
<v Speaker 7>how much elevation gain you have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the exterior temperature is.</v>

3506
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:31.590
<v Speaker 7>And you can create these insane graphs </v>
<v Speaker 7>and look at it and like make judgment </v>

3507
02:35:31.590 --> 02:35:32.920
<v Speaker 7>calls about where your fitness is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where your weaknesses are,</v>

3508
02:35:32.921 --> 02:35:34.840
<v Speaker 7>and adjust your training program </v>
<v Speaker 7>accordingly.</v>

3509
02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:38.260
<v Speaker 7>And so when you're training for </v>
<v Speaker 7>endurance or ultra endurance,</v>

3510
02:35:38.261 --> 02:35:43.261
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it goes back to really emphasizing that </v>

3511
02:35:43.261 --> 02:35:43.261
<v Speaker 7>fat burning zone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that aerobic zone,</v>

3512
02:35:43.261 --> 02:35:46.660
<v Speaker 7>because because the more efficient you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can be at that,</v>

3513
02:35:46.990 --> 02:35:48.520
<v Speaker 7>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can,</v>

3514
02:35:48.521 --> 02:35:51.730
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can improve your speed without doing</v>

3515
02:35:51.731 --> 02:35:53.250
<v Speaker 7>that much speed work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not,</v>

3516
02:35:53.290 --> 02:35:57.420
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying this very articulately,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but for.</v>

3517
02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:02.460
<v Speaker 7>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I first started doing this </v>

3518
02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:05.950
<v Speaker 7>endurance stuff out and wanted to stay </v>
<v Speaker 7>in my zone two,</v>

3519
02:36:05.951 --> 02:36:10.951
<v Speaker 7>which is the aerobics,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I would have to keep my heart rate </v>

3520
02:36:10.951 --> 02:36:13.711
<v Speaker 7>when I was running below about 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Initially when I first started running,</v>

3521
02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:15.440
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3522
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:19.660
<v Speaker 7>if I ran faster than like a nine or 9:30</v>
<v Speaker 7>pace,</v>

3523
02:36:19.661 --> 02:36:23.230
<v Speaker 7>my ra would go over 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when it went over 1:45,</v>

3524
02:36:23.231 --> 02:36:26.530
<v Speaker 7>I knew I was no longer in the fat </v>
<v Speaker 7>burning zone that I was getting into the</v>

3525
02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:31.560
<v Speaker 7>glycogen burning zone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But by staying in that specific heart </v>

3526
02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:33.370
<v Speaker 7>rate region,</v>
<v Speaker 7>over time,</v>

3527
02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:35.890
<v Speaker 7>my pace increased without my heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 7>going up,</v>

3528
02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:37.270
<v Speaker 7>which,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is telling,</v>

3529
02:36:37.450 --> 02:36:42.450
<v Speaker 7>which is telling me that I'm becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 7>more efficient athlete at a certain </v>

3530
02:36:42.450 --> 02:36:46.321
<v Speaker 7>level of exertion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My body is becoming faster and more </v>

3531
02:36:46.321 --> 02:36:47.950
<v Speaker 7>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So by training less hard,</v>

3532
02:36:48.010 --> 02:36:53.010
<v Speaker 7>less less physical exertion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you actually improve your boundaries in </v>

3533
02:36:53.010 --> 02:36:53.530
<v Speaker 7>a certain respect.</v>

3534
02:36:53.530 --> 02:36:58.530
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it was explained to me initially </v>

3535
02:36:58.530 --> 02:37:00.640
<v Speaker 7>like if you want to go fast first you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>going to have to go slow and build the,</v>

3536
02:37:00.670 --> 02:37:03.640
<v Speaker 7>build the foundation of this machine </v>
<v Speaker 7>from the ground up.</v>

3537
02:37:03.641 --> 02:37:07.570
<v Speaker 7>And that doesn't mean there isn't a time</v>
<v Speaker 7>and place for speed work and you know,</v>

3538
02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:11.980
<v Speaker 7>super exertion work at a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at a higher intensity zone.</v>

3539
02:37:12.430 --> 02:37:17.430
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the key to success in endurance </v>

3540
02:37:17.430 --> 02:37:20.441
<v Speaker 7>sports is really emphasizing that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that aerobics on training and education </v>

3541
02:37:20.441 --> 02:37:22.190
<v Speaker 7>efficiency more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so for example,</v>

3542
02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:27.640
<v Speaker 7>when I first started doing this training</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I'd go out for these crazy long </v>

3543
02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:27.710
<v Speaker 7>training sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I come back,</v>

3544
02:37:27.711 --> 02:37:28.910
<v Speaker 7>I was starving,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd be eating,</v>

3545
02:37:28.911 --> 02:37:30.380
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just couldn't eat enough food.</v>

3546
02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:35.680
<v Speaker 7>Now the toll that it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the tax on my body for doing a similar </v>

3547
02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:40.541
<v Speaker 7>workout like four or five years later is</v>
<v Speaker 7>de minimus compared to what it was </v>

3548
02:37:40.541 --> 02:37:45.041
<v Speaker 7>before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So actually my appetite has gone down </v>

3549
02:37:45.041 --> 02:37:45.740
<v Speaker 7>even though the training has been the </v>
<v Speaker 7>same,</v>

3550
02:37:45.741 --> 02:37:47.660
<v Speaker 7>if not more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>

3551
02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:49.670
<v Speaker 7>So the body adapts in other words.</v>

3552
02:37:50.010 --> 02:37:51.570
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is fascinating stuff.</v>

3553
02:37:51.750 --> 02:37:52.490
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3554
02:37:52.530 --> 02:37:57.530
<v Speaker 5>how often are you wearing a heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>monitor while you're training while </v>

3555
02:37:57.530 --> 02:37:57.740
<v Speaker 5>you're exercising?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Always.</v>

3556
02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:00.270
<v Speaker 5>Always because see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never did.</v>

3557
02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:02.290
<v Speaker 5>I always buy them and I just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>leave them,</v>

3558
02:38:02.291 --> 02:38:05.550
<v Speaker 5>sit there and I just work out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>work out hard and then I'm done.</v>

3559
02:38:05.710 --> 02:38:10.710
<v Speaker 7>Well and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>coming from swimming and what it was </v>

3560
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:10.710
<v Speaker 7>like in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3561
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:10.710
<v Speaker 7>it was always,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3562
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:12.970
<v Speaker 7>a go hard or go home and no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no gain.</v>

3563
02:38:12.971 --> 02:38:16.270
<v Speaker 7>It's like if I had an hour to work out </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I was going to go for a run,</v>

3564
02:38:16.271 --> 02:38:18.370
<v Speaker 7>just run as hard as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3565
02:38:18.371 --> 02:38:23.371
<v Speaker 7>as fast as I can in that given our.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's the best workout then I'm </v>

3566
02:38:23.371 --> 02:38:23.380
<v Speaker 7>going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And actually,</v>

3567
02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:26.020
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the truth couldn't be more different.</v>

3568
02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:31.560
<v Speaker 7>So if you want to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's the problem with a lot of </v>

3569
02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:33.160
<v Speaker 7>sort of amateur athletes that want to do</v>
<v Speaker 7>marathons or 10 k's or,</v>

3570
02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:36.460
<v Speaker 7>or even like shorter distance triathlons</v>
<v Speaker 7>by training,</v>

3571
02:38:36.461 --> 02:38:39.780
<v Speaker 7>that way of just kind of using the time </v>
<v Speaker 7>allotted and going as hard as you can in</v>

3572
02:38:39.781 --> 02:38:42.100
<v Speaker 7>that allotted period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to reach a certain level of</v>

3573
02:38:42.101 --> 02:38:44.680
<v Speaker 7>fitness and aptitude and what you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>trying to do,</v>

3574
02:38:44.980 --> 02:38:49.980
<v Speaker 7>but you're very quickly gonna hit a </v>
<v Speaker 7>glass ceiling and you're going to </v>

3575
02:38:49.980 --> 02:38:49.980
<v Speaker 7>plateau and you're not going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 7>to break through.</v>

3576
02:38:49.980 --> 02:38:54.780
<v Speaker 7>So what is the way to break through,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we had to break through is to step </v>

3577
02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:56.260
<v Speaker 7>it back and really again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go back to building that foundation from</v>

3578
02:38:56.261 --> 02:39:01.261
<v Speaker 7>the ground up and focusing on if you </v>
<v Speaker 7>slow down and really focus on improving </v>

3579
02:39:04.301 --> 02:39:07.300
<v Speaker 7>your aerobic efficiency and it's time </v>
<v Speaker 7>consuming,</v>

3580
02:39:07.301 --> 02:39:08.960
<v Speaker 7>it takes time to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3581
02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:13.750
<v Speaker 7>then you are building a platform upon </v>
<v Speaker 7>which that speed work,</v>

3582
02:39:13.751 --> 02:39:18.751
<v Speaker 7>which you will do later,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is going to catapult you into a new </v>

3583
02:39:18.751 --> 02:39:19.090
<v Speaker 7>realm of proficiency.</v>

3584
02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:21.620
<v Speaker 5>So it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make sense.</v>

3585
02:39:21.621 --> 02:39:24.290
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's all about pushing the heart rate</v>

3586
02:39:24.291 --> 02:39:29.291
<v Speaker 5>at a certain pace,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maintaining that certain pace for </v>

3587
02:39:29.291 --> 02:39:31.931
<v Speaker 5>prolonged periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then building up to the point where </v>

3588
02:39:31.931 --> 02:39:35.831
<v Speaker 5>you could do that easier and easier and </v>
<v Speaker 5>easier and that is your real big base </v>

3589
02:39:35.831 --> 02:39:38.030
<v Speaker 5>and it's not about these wild sprints to</v>
<v Speaker 5>your heart wants to fucking explode.</v>

3590
02:39:38.390 --> 02:39:43.390
<v Speaker 5>It's actually about building up your </v>
<v Speaker 5>ability to maintain a a heart rate even </v>

3591
02:39:44.031 --> 02:39:48.230
<v Speaker 5>though you're doing more work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maintained the same heartbreak of 1:45.</v>

3592
02:39:48.231 --> 02:39:48.530
<v Speaker 5>Is that weird?</v>

3593
02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:49.210
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3594
02:39:49.211 --> 02:39:52.220
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's just my personal example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I mean it,</v>

3595
02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:57.340
<v Speaker 7>it requires a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>discipline because you kind of have to </v>

3596
02:39:57.340 --> 02:39:57.340
<v Speaker 7>check your ego at the door,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

3597
02:39:57.340 --> 02:40:02.251
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and sometimes you want that feeling of </v>

3598
02:40:02.251 --> 02:40:02.251
<v Speaker 7>like I just exerted myself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like I did some work,</v>

3599
02:40:02.251 --> 02:40:06.901
<v Speaker 7>I got something done.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And having the discipline to say every </v>

3600
02:40:06.901 --> 02:40:10.501
<v Speaker 7>workout has a purpose and the purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 7>this workout is I'm going to run for an </v>

3601
02:40:10.501 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 7>hour and a half and my goal is to never </v>
<v Speaker 7>let my heart rate exceed that zone </v>

3602
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:18.710
<v Speaker 7>threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So say if I'm going to finish the run </v>

3603
02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.870
<v Speaker 7>and maybe I'm not even gonna feel that </v>
<v Speaker 7>tired,</v>

3604
02:40:18.871 --> 02:40:23.871
<v Speaker 7>I might not feel like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't feel like I got anything out of </v>

3605
02:40:23.871 --> 02:40:26.661
<v Speaker 7>that and believing in that program and </v>
<v Speaker 7>sticking to it over time to build that </v>

3606
02:40:26.661 --> 02:40:26.661
<v Speaker 7>house.</v>

3607
02:40:26.661 --> 02:40:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's a good way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone should approach a martial arts </v>

3608
02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:35.401
<v Speaker 1>as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that like strength and conditioning </v>

3609
02:40:35.401 --> 02:40:37.441
<v Speaker 1>for martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say kettlebells or something like </v>

3610
02:40:37.441 --> 02:40:39.331
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should also do the same sort of </v>

3611
02:40:39.331 --> 02:40:39.331
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maintain A.</v>

3612
02:40:39.331 --> 02:40:42.930
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a little bit different because </v>

3613
02:40:42.930 --> 02:40:43.750
<v Speaker 7>endurance sports are so much about </v>
<v Speaker 7>efficiency of movement,</v>

3614
02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:46.930
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and over a prolonged period of time.</v>

3615
02:40:46.931 --> 02:40:49.290
<v Speaker 7>Whereas something like Jujitsu or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>

3616
02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:51.580
<v Speaker 7>or what have you is about explosive </v>
<v Speaker 7>speed,</v>

3617
02:40:51.790 --> 02:40:56.790
<v Speaker 7>but at the same time you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the ring for a prolonged period of </v>

3618
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:59.641
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you have this sort of lung capacity </v>

3619
02:40:59.641 --> 02:41:00.310
<v Speaker 7>and stamina to endure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3620
02:41:00.430 --> 02:41:05.430
<v Speaker 7>longer than your competitor so that </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're fresher in that last round than </v>

3621
02:41:05.430 --> 02:41:06.640
<v Speaker 7>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you're going to have an advantage.</v>

3622
02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:11.760
<v Speaker 7>So I think that what that would mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and certainly I'm no expert in martial </v>

3623
02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:16.381
<v Speaker 7>arts or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I don't want to get schooled for </v>

3624
02:41:16.381 --> 02:41:19.920
<v Speaker 7>saying the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it would seem to me that in the off </v>

3625
02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:19.920
<v Speaker 7>season,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3626
02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:23.380
<v Speaker 7>or you know quite a bit of time before </v>
<v Speaker 7>you get into your training camps leading</v>

3627
02:41:23.381 --> 02:41:28.381
<v Speaker 7>up to a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you would focus on doing a lot of base </v>

3628
02:41:28.381 --> 02:41:29.830
<v Speaker 7>aerobic training work to kind of lay </v>
<v Speaker 7>that endurance foundation.</v>

3629
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:35.070
<v Speaker 7>And then you build upon that with the </v>
<v Speaker 7>specific strength and explosive speed </v>

3630
02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:35.070
<v Speaker 7>exercises to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3631
02:41:35.170 --> 02:41:38.500
<v Speaker 7>have that pyramid come to a peak when it</v>
<v Speaker 7>comes to fight day</v>

3632
02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 1>one of the best fighters in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3633
02:41:40.290 --> 02:41:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz is a unknown triathlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3634
02:41:43.651 --> 02:41:48.651
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's constantly doing massive endurance </v>

3635
02:41:48.651 --> 02:41:49.200
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about nick is that he puts</v>

3636
02:41:49.201 --> 02:41:52.260
<v Speaker 1>guys a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts them into a pace he sets them up.</v>

3637
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Like when he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3638
02:41:53.970 --> 02:41:54.930
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fights,</v>

3639
02:41:54.931 --> 02:41:57.750
<v Speaker 1>he pushes a pace that other guys can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete with.</v>

3640
02:41:58.110 --> 02:42:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Like he uses his endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He uses his verse strong endurance base </v>

3641
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:04.260
<v Speaker 1>as an extra weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an extra.</v>

3642
02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes a lot of sense.</v>

3643
02:42:06.861 --> 02:42:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he can,</v>

3644
02:42:07.580 --> 02:42:10.740
<v Speaker 1>he can just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He swimming back from Alcatraz twice.</v>

3645
02:42:10.890 --> 02:42:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got ridiculous endurance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that it seems like one of the</v>

3646
02:42:15.931 --> 02:42:17.520
<v Speaker 1>scariest guys in the world because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3647
02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:19.290
<v Speaker 1>because you know you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear them out.</v>

3648
02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:21.150
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to wear him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

3649
02:42:21.330 --> 02:42:26.330
<v Speaker 1>There'll be scrambling deep into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth round while you're gasping for </v>

3650
02:42:26.330 --> 02:42:26.330
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

3651
02:42:26.330 --> 02:42:29.750
<v Speaker 1>He'll be fine and he talks shit to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why he's beating on you sort of terrible</v>

3652
02:42:29.770 --> 02:42:34.770
<v Speaker 1>time were alive at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he follows a basically a Vegan </v>

3653
02:42:34.770 --> 02:42:35.490
<v Speaker 1>diet as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought.</v>

3654
02:42:35.491 --> 02:42:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does it for performance reasons.</v>

3655
02:42:37.201 --> 02:42:42.201
<v Speaker 1>I think jake shields does as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think jake may eat eggs occasionally,</v>

3656
02:42:42.750 --> 02:42:44.730
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's it for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that don't know.</v>

3657
02:42:44.731 --> 02:42:49.731
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know until I was 30 that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have an egg that's not like </v>

3658
02:42:49.731 --> 02:42:53.361
<v Speaker 1>something died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chickens just lay those eggs and if </v>

3659
02:42:53.361 --> 02:42:56.121
<v Speaker 1>they're not fertilized by the mail </v>
<v Speaker 1>through so he doesn't get in the </v>

3660
02:42:56.121 --> 02:42:57.330
<v Speaker 1>henhouse those eggs or just go to waste </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of them.</v>

3661
02:42:57.570 --> 02:43:01.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have bad Karma Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 7>boom.</v>

3677
02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:30.010
<v Speaker 1>And is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3678
02:43:30.011 --> 02:43:31.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is it also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3680
02:43:32.810 --> 02:43:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is</v>

3681
02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:35.440
<v Speaker 7>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's essentially,</v>

3682
02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:38.200
<v Speaker 7>it's essentially memoir.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like my personal story,</v>

3683
02:43:38.201 --> 02:43:39.740
<v Speaker 7>but it has a lot about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3684
02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:45.330
<v Speaker 7>how I sort of reinvented myself as an </v>
<v Speaker 7>athlete and how I had to kind of relearn</v>

3685
02:43:45.881 --> 02:43:50.881
<v Speaker 7>some certain principles about fitness </v>
<v Speaker 7>that I grappled with and didn't </v>

3686
02:43:50.881 --> 02:43:52.030
<v Speaker 7>understand initially that I'm sort of </v>
<v Speaker 7>allowed me,</v>

3687
02:43:52.031 --> 02:43:57.031
<v Speaker 7>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to reach a new level of fitness sites </v>

3688
02:43:57.031 --> 02:43:57.280
<v Speaker 7>that I certainly didn't think was </v>
<v Speaker 7>possible,</v>

3689
02:43:57.281 --> 02:43:59.740
<v Speaker 7>particularly as a middle aged guy.</v>

3690
02:44:00.030 --> 02:44:03.180
<v Speaker 1>And you did this all through that method</v>
<v Speaker 1>of building up the aerobic base</v>

3691
02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:06.020
<v Speaker 7>specific thing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3692
02:44:06.190 --> 02:44:11.190
<v Speaker 7>not what most people are training for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the kind of principles that we were </v>

3693
02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:12.580
<v Speaker 7>just talking about I think are </v>
<v Speaker 7>applicable to,</v>

3694
02:44:12.610 --> 02:44:13.640
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

3695
02:44:14.060 --> 02:44:19.060
<v Speaker 7>the sort of weekend warrior athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether you want to go out and be able </v>

3696
02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:19.770
<v Speaker 7>to feel good in your pickup basketball </v>
<v Speaker 7>game or,</v>

3697
02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:22.120
<v Speaker 7>or touch football or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3698
02:44:22.270 --> 02:44:27.100
<v Speaker 7>it's how to use your time crunched a </v>
<v Speaker 7>days effectively.</v>

3699
02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:32.160
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>rather than just going out haphazardly </v>

3700
02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:34.561
<v Speaker 7>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to blast this 30 minutes on </v>

3701
02:44:34.561 --> 02:44:37.021
<v Speaker 7>the treadmill and do it time and time </v>
<v Speaker 7>again and wonder why you're never </v>

3702
02:44:37.021 --> 02:44:37.021
<v Speaker 7>getting any faster.</v>

3703
02:44:37.021 --> 02:44:37.030
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3704
02:44:37.060 --> 02:44:42.060
<v Speaker 1>so people can get any answers to any </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions about conditioning and what </v>

3705
02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you learned from finding ultra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can they get that on Amazon?</v>

3706
02:44:43.271 --> 02:44:45.490
<v Speaker 1>And it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on Amazon,</v>

3707
