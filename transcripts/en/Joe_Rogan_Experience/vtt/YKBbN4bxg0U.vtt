1
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.820
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we jumped the gun.</v>

4
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Hey Amy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

5
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:11.890
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this man.</v>

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to be here.</v>

7
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>How's things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:18.340
<v Speaker 1>outside of Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's good.</v>

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.001
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to say that everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

11
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>these things that happen that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just changed the whole world.</v>

12
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.893
<v Speaker 1>You gotta think that's probably one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons why these psychos do it in </v>

13
00:00:28.421 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

14
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>So that everyone talks about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes their,</v>

15
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.883
<v Speaker 1>their big fireworks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fourth of July grand finale before they </v>

16
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:38.554
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>

17
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a very interesting post by a </v>

18
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 2>guy named Robert King on psychology </v>
<v Speaker 2>today and I guess he's doing research in</v>

19
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:45.334
<v Speaker 2>this and he talked about it as a way for</v>
<v Speaker 2>men to get or chase status and that he </v>

20
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:54.214
<v Speaker 2>saw two bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one was at 23 and one at 41 in </v>

21
00:00:57.131 --> 00:01:02.131
<v Speaker 2>terms of the ages that people do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it does tend to be men who have some</v>

22
00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 2>kind of their marriage breaks up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lose their job in their forties are</v>

23
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 2>the young men are just chasing status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

24
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.573
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at least some kind of explanation </v>

25
00:01:11.861 --> 00:01:12.491
<v Speaker 2>other than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

26
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 2>someone just went wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just went crazy.</v>

27
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:15.694
<v Speaker 2>Which is not helpful because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell us really what we can do to maybe </v>

28
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.740
<v Speaker 2>prevented or look at how do we look for </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people who do this?</v>

29
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>to prevent it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to lock all men up.</v>

31
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Not for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way.</v>

32
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean not obviously not the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all men.</v>

33
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:35.684
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never see women go on mass </v>

35
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:37.814
<v Speaker 1>shootings,</v>

36
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 2>but well without men who we'd still be </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in grass huts,</v>

37
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

38
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man.</v>

39
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm all pro men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very weird that it's entirely </v>

40
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:48.344
<v Speaker 1>men who do mass shootings and drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>trucks into crowds and that kind of </v>

41
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

42
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.133
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we may start seeing women do </v>

43
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:56.084
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually I don't think it's weird </v>

44
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 2>that it's men because men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at how men and women evolved</v>

45
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 2>to get partners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women just have to look hot.</v>

46
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 2>You have to look like you're fertile and</v>
<v Speaker 2>young and have good genes,</v>

47
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.693
<v Speaker 2>which is what we consider beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These what feminists say are arbitrary </v>

48
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 2>standards of beauty or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

49
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.753
<v Speaker 2>They're very across cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men like women with this hourglass </v>

50
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.264
<v Speaker 2>figure and who have long shiny hair and </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are not 72 because if you had sex </v>

51
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:28.490
<v Speaker 2>with a 72 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your genes died out out.</v>

52
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This feminist thing about arbitrary </v>

53
00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>standards of beauty as a person who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply entrenched in science,</v>

54
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:38.290
<v Speaker 1>like that's gotta be frustrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Because you're looking at something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not accurate.</v>

56
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It's you're pushing a narrative that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not accurate.</v>

57
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>There's this very takeaway culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>takeaway.</v>

58
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.063
<v Speaker 1>You know all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your personal feelings about human </v>

59
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 1>beings and you look at the mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human mammal,</v>

60
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.573
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very clear why the certain males </v>

61
00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>are gravitating towards certain and</v>

62
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v Speaker 3>contrary or conversely why certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>females or gravitating towards certain </v>

63
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 3>males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's biological and this.</v>

64
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 3>It's so unhelpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really awful.</v>

65
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 3>This idea that people should like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>for Watson down the inside,</v>

66
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 3>we don't see the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at porn,</v>

67
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 3>it's not the woman who buys a homeless </v>
<v Speaker 3>man a sandwich.</v>

68
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.103
<v Speaker 3>You know who in the porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the woman with those features that </v>

69
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 3>are just cross culturally appreciated by</v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

70
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's also too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking only about sexual,</v>

71
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.543
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because people do like you for who you </v>

72
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:32.674
<v Speaker 3>are on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Melissa McCarthy is a perfect </v>

73
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's as vibrant,</v>

74
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.114
<v Speaker 3>hilarious woman and no one's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's holding her up as the standard </v>

75
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 3>of beauty or sexual attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

76
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at her as this fun person</v>

77
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:47.584
<v Speaker 3>and that's why millions of people go see</v>
<v Speaker 3>her in movies and her tv shows is giant </v>

78
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 3>hit mean.</v>

79
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.413
<v Speaker 3>It's literally what's on the inside and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how she carries herself and she is very </v>

80
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 3>vibrant and if you look at that cross </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural research,</v>

81
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 3>David Buss who is an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologist,</v>

82
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:03.634
<v Speaker 3>did the big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big cross cultural study and kindness </v>

83
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 3>was what both men and women wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was the top,</v>

84
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 3>the top of each list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you prioritize,</v>

85
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:14.021
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

86
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 3>well what do I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are my must haves in a partner?</v>

87
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 3>A guy is not going to want a very old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unattractive woman as his partner.</v>

88
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.293
<v Speaker 3>If he can do better and a woman is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to want to have the guy who is </v>

89
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 3>sleeping in grandma's basement playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>Atari,</v>

90
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.703
<v Speaker 3>Atari or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a girl so I don't know anything </v>

91
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:32.644
<v Speaker 3>about football or video games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My boyfriend tried to educate me on the </v>

92
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 3>way over about some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

93
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 3>some guy who said something insulting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>female sports announcer,</v>

94
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.990
<v Speaker 4>Cam Newton pretty popular quarterback </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

95
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.853
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got a question from a beat reporter </v>

96
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.630
<v Speaker 4>that works for the his team and ask them</v>
<v Speaker 4>something about our wide receivers route</v>

97
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.503
<v Speaker 4>running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said it's surprising that a girl </v>

98
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:56.120
<v Speaker 4>is asking about route running or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

99
00:04:56.121 --> 00:04:59.270
<v Speaker 4>and he got a lot of shit about it right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now you've got to drop from a sponsor.</v>

100
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.380
<v Speaker 3>So sort of going on further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that all he said,</v>

101
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 3>it's surprising that a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe so in then they,</v>

102
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.823
<v Speaker 3>I heard that they went further into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>off off the record a little bit and he </v>

103
00:05:09.651 --> 00:05:11.180
<v Speaker 3>was rude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what she said.</v>

104
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really expect the football,</v>

105
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 3>the quarterback to be the height of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

106
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.460
<v Speaker 3>politeness and social etiquette and </v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

107
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.380
<v Speaker 3>he shouldn't have said this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that these,</v>

108
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.570
<v Speaker 3>there are some incredible women who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports announcers.</v>

109
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 3>So I'm told by the boyfriend and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sexy to be a knowledgeable woman in</v>

110
00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:32.600
<v Speaker 3>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

111
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.870
<v Speaker 3>however we now prosecute everybody for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

112
00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:38.060
<v Speaker 3>And the reason we do that is there's too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much media.</v>

113
00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got a microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's on twitter.</v>

114
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.590
<v Speaker 3>So now this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dumb stuff,</v>

115
00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:46.190
<v Speaker 3>people would have said another era that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have just gone off into the ether.</v>

116
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Now it is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a new story.</v>

117
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Do you think is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

118
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.253
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it also that we're examining </v>

119
00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 3>behavior on a much more scale</v>

120
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.383
<v Speaker 1>than we've ever done before and we see </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we don't like and we're </v>

121
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.194
<v Speaker 1>highlighting those things in a much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive way than we've ever done </v>

122
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:08.714
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like there's accelerating </v>

123
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:11.984
<v Speaker 1>social evolution that's going on right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and along the way you're getting a </v>

124
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>lot of bumps and a lot of weird stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's happening.</v>

125
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:17.984
<v Speaker 1>A lot of social justice warrior stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got a lot of all right </v>

126
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>stuff on the other side and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>battling it out with each other and it's</v>

127
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:25.934
<v Speaker 1>almost like these intense extremes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this new landscape and people are </v>

128
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:34.811
<v Speaker 1>jockeying for positioning on this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural standard playing field.</v>

129
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what's happened is that now </v>

130
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 2>everyone has a microphone and just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's on twitter,</v>

131
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:41.774
<v Speaker 2>everyone can make a tweet that put out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweet that gets tweeted and retweeted </v>

132
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:46.334
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>4 million people and so people are </v>

133
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:49.544
<v Speaker 2>looking to have standing and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it by putting out their opinions </v>

134
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:53.294
<v Speaker 2>and they also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're saying this about these </v>

135
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 2>tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do it to signal,</v>

136
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm part of this tribe.</v>

137
00:06:57.561 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm a social justice warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the right.</v>

138
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm Antifa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that that's a big part of</v>

139
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:04.994
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're looking for criminal </v>

140
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially criminal behavior and whereas,</v>

141
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 2>you know this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

142
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 2>do I really expect every quarterback to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the most pc views?</v>

143
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.340
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And okay,</v>

144
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:19.100
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna lose his sponsorship when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says something like this,</v>

145
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you open the quarterback can,</v>

146
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:25.360
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see quarterback stuff in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it's not,</v>

147
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emily post,</v>

148
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.600
<v Speaker 1>well first of all with quarterbacks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>with any football players,</v>

149
00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:31.434
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with head trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are 100 percent dealing with head </v>

150
00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:34.854
<v Speaker 1>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an extremely high likelihood </v>

151
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that all those guys on the playing field</v>
<v Speaker 1>or have erratic behavior due to the fact</v>

152
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:42.863
<v Speaker 1>they're head's been smashed a 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking times a year since they were a </v>

153
00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:47.310
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is just a fact.</v>

154
00:07:47.311 --> 00:07:48.450
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting around that.</v>

155
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually,</v>

156
00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:50.334
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're starting to see people look at </v>

157
00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:54.400
<v Speaker 2>that and bring that out so parents know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.990
<v Speaker 2>do you want your son to play football or</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play some other sport?</v>

159
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

160
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.973
<v Speaker 1>I have kids and I wouldn't want my kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight even though I'm a commentator </v>

161
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:05.324
<v Speaker 1>and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

162
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I just think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

163
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

164
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll support them in anything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to do,</v>

165
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.103
<v Speaker 1>but I would tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the upside and the </v>

166
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 1>downside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you can get out,</v>

167
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>like some guys get out like floyd </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather.</v>

168
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's just a brilliant tactician </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a incredibly good defensively and he</v>

169
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:26.144
<v Speaker 1>got out relatively unscathed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you really won't know how unscathed </v>

170
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:30.164
<v Speaker 1>until 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years from now when you see them </v>

171
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:32.770
<v Speaker 1>struggling with his words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

172
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not worth it.</v>

173
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Life is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is short,</v>

174
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's long if you're fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

175
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.313
<v Speaker 2>And you see that from these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read some story about that the other </v>

176
00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:45.820
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think who is the guy so,</v>

177
00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:46.654
<v Speaker 2>so sad and this thing about it showing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up much later where you get terribly </v>

178
00:08:49.391 --> 00:08:51.310
<v Speaker 2>mental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally ill people.</v>

179
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.170
<v Speaker 2>They make those tradeoffs where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

180
00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:54.004
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can get money and fame way and </v>

181
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>it's quick</v>

182
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.903
<v Speaker 3>and everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really realize what the </v>

183
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 3>longterm consequences will be.</v>

184
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.553
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people in the got into </v>

185
00:09:03.401 --> 00:09:05.620
<v Speaker 1>football and even people that got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>

186
00:09:05.621 --> 00:09:06.454
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know as much back then when </v>

187
00:09:08.501 --> 00:09:12.010
<v Speaker 1>they first entered this sort of journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially football.</v>

188
00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean football being we really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no conversation about that.</v>

189
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Think about like the Oj trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.893
<v Speaker 1>I've been kind of on the Oj kick lately </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I started watching that Cuba </v>

191
00:09:21.641 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Speaker 1>gooding jr series where they sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reenact and it's really kind of freaking</v>

192
00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:29.930
<v Speaker 1>me out because bringing back the </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories of the nineties and what,</v>

193
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.910
<v Speaker 1>what it was like when that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that thing went down,</v>

194
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:34.744
<v Speaker 1>I was with my girlfriend at the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were sitting in front of the </v>

195
00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:41.590
<v Speaker 1>television holding hands and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like waiting for the verdict and when,</v>

196
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.310
<v Speaker 1>when they said not guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she threw her hands on her face.</v>

197
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Like she had just seen a horrible car </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>

198
00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:48.790
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

199
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kept shooting.</v>

200
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

201
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

202
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.393
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

203
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.000
<v Speaker 1>now today they're saying the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

204
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very doctor that was working with Oj</v>

205
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.950
<v Speaker 1>said if they were going to do that case </v>
<v Speaker 1>again today,</v>

206
00:10:02.951 --> 00:10:04.340
<v Speaker 1>they would absolutely bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

207
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right about that.</v>

208
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.860
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's so many football players who</v>

209
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:12.620
<v Speaker 3>got in just not knowing who will come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out like that.</v>

210
00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I think within a number of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

211
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.420
<v Speaker 3>that was only 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>23 years ago,</v>

212
00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:19.490
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not that long ago,</v>

213
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.660
<v Speaker 3>so 23 years ago nobody thought about </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain trauma came to facebook,</v>

214
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 3>which is just nuts.</v>

215
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.723
<v Speaker 1>Well now these guys are debilitated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole bunch of different </v>

216
00:10:29.511 --> 00:10:30.344
<v Speaker 1>lawsuits that are going on right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the NFL and you're seeing these </v>

217
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.133
<v Speaker 1>older players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have on real sports at </v>

218
00:10:34.251 --> 00:10:35.084
<v Speaker 1>Bryant Gumbel and they're sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're shaking and they can't </v>

219
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:39.130
<v Speaker 1>control themselves and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

220
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.940
<v Speaker 1>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is on</v>

221
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.910
<v Speaker 3>unheard of 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years ago,</v>

222
00:10:42.911 --> 00:10:45.340
<v Speaker 3>we never thought of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was never in the public discourse.</v>

223
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I suspect if you go back and look at</v>

224
00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:48.454
<v Speaker 3>those tapes sort of forensically that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that kind of thing just </v>

225
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:51.824
<v Speaker 3>shaking and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also that if you look at to take a </v>

226
00:10:54.251 --> 00:10:57.750
<v Speaker 3>look at over football players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people have these,</v>

227
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.750
<v Speaker 3>these diseases and mental illness that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>related to this head trauma?</v>

228
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

229
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.253
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure quite a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mean this football player guy that </v>

230
00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:06.950
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cam Newton.</v>

231
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.860
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that's wrong with.</v>

232
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not even wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's trying to get sponsors.</v>

233
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

234
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 3>and if you're whatever Coca Cola or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the company is,</v>

235
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 3>you don't want someone representing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that does something like that.</v>

236
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's sort of normal.</v>

237
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's normal that they say,</v>

238
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.853
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're dumping you and it's normal that </v>

239
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 3>he would say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's always funny is that these,</v>

240
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 3>these companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they profess surprise when it's like,</v>

241
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.443
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You thought that this person was going </v>

242
00:11:38.371 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Speaker 3>to be the sort of curtailed reigned in </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

243
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like with Kathy Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

244
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.633
<v Speaker 3>you just figured out that she says </v>
<v Speaker 3>events of things that was a surprise to </v>

245
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it wasn't.</v>

246
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with her was just so poorly thought out.</v>

247
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

248
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 3>what is</v>

249
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.903
<v Speaker 1>the message there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're holding a bloody head like Jesus </v>

250
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when we.</v>

251
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:59.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to hold up the bloody head </v>

252
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 1>of some murderous dictator who's killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people,</v>

253
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.020
<v Speaker 1>then I kind of understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even then like what,</v>

254
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you isis?</v>

255
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this message?</v>

256
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.441
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

257
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I think she didn't think it out and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just okay,</v>

258
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 2>outrage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to be shocking,</v>

259
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:15.903
<v Speaker 2>trying to be shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the sort of fake apology and </v>

260
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 2>then okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it back.</v>

261
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It's the fake apology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was like a,</v>

262
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.890
<v Speaker 1>he's a bullying and he broke me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

263
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.140
<v Speaker 1>like playing the victim card.</v>

264
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a comedian,</v>

265
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know comedians have like that.</v>

266
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.643
<v Speaker 2>Then you know what someone's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>heckle you on and so you have stuff </v>

267
00:12:33.411 --> 00:12:34.244
<v Speaker 2>ready for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this thing like where she's all </v>

268
00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:36.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

269
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.930
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my career is over.</v>

270
00:12:38.931 --> 00:12:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a career now is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh all right,</v>

271
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.760
<v Speaker 1>just take a couple months off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be fun.</v>

272
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

273
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.180
<v Speaker 1>People forget there's some new outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's always going to be.</v>

274
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.073
<v Speaker 1>It's always has some new crazy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and it was also going to be a </v>

275
00:12:50.151 --> 00:12:52.130
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people that are probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>excited that you did that too.</v>

276
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.493
<v Speaker 1>They'll calm down after a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It won't be in the news anymore and </v>

277
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.033
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just we live in a time where </v>

278
00:12:58.401 --> 00:13:00.890
<v Speaker 1>everything is hyper examined.</v>

279
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

280
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.363
<v Speaker 2>and so that standard and that's why I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think we have to be more lenient with </v>

281
00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:07.104
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea that you say something awful </v>

282
00:13:09.001 --> 00:13:11.100
<v Speaker 2>and then you're excommunicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lose your job.</v>

283
00:13:11.101 --> 00:13:13.770
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be living in a dumpster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really wrong.</v>

284
00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:16.740
<v Speaker 2>We need to understand that to be human </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to be an asshole.</v>

285
00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:20.550
<v Speaker 2>We're all assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all say shitty things to people and I</v>

286
00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:21.384
<v Speaker 2>try to recognize my assholeishness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize when I've been awful and make </v>

287
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:26.454
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If sometimes you have to put some money </v>

288
00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:28.550
<v Speaker 2>into making good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

289
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.190
<v Speaker 2>It's what the situation calls for </v>
<v Speaker 2>William.</v>

290
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:31.831
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

291
00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:32.664
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you run into someone in </v>

292
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:34.114
<v Speaker 1>traffic and they're screaming at someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and giving them the finger like you </v>

293
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 1>don't know what that poor person has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been through that day.</v>

294
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're at nine,</v>

295
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 1>they didn't start at one when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that traffic incident.</v>

296
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:47.680
<v Speaker 1>They're probably at nine already and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then this Saben</v>

297
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.280
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where they're coming from.</v>

298
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Raw nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

299
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 2>And so it really is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People see it as a sign of weakness,</v>

300
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:57.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually a sign of strength to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

301
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm ashamed I did this bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this recently.</v>

302
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I shouted on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad to this.</v>

303
00:14:03.621 --> 00:14:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Some really nice person at the Kaiser </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pharmacy just because you know,</v>

304
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 2>she should magically solve my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a problem she could solve,</v>

305
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 2>but after I did that I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

306
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:13.990
<v Speaker 2>this is so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

307
00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I talked to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's kind,</v>

308
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:16.540
<v Speaker 2>she didn't deserve this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I actually,</v>

309
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I went in and I asked for her and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

310
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm so ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spoke to you terribly.</v>

311
00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Speaker 2>You didn't deserve this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very kind to date and purpose.</v>

312
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me in person,</v>

313
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:25.883
<v Speaker 2>in person because well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going there anyway to pick up my </v>

314
00:14:27.631 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was easier.</v>

315
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:30.214
<v Speaker 2>But I actually asked to speak to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it means something to </v>

316
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:36.070
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you do that thing where you say you</v>

317
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 2>put your ego aside and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

318
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:38.584
<v Speaker 2>I was bad and I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People appreciate that you're doing </v>

319
00:14:41.531 --> 00:14:42.364
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives them something back and it </v>

320
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>steals from people to just do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then think,</v>

321
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.990
<v Speaker 2>ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got away with it because you didn't.</v>

322
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>You know it and actually they know</v>

323
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 5>it and they feel bad and I don't like to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make people feel bad.</v>

324
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.573
<v Speaker 5>Well also you feel less about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's as important as </v>

325
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:01.490
<v Speaker 5>anything like one of the things about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you're a sociopath,</v>

326
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.730
<v Speaker 5>when you do something mean to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel bad about yourself,</v>

327
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:07.604
<v Speaker 5>you don't judge yourself the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look at yourself and your own </v>

328
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 5>behavior and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

329
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:12.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm faulty.</v>

330
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

331
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm not proud of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's awful.</v>

332
00:15:15.451 --> 00:15:16.284
<v Speaker 5>Like what I did was a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel bad about who I am and if you </v>

333
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:20.894
<v Speaker 5>just deny that you're just building up </v>
<v Speaker 5>this weird wall of disconnect between </v>

334
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:26.144
<v Speaker 5>you and reality and you're going to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>more and more shitty choices if you do </v>

335
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:31.370
<v Speaker 5>that and you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

336
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:32.204
<v Speaker 5>I think that you are the sum total of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your behavior so you can feel all sorts </v>

337
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:35.924
<v Speaker 5>of ways.</v>

338
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 5>You can fail wimpy and afraid and feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you don't want to apologize,</v>

339
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 5>but if you behave the good way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the better way,</v>

340
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:45.920
<v Speaker 5>the way you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're that person.</v>

341
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter what your feelings </v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

342
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:48.703
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is one of the main issues that I </v>

343
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:50.474
<v Speaker 5>have today with this right versus left </v>
<v Speaker 5>social justice warrior thing that's </v>

344
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:55.574
<v Speaker 5>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people are being so fucking </v>

345
00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:58.663
<v Speaker 5>aggressive and so rude and so just the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way they are trying to silence people </v>

346
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:05.924
<v Speaker 5>from speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way they're describing people and </v>

347
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:09.470
<v Speaker 5>attacking people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a.</v>

348
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.523
<v Speaker 5>it's a very aggressive way and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 5>short sided because when you have that </v>

349
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:14.924
<v Speaker 5>sort of short sided aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's you're doing is like you're </v>

350
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:19.730
<v Speaker 5>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shut the fuck up.</v>

351
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.601
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you yelled,</v>

352
00:16:20.601 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 5>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to shut the fuck up.</v>

353
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:23.960
<v Speaker 5>They don't just go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

354
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:24.670
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

355
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.503
<v Speaker 5>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're.</v>

356
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.380
<v Speaker 5>This is a childish way of approaching an</v>
<v Speaker 5>issue like the,</v>

357
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.810
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more objective nuanced,</v>

358
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:33.703
<v Speaker 5>more thought out way of approaching it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is to take into consideration how this </v>

359
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:40.310
<v Speaker 5>other person is going to view what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying.</v>

360
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.433
<v Speaker 5>Like the only way to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>change is to present them and art or </v>

361
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.960
<v Speaker 5>some sort of an argument or some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

362
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.080
<v Speaker 5>an idea that is both polite and well </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought out and,</v>

363
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 5>and there's no social issue involved in </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

364
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:58.484
<v Speaker 5>Like there's no negative back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 5>between you where you're trying to get </v>

365
00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:03.164
<v Speaker 5>them and they're trying to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only way to get someone to really </v>

366
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:10.590
<v Speaker 5>take into consideration your ideas is to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have them in some way respect your,</v>

367
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.740
<v Speaker 5>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as soon as you tell someone,</v>

368
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:13.910
<v Speaker 5>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

369
00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:14.744
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's out.</v>

370
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's out,</v>

371
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.843
<v Speaker 5>and now it's just like you're just going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to win by having more people yell or </v>

372
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:20.240
<v Speaker 5>what are you going to do?</v>

373
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.570
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna put a ski mask on and break</v>
<v Speaker 5>windows like,</v>

374
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.020
<v Speaker 5>is that how you're going to get this </v>
<v Speaker 5>done?</v>

375
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.063
<v Speaker 5>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just going to cause an action </v>

376
00:17:27.201 --> 00:17:28.034
<v Speaker 5>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just going to cause this sort of </v>

377
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:29.954
<v Speaker 5>rubber band effect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We pull it back and then it snaps and </v>

378
00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:32.924
<v Speaker 5>then you've got some sort of ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 5>infighting where people go full tribal </v>

379
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.603
<v Speaker 5>and they get one side goes against the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other side and this is what you're </v>

380
00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:40.784
<v Speaker 5>seeing today and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're seeing people do it to get </v>

381
00:17:43.101 --> 00:17:43.934
<v Speaker 5>attention as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're seeing people do it clearly when </v>

382
00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:46.634
<v Speaker 5>they know the cameras are on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they ramp it up and starts yelling </v>

383
00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 5>obscenities</v>

384
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>and being more ridiculous about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very odd.</v>

385
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.760
<v Speaker 1>It's very odd to watch it play out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.790
<v Speaker 2>so short sided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

387
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.940
<v Speaker 2>they practically wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

388
00:17:58.941 --> 00:18:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Are you rolling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

389
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:01.311
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

390
00:18:01.311 --> 00:18:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smash the window.</v>

391
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.073
<v Speaker 2>You know what you said reminded me the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst thing a man can say to a woman is </v>

392
00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:09.920
<v Speaker 2>calmed down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It always has the opposite effect.</v>

393
00:18:09.921 --> 00:18:10.754
<v Speaker 2>At cop once said that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called the local police station about </v>

394
00:18:12.711 --> 00:18:13.820
<v Speaker 2>some problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Guy told me,</v>

395
00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:14.660
<v Speaker 2>calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

396
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.780
<v Speaker 2>does that work on your girlfriend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's not working on me.</v>

397
00:18:17.781 --> 00:18:19.700
<v Speaker 2>It never works in any woman's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's a tip,</v>

398
00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:20.534
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what doesn't work on men either doesn't </v>

399
00:18:21.741 --> 00:18:23.660
<v Speaker 2>work on anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it works on kids,</v>

400
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.840
<v Speaker 2>not just kids and work on anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell my kids to calm down.</v>

401
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:31.640
<v Speaker 2>The opposite effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always shut off for any of these things.</v>

402
00:18:31.641 --> 00:18:34.280
<v Speaker 2>He's rude approaches and so the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

403
00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:35.114
<v Speaker 2>when you get somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do is you provoke somebody </v>

404
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.100
<v Speaker 2>defensiveness.</v>

405
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.933
<v Speaker 2>It's a fight or flight reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know this happens to us on an </v>

406
00:18:40.371 --> 00:18:41.204
<v Speaker 2>emotional plane as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you're provoking that whole </v>

407
00:18:43.911 --> 00:18:44.744
<v Speaker 2>reaction that's designed to make you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from a bear or some type of wild </v>

408
00:18:48.921 --> 00:18:49.754
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But instead of writing and burning off </v>

409
00:18:51.411 --> 00:18:54.560
<v Speaker 2>all those biochemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all pooling in you.</v>

410
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.673
<v Speaker 2>You're filling with hate and rage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is not a state in which you can </v>

411
00:18:59.061 --> 00:18:59.894
<v Speaker 2>listen to anyone and so the moment you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it up to that area of invoking </v>

412
00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:07.460
<v Speaker 2>somebody hate and defense and rage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff,</v>

413
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.680
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so far away from listening,</v>

414
00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:12.710
<v Speaker 2>you might as well just crawl under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk and go read a novel.</v>

415
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just so pointless to even engage </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

416
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.970
<v Speaker 2>And so the people who do want to engage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you engage on a pole light level,</v>

417
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe possibly if someone is just not </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally reeled in by confirmation bias,</v>

418
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.090
<v Speaker 2>they might listen and confirmation bias </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course is that thing where we believe</v>

419
00:19:29.091 --> 00:19:33.080
<v Speaker 2>what we already believe and when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw away any disconfirming evidence.</v>

420
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.340
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you recognize these propensities,</v>

421
00:19:37.341 --> 00:19:40.340
<v Speaker 2>we have to do that to believe what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe,</v>

422
00:19:40.341 --> 00:19:42.200
<v Speaker 2>to be tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stick to this side,</v>

423
00:19:42.201 --> 00:19:44.330
<v Speaker 2>to not listened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not change our views.</v>

424
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.433
<v Speaker 2>The maybe have a hope of changing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>views and maybe if you try to listen to </v>

425
00:19:49.101 --> 00:19:51.570
<v Speaker 2>other people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

426
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:52.723
<v Speaker 2>there are differing views who are polite</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to engage on a rational </v>

427
00:19:55.911 --> 00:19:57.530
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can learn something.</v>

428
00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I try to be open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to take criticism.</v>

429
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.423
<v Speaker 2>I try to not rejected out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I don't take the criticism </v>

430
00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:05.840
<v Speaker 2>that comes from dear bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ugly whore.</v>

431
00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Like to get those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

432
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.010
<v Speaker 2>But I always think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just drop the deer.</v>

433
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:13.240
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to start with bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ugly whore.</v>

434
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.010
<v Speaker 2>The humor comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in when they're being polite,</v>

435
00:20:16.011 --> 00:20:16.970
<v Speaker 2>whether criticize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

436
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

437
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.670
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

438
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.230
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

439
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.570
<v Speaker 1>when they get in arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a competition,</v>

440
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

441
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a big part of the whole insult </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the part,</v>

442
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.193
<v Speaker 1>just shouting down thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're trying to win and </v>

443
00:20:29.441 --> 00:20:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to win an argument that </v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people ever.</v>

444
00:20:31.991 --> 00:20:32.920
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

445
00:20:32.921 --> 00:20:33.754
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

446
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.240
<v Speaker 1>it's usually like both people walk away </v>
<v Speaker 1>just disgusted with a loss,</v>

447
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that unless someone is </v>

448
00:20:39.971 --> 00:20:40.804
<v Speaker 1>egregious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee incorrect and you literally have to </v>

449
00:20:43.091 --> 00:20:43.924
<v Speaker 1>shout them down because what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is horrific and you need to point </v>

450
00:20:46.001 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>it out to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but usually not the case.</v>

451
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>usually it's disagreement,</v>

452
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of the time.</v>

453
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.663
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these people think they're so </v>

454
00:20:53.511 --> 00:20:55.910
<v Speaker 2>convinced it's religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that they're right.</v>

455
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.440
<v Speaker 2>We are on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're right,</v>

456
00:20:57.441 --> 00:20:58.274
<v Speaker 2>we're on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were right and they are just unwilling </v>

457
00:21:00.531 --> 00:21:01.760
<v Speaker 2>to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cartoonish.</v>

458
00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Now I saw something the other day about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this great girl at Bernard,</v>

459
00:21:06.021 --> 00:21:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Tony Braxton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's this young journalist student.</v>

460
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Tony around accidents a I r e e k.</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

461
00:21:14.181 --> 00:21:15.014
<v Speaker 2>I can see what a strange name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know she's from Ohio and from a poor </v>

462
00:21:19.131 --> 00:21:22.820
<v Speaker 2>family and got a scholarship to Bernard </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see how hard she works.</v>

463
00:21:22.821 --> 00:21:23.654
<v Speaker 2>She's a journalist and she looks to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>different sides of things and I really </v>

464
00:21:28.131 --> 00:21:30.950
<v Speaker 2>respect that in her because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>see that in a lot of people that age.</v>

465
00:21:30.951 --> 00:21:34.280
<v Speaker 2>There's just such polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget why I was bringing her up.</v>

466
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.061
<v Speaker 2>It's this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

467
00:21:35.061 --> 00:21:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I know she posted something so she wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>an article.</v>

468
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.331
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:21:38.331 --> 00:21:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Columbia Republicans who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

470
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.870
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they want to bring in?</v>

471
00:21:41.871 --> 00:21:42.704
<v Speaker 2>Like Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea that anyone would be </v>

472
00:21:44.271 --> 00:21:46.820
<v Speaker 2>afraid of Ben Shapiro behind me on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

473
00:21:46.821 --> 00:21:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh great.</v>

474
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dark Alley.</v>

475
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

476
00:21:50.691 --> 00:21:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Sorry Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But who's a nice guy?</v>

477
00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he seems fine.</v>

478
00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:57.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a little Yamaka and everything.</v>

479
00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm post Jewish so I can make Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes Jewish.</v>

480
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.070
<v Speaker 2>So I draped it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

481
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.063
<v Speaker 2>I'm an escape Jew and so they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody posted something about being </v>

482
00:22:09.741 --> 00:22:10.574
<v Speaker 2>against white supremacists and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really about like they're going to have </v>

483
00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:14.510
<v Speaker 2>a Republican speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:22:14.511 --> 00:22:17.000
<v Speaker 2>and there was so ugly about Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

485
00:22:17.001 --> 00:22:18.620
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever talked to one?</v>

486
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.470
<v Speaker 2>My parents are Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Tom,</v>

487
00:22:21.471 --> 00:22:22.304
<v Speaker 2>who this Christian lawyer I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he feeds the homeless because he thinks </v>

488
00:22:24.681 --> 00:22:26.180
<v Speaker 2>that split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus said you should do.</v>

489
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.410
<v Speaker 2>These are not horrible people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>burning crosses in lawns.</v>

490
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.830
<v Speaker 2>They're your next door neighbor </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on where you live,</v>

491
00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.350
<v Speaker 2>grows</v>

492
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.390
<v Speaker 5>generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't do anyone any good,</v>

493
00:22:35.391 --> 00:22:38.000
<v Speaker 5>especially when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone like Ben Shapiro.</v>

494
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.030
<v Speaker 5>Ben is a very well read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very well thought out,</v>

495
00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.640
<v Speaker 5>very reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when you talk to him in person,</v>

496
00:22:43.641 --> 00:22:45.830
<v Speaker 5>he's a very kind guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing wrong with him.</v>

497
00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.600
<v Speaker 5>He's just conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

498
00:22:47.601 --> 00:22:48.434
<v Speaker 5>and whether I agree or disagree and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>sure I disagree with him on a lot of </v>

499
00:22:50.931 --> 00:22:51.764
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a really pleasant time talking to </v>

500
00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:54.440
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he's a very nice guy.</v>

501
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.600
<v Speaker 5>His ideas and his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his.</v>

502
00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 5>The way he speaks is very well thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

503
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.840
<v Speaker 5>He speaks very quickly and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>intimidating to a lot of people,</v>

504
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:06.853
<v Speaker 5>his ideas and the the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea that he is this extremely </v>

505
00:23:09.861 --> 00:23:10.694
<v Speaker 5>articulate right wing guy immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best way to silence that is white </v>

506
00:23:15.411 --> 00:23:17.510
<v Speaker 5>supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kay Kay Kay.</v>

507
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.553
<v Speaker 5>He's a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen people call Ben Shapiro and </v>

508
00:23:21.321 --> 00:23:23.160
<v Speaker 5>Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wears a fucking Yama.</v>

509
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.340
<v Speaker 5>I know he's an Orthodox Jew,</v>

510
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

511
00:23:26.681 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 2>So amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so amazing and that kind of thing.</v>

512
00:23:29.861 --> 00:23:32.500
<v Speaker 2>We see it on both sides and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something the other day,</v>

513
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:36.790
<v Speaker 2>so Dana Loesch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a commentator and she's apparently</v>

514
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.773
<v Speaker 2>very pro nra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people send her just the ugliest </v>

515
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:44.260
<v Speaker 2>tweets and I'm sure I disagree with her </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a number of things.</v>

516
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:45.590
<v Speaker 2>They don't really look at her views</v>

517
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 3>extensively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were things like,</v>

518
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you die in a hail of gunfire or </v>

519
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Along those lines,</v>

520
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 3>outside the NRA headquarters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I love this one.</v>

521
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.320
<v Speaker 3>The Guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dear God,</v>

522
00:23:57.321 --> 00:23:58.640
<v Speaker 3>and he spelled God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>g,</v>

523
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.503
<v Speaker 3>Dash d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really are going to pussy foot onto </v>

524
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.340
<v Speaker 3>the oh and in God on the vowels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I love that.</v>

525
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 3>That's like extreme left people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't even acknowledged the existence of</v>

526
00:24:10.731 --> 00:24:12.410
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even as they write it,</v>

527
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.273
<v Speaker 3>they put a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an Asterick I think he might've </v>

528
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 3>been a religious guy or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

529
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:17.680
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

530
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write books with fucking the title and</v>

531
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I always want them to write the full </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

532
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.213
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like enough to get the fuck in </v>

533
00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:24.854
<v Speaker 3>there with the asterisk and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funny that we're afraid of words like </v>

534
00:24:27.701 --> 00:24:28.131
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

535
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

536
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.073
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think you're confusing </v>

537
00:24:31.071 --> 00:24:32.870
<v Speaker 3>someone with like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

538
00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:33.681
<v Speaker 3>they actually meant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

539
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:35.010
<v Speaker 3>Petunia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

540
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.980
<v Speaker 3>asterisk makes it all.</v>

541
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are people,</v>

542
00:24:39.731 --> 00:24:41.780
<v Speaker 3>and my favorite ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people reviewed one of my books.</v>

543
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 3>They would say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this book is filled with profanity.</v>

544
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.680
<v Speaker 3>It has fuck on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was your first fucking clue?</v>

545
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really,</v>

546
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.750
<v Speaker 3>really weird with that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

547
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

548
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.530
<v Speaker 3>what they get upset about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

549
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I know Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met her.</v>

550
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 3>She's very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

551
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.600
<v Speaker 3>I've been on our show once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right after that,</v>

552
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Cecil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lion thing happened and brighter.</v>

553
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.890
<v Speaker 3>Vaguely remember that she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

554
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.820
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like a,</v>

555
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 3>a right wing woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure she started at her life.</v>

556
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 3>I think she was very left wing and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>point in time and saw a lot of hypocrisy</v>

557
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:17.810
<v Speaker 3>in the left and switched over to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

558
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.360
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like we were talking about before,</v>

559
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:21.780
<v Speaker 3>she's very tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

560
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.633
<v Speaker 3>she's nra tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pro gun second amendment and they dig </v>

561
00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:26.930
<v Speaker 3>their heels in and that's it.</v>

562
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:27.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bumps.</v>

563
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 3>I want the bump stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the fucking full auto.</v>

564
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.560
<v Speaker 3>I want magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big magazines.</v>

565
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Like no matter what happens and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

566
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call myself a neither.</v>

567
00:25:37.611 --> 00:25:40.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm neither a Democrat or Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm libertarian,</v>

568
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:44.210
<v Speaker 3>fiscally conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that helps me identifying as</v>

569
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:45.044
<v Speaker 3>sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing helps me to not succumb to so </v>

570
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:50.140
<v Speaker 3>much of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

571
00:25:50.141 --> 00:25:50.974
<v Speaker 3>I of course being human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do have views and I tend to stick to </v>

572
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:57.080
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I try to be open.</v>

573
00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go nra though,</v>

574
00:25:58.670 --> 00:25:59.503
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the thing is like if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like a very outspoken nra person </v>

575
00:26:02.491 --> 00:26:06.560
<v Speaker 3>and she was famously involved in one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those really aggressive videos about the</v>

576
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 3>NRA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just see that video that was,</v>

577
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.613
<v Speaker 3>it was like a sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really recently very </v>

578
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:17.560
<v Speaker 3>controversial video talking about gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>ownership and there's,</v>

579
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.573
<v Speaker 3>it was like a sort of pro nra video that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like widely criticized on the left </v>

580
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.433
<v Speaker 3>and I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the subject of gun ownership and </v>

581
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.100
<v Speaker 3>just what happens to these mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedies.</v>

582
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:31.934
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a conversation that stirs up </v>

583
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.740
<v Speaker 3>tribalism logic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

584
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a very complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

585
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:39.944
<v Speaker 3>And also mental health issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I want to know what was going on </v>

586
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:43.820
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know</v>

587
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:44.993
<v Speaker 1>this Vegas Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he on some sort of psych meds </v>

588
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.633
<v Speaker 1>because a giant percentage of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are and what's the ramifications </v>

589
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:55.350
<v Speaker 1>of that and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is causing this fucked up behavior?</v>

590
00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Is it simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

591
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.743
<v Speaker 1>what people love to call toxic </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity manifesting itself in the </v>

592
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:03.360
<v Speaker 1>most horrific form?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is there some other factors?</v>

593
00:27:03.361 --> 00:27:04.194
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these disassociative psych meds that </v>

594
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:07.164
<v Speaker 1>they put these people on that allow them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just deal with life in a way where </v>

595
00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Speaker 1>they just don't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

596
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been on psych meds?</v>

597
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took Zoloft ones and.</v>

598
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I forgot.</v>

599
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I take adderall every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pilled up.</v>

600
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.773
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

601
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not on it now because I would talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>so fast.</v>

602
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:24.924
<v Speaker 1>I might hurt people with my speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people in here that are on </v>

603
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 1>adderall because they feel like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do a podcast they need to be ramped</v>

604
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 1>up to keep up.</v>

605
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.470
<v Speaker 1>And Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious.</v>

606
00:27:33.471 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 1>You're like slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get them drinks.</v>

607
00:27:35.101 --> 00:27:36.480
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I offer them drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

608
00:27:36.481 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a drink.</v>

609
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.943
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know better even though it slows me </v>

610
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:41.124
<v Speaker 1>down and I'm on the same dose at seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>point five milligrams and the total </v>

611
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 1>lightweight of lightweights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

612
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 1>so the Zoloft I took because I went to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist in New York and you know,</v>

613
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:50.544
<v Speaker 1>date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually tried to give me like </v>

614
00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:54.210
<v Speaker 1>lithium and all these other things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>for manic depressive people.</v>

615
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:55.044
<v Speaker 1>My friends said you're manic depressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically it's so crazy because all </v>

616
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't some kind of inexplicable,</v>

617
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.680
<v Speaker 1>horrible depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a boyfriend.</v>

618
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any money and I was bombed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I took us all off.</v>

619
00:28:08.401 --> 00:28:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Then I realized that just shaved off </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of my personality.</v>

620
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.470
<v Speaker 1>So I did the really dumb thing you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to do,</v>

621
00:28:13.471 --> 00:28:15.480
<v Speaker 1>which is just I thought like fuck this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

622
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:16.470
<v Speaker 1>flushed it down the toilet.</v>

623
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And then I fell off a cliff emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a bad idea.</v>

624
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you do those poor fish river?</v>

625
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.790
<v Speaker 1>My follow this bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Well they said that there's like Lotus a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl,</v>

627
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.343
<v Speaker 1>like trace elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could actually measure trace </v>

628
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 1>elements and some water supplies of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of antidepressants probably.</v>

629
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Sorry everybody water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that funny that,</v>

630
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:43.554
<v Speaker 1>that saying that like I've talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are extremely defensive </v>

631
00:28:47.371 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 1>about their use of antidepressants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you bring in,</v>

632
00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:52.254
<v Speaker 1>anybody discusses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially someone like you who has </v>

633
00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:55.044
<v Speaker 1>tried them and is open about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the cause here I was bummed </v>

634
00:28:59.011 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a boyfriend.</v>

635
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Like if you say that to people they love</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

636
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.760
<v Speaker 1>to generalize depression as a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a disease,</v>

637
00:29:09.931 --> 00:29:14.100
<v Speaker 1>there is a mental issue and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no exercise,</v>

638
00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.860
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change of lifestyle,</v>

639
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love in your life,</v>

640
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:19.343
<v Speaker 1>none of that's going to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a career that's really </v>

641
00:29:20.761 --> 00:29:22.380
<v Speaker 1>fulfilling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of that was going to fix it.</v>

642
00:29:22.381 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I have a disease and I need medicine for</v>
<v Speaker 1>my disease.</v>

643
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.090
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a.</v>

644
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.830
<v Speaker 1>just a sort of wary one note idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I love the research of this guy,</v>

645
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Randy Nessie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

646
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:37.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a psychiatrist and an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and he talks about how,</v>

647
00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it's any sse and you can go on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his website.</v>

648
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 1>He's now at University of Arizona</v>

649
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.960
<v Speaker 2>because he was in Michigan's freezing </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

650
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Everybody out eventually moved to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona.</v>

651
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:47.770
<v Speaker 2>All these professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

652
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he talks about how depression,</v>

653
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:52.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

654
00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.080
<v Speaker 2>the sad feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are adaptive and so when something</v>

655
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 2>bad happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being sad causes you to slow down,</v>

656
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.143
<v Speaker 2>you have the features of a sad person </v>
<v Speaker 2>which has causes other people to gather </v>

657
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 2>around you and be empathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it goes on for too long,</v>

658
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:08.494
<v Speaker 2>you may chase people away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this allows you to think about what </v>

659
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 2>dumb fucking thing you did that made you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get in the state.</v>

660
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And I talk about how emotions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational tools.</v>

661
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:18.904
<v Speaker 2>We think of them as sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>wallpaper for our head to decorate our </v>

662
00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:21.724
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not emotions when you're </v>

663
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:26.240
<v Speaker 2>happy that says do more of that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're depressed.</v>

664
00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I stopped doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflect on it.</v>

665
00:30:28.181 --> 00:30:30.490
<v Speaker 2>And so there are different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

666
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.323
<v Speaker 2>There's a kind that is this medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression that's inexplicable and that </v>

667
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:39.730
<v Speaker 2>maybe drugs are needed for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But often I think that doctors,</v>

668
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

669
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.923
<v Speaker 2>my experience was in my experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to other people because I </v>

670
00:30:44.771 --> 00:30:46.990
<v Speaker 2>write this advice column and I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>letters from everybody.</v>

671
00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:49.480
<v Speaker 2>And I've been doing this for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the early nineties,</v>

672
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.840
<v Speaker 2>is that doctors just say here's a pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of these antidepressants,</v>

673
00:30:55.211 --> 00:30:56.044
<v Speaker 2>they've been shown that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really work and so maybe it's a placebo </v>

674
00:30:59.381 --> 00:31:00.850
<v Speaker 2>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually is a thing,</v>

675
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.673
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of times it's people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicating away this helpful part of </v>

676
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:10.114
<v Speaker 2>depression and sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is reflecting and drawing people </v>

677
00:31:12.881 --> 00:31:16.870
<v Speaker 2>to you and all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this idea of it's a disease that,</v>

678
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:20.690
<v Speaker 2>that it's also used with alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just this idea.</v>

679
00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.920
<v Speaker 2>People like to put these things in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>neat boxes and it doesn't really work.</v>

680
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't say that any better.</v>

681
00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:27.464
<v Speaker 5>And I think that there are people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>do have mental issues that do need </v>

682
00:31:30.081 --> 00:31:31.820
<v Speaker 5>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not generalizing.</v>

683
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think just like some people have liver</v>

684
00:31:33.831 --> 00:31:36.200
<v Speaker 5>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people have thyroid issues,</v>

685
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.183
<v Speaker 5>there are absolutely people that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>issues with their brain's ability to </v>

686
00:31:39.741 --> 00:31:41.990
<v Speaker 5>produce serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just a fact.</v>

687
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:47.470
<v Speaker 5>And how many of those people is the real</v>
<v Speaker 5>question and to generalize completely,</v>

688
00:31:47.991 --> 00:31:48.960
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

689
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:50.443
<v Speaker 5>all depression is a disease that should </v>
<v Speaker 5>be medicated or all depression can be </v>

690
00:31:54.981 --> 00:31:56.970
<v Speaker 5>cured with exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

691
00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's healthy to go either </v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

692
00:31:59.331 --> 00:32:00.164
<v Speaker 5>I think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know many people that have been in </v>

693
00:32:01.851 --> 00:32:02.684
<v Speaker 5>really bad places in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got on some sort of an Ssri and </v>

694
00:32:06.741 --> 00:32:07.574
<v Speaker 5>then they started feeling better and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then they wean themselves off and now </v>

695
00:32:09.921 --> 00:32:12.980
<v Speaker 5>their life is in a way better place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a good buddy of mine.</v>

696
00:32:12.981 --> 00:32:15.570
<v Speaker 5>He was suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got an a in.</v>

697
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.440
<v Speaker 5>The really interesting thing is when he </v>
<v Speaker 5>got on medication,</v>

698
00:32:18.441 --> 00:32:22.310
<v Speaker 5>like he couldn't find the right one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that is really so baffling.</v>

699
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.203
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

700
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.130
<v Speaker 5>it's science obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

701
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.440
<v Speaker 5>When you're talking about medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about medication.</v>

702
00:32:27.441 --> 00:32:28.274
<v Speaker 5>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this little lot of guesswork to </v>

703
00:32:30.591 --> 00:32:31.350
<v Speaker 5>this whole thing.</v>

704
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:32.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say,</v>

705
00:32:32.251 --> 00:32:35.100
<v Speaker 2>because I'm writing a big expo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say now I didn't intend to do this,</v>

706
00:32:35.101 --> 00:32:35.934
<v Speaker 2>but I tried to shove it off on both Nina</v>
<v Speaker 2>tie shall send a doctor's eads and they </v>

707
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:40.640
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't bite.</v>

708
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it reading medical research.</v>

709
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.143
<v Speaker 2>I can't even begin to tell you how non </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence based maybe even most of our </v>

710
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:49.094
<v Speaker 2>medical carriers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so terrible and I'm lucky that I </v>

711
00:32:51.431 --> 00:32:52.264
<v Speaker 2>have a psychiatrist now who is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence based and went on for future </v>

712
00:32:56.031 --> 00:32:56.864
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>further training because I had been </v>

713
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 2>taking Ritalin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just made me jumpy.</v>

714
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:05.951
<v Speaker 2>It didn't really help me with my focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ritalin and Zoloft.</v>

715
00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Well the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he changed me.</v>

716
00:33:09.441 --> 00:33:11.780
<v Speaker 2>I told him I actually started taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was self medicating.</v>

717
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:13.820
<v Speaker 2>This is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before I read as much science as</v>

718
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was taking Musinex in.</v>

719
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:16.020
<v Speaker 2>The guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh.</v>

720
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to kind of get behind the </v>

721
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:20.510
<v Speaker 2>counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like in some kind of like they make</v>

722
00:33:20.511 --> 00:33:21.410
<v Speaker 2>meth out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

723
00:33:21.411 --> 00:33:23.000
<v Speaker 2>they said you have to like sign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Speaker 2>it was buying at different pharmacies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hoping I wouldn't get arrested,</v>

725
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:26.151
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

726
00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm just taking it to right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

727
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything.</v>

728
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:30.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have meth lab in my basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a basement.</v>

729
00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:31.740
<v Speaker 2>So that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

730
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.010
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this guy said,</v>

731
00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:34.844
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna change you because I told </v>

732
00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:37.880
<v Speaker 2>him I couldn't focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said you can't take this,</v>

733
00:33:37.881 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 2>it's making your heart race or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said that this adderall,</v>

734
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:43.544
<v Speaker 2>what it does that's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it pushes a little dope me up out into </v>

735
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:48.440
<v Speaker 2>your brain besides being a dopamine </v>
<v Speaker 2>reuptake inhibitor,</v>

736
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:51.320
<v Speaker 2>which we hear with Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the antidepressants.</v>

737
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.990
<v Speaker 2>So it regulates that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also goes like spurt.</v>

738
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Here's little dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first day I was on that,</v>

739
00:33:57.621 --> 00:33:58.454
<v Speaker 2>the first pill I took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the best writing day I'd had </v>

740
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 2>really in 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

741
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:05.360
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm still on the same dosage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

742
00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:06.194
<v Speaker 2>But this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave me my life back because it was </v>

743
00:34:08.301 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 2>tortured or right before that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

744
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.940
<v Speaker 2>and that really was a big deal and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much of a medical care,</v>

745
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.940
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the stuff on Diet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unit tie shows has been great on this.</v>

746
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Gary Tobbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the EADS,</v>

747
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other people on this who have </v>

748
00:34:20.721 --> 00:34:23.570
<v Speaker 2>shown that look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't eat this high carb,</v>

749
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 2>low fat diet and the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommends it,</v>

750
00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:31.241
<v Speaker 2>will make you sick and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm here this high fat,</v>

751
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 2>low carbohydrate diet for many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not all because we have individual</v>

752
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:36.704
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

753
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:37.573
<v Speaker 2>This seems to be the most healthy diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also not eating polyunsaturated </v>

754
00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:44.150
<v Speaker 2>fatty acids and stuff like that that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about.</v>

755
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more.</v>

756
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:47.600
<v Speaker 2>And you see more and more on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

757
00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.291
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

758
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:49.370
<v Speaker 2>but my doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kaiser,</v>

759
00:34:49.371 --> 00:34:51.530
<v Speaker 2>I love to say that those healthy whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>grains on the wall,</v>

760
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.380
<v Speaker 2>there is no such thing as healthy whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>grains.</v>

761
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I haven't eaten a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been on a hamburger since 2009,</v>

762
00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wouldn't.</v>

763
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.003
<v Speaker 2>It's just dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat bacon and grease all day and I'm </v>

764
00:35:03.141 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 2>very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

765
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:04.994
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though my doctor actually thinks </v>

766
00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:07.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have artica heart detect by</v>
<v Speaker 2>next week,</v>

767
00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:10.320
<v Speaker 2>the truth is if you actually think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

768
00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.250
<v Speaker 2>because my cholesterol is like 303 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

769
00:35:13.251 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 2>But what I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is from Mike eades,</v>

770
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 2>the doctor who wrote the protein power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

771
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has this great blog where he talks,</v>

772
00:35:21.021 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 2>he's very evidenced based but explains </v>
<v Speaker 2>it very well.</v>

773
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:24.554
<v Speaker 2>There are these ratios.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at what's the ratio of your </v>

774
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:30.410
<v Speaker 2>triglycerides to hdl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so basically my ratios,</v>

775
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.800
<v Speaker 2>which the doctors don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kaiser don't understood.</v>

776
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 2>They are so good that I say that I'm as </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to have a heart attack.</v>

777
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 2>I am to be kicked in the knee by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Unicorn.</v>

778
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm so not in danger of that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just terrible.</v>

779
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.130
<v Speaker 2>They sent me this letter to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat a low fat diet.</v>

780
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Thanks</v>

781
00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.970
<v Speaker 5>crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The doctors are doing this.</v>

782
00:35:46.971 --> 00:35:47.804
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand that they went to school a </v>

783
00:35:49.071 --> 00:35:51.230
<v Speaker 5>long time ago and I understand that a </v>
<v Speaker 5>long time ago.</v>

784
00:35:51.231 --> 00:35:54.560
<v Speaker 5>That is what people thought that if your</v>
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol hit a certain point,</v>

785
00:35:54.561 --> 00:35:58.100
<v Speaker 5>you needed to take some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>medication to lower your cholesterol,</v>

786
00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.353
<v Speaker 5>but if you eat a healthy diet and your </v>
<v Speaker 5>body is doing well on that healthy diet </v>

787
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.300
<v Speaker 5>like you have to take into consideration</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what are the whole,</v>

788
00:36:08.301 --> 00:36:09.134
<v Speaker 5>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are all the factors involved in in </v>

789
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:12.643
<v Speaker 5>health and vitality and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding of hdl versus ldl and the </v>

790
00:36:17.391 --> 00:36:18.224
<v Speaker 5>balance of triglycerides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're a doctor and you don't </v>

791
00:36:20.991 --> 00:36:21.824
<v Speaker 5>understand that and you're giving advice</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're telling people to get on </v>

792
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.320
<v Speaker 5>statens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking disturb.</v>

793
00:36:27.321 --> 00:36:29.510
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's terrible,</v>

794
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:32.150
<v Speaker 5>and those statens are fucking terrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>for you.</v>

795
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Terrible effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can cause diabetes.</v>

796
00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.413
<v Speaker 2>They have just the worst side effects </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing that I look at </v>

797
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:39.223
<v Speaker 2>when I'm looking at research or looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at because I do what I call applied </v>

798
00:36:41.691 --> 00:36:42.524
<v Speaker 2>behavioral science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's science help as opposed to self </v>

799
00:36:44.901 --> 00:36:47.450
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at what are the tradeoffs.</v>

800
00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.313
<v Speaker 2>If I tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the tradeoffs in doing this </v>

801
00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:53.270
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you going to have a problem?</v>

802
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.300
<v Speaker 2>How worthwhile is this solution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

803
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.060
<v Speaker 2>and that's what doctors aren't looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at when they get people statens.</v>

804
00:36:59.061 --> 00:37:01.750
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like from the drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies mouths to you,</v>

805
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.080
<v Speaker 2>your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

806
00:37:03.081 --> 00:37:03.840
<v Speaker 2>it's just so</v>

807
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.860
<v Speaker 5>many doctors are basing their decisions </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

808
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:10.160
<v Speaker 5>the advice they give on really old </v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence or excuse me,</v>

809
00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:11.230
<v Speaker 5>really old knowledge</v>

810
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.383
<v Speaker 2>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote keys fraudulent quote </v>

811
00:37:15.631 --> 00:37:18.790
<v Speaker 2>unquote science and it's so terrible and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sees,</v>

812
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did this quote unquote research,</v>

813
00:37:21.391 --> 00:37:25.240
<v Speaker 2>but he excluded countries that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>show searches this,</v>

814
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.480
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in the,</v>

815
00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:27.363
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did this multiple countries study </v>

816
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:33.480
<v Speaker 2>where he looked at what people ate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did.</v>

817
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:35.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a story from the Holocaust where</v>

818
00:37:35.611 --> 00:37:40.170
<v Speaker 2>a guy shot all these bullseyes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall and some army person came up to him</v>

819
00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:41.970
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you learn to shoot that way?</v>

820
00:37:41.971 --> 00:37:42.751
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>

821
00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I first shot the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I drew the bullseye.</v>

822
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:45.913
<v Speaker 2>And so that's when an sell keys did with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this research and he excluded any </v>

823
00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 2>countries that didn't fit what he wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

824
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.390
<v Speaker 2>which is eat this diet that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>

825
00:37:54.391 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Our government told us to eat for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this high carb,</v>

826
00:37:57.301 --> 00:38:01.230
<v Speaker 2>low fat diet that actually causes you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be just hungry motherfucker all day.</v>

827
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 2>And then also spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

828
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I learned from Gary Tobbs,</v>

829
00:38:07.021 --> 00:38:07.854
<v Speaker 2>who's actually a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I got an early on the low carb thing </v>

830
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.880
<v Speaker 2>because I heard while he was writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

831
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.420
<v Speaker 2>that carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is potatoes,</v>

832
00:38:15.421 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 2>starchy vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruits,</v>

833
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:18.623
<v Speaker 2>fruit juice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sugar these things cause the </v>

834
00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:25.590
<v Speaker 2>insulin secretion that puts on fat that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you diabetic and all these things.</v>

835
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.430
<v Speaker 2>And there's some indication that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's is diabetes.</v>

836
00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Three diabetes of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need more evidence on that.</v>

837
00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:33.564
<v Speaker 2>But personally I do not eat sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat one tiny little ice cream thing a </v>

838
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.610
<v Speaker 2>week just so I won't feel totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>deprived.</v>

839
00:38:39.611 --> 00:38:40.960
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

840
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.440
<v Speaker 2>when I Bacon and stuff all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steak and green beans,</v>

841
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:45.274
<v Speaker 2>drowning and butter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel deprived and it's better </v>

842
00:38:47.561 --> 00:38:48.920
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

843
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can do that,</v>

844
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 2>that's not much of a sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

845
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I won't eat the bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Deal.</v>

846
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I read</v>

847
00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.830
<v Speaker 5>Garrett's book and I had him on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast as well.</v>

848
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:56.913
<v Speaker 5>It's a fascinating thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very controversial to a lot of people </v>

849
00:38:58.731 --> 00:39:01.460
<v Speaker 5>email me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to get on and refute what he said</v>

850
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.670
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

851
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.713
<v Speaker 5>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I literally got dozens of people that </v>

852
00:39:05.181 --> 00:39:08.090
<v Speaker 5>did that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the thing that's most shocking,</v>

853
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:12.450
<v Speaker 5>I started following mark sisson's primal</v>
<v Speaker 5>blueprint diet and when I,</v>

854
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.920
<v Speaker 5>when I started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cut out all the sugar pretty much.</v>

855
00:39:15.921 --> 00:39:16.754
<v Speaker 5>I mean I fuck around every now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one of the things that was so </v>

856
00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:20.624
<v Speaker 5>shocking was my appetite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my appetite was so unmanageable like it </v>

857
00:39:24.651 --> 00:39:26.330
<v Speaker 5>used to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was ravenous.</v>

858
00:39:26.331 --> 00:39:27.164
<v Speaker 5>I would eat and then I would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>exhausted and then I would be fucking </v>

859
00:39:30.621 --> 00:39:33.950
<v Speaker 5>ravenous like four hours later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if I went three hours or four hours</v>

860
00:39:33.951 --> 00:39:36.960
<v Speaker 5>without eating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was starving and I've,</v>

861
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:42.240
<v Speaker 5>I regularly do intermittent fasting now </v>
<v Speaker 5>or I'll do 14 hours between,</v>

862
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:43.463
<v Speaker 5>between.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really good for your body and I </v>

863
00:39:44.571 --> 00:39:47.540
<v Speaker 5>lost a lot of body fat for doing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the big.</v>

864
00:39:47.541 --> 00:39:51.230
<v Speaker 5>But the big thing was that when it came </v>
<v Speaker 5>time to eat,</v>

865
00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.800
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't like I was holding my breath </v>
<v Speaker 5>the entire time,</v>

866
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:58.760
<v Speaker 5>but finally it wasn't that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just so normal and I was like,</v>

867
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:59.623
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's some other process that I </v>

868
00:40:01.341 --> 00:40:03.590
<v Speaker 5>thought I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I attributed to hunger.</v>

869
00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:04.900
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

870
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.860
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get really hungry,</v>

871
00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:10.010
<v Speaker 5>but it's not just hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's insulin,</v>

872
00:40:10.011 --> 00:40:10.250
<v Speaker 5>it's</v>

873
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:12.380
<v Speaker 2>insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you hungry in that way.</v>

874
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Before I stopped eating bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to starbucks in culver city and I</v>

875
00:40:15.951 --> 00:40:19.580
<v Speaker 2>would always get the thing that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular fatty thing,</v>

876
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on whatever.</v>

877
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.770
<v Speaker 2>And I know I love all that kind of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

878
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.760
<v Speaker 2>But I got by accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody gave me the sugar,</v>

879
00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.500
<v Speaker 2>the fat free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

880
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:35.090
<v Speaker 2>And after about 20 minutes I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bite off somebody's arm in line.</v>

881
00:40:35.091 --> 00:40:38.350
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The counter get some things.</v>

882
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:39.453
<v Speaker 2>It makes you feel so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at all those years I had </v>

883
00:40:41.721 --> 00:40:43.910
<v Speaker 2>dieted and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one point I just thought like,</v>

884
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.850
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

885
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.450
<v Speaker 2>If anybody's like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little rounder than other people,</v>

886
00:40:47.451 --> 00:40:48.284
<v Speaker 2>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started going to bobby's diner in </v>

887
00:40:49.581 --> 00:40:51.920
<v Speaker 2>New York City having this chicken potato</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burrito,</v>

888
00:40:51.921 --> 00:40:53.960
<v Speaker 2>which now he wouldn't eat the bread and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the potato,</v>

889
00:40:53.961 --> 00:40:54.794
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started losing weight just by </v>

890
00:40:56.511 --> 00:40:59.030
<v Speaker 2>eating like a normal human being and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>excluding fat.</v>

891
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:01.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was sort of instructive for this.</v>

892
00:41:01.431 --> 00:41:03.530
<v Speaker 2>And now I just basically tried to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat all day,</v>

893
00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:04.281
<v Speaker 2>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greece,</v>

894
00:41:04.281 --> 00:41:08.210
<v Speaker 2>more grease and if you don't have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunger.</v>

895
00:41:08.211 --> 00:41:09.044
<v Speaker 2>And also I know it's so much healthier </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to not eat bread and to not eat </v>

896
00:41:12.891 --> 00:41:14.930
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't eat bad oils anymore.</v>

897
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.670
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just to tell you another weight loss</v>

898
00:41:16.671 --> 00:41:17.504
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll do exactly what you say,</v>

922
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 2>but I said you will lose weight and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will not be hungry.</v>

923
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 2>So I put them on a diet of a bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs.</v>

924
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.413
<v Speaker 2>He could eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no vegetables and just copy and spring </v>

925
00:42:20.941 --> 00:42:21.950
<v Speaker 2>water vegetables.</v>

926
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>

927
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.590
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember Dr Atkins,</v>

928
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.693
<v Speaker 2>the Atkins Induction Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to take magnesium or it can be </v>

929
00:42:28.161 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 2>blocked up like the Berlin Wall inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

930
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.233
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lost 30 pounds in five weeks while </v>

931
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:35.780
<v Speaker 2>sitting in his chair researching </v>
<v Speaker 2>Djibouti.</v>

932
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:39.260
<v Speaker 2>The book delmore ended up doing and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>did not leave his chair.</v>

933
00:42:39.261 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 2>He turns librarians on the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>embassy people and stuff like that.</v>

934
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:43.544
<v Speaker 2>But is no vegetables a good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you need vitamins now </v>

935
00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:49.850
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But actually tops has said,</v>

936
00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:54.851
<v Speaker 2>we talked about this once and he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically that meat has all the vitamins</v>

937
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 2>except vitamin C and I'm sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>paraphrasing from long time ago,</v>

938
00:42:58.401 --> 00:42:59.810
<v Speaker 2>so forgive me if I get this wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

939
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:00.763
<v Speaker 2>And that if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you are eating meat rather than </v>

940
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:04.730
<v Speaker 2>carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't get vitamin C deficient,</v>

941
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.480
<v Speaker 2>you look at them Osi and also the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Eskimos.</v>

942
00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.423
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the nun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Stefansson was a guy who was up </v>

943
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 2>there and before they started eating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>western diet,</v>

944
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:14.714
<v Speaker 2>they just stayed blubber and whale meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess they maybe a penguin here </v>

945
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:20.510
<v Speaker 2>and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The penguins.</v>

946
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Penguins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think around our cake with a different</v>

947
00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:26.490
<v Speaker 2>part of the world and nuggets you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really good on geography.</v>

948
00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln say south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I failed geography obviously.</v>

949
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.123
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

950
00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.310
<v Speaker 1>I know that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they also had extremely low rates of</v>

951
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:37.310
<v Speaker 1>cancer and there were just healthier </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

952
00:43:37.311 --> 00:43:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

953
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 2>It's changed as soon as they started </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating the western Diet and Tom's brings</v>

954
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:42.710
<v Speaker 2>up the pima Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>

955
00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Do they have horrible problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes?</v>

956
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Do also though the</v>

957
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.240
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to throw some other stuff in there.</v>

958
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.150
<v Speaker 1>That was also an issue with alcoholism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cigarettes.</v>

959
00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:54.183
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

960
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.920
<v Speaker 1>the cancer and the heart attacks and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the things that happened with the</v>

961
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.190
<v Speaker 1>nun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>

962
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a correlation between extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption of cigarettes and alcohol.</v>

963
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:05.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a,</v>

964
00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:05.934
<v Speaker 1>the American diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all the vices that go along with </v>

965
00:44:07.851 --> 00:44:10.160
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're good at producing this.</v>

966
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:11.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we suck.</v>

967
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.790
<v Speaker 1>We import horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

968
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:16.560
<v Speaker 1>liquid we did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We obviously you and I weren't alive,</v>

969
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:17.963
<v Speaker 1>but whoever looked like us that did that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the native Americans introducing </v>

970
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:22.460
<v Speaker 1>alcohol to them and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:26.270
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bodies weren't used to it.</v>

972
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

973
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a doctor,</v>

974
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:30.763
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm going to have on the soon who </v>

975
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.710
<v Speaker 1>is on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

976
00:44:33.711 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea if this guy's not a.</v>

977
00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is,</v>

978
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.730

<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you right now,</v>

979
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:42.600
<v Speaker 1>but this gentleman is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a full carnivore.</v>

980
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.290
<v Speaker 1>All he does is eat meat and he holds a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of records,</v>

981
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

982
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.130
<v Speaker 1>like athletic pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of interesting.</v>

983
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

984
00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:53.160
<v Speaker 1>this Guy Stephen Phinney is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you in a minute,</v>

985
00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.493
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull them up real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he and I had been going back and </v>

986
00:44:57.301 --> 00:44:59.970
<v Speaker 1>forth trying to figure out a time to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>him on the podcast,</v>

987
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:04.971
<v Speaker 1>but he's 50 years old and it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive what he's been able to do and</v>

988
00:45:05.521 --> 00:45:07.740
<v Speaker 1>all he does is eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't eat anything but meat,</v>

989
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's an md,</v>

990
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:12.570
<v Speaker 1>so of course the fucking Internet's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>working here.</v>

991
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Going on with the Internet here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young Jamie month working.</v>

992
00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of shit.</v>

993
00:45:18.481 --> 00:45:19.314
<v Speaker 1>Laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This laptop has been the worst one I've </v>

994
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:25.560
<v Speaker 1>ever had as far as like connecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it takes forever to reconnect.</v>

995
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that anywhere.</v>

996
00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.650
<v Speaker 2>I never leave the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always on my big computer.</v>

997
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.600
<v Speaker 2>You never leave the house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Lately.</v>

998
00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.000
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book for three years that </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent three years trying to kill me.</v>

999
00:45:34.001 --> 00:45:36.850
<v Speaker 2>So Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my boyfriend brought me food.</v>

1000
00:45:36.851 --> 00:45:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I would've eaten frozen hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs for three years.</v>

1001
00:45:39.311 --> 00:45:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Select the meat guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not good,</v>

1002
00:45:41.051 --> 00:45:42.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't.</v>

1003
00:45:42.311 --> 00:45:43.031
<v Speaker 2>But the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1004
00:45:43.031 --> 00:45:43.864
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you plan on writing this book and I </v>

1005
00:45:45.311 --> 00:45:45.581
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1006
00:45:45.581 --> 00:45:48.220
<v Speaker 2>this'll be easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is this book on how to transform</v>

1007
00:45:48.221 --> 00:45:50.030
<v Speaker 2>to be confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1008
00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.191
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1009
00:45:51.191 --> 00:45:52.024
<v Speaker 2>this will be easy because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing this in my column for so many </v>

1010
00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:54.933
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I look into the science and I </v>

1011
00:45:55.601 --> 00:45:57.490
<v Speaker 2>look a little deeper and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1012
00:45:57.491 --> 00:46:00.310
<v Speaker 2>this is so horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens is.</v>

1013
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.310
<v Speaker 2>So this professor will do these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these researchers,</v>

1014
00:46:03.311 --> 00:46:05.740
<v Speaker 2>they do some research but they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally support it.</v>

1015
00:46:05.741 --> 00:46:07.870
<v Speaker 2>And then they don't work in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transdisciplinary way.</v>

1016
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:08.973
<v Speaker 2>So you have to support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one's researched with that one's </v>

1017
00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:11.734
<v Speaker 2>research and this became this big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just kept having nightmares about </v>

1018
00:46:15.311 --> 00:46:19.270
<v Speaker 2>my editor who's a nice man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing me down the street asking for my</v>

1019
00:46:19.271 --> 00:46:24.271
<v Speaker 2>advanced back with an x and x.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and x or acts like an x.</v>

1020
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1021
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this guy's A.</v>

1022
00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know his full name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His uh,</v>

1023
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.910
<v Speaker 1>his twitter name is s Baker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is a heroin.</v>

1024
00:46:33.911 --> 00:46:38.911
<v Speaker 1>When kidding to hear trades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S Baker md is his twitter name,</v>

1025
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:40.723
<v Speaker 1>the sport world record holding masters </v>
<v Speaker 1>50 plus athlete nutrition for </v>

1026
00:46:44.131 --> 00:46:46.950
<v Speaker 1>performance and health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare and not sick care.</v>

1027
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.060
<v Speaker 1>No medical advice here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all he does is eat meat.</v>

1028
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but meat.</v>

1029
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.000
<v Speaker 2>The Guy I mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Stephen Finney,</v>

1030
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.080
<v Speaker 2>he is a dietary researcher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and Jeff Volek wrote a very good book</v>

1031
00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.520
<v Speaker 2>on low carb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff,</v>

1032
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:00.354
<v Speaker 2>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also dietary researcher and Finney I </v>

1033
00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:04.254
<v Speaker 2>think bicycles competitively or very </v>
<v Speaker 2>intensely and he says that I'm eating </v>

1034
00:47:11.341 --> 00:47:12.174
<v Speaker 2>low carb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's apparently some hump you get </v>

1035
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:15.210
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then that is better.</v>

1036
00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It gives you more energy than this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>

1037
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.470
<v Speaker 2>like drink some gatorade that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have held as the conventional wisdom.</v>

1038
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:23.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the case with like extreme </v>

1039
00:47:25.331 --> 00:47:28.960
<v Speaker 1>endurance sports and oh there's one guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we talked about.</v>

1040
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 1>What do you got here?</v>

1041
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 5>Sean Baker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr Sean Baker,</v>

1042
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:36.781
<v Speaker 5>Carnivore Diet Zero carb Diet plan guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks healthy as fuck.</v>

1043
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 5>He's on the right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1044
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:44.130
<v Speaker 5>he does mean he's jacked and he's dunks </v>
<v Speaker 5>basketballs and lift weights and shit.</v>

1045
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:46.680
<v Speaker 5>But he might just be some athletic </v>
<v Speaker 5>freak.</v>

1046
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:49.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know if it's jeans too.</v>

1047
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.420
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky I have good genes,</v>

1048
00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:52.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boyfriend looks at a saltine and he </v>

1049
00:47:53.821 --> 00:47:54.654
<v Speaker 2>gained three pounds and I'm lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my family were eastern European </v>

1050
00:47:58.111 --> 00:47:58.944
<v Speaker 2>should hold Jews and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably wasn't a lot of food and I </v>

1051
00:48:01.231 --> 00:48:02.064
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow my body learn to manage that </v>

1052
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.940
<v Speaker 2>having lot and having not a lot and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>manages it better.</v>

1053
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.150
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1054
00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:07.984
<v Speaker 5>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm wondering whether or not that's a </v>

1055
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:12.850
<v Speaker 5>really a viable diet to just eat only </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat.</v>

1056
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.713
<v Speaker 5>It just seems like,</v>

1057
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.550
<v Speaker 2>well the Messiah do it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1058
00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.420
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they did it.</v>

1059
00:48:18.421 --> 00:48:21.810
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you missing nutrients?</v>

1060
00:48:21.811 --> 00:48:24.420
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not the person to answer this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you missing nutrients?</v>

1061
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian.</v>

1062
00:48:26.641 --> 00:48:28.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named Chris Kresser who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>posted on this.</v>

1063
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this.</v>

1064
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

1065
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:34.290
<v Speaker 2>And so he has some really good posts </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what you're missing.</v>

1066
00:48:34.291 --> 00:48:35.700
<v Speaker 2>If you provide your tarion and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1067
00:48:35.701 --> 00:48:36.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take vitamins,</v>

1068
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.793
<v Speaker 2>but can you get the vitamins in the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need in the way your body uses them </v>

1069
00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:44.130
<v Speaker 2>from taking vitamin pills or even from </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>

1070
00:48:44.131 --> 00:48:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat a ton of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1071
00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being curt or something.</v>

1072
00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to have soy.</v>

1073
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:52.050
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the dishonesty.</v>

1074
00:48:52.051 --> 00:48:55.070
<v Speaker 2>But vegetarianism and some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowingly make that tradeoff,</v>

1075
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:56.910
<v Speaker 2>but I sure wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1076
00:48:56.911 --> 00:48:58.660
<v Speaker 2>As much as the bunnies are cute and</v>

1077
00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:02.410
<v Speaker 5>Chris Kresser was a Vegan for a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time and you know,</v>

1078
00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:03.244
<v Speaker 5>he's had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had some pretty serious health </v>

1079
00:49:04.111 --> 00:49:06.400
<v Speaker 5>consequences because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1080
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:07.403
<v Speaker 5>that's just him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people were fine with the Vegan </v>

1081
00:49:09.211 --> 00:49:10.044
<v Speaker 5>diet and that's one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>important things to talk about is that </v>

1082
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:12.923
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biodiversity in human beings is </v>

1083
00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:17.100
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a broad,</v>

1084
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:20.520
<v Speaker 5>broad spectrum of what people need and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what people don't need.</v>

1085
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.920
<v Speaker 5>Which is why some people like my friend </v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

1086
00:49:22.921 --> 00:49:27.360
<v Speaker 5>his mom can't even touch Brazil nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have she ate a Brazil nut.</v>

1087
00:49:27.361 --> 00:49:30.270
<v Speaker 5>She'd go into shock and she'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1088
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.880
<v Speaker 5>I can eat them all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They taste like shit.</v>

1089
00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't totally like them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1090
00:49:36.421 --> 00:49:39.030
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a giant curve was</v>

1091
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:39.990
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:43.470
<v Speaker 2>This is the individual differences thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was talking about before.</v>

1093
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.930
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this big push to say,</v>

1094
00:49:45.931 --> 00:49:46.764
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women are alike and groups are </v>

1095
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:50.950
<v Speaker 2>no different from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1096
00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.153
<v Speaker 2>you don't see Jews as NBA basketball </v>
<v Speaker 2>stars and Jews and people from </v>

1097
00:49:56.941 --> 00:50:01.110
<v Speaker 2>northeastern Europe tend to have lactose</v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance in a way other people do not.</v>

1098
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:06.670
<v Speaker 2>So where we are from where we mainly our</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution took place that,</v>

1099
00:50:07.501 --> 00:50:09.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean that goes back way,</v>

1100
00:50:09.121 --> 00:50:09.601
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1101
00:50:09.601 --> 00:50:11.060
<v Speaker 2>way back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1102
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:12.203
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1103
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:13.043
<v Speaker 2>that affects our skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our abilities as well as our digestive </v>

1104
00:50:16.981 --> 00:50:18.330
<v Speaker 2>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1105
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.313
<v Speaker 2>can you eat this kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you drink liquor and not be really </v>

1106
00:50:22.081 --> 00:50:23.880
<v Speaker 2>effected by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those things.</v>

1107
00:50:23.881 --> 00:50:24.714
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the stuff that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like to look at everyone the way </v>

1108
00:50:27.621 --> 00:50:31.220
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about before that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like to say it's just like this.</v>

1109
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.200
<v Speaker 2>It's this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a disease and it's horrible.</v>

1110
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:35.323
<v Speaker 2>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lack of nuance that's just so </v>

1111
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:37.994
<v Speaker 2>stupid and it's so sort of anti solution</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people like to do when people do </v>

1112
00:50:42.111 --> 00:50:43.010
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing of,</v>

1113
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying things are one way.</v>

1114
00:50:45.621 --> 00:50:49.670
<v Speaker 2>It's often in a way too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that people try to feel superior</v>

1115
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.580
<v Speaker 2>who try to simplify things too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do that so that too,</v>

1116
00:50:52.581 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 2>because we'd like to understand things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's that.</v>

1117
00:50:54.891 --> 00:50:55.724
<v Speaker 2>And then also there's a tendency to want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to prosecute people to say you are a </v>

1118
00:50:59.701 --> 00:51:00.534
<v Speaker 2>slovenly fat person and the reason you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are a heavy is that you did not go to </v>

1119
00:51:04.221 --> 00:51:05.054
<v Speaker 2>the gym and I went to the gym and I am a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Gym Goer and you are a scummy </v>

1120
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:12.140
<v Speaker 2>terribles couch sitter and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case.</v>

1121
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:12.974
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tobbs wrote a great piece for New York </v>

1122
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:17.900
<v Speaker 2>magazine about how we think exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes us thinner,</v>

1123
00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:18.734
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't and the reasons you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying before for doing it for mental </v>

1124
00:51:21.531 --> 00:51:22.364
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to do that when I'm feeling just </v>

1125
00:51:23.901 --> 00:51:24.734
<v Speaker 2>my worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make myself get on the bike and do </v>

1126
00:51:26.571 --> 00:51:31.280
<v Speaker 2>these high intensity intervals because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that that'll help me mentally.</v>

1127
00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:32.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'll be there.</v>

1128
00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:35.100
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting exercise doesn't make people</v>

1129
00:51:35.101 --> 00:51:35.934
<v Speaker 5>thinner.</v>

1130
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:37.083
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what tops in this piece says and </v>

1131
00:51:38.891 --> 00:51:40.570
<v Speaker 2>that's what I see over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 2>and believe me,</v>

1132
00:51:40.571 --> 00:51:41.404
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to believe that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think people can lose weight through </v>

1133
00:51:44.081 --> 00:51:45.550
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they get hungrier.</v>

1134
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:47.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not you don't you exercise,</v>

1135
00:51:47.711 --> 00:51:48.544
<v Speaker 2>you get hungrier and you replace that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have all the nuances on this so </v>

1136
00:51:51.761 --> 00:51:52.594
<v Speaker 2>everyone should look up that top piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York magazine because he's just </v>

1137
00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:55.510
<v Speaker 2>fantastic and it</v>

1138
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.910
<v Speaker 5>with all that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very anecdotal.</v>

1139
00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:58.803
<v Speaker 5>You know when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you start saying that diet is the </v>

1140
00:52:00.671 --> 00:52:03.220
<v Speaker 5>way to go and that exercise does not </v>
<v Speaker 5>make you thin.</v>

1141
00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:07.720
<v Speaker 5>It's anecdotal because some people </v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise absolutely make some thing.</v>

1142
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of people that have started</v>

1143
00:52:10.181 --> 00:52:12.070
<v Speaker 5>doing Jujitsu and lost 30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40 pounds.</v>

1144
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:15.250
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of people that have done </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and it works,</v>

1145
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's extremely strenuous,</v>

1146
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.093
<v Speaker 5>extremely rigorous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She burned off a ton of a ton of </v>

1147
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:21.580
<v Speaker 5>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You accelerate your metabolism,</v>

1148
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:26.080
<v Speaker 5>your metabolism starts burning off fat </v>
<v Speaker 5>at an unprecedented rate for your body,</v>

1149
00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.450
<v Speaker 5>and it does work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>

1150
00:52:28.451 --> 00:52:30.430
<v Speaker 5>what kind of exercise do you engage?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1151
00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:31.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1152
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:34.510
<v Speaker 5>that's another factor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like are you just doing like a long slow</v>

1153
00:52:34.511 --> 00:52:38.860
<v Speaker 5>jog with very low intensity or are you </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing like power lifting?</v>

1154
00:52:38.861 --> 00:52:39.694
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 5>actual weightlifting is way better for </v>

1155
00:52:43.061 --> 00:52:46.570
<v Speaker 5>burning fat than anything else because </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you weight lift,</v>

1156
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.380
<v Speaker 5>your body makes more muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more muscle consumes more calories,</v>

1157
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.930
<v Speaker 5>and if you have the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>calorie intake,</v>

1158
00:52:52.931 --> 00:52:53.764
<v Speaker 5>but now your body has more requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll start burning off some of that </v>

1159
00:52:56.441 --> 00:52:57.080
<v Speaker 5>fat.</v>

1160
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a really great point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I am not one to,</v>

1161
00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:00.463
<v Speaker 2>that's I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert in this area and I </v>

1162
00:53:02.331 --> 00:53:05.000
<v Speaker 2>haven't read very much in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have read this.</v>

1163
00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the guy's name?</v>

1164
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot,</v>

1165
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mikey.</v>

1166
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:11.070
<v Speaker 2>It's wrote a book with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

1167
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:14.780
<v Speaker 2>it's slow burn fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually I do that.</v>

1168
00:53:14.781 --> 00:53:15.614
<v Speaker 2>I lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lift them until your muscles are </v>

1169
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:20.270
<v Speaker 2>just screaming and I can live like eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds because I'm totally wimpy.</v>

1170
00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1171
00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:24.770
<v Speaker 2>and you do it really slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so slowly,</v>

1172
00:53:24.771 --> 00:53:28.830
<v Speaker 2>like times barely moving and that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase your metabolism.</v>

1173
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 2>It improves your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1174
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 2>improves your cardiovascular system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the other thing?</v>

1175
00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 2>And it does help weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the new one,</v>

1176
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.270
<v Speaker 2>there are nuances on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

1177
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I say that because when I look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tops thing,</v>

1178
00:53:41.911 --> 00:53:43.980
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he support stuff very well.</v>

1179
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:45.083
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a little light on what the </v>

1180
00:53:46.201 --> 00:53:48.060
<v Speaker 2>details are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So admittedly,</v>

1181
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:48.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1182
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:49.763
<v Speaker 2>I think you bring up a good point on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and also the individual </v>

1183
00:53:51.601 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 2>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we are the thing that we are</v>

1184
00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:55.194
<v Speaker 2>different and so some people are able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose weight in ways that other people </v>

1185
00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:01.380
<v Speaker 2>may be or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think this</v>

1186
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.210
<v Speaker 5>you see with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you have kids?</v>

1187
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:04.440
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have kids.</v>

1188
00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:05.274
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things you see is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see kids that can just fucking eat </v>

1189
00:54:08.401 --> 00:54:10.890
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They eat anything and they're skinny and</v>

1190
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:14.700
<v Speaker 5>then you see other kids that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just really struggling on a really early</v>

1191
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.533
<v Speaker 5>age and their body packs on a ton of fat</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they have those extreme endomorph </v>

1192
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:22.030
<v Speaker 5>bodies and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1193
00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 5>it's clear differences and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they,</v>

1194
00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:26.880
<v Speaker 5>they are both on the playground together</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the same time.</v>

1195
00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:27.714
<v Speaker 5>They're both the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not dealing with a lifetime of </v>

1196
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:30.594
<v Speaker 5>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about 10 year olds right </v>

1197
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:31.840
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

1198
00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:36.100
<v Speaker 2>So it comes down to me to how does your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body process nutrients,</v>

1199
00:54:36.101 --> 00:54:36.934
<v Speaker 2>how does it process the food you take in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how well does it do it and where </v>

1200
00:54:40.331 --> 00:54:42.420
<v Speaker 2>does it store it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

1201
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:43.970
<v Speaker 2>those kids who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

1202
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:46.180
<v Speaker 2>if you had them do the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

1203
00:54:46.181 --> 00:54:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you will see that one kid ends up being </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatter and one isn't and,</v>

1204
00:54:50.081 --> 00:54:51.040
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1205
00:54:51.041 --> 00:54:51.874
<v Speaker 2>if you fed them the exact same things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that the factories just </v>

1206
00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.710
<v Speaker 2>working differently in one kid had </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetics.</v>

1207
00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:59.230
<v Speaker 5>The other thing to take into </v>
<v Speaker 5>consideration,</v>

1208
00:54:59.231 --> 00:55:01.150
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about lactose </v>
<v Speaker 5>intolerance,</v>

1209
00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:01.993
<v Speaker 5>intolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that I read recently </v>

1210
00:55:04.031 --> 00:55:04.864
<v Speaker 5>is that a big part of lactose </v>
<v Speaker 5>intolerance can be attributed to the </v>

1211
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:12.040
<v Speaker 5>homogenization and pasteurization of </v>
<v Speaker 5>milk and that you know,</v>

1212
00:55:12.041 --> 00:55:14.650
<v Speaker 5>we're very concerned about diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rightly so,</v>

1213
00:55:14.651 --> 00:55:18.970
<v Speaker 5>and that's why I'm in freshness and but </v>
<v Speaker 5>milk's not supposed to be able to sit on</v>

1214
00:55:18.971 --> 00:55:21.490
<v Speaker 5>a shelf for three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not supposed to.</v>

1215
00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:24.100
<v Speaker 5>You're supposed to get milk if you drink</v>
<v Speaker 5>it at all,</v>

1216
00:55:24.101 --> 00:55:24.934
<v Speaker 5>it should be fresh and that way it has </v>
<v Speaker 5>the enzymes in it and that what we're </v>

1217
00:55:27.581 --> 00:55:28.414
<v Speaker 5>doing by boiling this milk and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pasteurizing and homogenizing it is </v>

1218
00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:32.194
<v Speaker 5>where you're creating this dead protein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>liquid shit that your body doesn't know </v>

1219
00:55:35.351 --> 00:55:39.820
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck to do with and then the </v>
<v Speaker 5>weirder ones is when you take it and you</v>

1220
00:55:39.821 --> 00:55:40.654
<v Speaker 5>suck the fat out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you have low fat milk and a </v>

1221
00:55:43.121 --> 00:55:45.760
<v Speaker 5>lot of people don't even realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Low fat milk has sugar in it.</v>

1222
00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:49.210
<v Speaker 5>They literally add sugar to low fat milk</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make it palatable.</v>

1223
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 5>So disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>

1224
00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:52.780
<v Speaker 5>Not you're not getting anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

1225
00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:57.190
<v Speaker 5>It might be low fat is in fat content,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as in the effects it's going to have</v>

1226
00:55:57.191 --> 00:55:58.810
<v Speaker 5>on your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not low fat at all.</v>

1227
00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually Jeff Volek,</v>

1228
00:56:00.171 --> 00:56:03.620
<v Speaker 2>that dietary researcher basically agreed</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me when I said to him,</v>

1229
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.980
<v Speaker 2>so is it basically child abuse to feed </v>
<v Speaker 2>your child skim milk?</v>

1230
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we are,</v>

1231
00:56:07.551 --> 00:56:09.620
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a very wealthy country.</v>

1232
00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.470
<v Speaker 2>People are feeding their children </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrient free food.</v>

1233
00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:14.340
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1234
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:14.670
<v Speaker 2>there I</v>

1235
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:18.810
<v Speaker 5>have not had enough time to study the </v>
<v Speaker 5>research.</v>

1236
00:56:18.811 --> 00:56:19.980
<v Speaker 5>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people,</v>

1237
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:21.083
<v Speaker 5>they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they hear is if you eat </v>

1238
00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.880
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll get fat.</v>

1239
00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:29.080
<v Speaker 5>If you eat saturated fats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll have a heart attack,</v>

1240
00:56:29.081 --> 00:56:32.260
<v Speaker 5>and there you're talking about like 19 </v>
<v Speaker 5>sixties knowledge.</v>

1241
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.160
<v Speaker 5>You talk to top of the food chain </v>
<v Speaker 5>researchers today,</v>

1242
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:38.560
<v Speaker 5>no pun intended,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in 2017,</v>

1243
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:42.310
<v Speaker 5>and they'll tell you quite the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll tell you that saturated fats and</v>

1244
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:43.144
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol are actually good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they are the precursors for </v>

1245
00:56:45.731 --> 00:56:46.564
<v Speaker 5>hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body uses them to produce </v>

1246
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:48.874
<v Speaker 5>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like your body uses them to produce </v>

1247
00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:51.694
<v Speaker 5>hormones and that this idea that eating </v>
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol raises your blood </v>

1248
00:56:57.191 --> 00:56:59.260
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not true.</v>

1249
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.153
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually we've been so credulous as </v>

1250
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.020
<v Speaker 2>as people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think probably it's not just us,</v>

1251
00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:05.854
<v Speaker 2>it's probably around the globe for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many decades and now part of the good </v>

1252
00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:10.413
<v Speaker 2>part of having all this media is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of the sort of the counterpoint </v>

1253
00:57:14.621 --> 00:57:17.770
<v Speaker 2>gets out there and so it's been sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a religion.</v>

1254
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 2>People have believed this because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government put it out.</v>

1255
00:57:20.921 --> 00:57:25.390
<v Speaker 2>The American Heart Association,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ama put it out saying fat is,</v>

1256
00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat is bad.</v>

1257
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And recently they did it again with </v>
<v Speaker 2>capstone.</v>

1258
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Yet it's so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not evidence based.</v>

1259
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:32.543
<v Speaker 2>It's no</v>

1260
00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:33.853
<v Speaker 5>send it to a bunch of people like Rhonda</v>
<v Speaker 5>Patrick and all the doctors and </v>

1261
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:38.820
<v Speaker 5>scientists that I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1262
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 5>am I wrong here or is this crap?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And on it wrote a piece,</v>

1263
00:57:42.761 --> 00:57:47.260
<v Speaker 5>one of the researchers for on it wrote a</v>
<v Speaker 5>piece of essentially saying the American</v>

1264
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.093
<v Speaker 5>Heart Association is essentially whack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of a whack institution and </v>

1265
00:57:50.621 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 5>they're not on top of the ball.</v>

1266
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:52.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found this with another medical </v>

1267
00:57:53.771 --> 00:57:54.604
<v Speaker 2>association in this piece I'm writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really terrible because what </v>

1268
00:57:57.671 --> 00:58:01.120
<v Speaker 2>happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so doctor say that you go to an Hmo,</v>

1269
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.983
<v Speaker 2>those doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go by the recommendations of these </v>

1270
00:58:04.661 --> 00:58:05.494
<v Speaker 2>big associations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got the big associations </v>

1271
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:08.554
<v Speaker 2>telling basically medical fairy tales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're continuing to tell the same </v>

1272
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 2>fairytale that they've told and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are basing their healthcare decisions on</v>

1273
00:58:16.331 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 2>that doctors are and then the patients </v>
<v Speaker 2>are listening.</v>

1274
00:58:18.881 --> 00:58:19.601
<v Speaker 2>They assume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1275
00:58:19.601 --> 00:58:20.434
<v Speaker 2>you're wearing a white coat and you went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to medical school and I went to school </v>

1276
00:58:22.391 --> 00:58:23.224
<v Speaker 2>of Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'll listen to you and that's </v>

1277
00:58:25.691 --> 00:58:26.524
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really damaging and this is why I think </v>

1278
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Nina Tie Scholtz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Dr Eades,</v>

1279
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:32.163
<v Speaker 2>Gary Tobbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people you know who've done </v>

1280
00:58:34.121 --> 00:58:36.700
<v Speaker 2>this work to put this put out the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

1281
00:58:36.701 --> 00:58:37.534
<v Speaker 2>they have saved an enormous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives and stop people from having </v>

1282
00:58:40.631 --> 00:58:41.464
<v Speaker 2>horrible diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that they're all heroic </v>

1283
00:58:43.361 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 2>because it's been a fight to put that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff out.</v>

1284
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 2>It's been a big battle for them and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have people fighting them all the time.</v>

1285
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.983
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people that go to a doctor for </v>

1286
00:58:51.771 --> 00:58:54.120
<v Speaker 5>advice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the reality about medical schools,</v>

1287
00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:56.630
<v Speaker 5>you'd take very little time to learn </v>
<v Speaker 5>about nutrition.</v>

1288
00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:57.753
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's an orthopedic surgeon or </v>

1289
00:58:59.991 --> 00:59:00.824
<v Speaker 5>the whatever the specialty is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea that these people are the goto </v>

1290
00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:07.573
<v Speaker 5>expert on every single area of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including nutritional absorption is </v>

1291
00:59:10.581 --> 00:59:11.414
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not the case and there's a </v>

1292
00:59:13.881 --> 00:59:14.714
<v Speaker 5>great many people that know more about </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition and especially state of the </v>

1293
00:59:19.041 --> 00:59:22.760
<v Speaker 5>art and nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then your does unfortunately.</v>

1294
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:23.803
<v Speaker 2>But see if you realize that then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>already ahead of the game and you can </v>

1295
00:59:26.061 --> 00:59:26.930
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1296
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.063
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am going to use you for tests and </v>

1297
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 2>tried to sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really sucks.</v>

1298
00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:35.893
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are obviously some great doctors </v>

1299
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:39.140
<v Speaker 2>out there in the Ken give you some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1300
00:59:39.141 --> 00:59:39.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my doctor,</v>

1301
00:59:39.981 --> 00:59:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Dr Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Gordon,</v>

1302
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 5>he's also an expert in traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>injury and uh,</v>

1303
00:59:45.021 --> 00:59:45.854
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a really nuanced guy and when I </v>

1304
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:48.914
<v Speaker 5>talked to him about cholesterol and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these different factors and ldl and hdl </v>

1305
00:59:52.671 --> 00:59:53.504
<v Speaker 5>and triglycerides and he can give me a </v>
<v Speaker 5>research based sort of point of view on </v>

1306
00:59:58.491 --> 01:00:02.750
<v Speaker 5>it because he's doing it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's eating this way himself.</v>

1307
01:00:02.751 --> 01:00:04.880
<v Speaker 5>He's paying attention to all the latest </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>

1308
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:07.730
<v Speaker 5>but he's got a voracious appetite for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that stuff.</v>

1309
01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.770
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that just don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to be bothered.</v>

1310
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 5>They got their degree in 1982 and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're done.</v>

1311
01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's so terrible.</v>

1312
01:00:13.931 --> 01:00:15.940
<v Speaker 2>And see if your doctor discloses that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1313
01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:17.043
<v Speaker 2>If they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1314
01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:17.993
<v Speaker 2>I am really known nothing about diet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you advice because </v>

1315
01:00:21.221 --> 01:00:22.054
<v Speaker 2>they say that I should give you advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really it's not based in anything </v>

1316
01:00:24.341 --> 01:00:26.260
<v Speaker 2>other than they printed out some sheets </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1317
01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Then okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then you're informed.</v>

1318
01:00:28.481 --> 01:00:31.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not like your doctor is leading you</v>
<v Speaker 2>on with the white coat,</v>

1319
01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.190
<v Speaker 2>but most people are being led on,</v>

1320
01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.770
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just we have this idea,</v>

1321
01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:37.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have this idea that,</v>

1322
01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.013
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1323
01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:39.580
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I need to do to be healthy.</v>

1324
01:00:39.581 --> 01:00:40.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1325
01:00:40.421 --> 01:00:43.210
<v Speaker 5>maybe I should go on a vegetarian diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'll be healthy.</v>

1326
01:00:43.211 --> 01:00:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1327
01:00:44.051 --> 01:00:44.884
<v Speaker 5>if you read fucking cupcakes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Burritos and fucking cheese doodles all </v>

1328
01:00:48.551 --> 01:00:49.384
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1329
01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:51.700
<v Speaker 5>a Vegan Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be amazing for you.</v>

1330
01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.310
<v Speaker 5>It's going to really do a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>

1331
01:00:54.311 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 5>is it optimal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be,</v>

1332
01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:58.530
<v Speaker 5>it might be optimal for you and put it </v>
<v Speaker 5>might not be optimal for you.</v>

1333
01:00:58.790 --> 01:00:59.770
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>might be for me,</v>

1334
01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.140
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1335
01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:02.163
<v Speaker 5>but if trying and trial and error </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes really difficult for people </v>

1336
01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:10.330
<v Speaker 5>because most people have jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 5>families and obligations and hobbies and</v>

1337
01:01:10.331 --> 01:01:11.164
<v Speaker 5>things they like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to spend time going </v>

1338
01:01:12.761 --> 01:01:16.450
<v Speaker 5>through pub med studies and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out what the fuck is a good thing</v>

1339
01:01:16.451 --> 01:01:18.580
<v Speaker 5>to eat and the bad thing to eat and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1340
01:01:18.581 --> 01:01:20.770
<v Speaker 5>what are the variables?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it based on,</v>

1341
01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the origin of my ancestors?</v>

1342
01:01:22.451 --> 01:01:23.950
<v Speaker 5>Do I have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about,</v>

1343
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.273
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those ancestral diet people that are </v>

1344
01:01:26.261 --> 01:01:27.190
<v Speaker 5>really into that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1345
01:01:27.191 --> 01:01:28.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like where are you,</v>

1346
01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:30.280
<v Speaker 5>where are your people from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like where did they grow up doing,</v>

1347
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.170
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1348
01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

1349
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.680
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard and the great thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there,</v>

1350
01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:36.563
<v Speaker 2>there is more stuff out there that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>written for lay people were people who </v>

1351
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:40.733
<v Speaker 2>read the research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain it to people in a way that is </v>

1352
01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:44.483
<v Speaker 2>very clear and understandable so people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can make more of their own decision I </v>

1353
01:01:47.431 --> 01:01:48.870
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they ever could before.</v>

1354
01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.580
<v Speaker 5>It was also people that are super </v>
<v Speaker 5>cynical.</v>

1355
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:51.271
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

1356
01:01:51.271 --> 01:01:52.104
<v Speaker 5>I grew up with Dr Susan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Food Pyramid was always weed at the </v>

1357
01:01:53.941 --> 01:01:56.250
<v Speaker 5>bottom and the top was all this other </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>

1358
01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.293
<v Speaker 5>but now everybody's flipping the food </v>
<v Speaker 5>pyramid and you just taken out the </v>

1359
01:01:59.401 --> 01:02:00.960
<v Speaker 5>bottom part entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1360
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.540
<v Speaker 5>and so what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's gonna happen five years from now?</v>

1361
01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:04.321
<v Speaker 5>You're going to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1362
01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:06.690
<v Speaker 5>high fat is actually terrible for your </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>

1363
01:02:06.691 --> 01:02:07.890
<v Speaker 5>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1364
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:08.813
<v Speaker 5>it's just people are understandably </v>
<v Speaker 5>tired of all this stuff and it's real </v>

1365
01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 5>easy to just sort of compartmentalize </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just push it away and listen to your</v>

1366
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:20.454
<v Speaker 5>doctor.</v>

1367
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

1368
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.313
<v Speaker 2>And the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point you made before about the </v>

1369
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>people who are eating the cheetos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cupcakes,</v>

1370
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Diane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well of course,</v>

1371
01:02:26.551 --> 01:02:28.390
<v Speaker 2>if you start eating a Vegan Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1372
01:02:28.391 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 2>you're not eating cheetos and cupcakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're going to see an effect.</v>

1373
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:33.300
<v Speaker 2>But is that a good effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1374
01:02:33.301 --> 01:02:36.120
<v Speaker 2>in terms of your longterm health and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1375
01:02:36.121 --> 01:02:36.954
<v Speaker 2>we see that vegetarians don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary proteins that you get very </v>

1376
01:02:39.781 --> 01:02:41.650
<v Speaker 2>easily from meat with no training</v>

1377
01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.500
<v Speaker 1>to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a balanced amino acid profile.</v>

1378
01:02:44.501 --> 01:02:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Foods like I know pea protein and hemp </v>
<v Speaker 1>proteins.</v>

1379
01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Very good keen keenwah</v>

1380
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:51.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than I am.</v>

1381
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:52.374
<v Speaker 2>This I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't my area because I don't care </v>

1382
01:02:53.761 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 2>about that stuff since I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian and wouldn't eat that way,</v>

1383
01:02:57.841 --> 01:03:00.840
<v Speaker 2>but I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people like Chris Kresser try to help</v>

1384
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:01.980
<v Speaker 2>people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1385
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.023
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can make some choices and </v>

1386
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:06.840
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1387
01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:07.674
<v Speaker 2>is there a way for me as a vegetarian to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the nutrients I need or am I always </v>

1388
01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:13.980
<v Speaker 2>going to be deficient and how might that</v>
<v Speaker 2>affect my health?</v>

1389
01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.180
<v Speaker 2>So what are the tradeoffs?</v>

1390
01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people they don't think of it </v>

1391
01:03:17.091 --> 01:03:17.924
<v Speaker 1>purely as a health issue as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also think about it as an ethical </v>

1392
01:03:20.571 --> 01:03:21.720
<v Speaker 1>and moral issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1393
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:22.850
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1394
01:03:22.851 --> 01:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be a part of factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>farming.</v>

1395
01:03:24.591 --> 01:03:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of animals,</v>

1396
01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:28.123
<v Speaker 1>which I completely understand and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect and appreciate what they're </v>

1397
01:03:32.811 --> 01:03:37.190
<v Speaker 1>doing is they're trying to leave a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller footprint on the world.</v>

1398
01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:38.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense too.</v>

1399
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see that because I,</v>

1400
01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:41.624
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that animal cruelty is a </v>

1401
01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:45.810
<v Speaker 2>good thing and I think animals should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanely slaughtered and kept.</v>

1402
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.930
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that that's a really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

1403
01:03:48.931 --> 01:03:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I have friends who are vegetarians for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that reason,</v>

1404
01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:56.061
<v Speaker 2>who know about eating meat and and being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a healthier way to,</v>

1405
01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:57.683
<v Speaker 2>to have a diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they choose to make that tradeoff </v>

1406
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.530
<v Speaker 2>and as long as you're making a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reason choice and you know what you're</v>

1407
01:04:04.531 --> 01:04:06.570
<v Speaker 2>trading off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm fine with that.</v>

1408
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:07.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1409
01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1410
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.613
<v Speaker 1>for some people vegetarians probably the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to go and that's what gets really </v>

1411
01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:13.464
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how do you figure out what is </v>

1412
01:04:15.061 --> 01:04:17.250
<v Speaker 1>the right way to go and what is the for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1413
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

1414
01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:20.220
<v Speaker 1>what you're supposed to do is get blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>

1415
01:04:20.221 --> 01:04:21.870
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to do it on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

1416
01:04:21.871 --> 01:04:22.704
<v Speaker 1>Supposed to consult with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually knows what they're talking </v>

1417
01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:24.990
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1418
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:29.990
<v Speaker 1>And really just sort of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just make these choices,</v>

1419
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:34.350
<v Speaker 1>test the results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then make an educated decision based</v>

1420
01:04:34.351 --> 01:04:34.940
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>

1421
01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.773
<v Speaker 2>And here's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you find the evidence based </v>

1422
01:04:37.821 --> 01:04:38.654
<v Speaker 2>doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm in an Hmo so I can just </v>

1423
01:04:41.361 --> 01:04:44.630
<v Speaker 2>switch doctors forever and ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just stay with the doctor and then</v>

1424
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.870
<v Speaker 2>read stuff myself because I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do for a living,</v>

1425
01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:48.943
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for other people who aren't in an </v>

1426
01:04:50.091 --> 01:04:50.924
<v Speaker 2>Hmo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to find an evidence based </v>

1427
01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:55.430
<v Speaker 2>medicine practitioner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will say they are,</v>

1428
01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.880
<v Speaker 2>but then you hear the raw what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggest and they really aren't.</v>

1429
01:04:58.881 --> 01:04:59.714
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really big problem would be </v>

1430
01:05:01.041 --> 01:05:01.874
<v Speaker 2>great if there were somebody could make </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of money maybe doing a site </v>

1431
01:05:03.771 --> 01:05:04.281
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1432
01:05:04.281 --> 01:05:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm this doctor and here's what I look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at and think.</v>

1433
01:05:06.951 --> 01:05:07.784
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could choose because we tried to </v>

1434
01:05:09.801 --> 01:05:12.950
<v Speaker 2>find one for my boyfriend in Los Angeles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

1435
01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:14.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows.</v>

1436
01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

1437
01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It mean they're,</v>

1438
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>they're out there,</v>

1439
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.210
<v Speaker 5>but it's hard to find them.</v>

1440
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you tried five or six doctors.</v>

1441
01:05:21.491 --> 01:05:23.470
<v Speaker 2>You go through them and these are all </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor appointments.</v>

1442
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:25.180
<v Speaker 2>You have to pay for them and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you find,</v>

1443
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:26.014
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know anything really onto the </v>

1444
01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:27.904
<v Speaker 2>next</v>

1445
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:30.600
<v Speaker 5>incredibly time consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when I go to my doctor,</v>

1446
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:34.770
<v Speaker 5>when I get blood work done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have a 75 minute consultation.</v>

1447
01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.053
<v Speaker 5>We have to sit down for 75 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>go over all the various micronutrient </v>

1448
01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:41.940
<v Speaker 5>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all the different levels of,</v>

1449
01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything nice and [inaudible] be like,</v>

1450
01:05:44.731 --> 01:05:45.564
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we go over diet and we go over like </v>

1451
01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.620
<v Speaker 5>when are you eating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what time are you eating?</v>

1452
01:05:49.621 --> 01:05:50.670
<v Speaker 5>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when are you eating,</v>

1453
01:05:50.671 --> 01:05:52.800
<v Speaker 5>before you take the blood tests and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1454
01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:55.290
<v Speaker 5>how much water are you consuming?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Red hydrated are you.</v>

1455
01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.573
<v Speaker 5>And there's a lot going on me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to truly optimize your </v>

1456
01:05:59.461 --> 01:06:01.560
<v Speaker 5>health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's better than ever,</v>

1457
01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:05.010
<v Speaker 5>but still extremely hard to find someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows what they're doing.</v>

1458
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:05.923
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the doctor you go to that seems like </v>

1459
01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:09.014
<v Speaker 2>a smart if you are going to spend money </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that guy's probably really </v>

1460
01:06:10.971 --> 01:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're going to spend money,</v>

1461
01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a doctor who sees you for 72 minutes and</v>

1462
01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.390
<v Speaker 2>looks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks at you that way.</v>

1463
01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.330
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a really wise investment</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your future.</v>

1464
01:06:20.331 --> 01:06:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're maybe somebody who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1465
01:06:22.461 --> 01:06:24.890
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have money to burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

1466
01:06:24.891 --> 01:06:26.810
<v Speaker 2>that seems a really smart place to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1467
01:06:26.811 --> 01:06:29.420
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you have to make some sacrifices</v>

1468
01:06:29.421 --> 01:06:30.260
<v Speaker 2>in other areas.</v>

1469
01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:30.791
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1470
01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:31.624
<v Speaker 5>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think read as much as you can </v>

1471
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:37.000
<v Speaker 5>about not just read books by people on </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition,</v>

1472
01:06:37.001 --> 01:06:40.380
<v Speaker 5>but read articles about those books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1473
01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.273
<v Speaker 5>read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean pro and con and I've read a lot </v>

1474
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:44.584
<v Speaker 5>of con and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to go over that stuff with a </v>

1475
01:06:46.271 --> 01:06:48.060
<v Speaker 5>fine tooth comb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look for bias,</v>

1476
01:06:48.061 --> 01:06:49.220
<v Speaker 5>look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's hard to do.</v>

1477
01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.370
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to do.</v>

1478
01:06:50.371 --> 01:06:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Some of the important things are to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the sample size,</v>

1479
01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:54.090
<v Speaker 2>look at people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1480
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:56.670
<v Speaker 2>look the limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they'll say them at the end.</v>

1481
01:06:56.671 --> 01:06:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I always liked those studies that do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sample size,</v>

1482
01:06:59.551 --> 01:07:00.384
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when somebody has had 22 people in this </v>

1483
01:07:02.071 --> 01:07:03.110
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1484
01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.680
<v Speaker 2>that's not the one you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look for,</v>

1485
01:07:04.681 --> 01:07:06.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't just save necessarily,</v>

1486
01:07:06.901 --> 01:07:08.520
<v Speaker 2>oh it must be this number or that </v>
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>

1487
01:07:08.521 --> 01:07:11.790
<v Speaker 2>But look for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what else?</v>

1488
01:07:11.791 --> 01:07:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Like if they say something's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant,</v>

1489
01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.870
<v Speaker 2>then I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm immediately suspicious.</v>

1490
01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Significance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1491
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:19.023
<v Speaker 2>well there's this whole argument about p</v>
<v Speaker 2>values and that's probability measure </v>

1492
01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:25.080
<v Speaker 2>that's going on now and we'll okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take that.</v>

1493
01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:25.953
<v Speaker 2>Some people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take that out of the equation and </v>

1494
01:07:28.141 --> 01:07:31.830
<v Speaker 2>because that's people are using this as </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of golden thing to say,</v>

1495
01:07:31.831 --> 01:07:32.664
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had the spiny and it's fantastic and </v>

1496
01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:39.150
<v Speaker 2>to look at him to look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1497
01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.173
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole study and the findings in a </v>

1498
01:07:41.371 --> 01:07:44.400
<v Speaker 2>more nuanced way than just the p value.</v>

1499
01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.053
<v Speaker 5>It's hard for people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean one of the things that we've </v>

1500
01:07:47.171 --> 01:07:48.004
<v Speaker 5>talked about a couple of times recently </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people keep throwing around is </v>

1501
01:07:49.991 --> 01:07:50.824
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are the recent studies that show </v>

1502
01:07:52.211 --> 01:07:53.044
<v Speaker 5>that people who eat a lot of red meat </v>
<v Speaker 5>are more likely to get cancer and the </v>

1503
01:07:56.591 --> 01:07:58.960
<v Speaker 5>issue with these studies is a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>issues.</v>

1504
01:07:58.961 --> 01:07:59.794
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't differentiate what kind of </v>

1505
01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:01.594
<v Speaker 5>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't differentiate whether or not </v>

1506
01:08:02.441 --> 01:08:03.274
<v Speaker 5>you eat it with vegetables or whether </v>
<v Speaker 5>you eat it with white bread and </v>

1507
01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:10.891
<v Speaker 5>spaghetti and this huge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you're eating grass fed bison or</v>

1508
01:08:11.261 --> 01:08:12.094
<v Speaker 5>whether they're eating some bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 5>burger and you just saying you eat meet </v>

1509
01:08:15.561 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 5>five times</v>

1510
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.023
<v Speaker 2>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't show me what's in your </v>

1511
01:08:18.591 --> 01:08:19.424
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are called cohort studies and I </v>

1512
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:22.034
<v Speaker 2>call them if you see that cohort studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>or observational or population based </v>

1513
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.013
<v Speaker 2>observational study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call them leap to conclusions after </v>

1514
01:08:29.391 --> 01:08:33.230
<v Speaker 2>the fact and they're just like the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit of studies,</v>

1515
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because did the person,</v>

1516
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're saying,</v>

1517
01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:39.440
<v Speaker 2>what caused this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing that we're seeing,</v>

1518
01:08:39.441 --> 01:08:40.420
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are there,</v>

1519
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:41.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this effect.</v>

1520
01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.980
<v Speaker 2>There are healthy foods and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a,</v>

1521
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.790
<v Speaker 2>it's such a crappy way and you see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>reported in the media,</v>

1522
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:50.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1523
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:52.670
<v Speaker 2>these articles that say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1524
01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:55.970
<v Speaker 2>everyone should never eat this type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>food ever again.</v>

1525
01:08:55.971 --> 01:08:58.850
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't say that at all,</v>

1526
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 2>but the reporters don't know that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just don't even care.</v>

1527
01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:03.044
<v Speaker 2>It's just click a bunch of hits on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>article and you'll see articles like </v>

1528
01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:07.814
<v Speaker 2>that that even in like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>respectable publications that have this </v>

1529
01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 2>really attractive headline.</v>

1530
01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.910
<v Speaker 2>And then you read the actual article </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

1531
01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.240
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1532
01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.730
<v Speaker 2>what are you basing this off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really terrible.</v>

1533
01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:19.340
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you said to look at studies.</v>

1534
01:09:19.341 --> 01:09:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Look at the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite point of view that's really</v>

1535
01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:25.880
<v Speaker 2>important to look at at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1536
01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:28.160
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to read some of these studies.</v>

1537
01:09:28.161 --> 01:09:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate researchers who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and clear language.</v>

1538
01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I think that's more and more important </v>
<v Speaker 2>as people can get studies.</v>

1539
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a site called sky hub where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get studies that are protected,</v>

1540
01:09:39.561 --> 01:09:42.020
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the journals don't let you get.</v>

1541
01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can find them on professors.</v>

1542
01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Websites are ways to find these studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to find them.</v>

1543
01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.593
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use google scholar to look up </v>

1544
01:09:50.031 --> 01:09:53.510
<v Speaker 2>the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a scholar.google.com.</v>

1545
01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:56.780
<v Speaker 2>And then you can start finding these in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to get them through other sources if</v>

1546
01:09:56.781 --> 01:09:57.614
<v Speaker 2>they are password protected because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to just read the abstract </v>

1547
01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:02.780
<v Speaker 2>because they can say the abstracts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>part at the top where they tell you what</v>

1548
01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:03.580
<v Speaker 2>the study's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oee,</v>

1549
01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.720
<v Speaker 2>this significant finding and we found </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>

1550
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.490
<v Speaker 2>And you will often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not often,</v>

1551
01:10:07.491 --> 01:10:08.324
<v Speaker 2>but you will sometimes read a study and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that the thing that they say </v>

1552
01:10:11.331 --> 01:10:12.164
<v Speaker 2>they found is not what they found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's important to not </v>

1553
01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:17.960
<v Speaker 2>just be this lazy person who reads only </v>
<v Speaker 2>the abstract and the conclusion,</v>

1554
01:10:17.961 --> 01:10:20.600
<v Speaker 2>but to look at the methodology and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's stuff screwed up.</v>

1555
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.733
<v Speaker 2>I saw a study done by Harvard professors</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they didn't have a control group </v>

1556
01:10:25.191 --> 01:10:27.230
<v Speaker 2>for their third experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

1557
01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.030
<v Speaker 2>did you forget?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1558
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:31.130
<v Speaker 2>you're at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you guys don't know,</v>

1559
01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:33.020
<v Speaker 2>to put in a control group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1560
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:34.880
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a study about,</v>

1561
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:36.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was um,</v>

1562
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.200
<v Speaker 2>a study on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1563
01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.150
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna remember now it was,</v>

1564
01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:44.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mm shoot.</v>

1565
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.810
<v Speaker 2>It was the third part was in a train </v>
<v Speaker 2>station and I can't,</v>

1566
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what the study was </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1567
01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:49.993
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought it with me in an evolutionary </v>

1568
01:10:50.841 --> 01:10:51.674
<v Speaker 2>psychology conference thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking this will be east or write a </v>

1569
01:10:53.571 --> 01:10:54.404
<v Speaker 2>column from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I had a question that kind of </v>

1570
01:10:55.071 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 2>matched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1571
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.823
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was in a train station and they </v>

1572
01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:01.520
<v Speaker 2>should have gotten done in a train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did two,</v>

1573
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:02.413
<v Speaker 2>two of the experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first two experiments were where </v>

1574
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:07.880
<v Speaker 2>they played videos or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it had something to do with cell</v>

1575
01:11:07.881 --> 01:11:09.740
<v Speaker 2>phones or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't quite remember.</v>

1576
01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 2>It was someone trying to borrow a cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

1577
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:16.560
<v Speaker 2>someone can we borrow your cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so and,</v>

1578
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 2>and I like these professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've referenced one of their,</v>

1579
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.550
<v Speaker 2>both of their work in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my next book,</v>

1580
01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:22.460
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Study.</v>

1581
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:23.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was social psychology study and I </v>

1582
01:11:24.931 --> 01:11:25.764
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that why don't you have a </v>

1583
01:11:26.551 --> 01:11:29.910
<v Speaker 2>control for third through third </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>

1584
01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>And so then I had to do a new question </v>
<v Speaker 2>for my second question,</v>

1585
01:11:33.121 --> 01:11:35.700
<v Speaker 2>my column and I was all annoyed too so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remembered it.</v>

1586
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and then headlines from articles</v>

1587
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.253
<v Speaker 2>that are written about science by people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might not even necessarily be </v>

1588
01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:48.570
<v Speaker 2>scientists or really truly understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the science.</v>

1589
01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:49.404
<v Speaker 2>They just want to get an article out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that people are going to pay </v>

1590
01:11:50.971 --> 01:11:52.080
<v Speaker 2>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm,</v>

1591
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.033
<v Speaker 2>I'm sensitive to credentialism is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a phd and I started out </v>

1592
01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:58.050
<v Speaker 2>giving free advice in a street corner </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Soho is a joke.</v>

1593
01:11:58.051 --> 01:11:59.160
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've.</v>

1594
01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Since then I started out giving advice </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a street corner,</v>

1595
01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.000
<v Speaker 2>a little wacky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broad.</v>

1596
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:04.103
<v Speaker 2>So what we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we just had these two friends and </v>

1597
01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.393
<v Speaker 2>we just thought it would be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we set up on the corner of West </v>

1598
01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Broadway and broom with a card table and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some folding chairs that advice,</v>

1599
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:16.050
<v Speaker 2>it said free advice from a panel of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experts.</v>

1600
01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:18.990
<v Speaker 2>We've called the advice ladies and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>love and dating and you know,</v>

1601
01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:20.250
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what year did you do?</v>

1602
01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:22.080
<v Speaker 2>This?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was in the late eighties.</v>

1603
01:12:22.081 --> 01:12:25.230
<v Speaker 2>And then in the nineties he just decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this on a whim.</v>

1604
01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we thought we'd just do it once.</v>

1605
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:30.590
<v Speaker 2>I act like I'm drunk at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So No,</v>

1606
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.433
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a weird person and we did this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we just thought we'd sit there and </v>

1607
01:12:33.961 --> 01:12:36.750
<v Speaker 2>people walk past and laugh because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always liked making people laugh.</v>

1608
01:12:36.751 --> 01:12:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I once went out in an evening dress and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a goatee and a mustache.</v>

1609
01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:42.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm just to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I frightened to child.</v>

1610
01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1611
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.590
<v Speaker 2>we did this and people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was New York,</v>

1612
01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:47.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

1613
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.700
<v Speaker 2>They lined up around the block and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't just ask us like about like their</v>

1614
01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:51.990
<v Speaker 2>eyelashes or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1615
01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 2>can I get directions to grand street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grand Street?</v>

1616
01:12:54.781 --> 01:12:56.790
<v Speaker 2>They were asking a serious question and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1617
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better know something.</v>

1618
01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.453
<v Speaker 2>And so I read through all of psychology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you're not reading psychology </v>

1619
01:13:02.431 --> 01:13:03.770
<v Speaker 2>in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think like,</v>

1620
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.970
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud just made shit up.</v>

1621
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.490
<v Speaker 2>It was really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I discovered this guy,</v>

1622
01:13:08.491 --> 01:13:09.324
<v Speaker 2>Albert Ellis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the father at the same time as </v>

1623
01:13:11.071 --> 01:13:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Erin back of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1624
01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.493
<v Speaker 2>cognitive behavioral therapy basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then started reading more and more </v>

1625
01:13:16.951 --> 01:13:17.784
<v Speaker 2>and immersing myself more and more in </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and going to scientific </v>

1626
01:13:20.221 --> 01:13:23.640
<v Speaker 2>conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then because this thing where I look</v>

1627
01:13:23.641 --> 01:13:25.590
<v Speaker 2>for people to criticize me so I can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1628
01:13:25.591 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean not the people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1629
01:13:26.821 --> 01:13:28.530
<v Speaker 2>horror on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1630
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 2>I would ask professors like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did I get this wrong?</v>

1631
01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:31.734
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes they'd say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I learned more and more and got </v>

1632
01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:36.990
<v Speaker 2>better and better and incorporated more </v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

1633
01:13:36.991 --> 01:13:39.870
<v Speaker 2>So now what I do is sort of a synthesis </v>
<v Speaker 2>from across science.</v>

1634
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I read a cognitive neuroscience textbook</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I use evolutionary psychology.</v>

1635
01:13:44.221 --> 01:13:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I used that as sort of an underpinning </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory to everything.</v>

1636
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:49.380
<v Speaker 2>So I look at social science research and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1637
01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.410
<v Speaker 2>how would this have made sense in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestral environment?</v>

1638
01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Because if it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's no sense to it,</v>

1639
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:55.583
<v Speaker 2>then there's something empty and wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what they're finding or what </v>

1640
01:13:58.621 --> 01:14:03.390
<v Speaker 2>they're concluding now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you started out doing this,</v>

1641
01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:04.224
<v Speaker 2>you set up this card table and free </v>
<v Speaker 2>advice and then how did it progress to </v>

1642
01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:10.530
<v Speaker 2>you having this column?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1643
01:14:10.531 --> 01:14:11.364
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're doing this and just because it </v>

1644
01:14:12.731 --> 01:14:15.670
<v Speaker 2>was so fun and we got so much out of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I learned this,</v>

1645
01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:16.504
<v Speaker 2>that basically if you help people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do kindness to other people for </v>

1646
01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:21.580
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel really good.</v>

1647
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:25.000
<v Speaker 2>So there's self interest in being kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially to strangers.</v>

1648
01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:27.010
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what we were doing.</v>

1649
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.300
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1650
01:14:28.301 --> 01:14:30.760
<v Speaker 2>we did this for a few years and sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>walked by,</v>

1651
01:14:30.761 --> 01:14:32.680
<v Speaker 2>he wrote for The New York Times style </v>
<v Speaker 2>section.</v>

1652
01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:34.250
<v Speaker 2>He belittled teeny piece on us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1653
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.160
<v Speaker 2>and then it got old cut down Eric </v>
<v Speaker 2>Messenger.</v>

1654
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.310
<v Speaker 2>And then because I'm a governmental Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like five things well,</v>

1655
01:14:39.311 --> 01:14:41.170
<v Speaker 2>and one of them selling things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>

1656
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:42.700
<v Speaker 2>That means like you're in the garment </v>
<v Speaker 2>district,</v>

1657
01:14:42.701 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 2>you're like hocking clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can like get dressed.</v>

1658
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Notice I don't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1659
01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I get dressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>

1660
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:50.360
<v Speaker 2>not cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1661
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:51.213
<v Speaker 2>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1662
01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of them.</v>

1663
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.080
<v Speaker 2>And then selling things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I got us a TV deal with Deniro,</v>

1664
01:14:56.081 --> 01:14:58.600
<v Speaker 2>my partners and me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got us a column,</v>

1665
01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 2>the Daily News and a book agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of my partners ended up dying.</v>

1666
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:03.080
<v Speaker 2>It's very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1667
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:05.760
<v Speaker 2>and so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1668
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I ended up doing the column myself at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>

1669
01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.713
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just syndicated my own column </v>

1670
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:14.740
<v Speaker 2>because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1671
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing this for one paper,</v>

1672
01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.490
<v Speaker 2>don't make very much money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I make more money?</v>

1673
01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:19.323
<v Speaker 2>And I was an entrepreneur and so I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in a whole bunch of papers even </v>

1674
01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:23.800
<v Speaker 2>though all the syndicators who do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1675
01:15:23.801 --> 01:15:25.170
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anyone asks,</v>

1676
01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:27.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not possible anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Papers are all going out of business.</v>

1677
01:15:27.641 --> 01:15:29.340
<v Speaker 2>But true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>previous,</v>

1678
01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.370
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be there,</v>

1679
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:32.290
<v Speaker 2>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really struggling.</v>

1680
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 2>But back then I went to syndicators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

1681
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:35.884
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think you write a really great </v>

1682
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:37.450
<v Speaker 2>column,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Ann Landers,</v>

1683
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:38.800
<v Speaker 2>dear abby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all the real estate,</v>

1684
01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:39.634
<v Speaker 2>you'll never make any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I went to an alternative weekly </v>

1685
01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:44.980
<v Speaker 2>newspaper conference in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like the Hooker hotel because I</v>

1686
01:15:44.981 --> 01:15:47.290
<v Speaker 2>couldn't afford the real hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just went around saying like,</v>

1687
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:49.720
<v Speaker 2>here are my little samples here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my little samples.</v>

1688
01:15:49.721 --> 01:15:51.640
<v Speaker 2>And so paper started picking up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>column.</v>

1689
01:15:51.641 --> 01:15:55.360
<v Speaker 2>So I built a business out of doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this out of free advice.</v>

1690
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:59.350
<v Speaker 2>And then over the years became </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly science based,</v>

1691
01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to learn statistics.</v>

1692
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I have a book I weep reading under my </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk,</v>

1693
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:06.340
<v Speaker 2>biosis biostatistics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bare essentials.</v>

1694
01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:07.174
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of stats websites and try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to improve in that area in terms of </v>

1695
01:16:12.341 --> 01:16:16.540
<v Speaker 2>scientific thinking and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and understanding statistics.</v>

1696
01:16:16.541 --> 01:16:20.770
<v Speaker 2>So I can be better at assessing studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People gravitate towards advice.</v>

1697
01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:21.693
<v Speaker 2>They really do the advice columns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>advice like call in advice shows like </v>

1698
01:16:25.961 --> 01:16:27.550
<v Speaker 2>people love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Dr Laura,</v>

1699
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.780
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People call on,</v>

1700
01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:31.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should I do,</v>

1701
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:33.160
<v Speaker 2>what should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1702
01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:34.760
<v Speaker 2>the thing that I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1703
01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like I don't have a right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just give you my opinion.</v>

1704
01:16:37.571 --> 01:16:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before it was a science base was very</v>

1705
01:16:40.631 --> 01:16:41.464
<v Speaker 2>reasoned based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always loved critical thinking and </v>

1706
01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:46.100
<v Speaker 2>reasoning and logic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now you know,</v>

1707
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at somebodies question and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll sometimes think I know the answer,</v>

1708
01:16:49.211 --> 01:16:50.770
<v Speaker 2>but I'll always read to see.</v>

1709
01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this.</v>

1710
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.033
<v Speaker 2>I'll read a bunch of papers and I look </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what's called the most parsimonious </v>

1711
01:16:56.231 --> 01:16:58.900
<v Speaker 2>answer because there can be a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers to something,</v>

1712
01:16:58.901 --> 01:16:59.734
<v Speaker 2>but it's like what is the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>most closely narrowly answers this </v>

1713
01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:06.250
<v Speaker 2>person's question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also there's this thing,</v>

1714
01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:07.084
<v Speaker 2>I see advice columns all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tell someone to do something that </v>

1715
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.093
<v Speaker 2>nobody would ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I always have like this sort of </v>

1716
01:17:11.901 --> 01:17:13.700
<v Speaker 2>bullshit check on there of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

1717
01:17:13.701 --> 01:17:15.980
<v Speaker 2>it's anybody ever going to do this kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff?</v>

1718
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Well it's like write stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write stuff down.</v>

1719
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might do it.</v>

1720
01:17:19.941 --> 01:17:22.190
<v Speaker 2>And when people read those books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self help books,</v>

1721
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:23.024
<v Speaker 2>it says located okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right this worksheet and do all this </v>

1722
01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:26.870
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done that my whole life.</v>

1723
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:28.570
<v Speaker 2>And so write things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1724
01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have like a list of things to do?</v>

1725
01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I know I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have stuff written.</v>

1726
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.033
<v Speaker 2>My house is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fire hazard with a bed in an </v>

1727
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>oven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a walk in paper pile.</v>

1728
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.020
<v Speaker 2>So now I write everything down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually I type everything out.</v>

1729
01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a blowhard and in print.</v>

1730
01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is that in books,</v>

1731
01:17:47.481 --> 01:17:49.250
<v Speaker 2>when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill out this worksheet,</v>

1732
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I like reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to stop and do this thing.</v>

1733
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:55.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I've never done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in this next book that I wrote,</v>

1734
01:17:55.101 --> 01:17:57.610
<v Speaker 2>I have two ways to do some delays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1735
01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.453
<v Speaker 2>Amy Elk on way or the way that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually more efficient and will do </v>

1736
01:18:01.161 --> 01:18:01.994
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way I changed because I was </v>

1737
01:18:03.001 --> 01:18:06.440
<v Speaker 2>this loser with no confidence and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed myself.</v>

1738
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:08.750
<v Speaker 2>And actually it's based in good science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I did,</v>

1739
01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that I was just desperate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and miserable.</v>

1740
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:12.290
<v Speaker 2>But I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1741
01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:15.440
<v Speaker 2>if you make a list of these problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have,</v>

1742
01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.480
<v Speaker 2>the things you're afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will help you,</v>

1743
01:18:17.481 --> 01:18:19.100
<v Speaker 2>then you can tackle them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is smarter,</v>

1744
01:18:19.101 --> 01:18:20.450
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>

1745
01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to where I needed to go,</v>

1746
01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:26.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's just dumb to do it my way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can just do a little writing</v>

1747
01:18:26.361 --> 01:18:30.380
<v Speaker 2>work and get to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tackle this stuff you need to tackle,</v>

1748
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:35.040
<v Speaker 5>give advice that you don't really take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like saying like take,</v>

1749
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:35.933
<v Speaker 5>write down all the different things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have issue with and then you can </v>

1750
01:18:38.701 --> 01:18:40.110
<v Speaker 5>tackle those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't really do that</v>

1751
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.120
<v Speaker 2>well because I didn't do it based in </v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

1752
01:18:42.121 --> 01:18:42.954
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is that I recognize that</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people will be too lazy to write </v>

1753
01:18:46.051 --> 01:18:49.770
<v Speaker 2>stuff down or they just don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I did is I said,</v>

1754
01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:52.190
<v Speaker 2>here are the consequences if you do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>my way,</v>

1755
01:18:52.191 --> 01:18:54.360
<v Speaker 2>like it's going to be slower and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1756
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:58.230
<v Speaker 2>you might not be as successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this way it seems worthwhile.</v>

1757
01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Like if I could do this over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

1758
01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:02.370
<v Speaker 2>if I had a time machine and go back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

1759
01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable losers person,</v>

1760
01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:09.360
<v Speaker 2>here's what you do and write this down </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then it's going to take you this</v>

1761
01:19:09.361 --> 01:19:11.520
<v Speaker 2>many years instead of like that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1762
01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:12.683
<v Speaker 2>I would do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I tried to do is persuade </v>

1763
01:19:14.491 --> 01:19:17.040
<v Speaker 2>people to be smarter than I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

1764
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1765
01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:18.573
<v Speaker 2>you're</v>

1766
01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.460
<v Speaker 5>giving advice based on your personal </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

1767
01:19:21.461 --> 01:19:22.420
<v Speaker 5>Like this would have been a better way </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

1768
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a better way.</v>

1769
01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:28.380
<v Speaker 2>And I see that based on the science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I realized that some people won't do</v>

1770
01:19:28.381 --> 01:19:30.180
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can choose.</v>

1771
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:32.010
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like with the Diet,</v>

1772
01:19:32.011 --> 01:19:33.540
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat that cupcake,</v>

1773
01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:35.550
<v Speaker 2>you're going to enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the trade off.</v>

1774
01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:36.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>writing things down.</v>

1775
01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:37.694
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that's important about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is it cements those things in your </v>

1776
01:19:40.671 --> 01:19:44.810
<v Speaker 5>memory and it puts them in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in my opinion,</v>

1777
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:49.020
<v Speaker 5>physically writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why but like for notes like</v>

1778
01:19:49.021 --> 01:19:49.854
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have notes on my phone that I keep </v>

1779
01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:53.690
<v Speaker 5>from like comedy sets of like things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I need to do,</v>

1780
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.290
<v Speaker 5>but they're not as effective as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>notebook.</v>

1781
01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.650
<v Speaker 5>I keep a notebook as well and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>notebook is not where I write in.</v>

1782
01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:01.513
<v Speaker 5>I ride on a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my notebook is where I write things </v>

1783
01:20:04.671 --> 01:20:05.504
<v Speaker 5>down that I need to remember like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the subject of bits and the important </v>

1784
01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:12.660
<v Speaker 5>points in bits and maybe even if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>new bit,</v>

1785
01:20:12.661 --> 01:20:16.920
<v Speaker 5>I'll go over the important punchlines </v>
<v Speaker 5>and where they fit in and I'll write all</v>

1786
01:20:16.921 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 5>this stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that way,</v>

1787
01:20:18.301 --> 01:20:21.630
<v Speaker 5>like for some reason when you physically</v>
<v Speaker 5>write things down,</v>

1788
01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:22.493
<v Speaker 5>they get cemented in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The act of putting pen to paper and </v>

1789
01:20:26.641 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 5>moving your hand around</v>

1790
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.950
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1791
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:30.970
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the subject of my next book.</v>

1792
01:20:30.971 --> 01:20:31.804
<v Speaker 2>It's embodied cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that we don't just think with our </v>

1793
01:20:34.421 --> 01:20:37.930
<v Speaker 2>mind that our body is intimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved and so.</v>

1794
01:20:37.931 --> 01:20:42.220
<v Speaker 2>And there is research that finds you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually going to remember stuff more if</v>

1795
01:20:42.221 --> 01:20:43.054
<v Speaker 2>you write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they say in class you should </v>

1796
01:20:44.501 --> 01:20:47.380
<v Speaker 2>take notes in pen and ink rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>typing.</v>

1797
01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:48.910
<v Speaker 2>And so the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1798
01:20:48.911 --> 01:20:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I've lived all over my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that self help book genre that</v>

1799
01:20:52.841 --> 01:20:55.210
<v Speaker 2>I never wrote anything in where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said to write stuff,</v>

1800
01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:59.590
<v Speaker 2>but I think that that's very important </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also for memorization,</v>

1801
01:20:59.930 --> 01:21:00.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1802
01:21:00.821 --> 01:21:01.654
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an important thing that to write </v>

1803
01:21:02.681 --> 01:21:03.514
<v Speaker 2>stuff when I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a Ted talk and I had to memorize </v>

1804
01:21:05.981 --> 01:21:10.000
<v Speaker 2>stuff for it and I can see where I wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff on the pages.</v>

1805
01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.013
<v Speaker 2>So I had the type pages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I had stuff where I scratched </v>

1806
01:21:12.761 --> 01:21:15.700
<v Speaker 2>and notes and I can picture that still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even now,</v>

1807
01:21:15.701 --> 01:21:17.170
<v Speaker 2>even though I don't have the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory,</v>

1808
01:21:17.171 --> 01:21:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the places that I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>notes in this colored ink,</v>

1809
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:26.110
<v Speaker 2>there's something very memorable about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that where it isn't with the type page.</v>

1810
01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:29.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it is,</v>

1811
01:21:29.111 --> 01:21:30.490
<v Speaker 5>but it definitely works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1812
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the physical is very important.</v>

1813
01:21:32.361 --> 01:21:34.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at people who are,</v>

1814
01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:37.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel bad about themselves,</v>

1815
01:21:37.491 --> 01:21:39.800
<v Speaker 2>they sort of hunched down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1816
01:21:39.801 --> 01:21:40.634
<v Speaker 2>There's a different way of standing if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel good about yourself and good </v>

1817
01:21:43.581 --> 01:21:46.730
<v Speaker 2>about where you're going and walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>going forward.</v>

1818
01:21:46.731 --> 01:21:48.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of these things are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1819
01:21:48.261 --> 01:21:49.094
<v Speaker 2>If you are depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really can help to take a walk and </v>

1820
01:21:50.991 --> 01:21:53.360
<v Speaker 2>this is this kind of thing where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to force yourself.</v>

1821
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:55.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like when I forced myself to get on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bike,</v>

1822
01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:57.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do anything but that,</v>

1823
01:21:57.591 --> 01:22:00.890
<v Speaker 2>but I know that I just have to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'll feel so much better.</v>

1824
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Not just then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the next day it seems to,</v>

1825
01:22:03.891 --> 01:22:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I see an effect on mood the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1826
01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:11.360
<v Speaker 2>with this thing in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got very just in a dark place that did</v>

1827
01:22:11.361 --> 01:22:15.380
<v Speaker 2>that day that happened and I just made </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself get on the bike and it's the time</v>

1828
01:22:15.381 --> 01:22:16.214
<v Speaker 2>I've felt least like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean like how dumb because all </v>

1829
01:22:17.931 --> 01:22:19.550
<v Speaker 2>these people are going through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible stuff.</v>

1830
01:22:19.551 --> 01:22:20.001
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1831
01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get on a bicycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

1832
01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.770
<v Speaker 2>But it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your own little world.</v>

1833
01:22:24.771 --> 01:22:26.960
<v Speaker 2>That's where you inhabit and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of it.</v>

1834
01:22:26.961 --> 01:22:31.961
<v Speaker 2>And that was what I did to just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to go into a depression.</v>

1835
01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:34.780
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also a habit that's a good habit to</v>

1836
01:22:34.781 --> 01:22:39.781
<v Speaker 5>form the habit of getting too off your </v>
<v Speaker 5>ass and putting action,</v>

1837
01:22:40.730 --> 01:22:41.563
<v Speaker 5>doing something right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes it's hard for people that </v>

1838
01:22:43.631 --> 01:22:45.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can call it procrastinating.</v>

1839
01:22:45.011 --> 01:22:46.840
<v Speaker 5>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do or to think about not</v>

1840
01:22:46.841 --> 01:22:47.674
<v Speaker 5>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to get in the habit of just </v>

1841
01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:49.864
<v Speaker 5>doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting the habit of getting up and </v>

1842
01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:52.990
<v Speaker 5>doing where there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no option.</v>

1843
01:22:52.991 --> 01:22:55.570
<v Speaker 5>You don't have the option to not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Force yourself to do it.</v>

1844
01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:56.404
<v Speaker 5>And if you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will appreciate your free time so </v>

1845
01:22:59.201 --> 01:23:01.890
<v Speaker 5>much more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you people think that like,</v>

1846
01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:05.170
<v Speaker 5>well I just like being lazy and I like </v>
<v Speaker 5>relaxing,</v>

1847
01:23:05.490 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 5>sitting around</v>

1848
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:07.150
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You May,</v>

1849
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:08.103
<v Speaker 3>I believe you may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you won't like it as much as you </v>

1850
01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:13.030
<v Speaker 3>would like it if you've accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 3>your goals first.</v>

1851
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:13.893
<v Speaker 3>See are so great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because then you feel good about </v>

1852
01:23:15.071 --> 01:23:16.310
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've done something,</v>

1853
01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:18.630
<v Speaker 3>you feel good sitting on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like sitting on the couch.</v>

1854
01:23:18.631 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I'm watching TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's because I work so much,</v>

1855
01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:25.150
<v Speaker 3>I get shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I put my feet up I can like,</v>

1856
01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:26.680
<v Speaker 3>feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fucking off.</v>

1857
01:23:26.681 --> 01:23:29.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm enjoying leisure time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also important.</v>

1858
01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.023
<v Speaker 3>There's this classic social science </v>
<v Speaker 3>research by this Guy Carl Wyke who </v>

1859
01:23:33.431 --> 01:23:34.264
<v Speaker 3>talked about small wins and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really important and they talk about </v>

1860
01:23:37.241 --> 01:23:40.010
<v Speaker 3>that in a make your bed in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1861
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 3>and the thing you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>with feelings,</v>

1862
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:45.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big advocate of not letting your </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings be the boss of you.</v>

1863
01:23:45.431 --> 01:23:46.270
<v Speaker 3>That's how I say it.</v>

1864
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so for example,</v>

1865
01:23:48.161 --> 01:23:51.280
<v Speaker 3>I write to a timer because when I sit </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to write,</v>

1866
01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:54.610
<v Speaker 3>so my stuff is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I always think like I'm not funny,</v>

1867
01:23:54.611 --> 01:23:56.340
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the science,</v>

1868
01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:57.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1869
01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:58.324
<v Speaker 3>those are those immediate feelings </v>
<v Speaker 3>buzzing around like little flies and my </v>

1870
01:24:00.641 --> 01:24:03.460
<v Speaker 3>head and it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of that matters because the time,</v>

1871
01:24:03.461 --> 01:24:04.294
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put on 52 minutes on 17 minutes break </v>

1872
01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.120
<v Speaker 3>and that's all that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many times do you read a day?</v>

1873
01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1874
01:24:11.231 --> 01:24:14.500
<v Speaker 3>it depends on the day because sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 17 minutes for break.</v>

1875
01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Well do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do.</v>

1876
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.160
<v Speaker 3>Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how'd you come to that?</v>

1877
01:24:17.161 --> 01:24:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read something,</v>

1878
01:24:18.251 --> 01:24:19.630
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even read this study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

1879
01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh that sounds good.</v>

1880
01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.530
<v Speaker 3>There's this thing called a pomodoro </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you do 20 minutes,</v>

1881
01:24:23.531 --> 01:24:25.390
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't seem like very much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1882
01:24:25.450 --> 01:24:26.283
<v Speaker 3>with the humorous stuff sometimes if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard I have to just keep shooting </v>

1883
01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:31.210
<v Speaker 3>the shit with myself and like looking up</v>
<v Speaker 3>things on the internet like oh look,</v>

1884
01:24:31.211 --> 01:24:32.140
<v Speaker 3>a polar bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1885
01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:33.373
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and come up with some kind of joke or </v>

1886
01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:36.430
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it takes a while.</v>

1887
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:39.280
<v Speaker 3>And I read this somewhere saying that 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 17,</v>

1888
01:24:39.281 --> 01:24:42.540
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't even read the paper on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't just run with that.</v>

1889
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:43.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll run with that.</v>

1890
01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 3>And so what I do often in the 17 minute </v>
<v Speaker 3>break period,</v>

1891
01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:50.490
<v Speaker 3>especially if I'm doing something really</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard is um,</v>

1892
01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.470
<v Speaker 3>I will clean my house and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could,</v>

1893
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one pays writers anymore.</v>

1894
01:24:55.031 --> 01:24:57.160
<v Speaker 3>So I'd actually like to have a team of </v>
<v Speaker 3>maids and a butler,</v>

1895
01:24:57.161 --> 01:24:58.380
<v Speaker 3>a little midget butler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1896
01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:01.420
<v Speaker 3>for Nola to save.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1897
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:02.840
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little person.</v>

1898
01:25:02.841 --> 01:25:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little person Butler.</v>

1899
01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Why a little person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about a giant?</v>

1900
01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Because I always love the wizard of Oz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they're amazing looking.</v>

1901
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.103
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's probably a terrible thing and </v>

1902
01:25:12.011 --> 01:25:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably going to be happy.</v>

1903
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:14.730
<v Speaker 3>You have people like come after me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1904
01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:16.250
<v Speaker 3>what does this champion would just pull </v>
<v Speaker 3>up?</v>

1905
01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:17.643
<v Speaker 3>Pomodoro is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only heard of it and a time </v>

1906
01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.040
<v Speaker 3>cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1907
01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:22.790
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1908
01:25:23.190 --> 01:25:25.810
<v Speaker 3>It comes out of that little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little tomato timer.</v>

1909
01:25:25.811 --> 01:25:26.644
<v Speaker 3>It's 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So each 25 minute block of work as a </v>

1910
01:25:28.571 --> 01:25:29.404
<v Speaker 3>Pomodoro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you thought it was 24 pomodoros </v>

1911
01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:32.673
<v Speaker 3>take a longer break of 20 to 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This will help your brain relax and </v>

1912
01:25:35.591 --> 01:25:36.424
<v Speaker 3>refocus before your next session.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is default mode processing that </v>

1913
01:25:39.761 --> 01:25:42.160
<v Speaker 3>goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens is you're more efficient if</v>

1914
01:25:42.161 --> 01:25:42.994
<v Speaker 3>you take breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See I'm from the family of the puritan </v>

1915
01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:46.650
<v Speaker 3>work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews of like,</v>

1916
01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:47.723
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the just the beat the horse and have it </v>

1917
01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:49.774
<v Speaker 3>worked for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's really inefficient because </v>

1918
01:25:51.491 --> 01:25:55.030
<v Speaker 3>your brain does background processing </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're doing this,</v>

1919
01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:55.893
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're washing the dishes or whatever </v>

1920
01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.113
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I find that the thing about not </v>

1921
01:25:59.741 --> 01:26:01.480
<v Speaker 3>having a maid and doing the work </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

1922
01:26:01.481 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 3>you like cleaned the base board down </v>
<v Speaker 3>here or take the little</v>

1923
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:04.813
<v Speaker 2>clorox wipe and do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have these small wins so you </v>

1924
01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:10.100
<v Speaker 2>accomplished something even though it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a little tiny thing.</v>

1925
01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:10.934
<v Speaker 2>You clean your countertop or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>with bleach that you've done something </v>

1926
01:26:13.971 --> 01:26:15.920
<v Speaker 2>and where maybe you're writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going,</v>

1927
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:18.110
<v Speaker 2>it's frustrating and you haven't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished much.</v>

1928
01:26:18.111 --> 01:26:20.240
<v Speaker 2>He didn't figure out the thing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to figure out.</v>

1929
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 2>So you have that elevated feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

1930
01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:25.670
<v Speaker 2>having done something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1931
01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:26.983
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a lot of people say they like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take breaks and walk during the </v>

1932
01:26:30.741 --> 01:26:31.574
<v Speaker 2>walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when they sort of sort out all </v>

1933
01:26:32.991 --> 01:26:33.824
<v Speaker 2>the different things they were writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and they usually bring a phone or </v>

1934
01:26:36.271 --> 01:26:37.104
<v Speaker 2>a recorder and then they talk into it if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have an idea and then go over that </v>

1935
01:26:39.651 --> 01:26:40.870
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

1936
01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:41.713
<v Speaker 2>Do you use the transcription?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a smartphone use at </v>

1937
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:46.010
<v Speaker 2>transcriptional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I that dragon thing on my phone,</v>

1938
01:26:46.011 --> 01:26:46.844
<v Speaker 2>which I really like.</v>

1939
01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:48.133
<v Speaker 2>The walking does seem helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche walk and I've read papers on </v>

1940
01:26:51.441 --> 01:26:52.274
<v Speaker 2>this that walking is helpful and so I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that also if I have something that's </v>

1941
01:26:56.721 --> 01:26:57.554
<v Speaker 2>just where I can't figure something out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do is I go to the bank and get </v>

1942
01:27:00.201 --> 01:27:01.034
<v Speaker 2>$20 out just to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't seem like a meaningless </v>

1943
01:27:03.501 --> 01:27:08.180
<v Speaker 2>trip there and then come home and go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bank to get 20 bucks really?</v>

1944
01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:09.043
<v Speaker 2>Well it's near my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like on Lincoln and I walked back </v>

1945
01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:12.440
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a short trip,</v>

1946
01:27:12.441 --> 01:27:16.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's enough of a walk that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk and a symbolic thing of getting the</v>

1947
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 2>money out if it has no meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that,</v>

1948
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:20.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I just walked to the bank,</v>

1949
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:23.720
<v Speaker 2>it would feel purposeless than then </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I wouldn't do it the next time.</v>

1950
01:27:23.721 --> 01:27:26.510
<v Speaker 2>So it feels like I know I'm a weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

1951
01:27:26.511 --> 01:27:27.344
<v Speaker 2>what can I say?</v>

1952
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do that.</v>

1953
01:27:28.641 --> 01:27:32.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's just such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of alleviate some kind of debt</v>

1954
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.823
<v Speaker 2>that pressing feeling of you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's not a solution I don't </v>

1955
01:27:36.141 --> 01:27:37.670
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're moving,</v>

1956
01:27:37.671 --> 01:27:39.350
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this thing where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving forward.</v>

1957
01:27:39.351 --> 01:27:41.270
<v Speaker 2>That's this thing about your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just,</v>

1958
01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.253
<v Speaker 2>we don't just think about solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we can actually move in ways that </v>

1959
01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:46.664
<v Speaker 2>help your brain be more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's that the walking thing that </v>

1960
01:27:51.291 --> 01:27:52.124
<v Speaker 2>seems to be one of these ways where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take some pressure off and actually </v>

1961
01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:57.404
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I put things on the wall in my </v>

1962
01:27:58.371 --> 01:28:00.440
<v Speaker 2>shower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct things,</v>

1963
01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:04.190
<v Speaker 2>and I also put up things I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand to look at them over and over</v>

1964
01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:05.024
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing too is people feel </v>

1965
01:28:07.371 --> 01:28:12.140
<v Speaker 2>bad if they are not instantly geniuses </v>
<v Speaker 2>at figuring something out.</v>

1966
01:28:12.141 --> 01:28:14.610
<v Speaker 2>And what I like to do is go over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and overthink.</v>

1967
01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.473
<v Speaker 2>So on this thing that I'm writing now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this medical care expo say that I'm </v>

1968
01:28:17.871 --> 01:28:18.704
<v Speaker 2>writing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The research is really new to me and </v>

1969
01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:21.824
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I do is I have a pile of </v>

1970
01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:25.970
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a step stool in my bathroom.</v>

1971
01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:26.853
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My boyfriend goes in there and he sort </v>

1972
01:28:28.191 --> 01:28:31.410
<v Speaker 2>of frightened by the insanity but the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pile of paper.</v>

1973
01:28:31.411 --> 01:28:35.240
<v Speaker 2>So I put them on the bottom stool and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I reread them and I put them on the</v>

1974
01:28:35.241 --> 01:28:36.080
<v Speaker 2>top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's like a.</v>

1975
01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like an escalator going back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

1976
01:28:39.021 --> 01:28:39.854
<v Speaker 2>Because when you do it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get sort of a deep understanding </v>

1977
01:28:42.291 --> 01:28:44.300
<v Speaker 2>that you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you just read it at first.</v>

1978
01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:47.750
<v Speaker 2>And I know this from writing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an understanding I can listen to</v>

1979
01:28:47.751 --> 01:28:51.260
<v Speaker 2>somebody present their work at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific conference and understand it,</v>

1980
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:52.363
<v Speaker 2>but can I explain it to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole different level of </v>

1981
01:28:54.411 --> 01:28:59.090
<v Speaker 2>understanding that's deeper </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding that that does make sense.</v>

1982
01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.060
<v Speaker 2>And when you're talking about walking to</v>

1983
01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:02.923
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think the walking has an </v>

1984
01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:06.810
<v Speaker 5>effect also because it's a mild,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very mild exercise,</v>

1985
01:29:06.811 --> 01:29:08.640
<v Speaker 5>so it's not exhausting you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not hard,</v>

1986
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:09.713
<v Speaker 5>but you are getting some good </v>
<v Speaker 5>circulation because you're forcing your </v>

1987
01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 5>body to pick your legs up and move </v>
<v Speaker 5>forward and your heart starts beating.</v>

1988
01:29:15.331 --> 01:29:16.164
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think it sort of a ignites some </v>

1989
01:29:18.451 --> 01:29:19.290
<v Speaker 5>systems.</v>

1990
01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you're probably right about</v>

1991
01:29:21.291 --> 01:29:23.600
<v Speaker 2>that and you feel just the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1992
01:29:23.601 --> 01:29:24.434
<v Speaker 2>because you're going forward so forwards</v>
<v Speaker 2>a metaphor for success and progress and </v>

1993
01:29:28.641 --> 01:29:30.380
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that all of that,</v>

1994
01:29:30.381 --> 01:29:31.214
<v Speaker 2>it sounds kind of silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I looked at all this metaphor stuff </v>

1995
01:29:33.591 --> 01:29:36.010
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it's so silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1996
01:29:36.011 --> 01:29:36.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1997
01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:37.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>success is up,</v>

1998
01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:41.540
<v Speaker 2>moving forward as progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so our bodies are connected,</v>

1999
01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:46.430
<v Speaker 2>our first language as organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the organisms,</v>

2000
01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.800
<v Speaker 2>they had two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach and avoid.</v>

2001
01:29:48.801 --> 01:29:49.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

2002
01:29:49.881 --> 01:29:52.730
<v Speaker 2>a yummy piece of plankton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll approach that,</v>

2003
01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:53.683
<v Speaker 2>or oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing's gonna eat me and I'll back </v>

2004
01:29:56.001 --> 01:29:57.530
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>

2005
01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called,</v>

2006
01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.353
<v Speaker 2>there's a term called neural reused by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sky Anderson and another guy named </v>

2007
01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:05.080
<v Speaker 2>dot Haynes said it in different way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2008
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:09.620
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that the human emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>system comes out of her scalp.</v>

2009
01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:11.630
<v Speaker 2>They use a term scaffolded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they use it right,</v>

2010
01:30:11.631 --> 01:30:16.631
<v Speaker 2>but it's comes out of the approach and </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoid mechanisms of tiny organisms.</v>

2011
01:30:17.301 --> 01:30:20.960
<v Speaker 2>So going forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's approach going backward,</v>

2012
01:30:20.961 --> 01:30:22.870
<v Speaker 2>receiving that's avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2013
01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:27.230
<v Speaker 2>and so if you look at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense that walking,</v>

2014
01:30:27.231 --> 01:30:28.064
<v Speaker 2>that going to the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to walk in a little tennis </v>

2015
01:30:30.021 --> 01:30:32.810
<v Speaker 2>shoes in my word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Asian pullman sunglasses that,</v>

2016
01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going somewhere.</v>

2017
01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.950
<v Speaker 2>I got them from my neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's Japanese at a garage sale.</v>

2018
01:30:36.970 --> 01:30:38.610
<v Speaker 2>This Asian Pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2019
01:30:39.050 --> 01:30:42.530
<v Speaker 2>they're like those wraparound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically like putting a strap,</v>

2020
01:30:42.531 --> 01:30:43.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they,</v>

2021
01:30:43.071 --> 01:30:44.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if they don't want to you,</v>

2022
01:30:44.401 --> 01:30:45.234
<v Speaker 2>I identified in a photo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put a black bar over your face </v>

2023
01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:51.770
<v Speaker 2>that's like the sunglasses version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're huge and they're plastic and</v>

2024
01:30:51.771 --> 01:30:52.581
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need a car.</v>

2025
01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got them at her,</v>

2026
01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:54.620
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2027
01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also because.</v>

2028
01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.320
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

2029
01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm related to white out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2030
01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:00.333
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just hoping to not age like an old </v>

2031
01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Hermes handbag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2032
01:31:04.161 --> 01:31:04.994
<v Speaker 2>by even California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you spray like a sunscreen all over </v>

2033
01:31:07.491 --> 01:31:08.800
<v Speaker 2>your face when you do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2034
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I use FDA banned sunblock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2035
01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2036
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:16.500
<v Speaker 2>because I know the FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wrong to bend this.</v>

2037
01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:19.310
<v Speaker 2>They don't allow the most protective </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunblock,</v>

2038
01:31:19.311 --> 01:31:21.890
<v Speaker 2>which is with [inaudible] that they sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>in France,</v>

2039
01:31:21.891 --> 01:31:24.650
<v Speaker 2>that no French people have not been </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping dead in the streets.</v>

2040
01:31:24.651 --> 01:31:25.484
<v Speaker 2>They haven't been dying of cancer from </v>
<v Speaker 2>using sunblock with his very protective </v>

2041
01:31:27.951 --> 01:31:28.784
<v Speaker 2>ingredient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The FDA allows the sunblock now to be </v>

2042
01:31:31.371 --> 01:31:32.510
<v Speaker 2>sold here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called anthea.</v>

2043
01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.433
<v Speaker 2>Anthea Leo's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like with the whatever Musinex </v>

2044
01:31:35.931 --> 01:31:38.540
<v Speaker 2>I used to take that they know have </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the counter and they sell the one</v>

2045
01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:40.190
<v Speaker 2>up in the aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work.</v>

2046
01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:41.543
<v Speaker 2>They removed the active ingredient and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they sell the lesser ingredient in </v>

2047
01:31:44.571 --> 01:31:45.404
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to get the Antonios that </v>

2048
01:31:46.821 --> 01:31:48.290
<v Speaker 2>actually works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to go to France.</v>

2049
01:31:48.291 --> 01:31:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I buy a case when I'm there are other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people bring back a dress?</v>

2050
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:51.703
<v Speaker 2>I bring back $350 worth of sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even order it online and have </v>

2051
01:31:54.951 --> 01:31:55.160
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2052
01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:55.993
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is a great thing about the </v>

2053
01:31:56.931 --> 01:31:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Internet nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You spell it.</v>

2054
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Anthea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a n,</v>

2055
01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:00.460
<v Speaker 2>t h</v>

2056
01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.780
<v Speaker 3>e l I o s and there's a little French </v>
<v Speaker 3>accent.</v>

2057
01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Accent.</v>

2058
01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.820
<v Speaker 3>A goose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing I wanted to say if</v>

2059
01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:09.240
<v Speaker 3>you were French and Taleah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Antonio's.</v>

2060
01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:10.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2061
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:14.320
<v Speaker 3>So this stuff is just way stronger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything you get here in America.</v>

2062
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this oral.</v>

2063
01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:18.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the ingredient that protects you </v>
<v Speaker 3>from UVA and UVB.</v>

2064
01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:20.530
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really the,</v>

2065
01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.140
<v Speaker 3>the most protective ingredient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can also get it in Canada.</v>

2066
01:32:23.141 --> 01:32:24.510
<v Speaker 3>I got someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Vancouver,</v>

2067
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:26.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2068
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I get it in France because I can get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheaper there so I buy a whole case like</v>

2069
01:32:30.581 --> 01:32:31.414
<v Speaker 3>I caught you go to a bad neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 3>and buy it there and some like Yucky </v>

2070
01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.220
<v Speaker 3>pharmacy there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're taking this stuff,</v>

2071
01:32:36.221 --> 01:32:38.950
<v Speaker 3>like what is the difference between that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so like coppertone or something that</v>

2072
01:32:38.951 --> 01:32:39.820
<v Speaker 3>you would get in America?</v>

2073
01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Well that doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it doesn't protect.</v>

2074
01:32:41.861 --> 01:32:42.694
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember whether it's Uva or uvb</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it doesn't protect against fully </v>

2075
01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:48.400
<v Speaker 3>the kind with the titanium dioxide </v>
<v Speaker 3>protects.</v>

2076
01:32:48.401 --> 01:32:50.770
<v Speaker 3>But also the other problem with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>sunblocks has set,</v>

2077
01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:51.963
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they affect your endocrine system in </v>

2078
01:32:53.421 --> 01:32:55.720
<v Speaker 3>terrible ways?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2079
01:32:55.721 --> 01:32:57.790
<v Speaker 3>but I'm so vain that I just don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>

2080
01:32:57.870 --> 01:33:00.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like look like a sheep dog by the factor</v>

2081
01:33:00.731 --> 01:33:01.564
<v Speaker 3>into consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well because you're putting these </v>

2082
01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:05.860
<v Speaker 3>chemicals on your skin and stuff goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>into your skin.</v>

2083
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.200
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't gone outside and a long time.</v>

2084
01:33:08.201 --> 01:33:13.201
<v Speaker 3>So that sort of the effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a huge hat like that,</v>

2085
01:33:14.231 --> 01:33:15.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a witch,</v>

2086
01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:19.150
<v Speaker 3>a black hat and that helps to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

2087
01:33:19.151 --> 01:33:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Amy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>

2088
01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:23.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my better qualities I guess,</v>

2089
01:33:23.381 --> 01:33:25.400
<v Speaker 3>or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2090
01:33:25.450 --> 01:33:27.880
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is an interesting point about,</v>

2091
01:33:27.881 --> 01:33:28.714
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>affecting your endocrine system that I </v>

2092
01:33:29.561 --> 01:33:30.880
<v Speaker 3>never really took into consideration.</v>

2093
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about sunscreen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2094
01:33:32.931 --> 01:33:33.764
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was reading this thing about </v>

2095
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:35.383
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great barrier reef being destroyed </v>

2096
01:33:37.091 --> 01:33:41.620
<v Speaker 3>by sunscreen and a spray sunscreen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular over someone.</v>

2097
01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.513
<v Speaker 3>Someone sent me this message and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know if it's correct that the spray </v>

2098
01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:51.180
<v Speaker 3>sunscreen is the issue with reese and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not the put the rub on stuff.</v>

2099
01:33:51.290 --> 01:33:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to be a feminist.</v>

2100
01:33:53.730 --> 01:33:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2101
01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:58.140
<v Speaker 3>see if you could find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did see something.</v>

2102
01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:02.920
<v Speaker 3>I remember looking at stuff recently and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't true,</v>

2103
01:34:02.921 --> 01:34:06.190
<v Speaker 3>but I'm looking up again for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>

2104
01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:11.220
<v Speaker 3>there's something in the Aerosol version</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is more dangerous for reefs,</v>

2105
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.470
<v Speaker 3>but it Kinda makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2106
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:14.313
<v Speaker 3>you're putting this fucking skanky </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical on you and then you're jumping </v>

2107
01:34:17.141 --> 01:34:17.861
<v Speaker 3>in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2108
01:34:17.861 --> 01:34:18.790
<v Speaker 3>where's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:34:18.791 --> 01:34:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Well it seems though that both kinds </v>
<v Speaker 3>would work that way,</v>

2110
01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:26.170
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it's because the lotion kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably absorbed more into your skin.</v>

2111
01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Hair goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2112
01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:30.290
<v Speaker 3>your sunscreen isn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the world's coral reefs.</v>

2113
01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Varying studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've found those so that I don't know if</v>

2114
01:34:32.921 --> 01:34:33.754
<v Speaker 3>this one is even accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I found two other ones that said it </v>

2115
01:34:35.471 --> 01:34:40.471
<v Speaker 3>is burying studies produced by the sons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that is it.</v>

2116
01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Click Bait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

2117
01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Scroll up and let's see what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get a little larger there.</v>

2118
01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.013
<v Speaker 3>Thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swimming that swimmers that slather </v>

2119
01:34:49.421 --> 01:34:51.790
<v Speaker 3>themselves and sunscreen or doing their </v>
<v Speaker 3>skin a favor,</v>

2120
01:34:51.791 --> 01:34:52.624
<v Speaker 3>but it might not be so helpful to any </v>
<v Speaker 3>nearby coral reefs that claim released </v>

2121
01:34:55.631 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 3>in a recent scientific study sparked </v>
<v Speaker 3>global headlines,</v>

2122
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.083
<v Speaker 1>faulting sunscreen for the global </v>
<v Speaker 1>decline of these hot beds of </v>

2123
01:35:01.641 --> 01:35:02.474
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's disturbing idea that something so </v>

2124
01:35:04.341 --> 01:35:05.174
<v Speaker 1>necessary for protecting humans from </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin cancer could be doing so much </v>

2125
01:35:08.151 --> 01:35:10.550
<v Speaker 1>environmental damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what weight should we give?</v>

2126
01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:12.920
<v Speaker 1>The scientific finding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not much.</v>

2127
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:13.783
<v Speaker 1>Turns out the authors of the report who </v>
<v Speaker 1>hail from labs and universities in the </v>

2128
01:35:17.361 --> 01:35:20.480
<v Speaker 1>US and Israel found that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you say that?</v>

2129
01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Oxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benzos,</v>

2130
01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:22.873
<v Speaker 1>Benzos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an active ingredient in some sunscreens </v>

2131
01:35:25.221 --> 01:35:26.054
<v Speaker 1>that protects against ultraviolet light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is present in significant quantities </v>

2132
01:35:29.241 --> 01:35:30.074
<v Speaker 1>around recent Hawaii and the Virgin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islands that were favored by swimmers </v>

2133
01:35:32.511 --> 01:35:33.344
<v Speaker 1>and divers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They determined that the chemical has a </v>

2134
01:35:36.321 --> 01:35:41.321
<v Speaker 1>detrimental effect on the DNA of coral </v>
<v Speaker 1>in both its juvenile and adult stages.</v>

2135
01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:46.100
<v Speaker 1>The study was published in the Journal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Archives and environmental contamination</v>

2136
01:35:46.101 --> 01:35:48.260
<v Speaker 1>and toxicology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lab,</v>

2137
01:35:48.261 --> 01:35:49.094
<v Speaker 1>the researchers exposed core in the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The research is exploring exposed coral </v>

2138
01:35:52.551 --> 01:35:53.384
<v Speaker 1>to high concentrations of oxybenzone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only did it deform coral larvae by </v>

2139
01:35:58.281 --> 01:35:59.114
<v Speaker 1>trapping them in their own skeleton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The study found that it was also a </v>

2140
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:04.100
<v Speaker 1>factor in coral bleaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terry Hughes,</v>

2141
01:36:04.101 --> 01:36:06.500
<v Speaker 1>director of the Australian Research </v>
<v Speaker 1>Council,</v>

2142
01:36:06.501 --> 01:36:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Center of Excellence Crow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He studies at James Cook University told</v>

2143
01:36:11.061 --> 01:36:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Mashable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

2144
01:36:12.381 --> 01:36:14.990
<v Speaker 1>he thought the report's findings were </v>
<v Speaker 1>inconclusive.</v>

2145
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.333
<v Speaker 1>He was paid off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His particular study was done in a </v>

2146
01:36:19.011 --> 01:36:19.844
<v Speaker 1>laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they actually used artificial </v>

2147
01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:22.694
<v Speaker 1>seawater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He explained they put tiny bits into </v>

2148
01:36:25.161 --> 01:36:28.760
<v Speaker 1>coral in aquaria and then added some </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals.</v>

2149
01:36:28.761 --> 01:36:29.594
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coral didn't like chemicals thrown </v>

2150
01:36:31.161 --> 01:36:31.994
<v Speaker 1>at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2151
01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.073
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a good point and this is </v>

2152
01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:36.590
<v Speaker 2>something when you look at studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things I look at.</v>

2153
01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:38.970
<v Speaker 2>They call it in Vivo or in vitro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2154
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:39.833
<v Speaker 2>are you looking at stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they pull out some cells and do </v>

2155
01:36:43.611 --> 01:36:47.150
<v Speaker 2>something to them and does that </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicate or not replicate what,</v>

2156
01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:49.970
<v Speaker 2>what happens in the human body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there other things,</v>

2157
01:36:49.971 --> 01:36:53.750
<v Speaker 2>other reactions going on that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing from them?</v>

2158
01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2159
01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.110
<v Speaker 2>when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you pull it out and just look at it</v>

2160
01:36:57.111 --> 01:36:59.000
<v Speaker 2>in a petri dish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2161
01:36:59.001 --> 01:37:02.540
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like in that environment it</v>

2162
01:37:02.541 --> 01:37:03.374
<v Speaker 2>showed that the coral does not like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would imagine that that's not </v>

2163
01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:08.310
<v Speaker 2>terribly surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd like to know</v>

2164
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:13.190
<v Speaker 1>what are the trace amounts that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing in coral and can they mimic those</v>

2165
01:37:13.191 --> 01:37:16.390
<v Speaker 1>and studies or are they just pouring it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on them and you know,</v>

2166
01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.380
<v Speaker 1>like salt for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2167
01:37:18.381 --> 01:37:19.670
<v Speaker 1>If you put a little bit of salt in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

2168
01:37:19.671 --> 01:37:21.260
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You eat a pound of salt,</v>

2169
01:37:21.261 --> 01:37:22.280
<v Speaker 1>your big dead an hour.</v>

2170
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing that,</v>

2171
01:37:23.961 --> 01:37:25.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at studies,</v>

2172
01:37:25.011 --> 01:37:25.844
<v Speaker 2>this is why it's important to read them </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over like that and to really </v>

2173
01:37:28.581 --> 01:37:29.414
<v Speaker 2>pick them apart if you want to assess </v>
<v Speaker 2>them any sort of reliable way because </v>

2174
01:37:32.661 --> 01:37:34.670
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at those nuances and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

2175
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:35.803
<v Speaker 2>well wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called this thing to leave the lab </v>

2176
01:37:37.371 --> 01:37:40.070
<v Speaker 2>syndrome where you look at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've studied something you think like</v>

2177
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:41.263
<v Speaker 2>that's not how it works in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you doing the experiment that </v>

2178
01:37:43.851 --> 01:37:46.340
<v Speaker 2>way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's completely dumb and so,</v>

2179
01:37:46.341 --> 01:37:48.500
<v Speaker 2>and this is stuff you don't have to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist,</v>

2180
01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:49.513
<v Speaker 2>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps to think scientifically to </v>

2181
01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:54.230
<v Speaker 2>think logically and so it's always good </v>
<v Speaker 2>to enhance that thinking so you can look</v>

2182
01:37:54.231 --> 01:37:55.560
<v Speaker 2>at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look for the bullshit.</v>

2183
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:57.143
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for a lot of people they just see </v>

2184
01:37:58.021 --> 01:37:59.640
<v Speaker 3>that headline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2185
01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:03.300
<v Speaker 3>coral reefs dying because of Sunscreen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sunscreen bad.</v>

2186
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we'd like to blame people and I felt</v>

2187
01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:07.240
<v Speaker 3>bad when you've said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I sucked.</v>

2188
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out there killing just for my skin,</v>

2189
01:38:10.611 --> 01:38:13.650
<v Speaker 3>so will look like an old hag while also </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>

2190
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:14.880
<v Speaker 3>lung cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2191
01:38:14.881 --> 01:38:16.020
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing though.</v>

2192
01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:16.973
<v Speaker 3>There's so much stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much is more complicated than we </v>

2193
01:38:18.361 --> 01:38:19.194
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I giving myself problems by not </v>

2194
01:38:21.571 --> 01:38:22.404
<v Speaker 3>getting vitamin D the natural way and by</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a pill because I take a little </v>

2195
01:38:25.411 --> 01:38:26.244
<v Speaker 3>pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's one of those tradeoffs and I </v>

2196
01:38:27.481 --> 01:38:28.380
<v Speaker 3>think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2197
01:38:28.381 --> 01:38:29.214
<v Speaker 3>I eat a ketogenic diet and then I put on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sunscreen and you look at all that </v>

2198
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:35.610
<v Speaker 3>and you try to make the best guests you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

2199
01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.430
<v Speaker 3>That works also within what matters to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you as a woman.</v>

2200
01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:39.563
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to look really haggard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when I'm 65 or you're supposed </v>

2201
01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:45.130
<v Speaker 3>to Scotland or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at your students,</v>

2202
01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.940
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be in some marsh </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere,</v>

2203
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:50.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>

2204
01:38:50.221 --> 01:38:51.054
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy like a giant sunscreen thing and so </v>

2205
01:38:55.141 --> 01:38:57.780
<v Speaker 3>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you change these things in a modern</v>

2206
01:38:57.781 --> 01:39:00.360
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call it evolutionary mismatch.</v>

2207
01:39:00.650 --> 01:39:02.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

2208
01:39:02.101 --> 01:39:07.101
<v Speaker 3>Are you screwing yourself up in some way</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you aren't getting this nutrient</v>

2209
01:39:07.591 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way your body evolved to take it in?</v>

2210
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is such a weird thing.</v>

2211
01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:18.390
<v Speaker 3>The color of people's skin is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because we changed environments,</v>

2212
01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2213
01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:20.963
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole race thing is so thrown out </v>

2214
01:39:23.041 --> 01:39:24.810
<v Speaker 3>the window when you take that into </v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>

2215
01:39:24.811 --> 01:39:27.300
<v Speaker 3>The way we look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shape of our noses,</v>

2216
01:39:27.301 --> 01:39:29.100
<v Speaker 3>the shape of our faces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shape,</v>

2217
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:30.173
<v Speaker 3>the color of our skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all determined by the environment that </v>

2218
01:39:32.671 --> 01:39:33.360
<v Speaker 3>our ancestors.</v>

2219
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of these people who are say</v>

2220
01:39:36.001 --> 01:39:36.834
<v Speaker 3>Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all grew up in this place and so </v>

2221
01:39:39.001 --> 01:39:43.860
<v Speaker 3>they are characteristic Irish features </v>
<v Speaker 3>and and it's just an accepting me.</v>

2222
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:46.620
<v Speaker 3>See what what's happened now is we can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>make jokes anymore.</v>

2223
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I skated with 20 black guys in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2224
01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:50.670
<v Speaker 3>I stopped the thing you said about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>football thing.</v>

2225
01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.691
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2226
01:39:51.691 --> 01:39:56.280
<v Speaker 3>I earn a living writing and I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do a lot else that if I cracked my</v>

2227
01:39:56.281 --> 01:39:57.114
<v Speaker 3>head open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might not be able to earn a living </v>

2228
01:39:58.471 --> 01:40:00.600
<v Speaker 3>ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these guys,</v>

2229
01:40:00.601 --> 01:40:03.690
<v Speaker 3>they called me white out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was hilarious.</v>

2230
01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:04.601
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2231
01:40:04.601 --> 01:40:07.200
<v Speaker 3>and when you are not racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not,</v>

2232
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:10.320
<v Speaker 3>it's not bad to joke about race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racial stuff,</v>

2233
01:40:10.321 --> 01:40:11.154
<v Speaker 3>but now I mean it's just really the </v>
<v Speaker 3>third rail of everything that you even </v>

2234
01:40:14.461 --> 01:40:15.294
<v Speaker 3>say the slightest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make mention that someone's </v>

2235
01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:18.030
<v Speaker 3>different color.</v>

2236
01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean forget it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also there's no negative connotation</v>

2237
01:40:20.761 --> 01:40:22.500
<v Speaker 3>to being white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2238
01:40:22.501 --> 01:40:25.080
<v Speaker 3>So when you say you're wide out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not bad.</v>

2239
01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:27.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a charcoal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Ooh,</v>

2240
01:40:27.690 --> 01:40:32.690
<v Speaker 3>that people use charcoal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charcoal doesn't seem like an insult.</v>

2241
01:40:33.241 --> 01:40:34.890
<v Speaker 3>And also black people don't seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>chocolate.</v>

2242
01:40:35.130 --> 01:40:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I thought I had a black boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had chocolate.</v>

2243
01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:42.560
<v Speaker 3>His skin was the color of Toklas </v>
<v Speaker 3>Espresso or black super black.</v>

2244
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what really dark,</v>

2245
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:47.910
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people from from Africa.</v>

2246
01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I do too with that gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're amazing.</v>

2247
01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Until they started putting plates in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their lips to draw the line.</v>

2248
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you kiss someone like that?</v>

2249
01:40:57.130 --> 01:40:59.500
<v Speaker 3>You lick the plate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is there food left on the plate?</v>

2250
01:40:59.501 --> 01:41:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what is.</v>

2251
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.670
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the weirdest spanky's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's they're called Ubank.</v>

2252
01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Jeez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the people will like that.</v>

2253
01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:06.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2254
01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:07.613
<v Speaker 1>Surrey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the part of Africa that they do </v>

2255
01:41:09.061 --> 01:41:09.894
<v Speaker 1>that I believe that seems like one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weirdest sort of habits or behavior </v>

2256
01:41:16.381 --> 01:41:19.320
<v Speaker 1>patterns that people have ever adopted </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's weird,</v>

2257
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:23.040
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirdest cultural traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just passed down from generation to</v>

2258
01:41:23.041 --> 01:41:26.190
<v Speaker 1>generation and the larger the plate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lip,</v>

2259
01:41:26.191 --> 01:41:29.090
<v Speaker 1>the more cattle they're worth when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get married.</v>

2260
01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:32.420
<v Speaker 1>God super twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2261
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:35.100
<v Speaker 1>how did that ever come about?</v>

2262
01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:38.080
<v Speaker 3>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that area down there,</v>

2263
01:41:38.081 --> 01:41:38.914
<v Speaker 3>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's some of these cultural things </v>

2264
01:41:41.141 --> 01:41:42.460
<v Speaker 3>that go on are really crazy.</v>

2265
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you see body mutilation or </v>

2266
01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.200
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2267
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read that also being connected.</v>

2268
01:41:50.591 --> 01:41:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very vague now.</v>

2269
01:41:51.611 --> 01:41:52.444
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember it being connected </v>

2270
01:41:53.711 --> 01:41:54.544
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another to the slave trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they've made these women less </v>

2271
01:41:58.451 --> 01:42:00.580
<v Speaker 1>likely to be raped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2272
01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:01.480
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>

2274
01:42:03.490 --> 01:42:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I probably shouldn't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do always hear things.</v>

2275
01:42:06.881 --> 01:42:07.714
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just repeated and let people sort it </v>

2276
01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:10.271
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google it,</v>

2277
01:42:10.271 --> 01:42:11.200
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to me.</v>

2278
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.960
<v Speaker 3>But when you were saying about white </v>
<v Speaker 3>people before it now actually,</v>

2279
01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:14.794
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see this probably all over twitter </v>

2280
01:42:15.461 --> 01:42:18.700
<v Speaker 3>to this thing of white privilege and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there this,</v>

2281
01:42:19.610 --> 01:42:22.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I react when I was like 18,</v>

2282
01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:24.500
<v Speaker 3>it was like typhoid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2283
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:27.460
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so now if you're white,</v>

2284
01:42:27.461 --> 01:42:28.840
<v Speaker 3>you're just guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2285
01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.713
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing you can do and you see </v>

2286
01:42:30.851 --> 01:42:31.570
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>

2287
01:42:31.570 --> 01:42:33.100
<v Speaker 3>there was a video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in Berkeley,</v>

2288
01:42:33.101 --> 01:42:35.620
<v Speaker 3>some social justice guy and the woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2289
01:42:35.621 --> 01:42:37.270
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's basically,</v>

2290
01:42:37.271 --> 01:42:37.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what she said.</v>

2291
01:42:37.931 --> 01:42:40.030
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're guilty.</v>

2292
01:42:40.031 --> 01:42:42.140
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could remember the word chef or</v>
<v Speaker 3>white privilege.</v>

2293
01:42:42.170 --> 01:42:42.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2294
01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>odd.</v>

2295
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:44.300
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fun.</v>

2296
01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:46.803
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

2297
01:42:48.230 --> 01:42:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

2298
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.633
<v Speaker 1>But it's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a way to silence people and it's </v>

2299
01:42:50.541 --> 01:42:52.340
<v Speaker 1>also a way for you to be guilty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2300
01:42:52.341 --> 01:42:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2301
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:54.663
<v Speaker 1>you getting to have a clean slate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are all on the defensive </v>

2302
01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:57.730
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>

2303
01:42:57.731 --> 01:43:02.150
<v Speaker 1>you are already a guilty person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can virtue signal.</v>

2304
01:43:02.151 --> 01:43:03.840
<v Speaker 1>They can decide that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2305
01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you need to be punished or you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

2306
01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Your opinion is invalidated because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Melanin content and your scan.</v>

2307
01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:11.984
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

2308
01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:13.570
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the antithesis.</v>

2309
01:43:13.571 --> 01:43:17.350
<v Speaker 3>I Love Martin Luther King and let's say </v>
<v Speaker 3>the content of your character and that's</v>

2310
01:43:17.351 --> 01:43:19.520
<v Speaker 3>so beautiful and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2311
01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:20.363
<v Speaker 3>it's so terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing of you're white and you're </v>

2312
01:43:22.271 --> 01:43:23.680
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people don't understand.</v>

2313
01:43:23.681 --> 01:43:25.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the same thing as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2314
01:43:25.890 --> 01:43:28.360
<v Speaker 3>the racism that's been done to blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2315
01:43:28.361 --> 01:43:29.620
<v Speaker 3>for so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so long.</v>

2316
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:31.600
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

2317
01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of stunned by that and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

2318
01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:35.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically you're racist is now shut up.</v>

2319
01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:36.893
<v Speaker 3>That's what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pay attention to what went on in </v>

2320
01:43:39.251 --> 01:43:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Evergreen State College in Washington </v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

2321
01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.640
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Steen.</v>

2322
01:43:42.641 --> 01:43:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's my hero.</v>

2323
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 3>And what happened was they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't know.</v>

2324
01:43:48.371 --> 01:43:50.560
<v Speaker 3>They essentially said we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a.</v>

2325
01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 3>They used to have a day of absence</v>

2326
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:55.550
<v Speaker 5>of people of color and the idea is it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>a very progressive school and they said,</v>

2327
01:43:55.551 --> 01:43:56.384
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we have a day where people of color </v>

2328
01:43:58.251 --> 01:44:00.980
<v Speaker 5>or people of varying ethnic people </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't white,</v>

2329
01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:04.910
<v Speaker 5>essentially that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't show up maybe where they will</v>

2330
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:05.803
<v Speaker 5>be appreciated more and maybe we will </v>
<v Speaker 5>take them into consideration more what </v>

2331
01:44:08.770 --> 01:44:09.603
<v Speaker 5>for their absence will be felt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so then they decided let's flip that </v>

2332
01:44:12.801 --> 01:44:15.950
<v Speaker 5>around and force white people to stay </v>
<v Speaker 5>home.</v>

2333
01:44:16.190 --> 01:44:18.620
<v Speaker 5>White staff members,</v>
<v Speaker 5>white teachers,</v>

2334
01:44:18.621 --> 01:44:21.710
<v Speaker 5>white students,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Brett was like,</v>

2335
01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:24.110
<v Speaker 5>you're out of your mind like this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>racist.</v>

2336
01:44:24.111 --> 01:44:24.944
<v Speaker 5>It's one thing that you want to call </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention to the value of people of </v>

2337
01:44:28.251 --> 01:44:29.084
<v Speaker 5>color by not being there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is also arguably not the best way </v>

2338
01:44:32.421 --> 01:44:33.254
<v Speaker 5>to handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at least you're not saying to </v>

2339
01:44:35.481 --> 01:44:39.500
<v Speaker 5>someone that they cannot be there </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the color of their skin,</v>

2340
01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.990
<v Speaker 5>which is what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By forcing these people to.</v>

2341
01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:45.380
<v Speaker 5>And then obviously all hell broke out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2342
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.290
<v Speaker 5>People were protesting him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were.</v>

2343
01:44:47.291 --> 01:44:49.400
<v Speaker 5>They were looking for him with baseball </v>
<v Speaker 5>bats.</v>

2344
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.790
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's this escalation,</v>

2345
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:57.910
<v Speaker 5>this war of ideas where you're forcing </v>
<v Speaker 5>your ideas and your shouting people down</v>

2346
01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:02.210
<v Speaker 5>and calling people guilty before they've</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever done anything,</v>

2347
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:04.100
<v Speaker 5>which is essentially what this is all </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

2348
01:45:04.101 --> 01:45:04.934
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now he's not at school anymore and then </v>

2349
01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.380
<v Speaker 5>school is imploding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2350
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:10.220
<v Speaker 5>it's really crazy</v>

2351
01:45:10.450 --> 01:45:12.070
<v Speaker 2>and actually I would argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2352
01:45:12.210 --> 01:45:14.980
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people who are of color too,</v>

2353
01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:20.040
<v Speaker 2>to make a protest by not going to school</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a day after people fought so hard.</v>

2354
01:45:20.291 --> 01:45:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That little girl,</v>

2355
01:45:21.911 --> 01:45:25.270
<v Speaker 2>the picture of the girls in little rock </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to school,</v>

2356
01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:26.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were they segregated?</v>

2357
01:45:26.641 --> 01:45:27.474
<v Speaker 2>They desegregated the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine being a little girl and that's </v>

2358
01:45:30.341 --> 01:45:34.260
<v Speaker 2>you going with these police officers to </v>
<v Speaker 2>school or going crazy and,</v>

2359
01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.870
<v Speaker 2>and to value in education and to not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>skipping school.</v>

2360
01:45:37.871 --> 01:45:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then beyond that,</v>

2361
01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.353
<v Speaker 2>Bret Weinstein said his argument was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is racist and let's not do </v>

2362
01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:45.460
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's talk about it.</v>

2363
01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:50.080
<v Speaker 2>And his speech in the hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're outside his classroom.</v>

2364
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I saw him and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2365
01:45:52.091 --> 01:45:52.924
<v Speaker 2>this is an amazing guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at how rationally is measured and </v>

2366
01:45:55.721 --> 01:45:59.440
<v Speaker 2>calm and full of grace in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2367
01:45:59.441 --> 01:46:01.240
<v Speaker 2>there's this mob there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2368
01:46:01.241 --> 01:46:03.760
<v Speaker 2>you're calling them racist and shouting </v>
<v Speaker 2>him down.</v>

2369
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Him Down and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2370
01:46:05.711 --> 01:46:06.544
<v Speaker 2>I want to study with the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you please do a mooc on Coursera so </v>

2371
01:46:10.211 --> 01:46:11.044
<v Speaker 2>I can take a class from you and learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do what you do in a heated </v>

2372
01:46:14.471 --> 01:46:15.304
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Nicholas Christakis at Yale is </v>

2373
01:46:16.901 --> 01:46:21.190
<v Speaker 2>another one who had people screaming at </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and was just a class act,</v>

2374
01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just as crazy and they've lost.</v>

2375
01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.820
<v Speaker 2>So you'd lost Bret Weinstein from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Evergreen.</v>

2376
01:46:27.850 --> 01:46:28.840
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2377
01:46:28.841 --> 01:46:33.040
<v Speaker 2>this guy was a valuable guy to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it's so sad that he is now.</v>

2378
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:35.620
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't safe for him when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>there with baseball bats.</v>

2379
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a circus.</v>

2380
01:46:37.151 --> 01:46:38.620
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer about education.</v>

2381
01:46:38.621 --> 01:46:40.930
<v Speaker 2>You can see why he couldn't go back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife too.</v>

2382
01:46:40.931 --> 01:46:42.700
<v Speaker 2>It's very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

2383
01:46:42.701 --> 01:46:44.920
<v Speaker 2>very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is what's happening.</v>

2384
01:46:44.921 --> 01:46:47.020
<v Speaker 2>That they're not allowing discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea,</v>

2385
01:46:47.021 --> 01:46:48.970
<v Speaker 2>that accusation of your racist.</v>

2386
01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 2>This is now just this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a just giant muscle.</v>

2387
01:46:52.351 --> 01:46:55.170
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just listen to what it is,</v>

2388
01:46:55.171 --> 01:46:56.004
<v Speaker 2>is a giant muzzle just shut up and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way to silence you and it's a way to </v>

2389
01:46:58.801 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 2>force their ideas down your throat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you bring something up there.</v>

2390
01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I call it a way to have unearned power </v>
<v Speaker 2>over other people.</v>

2391
01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:05.993
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NPC part is that we have kids go to </v>

2392
01:47:11.551 --> 01:47:15.510
<v Speaker 2>college who are not prepared for college</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is especially true if you go to</v>

2393
01:47:15.511 --> 01:47:16.344
<v Speaker 2>some terrible school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not if you're the child of wealthy </v>

2394
01:47:18.061 --> 01:47:20.820
<v Speaker 2>parents who got all the sat training and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything like that,</v>

2395
01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:24.390
<v Speaker 2>but so you get promoted because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want a certain color face in there.</v>

2396
01:47:24.391 --> 01:47:27.810
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you do okay at Duke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they send you to Harvard because you</v>

2397
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:28.890
<v Speaker 2>can get in there because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2398
01:47:28.891 --> 01:47:30.060
<v Speaker 2>we have all these Asian people.</v>

2399
01:47:30.090 --> 01:47:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Screw you Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to like kick you out and not</v>

2400
01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:34.360
<v Speaker 2>admit you and will admit the craziest </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2401
01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so terrible.</v>

2402
01:47:36.901 --> 01:47:40.080
<v Speaker 2>So maybe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could clarify that because people</v>

2403
01:47:40.081 --> 01:47:42.030
<v Speaker 2>don't know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they do?</v>

2404
01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Policies Against Asians,</v>

2405
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:46.470
<v Speaker 2>admission policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Asians,</v>

2406
01:47:46.471 --> 01:47:47.304
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it has to do something with the </v>

2407
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:50.480
<v Speaker 2>culture and the family there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's um,</v>

2408
01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:51.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're Asian.</v>

2409
01:47:51.570 --> 01:47:54.530
<v Speaker 2>I had an Asian assistant before she </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived at home with her mother,</v>

2410
01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:56.900
<v Speaker 2>father and her sisters and her grandma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2411
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:58.740
<v Speaker 2>grandma answered the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't speak Korean,</v>

2412
01:47:58.741 --> 01:47:59.574
<v Speaker 2>she hung up on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was a very strong work ethic </v>

2413
01:48:02.491 --> 01:48:05.610
<v Speaker 2>that you must succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were very strong family ethics.</v>

2414
01:48:05.611 --> 01:48:06.444
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a single parent household.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens to a lot of </v>

2415
01:48:08.850 --> 01:48:10.950
<v Speaker 2>these at risk kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I speak at a school.</v>

2416
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:15.170
<v Speaker 2>I created a program to try to help kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it by showing example,</v>

2417
01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:15.781
<v Speaker 2>like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2418
01:48:15.781 --> 01:48:17.040
<v Speaker 2>here I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I failed.</v>

2419
01:48:17.041 --> 01:48:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I slept on a door in New York on two </v>
<v Speaker 2>milk crates.</v>

2420
01:48:19.531 --> 01:48:20.364
<v Speaker 2>I'm not from a wealthy family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be creative apprentice to </v>

2421
01:48:22.891 --> 01:48:23.910
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff.</v>

2422
01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Kids don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get that.</v>

2423
01:48:25.861 --> 01:48:27.660
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you grew up in a bad neighborhood and</v>

2424
01:48:27.661 --> 01:48:28.494
<v Speaker 2>your parents don't model that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>work ethic and the possibility to hope </v>

2425
01:48:32.251 --> 01:48:34.740
<v Speaker 2>for success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why should you think there would be</v>

2426
01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:36.420
<v Speaker 2>any hope for you and why should you </v>
<v Speaker 2>work?</v>

2427
01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a little off track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2428
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:38.671
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting off track.</v>

2429
01:48:38.671 --> 01:48:42.180
<v Speaker 2>The standards for standards for Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they say,</v>

2430
01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:43.710
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of you Asians,</v>

2431
01:48:43.711 --> 01:48:46.200
<v Speaker 2>we have too many of these Asian faces </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2432
01:48:46.230 --> 01:48:47.063
<v Speaker 2>It's so terrible and so we're not going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to admit you were going to take the </v>

2433
01:48:49.171 --> 01:48:49.640
<v Speaker 2>standards.</v>

2434
01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:50.473
<v Speaker 2>Standards for Asians are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>much higher than for everybody else and </v>

2435
01:48:53.131 --> 01:48:53.964
<v Speaker 2>so if you get this grade point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it's like a three point eight and </v>

2436
01:48:56.821 --> 01:48:58.050
<v Speaker 2>you're Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>

2437
01:48:58.051 --> 01:48:58.884
<v Speaker 2>You're out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you are this person of this face </v>

2438
01:49:00.541 --> 01:49:01.374
<v Speaker 2>color that we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put you in there even </v>

2439
01:49:04.171 --> 01:49:08.400
<v Speaker 2>though you know you have the same grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>point as somebody we're kicking out.</v>

2440
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Sorry to ramble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that,</v>

2441
01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:11.160
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the.</v>

2442
01:49:11.190 --> 01:49:14.310
<v Speaker 2>They have higher standards for </v>
<v Speaker 2>admission,</v>

2443
01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:18.000
<v Speaker 2>like they've essentially put the bar </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher for them and it's racist.</v>

2444
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:18.863
<v Speaker 2>It's racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible discrimination against a </v>

2445
01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:22.020
<v Speaker 2>minority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2446
01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:24.000
<v Speaker 2>And they are a minority and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

2447
01:49:24.001 --> 01:49:24.834
<v Speaker 2>And so what I hear minority than African</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans and bigger minority than </v>

2448
01:49:27.901 --> 01:49:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Hispanics and Latinos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big minority in America.</v>

2449
01:49:31.141 --> 01:49:32.700
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was nodding and then I thought,</v>

2450
01:49:32.701 --> 01:49:33.000
<v Speaker 2>are they?</v>

2451
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting.</v>

2452
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what I suspect,</v>

2453
01:49:36.991 --> 01:49:39.360
<v Speaker 2>and I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just a guess on my part,</v>

2454
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:40.223
<v Speaker 2>is that when you are promoted to a place</v>
<v Speaker 2>where maybe you aren't capable of </v>

2455
01:49:44.701 --> 01:49:45.860
<v Speaker 2>succeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2456
01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:46.973
<v Speaker 2>that maybe possibly you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of putting your energy into </v>

2457
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:52.263
<v Speaker 2>succeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put your energy into protesting and </v>

2458
01:49:53.951 --> 01:49:54.784
<v Speaker 2>saying the system is terrible and racist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and unfair because that is the way that </v>

2459
01:49:58.091 --> 01:50:00.490
<v Speaker 2>you become somebody and you have power </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

2460
01:50:00.491 --> 01:50:02.200
<v Speaker 2>If you can't get it through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2461
01:50:02.201 --> 01:50:03.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2462
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:05.740
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't to say,</v>

2463
01:50:05.741 --> 01:50:07.480
<v Speaker 2>so people think that when you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

2464
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:08.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this group of people,</v>

2465
01:50:08.711 --> 01:50:11.560
<v Speaker 2>they're stupider or worse than other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2466
01:50:11.590 --> 01:50:14.970
<v Speaker 2>But if you go back to the schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you help those kids,</v>

2467
01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:16.540
<v Speaker 2>this is what they're doing with charter </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>

2468
01:50:16.541 --> 01:50:19.360
<v Speaker 2>If you give those kids what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing there,</v>

2469
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:19.870
<v Speaker 2>there isn't.</v>

2470
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:20.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2471
01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:21.393
<v Speaker 2>we're individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can help people who might have been </v>

2472
01:50:23.321 --> 01:50:25.900
<v Speaker 2>throwaway people to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they just see,</v>

2473
01:50:25.901 --> 01:50:27.220
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible,</v>

2474
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:29.320
<v Speaker 2>and here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we put the stability?</v>

2475
01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:30.154
<v Speaker 2>Or are you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a child of a single mother that </v>

2476
01:50:31.421 --> 01:50:32.254
<v Speaker 2>comes with it comes with certain risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you grow up in a certain kind of </v>

2477
01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:35.794
<v Speaker 2>risky neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole area of evolutionary </v>

2478
01:50:38.051 --> 01:50:41.170
<v Speaker 2>psychology called life history theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>that talks about this.</v>

2479
01:50:41.410 --> 01:50:44.290
<v Speaker 2>It's called having a fast life history </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>

2480
01:50:44.291 --> 01:50:46.330
<v Speaker 2>It's adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you grow up in a risky,</v>

2481
01:50:46.331 --> 01:50:50.500
<v Speaker 2>terrible neighborhood where things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unstable to get pregnant early,</v>

2482
01:50:50.501 --> 01:50:52.270
<v Speaker 2>if you're a male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be violent.</v>

2483
01:50:52.630 --> 01:50:56.320
<v Speaker 2>All these these things that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>helpful in our modern society,</v>

2484
01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:01.480
<v Speaker 2>but they're kicked off by that unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unstable environment where you grow up.</v>

2485
01:51:01.481 --> 01:51:04.780
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if instability is a problem,</v>

2486
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:06.190
<v Speaker 2>we can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2487
01:51:06.191 --> 01:51:07.024
<v Speaker 2>you're single mothers should go back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time getting a time machine and go find </v>

2488
01:51:09.521 --> 01:51:11.680
<v Speaker 2>a man and marry somebody before she has </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2489
01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.513
<v Speaker 2>That's not realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't throw away people and that's </v>

2490
01:51:15.251 --> 01:51:17.410
<v Speaker 2>what I see people advocating some times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2491
01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:17.861
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2492
01:51:17.861 --> 01:51:20.890
<v Speaker 2>well we've got to tell people to not get</v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant without a,</v>

2493
01:51:21.110 --> 01:51:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a family structure,</v>

2494
01:51:22.631 --> 01:51:23.464
<v Speaker 2>people that they're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand human nature and so because </v>

2495
01:51:25.961 --> 01:51:27.700
<v Speaker 2>they've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't punish the kids.</v>

2496
01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:32.760
<v Speaker 2>How do we give those kids to stability?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lack and I think one of the ways is</v>

2497
01:51:32.861 --> 01:51:36.220
<v Speaker 2>to have people going from the earliest </v>
<v Speaker 2>grades and model what,</v>

2498
01:51:36.221 --> 01:51:37.054
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents modeled for me as these </v>

2499
01:51:38.551 --> 01:51:39.790
<v Speaker 2>suburban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not wealthy,</v>

2500
01:51:39.791 --> 01:51:42.340
<v Speaker 2>but just sort of middle class suburban </v>
<v Speaker 2>people work hard,</v>

2501
01:51:42.341 --> 01:51:43.690
<v Speaker 2>do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>

2502
01:51:43.691 --> 01:51:45.310
<v Speaker 2>and you will be okay.</v>

2503
01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:46.623
<v Speaker 5>Also the problem with the Asian folks in</v>
<v Speaker 5>universities is they don't complain and </v>

2504
01:51:51.841 --> 01:51:52.674
<v Speaker 5>the squeaky wheel gets the grease and </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people aren't protesting and </v>

2505
01:51:55.021 --> 01:51:55.854
<v Speaker 5>aren't screaming that it's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they're doing is they're putting </v>

2506
01:51:57.721 --> 01:51:59.820
<v Speaker 5>their head down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're working and they're working hard</v>

2507
01:51:59.821 --> 01:52:01.350
<v Speaker 5>and that's a part of their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2508
01:52:01.351 --> 01:52:02.184
<v Speaker 5>I grew up with a lot of Korean kids and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're extremely hard working to the </v>

2509
01:52:06.061 --> 01:52:06.894
<v Speaker 5>point that I would feel like a lazy fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was around them and one of my </v>

2510
01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:12.490
<v Speaker 5>good friends when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my friend junk,</v>

2511
01:52:12.670 --> 01:52:13.503
<v Speaker 5>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was doing his residency for medical </v>

2512
01:52:16.801 --> 01:52:19.920
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was also competing on the US national</v>

2513
01:52:19.921 --> 01:52:20.754
<v Speaker 5>taekwondo team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was going to school all day long and </v>

2514
01:52:23.341 --> 01:52:25.350
<v Speaker 5>then he was training two to three hours </v>
<v Speaker 5>a night.</v>

2515
01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.680
<v Speaker 5>His kid was a fucking maniac and I would</v>
<v Speaker 5>be around him and I just felt so lazy no</v>

2516
01:52:31.201 --> 01:52:32.960
<v Speaker 5>matter how hard I worked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was so late,</v>

2517
01:52:32.970 --> 01:52:35.190
<v Speaker 5>but he never complained about anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

2518
01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:38.280
<v Speaker 5>And it was the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The culture was to never complain,</v>

2519
01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:41.850
<v Speaker 5>just to work hard and never complained.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're seeing that in universities,</v>

2520
01:52:41.851 --> 01:52:42.684
<v Speaker 5>you're seeing that with their results,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're also seeing that with the </v>

2521
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:47.210
<v Speaker 5>that even though they're discriminated </v>
<v Speaker 5>against,</v>

2522
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:50.870
<v Speaker 5>like racially discriminated against by </v>
<v Speaker 5>universities,</v>

2523
01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:53.420
<v Speaker 5>no one's complaining about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they continue to do it.</v>

2524
01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:54.254
<v Speaker 5>So they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they do it under the guise of </v>

2525
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:56.383
<v Speaker 5>diversity because so many of these Asian</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are so successful in their </v>

2526
01:52:59.151 --> 01:52:59.984
<v Speaker 5>academic careers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they doing so well and getting into </v>

2527
01:53:01.191 --> 01:53:02.024
<v Speaker 5>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're pushing them out to try to </v>

2528
01:53:02.781 --> 01:53:03.614
<v Speaker 5>balance it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't balance out shit and </v>

2529
01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:06.333
<v Speaker 5>whatever you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>encouraging this sort of weird way of </v>

2530
01:53:10.191 --> 01:53:12.170
<v Speaker 5>looking at people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you're not,</v>

2531
01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.470
<v Speaker 5>you're not you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want equality of outcome.</v>

2532
01:53:15.710 --> 01:53:17.360
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that's not real,</v>

2533
01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:19.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>equality of opportunity is real.</v>

2534
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:23.450
<v Speaker 5>Equality of outcome is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just people.</v>

2535
01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.313
<v Speaker 5>The equality of outcome happens when </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone works the same amount and this </v>

2536
01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:32.780
<v Speaker 5>is the thing about a free society that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't like to understand,</v>

2537
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:38.050
<v Speaker 5>but when you have inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inequality is by in many ways because of</v>

2538
01:53:40.191 --> 01:53:41.024
<v Speaker 5>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you have the freedom to choose </v>

2539
01:53:42.711 --> 01:53:45.170
<v Speaker 5>to work as much as you want or as little</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you want.</v>

2540
01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.153
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have inequality and </v>
<v Speaker 5>outcome and there's other factors for </v>

2541
01:53:49.191 --> 01:53:51.320
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is absolutely discrimination.</v>

2542
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:52.303
<v Speaker 5>There's sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's racism is always different </v>

2543
01:53:53.631 --> 01:53:58.610
<v Speaker 5>factors that play into account as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's also effort and to deny that</v>

2544
01:53:58.700 --> 01:53:59.533
<v Speaker 5>and tonight that effort is a factor in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the outcome is preposterous and it sets </v>

2545
01:54:04.371 --> 01:54:07.400
<v Speaker 5>up this fantasy land that so many kids </v>
<v Speaker 5>live in today.</v>

2546
01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 5>While they're protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ben Shapiro calling him a fucking Nazi.</v>

2547
01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:13.640
<v Speaker 5>That's where it all comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That there's these,</v>

2548
01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:14.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these.</v>

2549
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:17.150
<v Speaker 5>You have a campus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

2550
01:54:17.151 --> 01:54:21.560
<v Speaker 5>these kids that are trying to shut down </v>
<v Speaker 5>Republican speaking on campus by calling</v>

2551
01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:25.040
<v Speaker 5>them and these blanket statements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're white supremacists and racists.</v>

2552
01:54:25.041 --> 01:54:25.874
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2553
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:28.280
<v Speaker 5>well what about Ben Carson?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a fucking Republican too,</v>

2554
01:54:28.281 --> 01:54:29.114
<v Speaker 5>and he's black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that are black </v>

2555
01:54:30.801 --> 01:54:31.634
<v Speaker 5>that are republican is a preposterous </v>
<v Speaker 5>way of looking at the world and it's </v>

2556
01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:37.670
<v Speaker 5>this sort of isolationist view and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

2557
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:41.420
<v Speaker 5>It's weird that they don't see how </v>
<v Speaker 5>racist it is to discriminate against</v>

2558
01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:42.293
<v Speaker 2>Asian people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terribly racist and also if you </v>

2559
01:54:44.521 --> 01:54:46.620
<v Speaker 2>look at what real diversity is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2560
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:51.240
<v Speaker 2>it's bringing in people who didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic advantage because these,</v>

2561
01:54:51.241 --> 01:54:52.074
<v Speaker 2>the people who have a hard time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if they're black or </v>

2562
01:54:53.911 --> 01:54:54.860
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2563
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I know I have a number of black friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are highly successful.</v>

2564
01:54:58.110 --> 01:55:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are researchers and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up in suburban neighborhoods.</v>

2565
01:55:01.471 --> 01:55:03.660
<v Speaker 2>They grew up like I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a family.</v>

2566
01:55:03.690 --> 01:55:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Their family was intact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2567
01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:09.060
<v Speaker 2>they didn't need a leg up from anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they did what I did,</v>

2568
01:55:09.061 --> 01:55:10.650
<v Speaker 2>which is work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother told me,</v>

2569
01:55:10.651 --> 01:55:11.484
<v Speaker 2>so I grew up a Jewish kid in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood with no Jews and they like </v>

2570
01:55:13.501 --> 01:55:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Egged her house and everything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2571
01:55:15.090 --> 01:55:16.980
<v Speaker 2>My mother said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2572
01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:17.903
<v Speaker 2>there are people who hate Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to have to work harder </v>

2573
01:55:20.101 --> 01:55:20.934
<v Speaker 2>than other people because some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to be prejudiced against you </v>

2574
01:55:22.861 --> 01:55:25.380
<v Speaker 2>and try to keep you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a message,</v>

2575
01:55:25.381 --> 01:55:25.921
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2576
01:55:25.921 --> 01:55:28.280
<v Speaker 2>we should whine about this and isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>this terrible?</v>

2577
01:55:28.450 --> 01:55:30.480
<v Speaker 2>His murderer issues my parents can be.</v>

2578
01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:31.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

2579
01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.353
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

2580
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:33.763
<v Speaker 5>It would be really beautiful if </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody just did the Martin Luther </v>

2581
01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:36.771
<v Speaker 5>King thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2582
01:55:36.771 --> 01:55:39.020
<v Speaker 5>Just judge people in the content of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their character,</v>

2583
01:55:39.070 --> 01:55:39.903
<v Speaker 5>not the color of their skin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the origin of their birth or their </v>

2584
01:55:42.690 --> 01:55:43.830
<v Speaker 5>ancestors birth,</v>

2585
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:45.113
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately we are tribal and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do have these weird tendencies to sort </v>

2586
01:55:49.051 --> 01:55:51.000
<v Speaker 1>of lump ourselves together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

2587
01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:53.040
<v Speaker 1>for people that are listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to disagreeing,</v>

2588
01:55:53.070 --> 01:55:54.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fucking social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior,</v>

2589
01:55:54.941 --> 01:55:56.560
<v Speaker 1>your tribal too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

2590
01:55:56.630 --> 01:55:59.070
<v Speaker 1>you're a radical lefty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking tribal.</v>

2591
01:55:59.071 --> 01:56:00.750
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tribal outlook,</v>

2592
01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:01.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we would all be better off if we </v>

2593
01:56:03.321 --> 01:56:04.800
<v Speaker 1>were a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more balanced.</v>

2594
01:56:04.801 --> 01:56:05.634
<v Speaker 1>Me included.</v>

2595
01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Well me included to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2596
01:56:07.791 --> 01:56:11.720
<v Speaker 2>and if we listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I try to do is to look at the other</v>

2597
01:56:11.721 --> 01:56:12.740
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2598
01:56:12.741 --> 01:56:16.370
<v Speaker 2>the style side I don't agree with like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about this before where</v>

2599
01:56:16.371 --> 01:56:20.420
<v Speaker 2>you maybe see things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see their point or you look at stuff</v>

2600
01:56:20.421 --> 01:56:23.120
<v Speaker 2>that you want to agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a nick kristoff thing.</v>

2601
01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm a piece on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2602
01:56:25.281 --> 01:56:28.970
<v Speaker 2>here's what we have to do with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at it because we all want,</v>

2603
01:56:28.971 --> 01:56:32.450
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea of like do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to do something but something is</v>

2604
01:56:32.451 --> 01:56:33.284
<v Speaker 2>not a good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at his piece wanting to </v>

2605
01:56:35.391 --> 01:56:37.760
<v Speaker 2>find something in there that would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2606
01:56:37.761 --> 01:56:39.770
<v Speaker 2>we just do these things in every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in there.</v>

2607
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:44.030
<v Speaker 2>It was all meaningless stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have stopped the guy in Vegas.</v>

2608
01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:47.300
<v Speaker 2>And so I looked at that wanting to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and you see nothing.</v>

2609
01:56:47.301 --> 01:56:48.134
<v Speaker 2>And so it's the thing of being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being intellectually honest and honest </v>

2610
01:56:51.111 --> 01:56:53.030
<v Speaker 2>when your site is full of shit too.</v>

2611
01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2612
01:56:54.791 --> 01:56:56.920
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in Vegas,</v>

2613
01:56:56.921 --> 01:57:00.490
<v Speaker 1>we want to find some sort of solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it doesn't necessarily exist.</v>

2614
01:57:00.491 --> 01:57:01.324
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously the access to weapons </v>

2615
01:57:03.581 --> 01:57:05.530
<v Speaker 1>is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge one.</v>

2616
01:57:05.531 --> 01:57:07.990
<v Speaker 1>And to deny that it's silly to deny that</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the right,</v>

2617
01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:08.853
<v Speaker 1>like the people that are massive second </v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment proponents like to deny that </v>

2618
01:57:12.271 --> 01:57:13.104
<v Speaker 1>the access to weapons has no factor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone using those weapons is pretty </v>

2619
01:57:16.541 --> 01:57:17.740
<v Speaker 1>fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2620
01:57:17.741 --> 01:57:18.574
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then to say that those weapons </v>

2621
01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:26.080
<v Speaker 1>should not be accessible to people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not criminals.</v>

2622
01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:28.690
<v Speaker 1>That's also weird because you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2623
01:57:28.691 --> 01:57:30.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you have.</v>

2624
01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:31.653
<v Speaker 1>If we have laws in this country that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow a person to go and buy a gun for </v>

2625
01:57:34.841 --> 01:57:35.674
<v Speaker 1>personal safety and then something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens where people get shot and </v>

2626
01:57:39.731 --> 01:57:40.564
<v Speaker 1>murdered by some crazy person and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take those rights away from the </v>

2627
01:57:44.621 --> 01:57:47.650
<v Speaker 1>people who have done nothing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good either.</v>

2628
01:57:47.890 --> 01:57:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2629
01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:50.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't stop it either.</v>

2630
01:57:50.130 --> 01:57:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Look at the Charlie Hebdo thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>France.</v>

2631
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:53.343
<v Speaker 2>They don't allow guns in France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if the policemen </v>

2632
01:57:55.371 --> 01:57:56.790
<v Speaker 2>armed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they are different</v>

2633
01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:57.361
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2634
01:57:57.361 --> 01:57:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Because that's Muslim extremists that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're acting on religious</v>

2635
01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:01.990
<v Speaker 2>pulses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they got guns.</v>

2636
01:58:01.991 --> 01:58:05.530
<v Speaker 2>They got horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible guns that killed people.</v>

2637
01:58:05.531 --> 01:58:06.364
<v Speaker 2>I mean it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they might've even been </v>

2638
01:58:08.801 --> 01:58:09.634
<v Speaker 2>automatic weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't want to use that term </v>

2639
01:58:11.171 --> 01:58:12.580
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns,</v>

2640
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:17.070
<v Speaker 2>so I probably just use that wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't allow guns in Francis.</v>

2641
01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.760
<v Speaker 2>They got them and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals,</v>

2642
01:58:18.761 --> 01:58:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I live near the hood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2643
01:58:19.841 --> 01:58:21.440
<v Speaker 2>you can get whatever drug you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2644
01:58:21.441 --> 01:58:24.760
<v Speaker 2>and the coroner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you get that through my adderall?</v>

2645
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2646
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:27.330
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2647
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.823
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>

2648
01:58:29.630 --> 01:58:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Access is it's way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2649
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Australia is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had one mass shooting.</v>

2650
01:58:33.891 --> 01:58:36.140
<v Speaker 1>They rounded up all the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't had a single one sense,</v>

2651
01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:37.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Australia also has less people than </v>

2652
01:58:38.871 --> 01:58:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles and it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the size United States.</v>

2653
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:43.420
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2654
01:58:43.450 --> 01:58:44.283
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a discussion to be had for sure </v>

2655
01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:47.193
<v Speaker 1>and along you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we need to discuss access to </v>

2656
01:58:50.861 --> 01:58:53.110
<v Speaker 1>firearms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a part of that discussion.</v>

2657
01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:54.273
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about it the other day with my </v>

2658
01:58:55.391 --> 01:58:56.224
<v Speaker 1>friend Alonzo Bowden and immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were put making articles saying </v>

2659
01:59:00.041 --> 01:59:03.190
<v Speaker 1>that we are calling for a police state </v>
<v Speaker 1>and confiscation of the guns.</v>

2660
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one said that,</v>

2661
01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:07.510
<v Speaker 1>but this is the right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2662
01:59:07.511 --> 01:59:12.430
<v Speaker 1>second amendment proponent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knee jerk reaction to an instantaneously</v>

2663
01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:17.460
<v Speaker 1>demonize anyone is critical of the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the access to 23 fucking rifles.</v>

2664
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:18.343
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And see the thing that that's happened </v>

2665
01:59:19.101 --> 01:59:21.710
<v Speaker 2>with the polarization is that now just </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

2666
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:23.840
<v Speaker 2>let's think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2667
01:59:23.841 --> 01:59:26.630
<v Speaker 2>because I'm libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pro second amendment,</v>

2668
01:59:26.631 --> 01:59:29.060
<v Speaker 2>but I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at this.</v>

2669
01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:31.130
<v Speaker 2>That's not bad to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at this.</v>

2670
01:59:31.131 --> 01:59:33.620
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't mean we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to take away everybody's guns.</v>

2671
01:59:33.621 --> 01:59:37.910
<v Speaker 2>It means that we want to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things as it's ever been a clear.</v>

2672
01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:42.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a giant problem with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>having access to guns like that.</v>

2673
01:59:42.610 --> 01:59:43.443
<v Speaker 1>Show it to me because this guy broke </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows in a hotel and shot 500 fucking </v>

2674
01:59:48.131 --> 01:59:48.964
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2675
01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:54.040
<v Speaker 1>if that's not a clear situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people need to look at it and go,</v>

2676
01:59:54.041 --> 01:59:55.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does this get presented?</v>

2677
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't get presented by burring </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head in the sand.</v>

2678
01:59:58.331 --> 01:59:59.164
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get prevented by just going </v>

2679
02:00:01.601 --> 02:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>back to the second amendment and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling it out,</v>

2680
02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:06.790
<v Speaker 1>stomping your feet and pound your fist </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the table,</v>

2681
02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:09.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shall not be infringed.</v>

2682
02:00:09.090 --> 02:00:09.923
<v Speaker 2>That is not how you prevent your </v>
<v Speaker 2>children from getting shot by a fucking </v>

2683
02:00:12.841 --> 02:00:13.710
<v Speaker 2>psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2684
02:00:13.711 --> 02:00:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I think what's hard in this too is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have any answers.</v>

2685
02:00:16.501 --> 02:00:17.550
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2686
02:00:17.551 --> 02:00:18.384
<v Speaker 2>if it was just mental health or just </v>
<v Speaker 2>this or just that because it's a </v>

2687
02:00:20.581 --> 02:00:21.414
<v Speaker 2>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people are just grasping at things </v>

2688
02:00:24.031 --> 02:00:26.790
<v Speaker 2>and everybody standing their ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat the pro gun,</v>

2689
02:00:26.791 --> 02:00:27.624
<v Speaker 2>the anti gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're saying cc and all the </v>

2690
02:00:30.181 --> 02:00:33.090
<v Speaker 2>disgusting stuff on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people did try to curb this a bit.</v>

2691
02:00:33.091 --> 02:00:33.924
<v Speaker 2>This stuff of people using that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ramp for their own whatever their views </v>

2692
02:00:38.251 --> 02:00:40.380
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was pretty ugly.</v>

2693
02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:41.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing those videos,</v>

2694
02:00:41.941 --> 02:00:43.890
<v Speaker 2>you always have that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you always have that.</v>

2695
02:00:43.891 --> 02:00:44.671
<v Speaker 2>But in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2696
02:00:44.671 --> 02:00:46.500
<v Speaker 2>when it's loss of life and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2697
02:00:46.501 --> 02:00:48.060
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump said this dumb thing,</v>

2698
02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:50.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that just barrage.</v>

2699
02:00:50.851 --> 02:00:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I saw that video of all the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

2700
02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:54.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2701
02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:55.380
<v Speaker 2>that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2702
02:00:55.410 --> 02:00:56.243
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a 10 minute video and the </v>

2703
02:00:58.051 --> 02:00:58.884
<v Speaker 2>police hurting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people didn't even realize it was </v>

2704
02:01:00.301 --> 02:01:02.130
<v Speaker 2>gun fire and you hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2705
02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:05.610
<v Speaker 2>that constant barrage when you hear that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that period of time,</v>

2706
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:09.030
<v Speaker 2>that gun going off so many times and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people,</v>

2707
02:01:09.450 --> 02:01:11.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being just that guy's victim,</v>

2708
02:01:11.850 --> 02:01:15.300
<v Speaker 2>that was so horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's brother getting interviewed.</v>

2709
02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:18.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw a photograph of the 90 minute</v>

2710
02:01:18.151 --> 02:01:18.640
<v Speaker 2>interview</v>

2711
02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most fucking bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews I've ever seen in my life.</v>

2712
02:01:22.691 --> 02:01:27.691
<v Speaker 1>He's so removed from his brother doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and he's talking about what a great</v>

2713
02:01:27.851 --> 02:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>guy his brother is and how quirky his </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother was,</v>

2714
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:34.210
<v Speaker 1>how his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother was just.</v>

2715
02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:35.073
<v Speaker 1>He was eccentric and he was just talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what his brother would have done </v>

2716
02:01:38.681 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>in the casino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People all</v>

2717
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:42.920
<v Speaker 5>knew his brother and to say they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know him was crazy,</v>

2718
02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:47.720
<v Speaker 5>but this guy seems like a guy trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>act normal.</v>

2719
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:49.220
<v Speaker 5>It is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2720
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:50.083
<v Speaker 5>there might be some sort of a mental </v>
<v Speaker 5>health issue with the entire family </v>

2721
02:01:51.891 --> 02:01:55.670
<v Speaker 5>because the dad apparently was a psycho </v>
<v Speaker 5>and was a serial bank robber.</v>

2722
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:57.343
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's some of the fucking strangers </v>

2723
02:01:59.901 --> 02:02:04.100
<v Speaker 5>interview where he's not like horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not crying.</v>

2724
02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:05.650
<v Speaker 5>He's not stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2725
02:02:05.651 --> 02:02:06.484
<v Speaker 5>it's so fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it brings me back to the whole </v>

2726
02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:11.690
<v Speaker 5>mental health aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have,</v>

2727
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:12.583
<v Speaker 5>there has to be a lot of shit wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 5>your mind for you to be able to do </v>

2728
02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:17.240
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What it is,</v>

2729
02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.910
<v Speaker 5>what it is.</v>
