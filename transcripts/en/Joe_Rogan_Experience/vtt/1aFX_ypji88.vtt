00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience and I can't think you enough Joe for uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>really sticking your neck out there.</v>

3
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:06.600
<v Speaker 1>And really,</v>

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I know you faced a lot of criticism for your supportive psychedelics.</v>

5
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.191
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:13.090
<v Speaker 2>it's been pretty easy.</v>

8
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be honest with you,</v>

9
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting here given this like heartfelt</v>

10
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

11
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>but I did take you seriously that day in the podcast when you told me mushrooms</v>

12
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>could change the world and it really planted a seed in my head which sprouted</v>

13
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>this journey that I've been doing around the world investigating these</v>

14
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>medicines.</v>

15
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>And that never would have happened.</v>

16
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

17
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>my life wouldn't be in such the amazing state.</v>

19
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it is in now.</v>

20
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>If it hadn't been for you having the gumption to,</v>

21
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>to talk about this and start this dialogue is our country.</v>

22
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Cause psychedelics have been so taboo,</v>

23
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>especially in the mainstream and I,</v>

24
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>and I think you're really helping to shift that consciousness nationwide.</v>

25
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't think I am.</v>

26
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm just the whole thing itself.</v>

27
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 2>It's very nice.</v>

28
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Tried to give me,</v>

29
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't deserve any credit,</v>

30
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 2>nor do I want any.</v>

31
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.461
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

32
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

33
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.073
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

34
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm shocked that more people don't know about the experiences and I feel a duty</v>

35
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.430
<v Speaker 2>because I've been there.</v>

36
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just like if you and your friends were starving to death and you found some</v>

37
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>food and the test and you're like,</v>

38
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:21.381
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

39
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:21.681
<v Speaker 2>come here.</v>

40
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:21.951
<v Speaker 2>Come here.</v>

41
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:22.191
<v Speaker 2>Come here.</v>

42
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:22.731
<v Speaker 2>I found the food.</v>

43
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:23.564
<v Speaker 2>I found the food.</v>

44
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Would you want all this credit for finding that food?</v>

45
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:25.731
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

46
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 2>You'd want your friends to have the food.</v>

47
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.273
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel.</v>

48
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.851
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

49
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.403
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

51
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 2>what we're all experiencing right now is a wait,</v>

52
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 2>what moment?</v>

53
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 2>The whole coach culture is going,</v>

54
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.381
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

55

<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

64
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 2>The NSA's listening to my fucking emails.</v>

65
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 2>They're listening to my voicemails.</v>

66
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 2>They're reading my emails.</v>

67
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.650

<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking insurance salesman.</v>

73
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

74
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.131
<v Speaker 2>and then people go,</v>

75

83
00:01:56.961 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 2>and we could pay for that with weed,</v>

84
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 2>but p and people are going to smoke the same amount of weed anyway.</v>

85
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Statistically proven.</v>

101
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 2>and about CNN and about,</v>

102
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 2>working for a corporation and being honest about it,</v>

104
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.220
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

105
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.441
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

106
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 2>you stuck your neck out about it.</v>

107
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 2>We're all just,</v>

108
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.260
<v Speaker 2>we're all forced into this reality.</v>

109
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 2>We didn't ask to be here.</v>

110
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>

111
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112

00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:36.230
<v Speaker 2>could you give birth to me so I can grow up in the 21st century and fake?</v>

114
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

115
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 2>this is what you get.</v>

116
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Nobody asked you.</v>

117
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.120
<v Speaker 2>This is what you get.</v>

118
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.870
<v Speaker 2>And I think all of us realize that that was the same for our far parents.</v>

119
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.460
<v Speaker 2>It was the same for our grandparents.</v>

120
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 2>It was the same for everybody and nobody hit the brakes.</v>

121
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had the wait what moment where they went,</v>

122
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:51.801
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

127
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just kept going and then had heart attacks and died and taught a bunch</v>

128
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>of nonsense to their kids and they went and they had heart attacks and died</v>

129
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 2>teaching a bunch of nonsense to their kids and then the internet came along and</v>

130
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.511
<v Speaker 2>that's the way,</v>

131
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>what moment and the way,</v>

132
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.431
<v Speaker 2>what moment?</v>

133
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>The real tipping point is people like you,</v>

134
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:11.981
<v Speaker 2>people like me,</v>

135
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>people like anybody that's a part of the,</v>
