61
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>We were both playing two guitars.</v>

62
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.691

66
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:32.941
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

67
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>first thing to get thrown first,</v>

00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>And they fucking,</v>

72
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>someone jumps on stage and just hit him with the guitar,</v>

73
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

74
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.661
<v Speaker 1>It's like dead ass.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

78
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.380

79
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>it was like the bread that gets buttered with bread or something.</v>

80
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

81
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.221
<v Speaker 1>that's literally,</v>

82
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>it was some crazy name like that on the bread gets buttered or the butter on the</v>

83
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>bread or something like that.</v>

84
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>And it was the most artists like craziest,</v>

85
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.573
<v Speaker 1>craziest,</v>

86
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>it ends and the lights and,</v>

87
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>and this is the middle of the day by the way too.</v>

88
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>This is like four o'clock maybe five o'clock and we're like,</v>

89
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.921

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>The whole house clears.</v>

92
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>So like all of a sudden I'm having a little bit of hope,</v>

93
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:15.901
<v Speaker 1>like okay,</v>

94
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe nobody will just be in here for our said maybe they all just were like</v>

95
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:19.441
