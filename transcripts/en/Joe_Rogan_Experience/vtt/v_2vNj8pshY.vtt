1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder what you base your </v>
<v Speaker 1>countdown on,</v>

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got two things going.</v>

5
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Why is it an accurate count on or use </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly guessing like a five count </v>

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.491
<v Speaker 1>because we have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it delay the thing and then the </v>

7
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:19.491
<v Speaker 1>thing and that thing and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>well we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

9
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>what's up to to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this man.</v>

10
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about the term </v>

11
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.611
<v Speaker 1>Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I put up a that we're gonna talk </v>

12
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:35.631
<v Speaker 1>about nutrition and diet and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>good stuff and then somebody went to </v>

13
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>your page and it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Paleo and lifestyle expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you have that word Paleo,</v>

15
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

16
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

17
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Serious baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

18
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day I think about,</v>

19
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda wish I never would have used </v>

20
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.050
<v Speaker 2>this word.</v>

21
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let's Mark Sisson went with primal.</v>

22
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

23
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>He uses that primal blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his sort of distinction of it.</v>

25
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're both just words is what </v>

26
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 2>it really comes down to A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about,</v>

27
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book that has the word Paleo </v>
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>

28
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 2>and I thought about even before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>published a book,</v>

29
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.240
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 2>what I'm talking about is not really </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people mean when they say Paleo.</v>

31
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more inclusive and a lot less</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogmatic and if I use this word,</v>

32
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.430
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be pros and cons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pro is people recognize it.</v>

33
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one word that that points at a </v>

34
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.101
<v Speaker 2>whole way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have called it the new nutrient </v>

35
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 2>dense ancestral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:43.091
<v Speaker 2>nutrition book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not too catchy and like five </v>

37
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 2>people that read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

38
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>

39
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Paleo has a ton of baggage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said.</v>

40
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

41
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

42
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 2>People get a certain idea when they hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>that word.</v>

43
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 2>And for some it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For others it's kind of neutral.</v>

44
00:01:55.221 --> 00:02:00.221
<v Speaker 2>They don't know anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for still others it's like </v>

45
00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:03.191
<v Speaker 2>instant turn off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why should we be emulating our Paleo </v>

46
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 2>ancestors lifestyles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all died when they were 30.</v>

47
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 2>This is stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.160
<v Speaker 2>why should we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a totally loaded term,</v>

49
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I think we just need to get past it as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

50
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea or a term and look at what it's </v>

51
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.830
<v Speaker 2>really pointing at it and evaluated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that basis.</v>

52
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that makes a lot sense.</v>

53
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>And also there was the issue with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>term Paleolithic,</v>

54
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>like using the term Paleo and then there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were some articles written about the </v>

55
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.171
<v Speaker 1>actual diet of the Paleolithic people </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they ate everything they got a </v>

56
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:34.510
<v Speaker 1>hold of and if they got grains they eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>a ton of grains.</v>

57
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

59
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean we know they weren't eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese doodles and drinking big Gulps,</v>

60
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:44.541
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of easier to talk about </v>

61
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:44.541
<v Speaker 2>Paleo in terms of what it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>include.</v>

62
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't include processed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>refined,</v>

63
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brad flower cookies,</v>

64
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>muffins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:57.411
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of packaged foods that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprise a large percentage of the </v>

66
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>American diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that top six foods now,</v>

67
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 2>our grain based desserts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar sweetened beverages,</v>

68
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 2>pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm chicken dishes,</v>

69
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>which are primarily fried chicken </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuggets.</v>

70
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm forgetting the other two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all crap.</v>

71
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foods wasn't the prime or six </v>

72
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.480
<v Speaker 2>primary foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>America Americans is just completely </v>

73
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 2>nutrient depleted junk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:27.481
<v Speaker 2>so we can all agree that our Paleolithic</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors weren't eating those foods and</v>

75
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 2>then we know it's pretty clear that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were eating a lot of neat.</v>

76
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we'll talk about that.</v>

77
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Meat and fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild fruits and vegetables,</v>

78
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 2>not the domesticated varieties that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're eating today,</v>

79
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 2>but wild fruits and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuts and seeds and some starchy plants.</v>

80
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.110
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

81
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 2>so those are the two extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we bracketed and then things like </v>

82
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 2>grains and the GMS were more of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>question mark,</v>

83
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.930
<v Speaker 2>like there's some recent evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows that that lagoon consumption was </v>

84
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 2>probably pretty more common than we </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought amongst our Paleo ancestors.</v>

85
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came later onto the scene,</v>

86
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 2>but if they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably ate them.</v>

87
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Is that based on geography?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're lagoons are present.</v>

88
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what other food sources were </v>

89
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.511
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty clear that they weren't the </v>

90
00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:15.511
<v Speaker 2>first option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

91
00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:15.511
<v Speaker 2>if they were able to slaughter an </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>

92
00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 2>they would have done that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eating the organs and the brain.</v>

93
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>And probably throw in the muscle meat to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dogs.</v>

94
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

95
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have it backwards.</v>

96
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:29.281
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at traditional hunter </v>

97
00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 2>gatherers and the way they eat animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go just like wild animals do.</v>

98
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 2>When wild animal kills another animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes straight for the organs.</v>

99
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's because the organs are way </v>
<v Speaker 2>more nutrient dense than the muscle </v>

100
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 2>needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

101
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.350
<v Speaker 2>and so traditional peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they knew the same thing even without </v>

102
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 2>having access to science and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing even what a nutrient was,</v>

103
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.580
<v Speaker 2>they just over generations figured out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that eating liver and the kidneys and </v>

104
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 2>the spleen and the brain was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to give them more energy,</v>

105
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 2>make them feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them more fertile than eating the </v>

106
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.071
<v Speaker 2>muscle meats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But did they eat the muscle meats at </v>

107
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:02.071
<v Speaker 2>all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

108
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that they probably did </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they hungry.</v>

109
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 2>They use every part of the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was clear that the organs were </v>

110
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 2>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

111
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the favorite thing to eat.</v>

112
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.570
<v Speaker 2>And how do we know this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just start anthropological studies </v>

113
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 2>of hunter gathers a contemporary hunter </v>
<v Speaker 2>gatherers,</v>

114
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sixties,</v>

115
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>

116
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:24.211
<v Speaker 2>there aren't many extent hunter gatherer</v>
<v Speaker 2>groups that we can even study now </v>

117
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:24.530
<v Speaker 2>because they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.930
<v Speaker 2>they've all been basically assimilated.</v>

119
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

120
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:36.331
<v Speaker 2>like the Hudson Hunter gatherers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa and there are some groups that </v>

121
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:40.171
<v Speaker 2>are still living a lifestyle that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively close to what they were </v>

122
00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 2>living for the last 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

123
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 2>And we can learn a lot by studying those</v>
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>

124
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's a pretty common theme in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these traditional peoples as they.</v>

125
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.190
<v Speaker 2>They focused on eating the organ meats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.290
<v Speaker 2>second would be probably meet another </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal products in terms of nutrient </v>

127
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 2>density.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ate a much broader variety of plant</v>

128
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.820
<v Speaker 2>species and we eat like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 2>across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people eat,</v>

130
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:07.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four to eight plant species in their </v>

131
00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A traditional hunter gatherer groups.</v>

132
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:09.810
<v Speaker 2>It was over 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

133
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 2>They were just whatever was edible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge diversity of plants.</v>

134
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 2>And that of course increase the nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 2>density,</v>

135
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 2>increase the fiber that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>

136
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 2>which we now know feeds of beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 2>gut bacteria.</v>

137
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Which has all kinds of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits for health and,</v>

138
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.230
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't eating the foods that we </v>

139
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 2>are now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating way more than we're eating </v>

141
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.780
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I say we,</v>

142
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean just Americans or people living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the industrialized world in general </v>

143
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem because of this concept</v>

144
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 2>of a species appropriate diet and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that all organisms evolve,</v>

145
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.870
<v Speaker 2>evolve in a certain environment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're are adapted to survive in that </v>

146
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.081
<v Speaker 2>environment and when their diet or </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle it gets too far from what they</v>

147
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 2>evolved for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this mismatch occurs.</v>

148
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 2>And that mismatch is really responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all modern disease.</v>

149
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is something that I thought was </v>

150
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.161
<v Speaker 1>really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but reading some of your work and some </v>

151
00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:14.230
<v Speaker 1>of your articles that you had sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrowed down to I believe eight.</v>

152
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:17.720
<v Speaker 1>The eight different factors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute to a,</v>

153
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.250
<v Speaker 1>to ill health that are a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored when diseases are,</v>

154
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.710
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone gets,</v>

155
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.500
<v Speaker 1>when someone gets diagnosed with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness,</v>

156
00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:32.560
<v Speaker 1>almost immediately there's a drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribed to treat the illness,</v>

157
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's not like sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

158
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.640
<v Speaker 1>backing up of the process to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

159
00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:42.820
<v Speaker 1>how did you get to this position?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is your diet like?</v>

160
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting enough sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of stress are you under?</v>

161
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Is your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm exposed to toxins on a regular basis</v>

162
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.450
<v Speaker 1>like you do you work with paint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

163
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you near something that's really bad</v>

164
00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:55.930
<v Speaker 1>for you to breathe?</v>

165
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

166
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the analogy I like to use is you have a </v>

167
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.230
<v Speaker 2>rock in your shoe and it's making your </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot hurt.</v>

168
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.490
<v Speaker 2>You could take advil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

169
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 2>And it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll probably feel less pain,</v>

170
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.100
<v Speaker 2>but you could also just take your shoe </v>
<v Speaker 2>off and dump out that rock.</v>

171
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 2>That would be a better idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

172
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I think we can all agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our Ma,</v>

173
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.610
<v Speaker 2>our medical system is the equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking advil when you have that rock in </v>

174
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.500
<v Speaker 2>your shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have high blood pressure,</v>

175
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 2>you go to the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get a medication to lower it.</v>

176
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 2>If you have high cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be prescribed to staten and those</v>

177
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:30.950
<v Speaker 2>can be effective at bringing those </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers down.</v>

178
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.340
<v Speaker 2>But there's rarely any investigation </v>
<v Speaker 2>into what's causing that symptom in the </v>

179
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

180
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.810
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is take the high </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood pressure medication,</v>

181
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 2>it lowers your blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have no libido.</v>

182
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 2>And so what's the solution there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another drug that increases your libido,</v>

183
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 2>you get via Viagara,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then Viagra,</v>

184
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>causes of some other side effect.</v>

185
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 2>And then you get prescribed another drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with that side effect.</v>

186
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:03.531
<v Speaker 2>And then by the time you're 65 or 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking seven or eight </v>

187
00:09:03.531 --> 00:09:06.681
<v Speaker 2>medications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the statistics actually bear this </v>

188
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:06.681
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

189
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:10.431
<v Speaker 2>most people at that age are taking two </v>
<v Speaker 2>handfuls of pills just to,</v>

190
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

191
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to get by.</v>

192
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's really not the way that human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings evolved,</v>

193
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 2>evolved and are designed for.</v>

194
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It's also it becomes a problem because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of money being made on </v>

195
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:26.750
<v Speaker 1>selling those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

196
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.790
<v Speaker 1>And the pharmaceutical industry is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic monster of a business where </v>

197
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:38.871
<v Speaker 1>they're just making billions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars and there's so much </v>

198
00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>momentum when you have a big industry</v>

199
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:45.140
<v Speaker 2>that absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they realized a while back that the </v>

200
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.370
<v Speaker 2>big money in drugs is not in treating </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick people.</v>

201
00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:53.371
<v Speaker 2>It's in treating healthy people because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are way more healthy people than </v>

202
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:56.881
<v Speaker 2>there are sick people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so once you get done with making </v>

203
00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:01.021
<v Speaker 2>drugs to treat diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to start making drugs to give </v>

204
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 2>to people who are fundamentally healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe have like some one lab marker </v>

205
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.460
<v Speaker 2>that's out of range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So take stat and drugs for example.</v>

206
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only a certain number of people </v>

207
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 2>that have already had heart attacks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in danger,</v>

208
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high risk of having another heart </v>

209
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.411
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you first stat and drug sales to </v>

210
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.951
<v Speaker 2>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to expand beyond that </v>

211
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:24.811
<v Speaker 2>population and start prescribing them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who aren't necessarily at high </v>

212
00:10:25.301 --> 00:10:27.650
<v Speaker 2>risk for heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

213
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe have slightly high cholesterol and</v>

214
00:10:30.191 --> 00:10:32.170
<v Speaker 2>that's where the real money is made.</v>

215
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

216
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:38.510
<v Speaker 1>so people that don't have really health </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of this,</v>

217
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

218
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:44.290
<v Speaker 1>like if you have high cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high cholesterol is a lot of times </v>

219
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:46.970
<v Speaker 1>associated with diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:52.060
<v Speaker 1>But the reality of cholesterol and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol rich diets and blood lipids </v>

221
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.130
<v Speaker 1>is that it doesn't really move the </v>
<v Speaker 1>needle.</v>

222
00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so much more complex than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is the cause of like if a </v>

223
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.220
<v Speaker 1>person has high cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the potential causes?</v>

224
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.160
<v Speaker 2>So diet is definitely one genetics or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

225
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:08.710
<v Speaker 2>or just certain genetic polymorphisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>that make you more susceptible to having</v>

226
00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:12.010
<v Speaker 2>high cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are a number of causes.</v>

227
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.740
<v Speaker 2>They're lesser known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So poor thyroid function.</v>

228
00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:19.741
<v Speaker 2>It's one cause because thyroid hormones </v>
<v Speaker 2>required to clear ldl cholesterol from </v>

229
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:20.710
<v Speaker 2>the circulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have,</v>

230
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even suboptimal thyroid function,</v>

231
00:11:23.981 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 2>not frank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi.</v>

232
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full on hypothyroidism,</v>

233
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:29.170
<v Speaker 2>but just a little bit of have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with thyroid.</v>

234
00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Your cholesterol can be high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

235
00:11:31.841 --> 00:11:36.280
<v Speaker 2>back in the eighties or seventies before</v>
<v Speaker 2>statens were a,</v>

236
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.370
<v Speaker 2>became a bigger part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the treatment of high cholesterol </v>

237
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.370
<v Speaker 2>doctors east to use low dose of thyroid </v>
<v Speaker 2>hormone to treat high cholesterol.</v>

238
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:48.070
<v Speaker 2>So they knew this at one time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

239
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.220
<v Speaker 2>disrupted gut microbiome and leaky gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I know you've talked about on this</v>

240
00:11:53.611 --> 00:11:58.611
<v Speaker 2>show with other guests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ldl is actually an antimicrobial </v>

241
00:11:58.611 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 2>substance.</v>

242
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 2>So the liver will make more ldl </v>
<v Speaker 2>particles if there's toxins,</v>

243
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.960
<v Speaker 2>endotoxins getting into the bloodstream </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the gut.</v>

244
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infections can raise cholesterol,</v>

245
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.640
<v Speaker 2>ldl and toxins can do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's studies showing mercury </v>

246
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 2>toxicity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

247
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:20.911
<v Speaker 2>can raise cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are all the potential </v>

248
00:12:20.911 --> 00:12:24.151
<v Speaker 2>underlying causes of high cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if someone comes to see me and they </v>

249
00:12:24.151 --> 00:12:28.591
<v Speaker 2>have that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to test for all of those </v>

250
00:12:28.591 --> 00:12:28.591
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to address those first.</v>

251
00:12:28.591 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 2>And then we see what happens and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>their liquids normalized after that,</v>

252
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

253
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:38.131
<v Speaker 2>we've done our work and we end the avoid</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a drug that they never needed to </v>

254
00:12:38.131 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 2>take in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we retest and they're still in,</v>

255
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:45.910
<v Speaker 2>their levels are still high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we have a bigger conversation about</v>

256
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 2>what the actual risk is given their </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

257
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.240
<v Speaker 2>their age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sex,</v>

258
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:57.270
<v Speaker 2>their family history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the absence or presence of other risk </v>

259
00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 2>factors like high blood pressure and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>

260
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

261
00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really complex.</v>

262
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.520
<v Speaker 2>And then this idea that there's just an </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary number for total cholesterol </v>

263
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.051
<v Speaker 2>and if you're higher than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to take a staton and if you're </v>

264
00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:13.360
<v Speaker 2>lower than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't is,</v>

265
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

266
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of a good comparison right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

267
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:22.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's ridiculously over simplified </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also has some effect,</v>

268
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your,</v>

269
00:13:23.921 --> 00:13:28.921
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your eight year amount of exercise and </v>

270
00:13:28.921 --> 00:13:28.921
<v Speaker 2>your overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

271
00:13:28.921 --> 00:13:29.550
<v Speaker 2>amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

272
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you put your body through as far as</v>

273
00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:34.870
<v Speaker 2>like stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>

274
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 2>activity that has some sort of an effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it as well.</v>

275
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cholesterol is a repair substance too.</v>

276
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:45.961
<v Speaker 2>So if there's any kind of damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>endothelial damage in the arteries and </v>

277
00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 2>the lining of the arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol can be moved to that site to</v>

278
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 2>repair the damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

279
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle choices definitely play a </v>
<v Speaker 2>role.</v>

280
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need,</v>

281
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I think getting back to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the original point here,</v>

282
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:05.701
<v Speaker 2>we need to be thinking more holistically</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what causes disease and how to </v>

283
00:14:05.701 --> 00:14:10.351
<v Speaker 2>treat it instead of just using bandaid </v>
<v Speaker 2>approaches that suppress symptoms.</v>

284
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't really have healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have disease management not to toe.</v>

285
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a fundamental difference that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to understand.</v>

286
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:22.171
<v Speaker 2>Like if you think of disease as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum where you know the far end is </v>

287
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:27.181
<v Speaker 2>death and here is perfect health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very rarely do people go from perfect </v>

288
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 2>health to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.020
<v Speaker 2>straight to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that happens in trauma accidents </v>

290
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.991
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But usually we progressed along that </v>

291
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:40.021
<v Speaker 2>spectrum and our conventional medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is designed to intervene at the </v>

292
00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 2>far end of that spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

293
00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:46.711
<v Speaker 2>when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're already kind of past the point of </v>

294
00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:46.711
<v Speaker 2>no return.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

295
00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 2>we had these drugs that suppress </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms.</v>

296
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 2>We have pretty amazing trauma care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I get hit by a bus,</v>

297
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:51.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

298
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're starting to be able to restore </v>

299
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 2>sight to the blind and do these </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible things.</v>

300
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 2>But they're all at that far end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>

301
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 2>A conventional medicine is really lousy </v>
<v Speaker 2>at preventing disease in the first place</v>

302
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.220
<v Speaker 2>or treating it at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this end of the spectrum when it's </v>

303
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 2>closer to health and it's really bad at </v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting health.</v>

304
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in most medical school textbooks,</v>

305
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:18.881
<v Speaker 2>there's not even a definition of health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just basically the absence of </v>

306
00:15:18.881 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think we can do better than that.</v>

307
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems logical.</v>

308
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that,</v>

309
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.840
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be an approach that everyone</v>

310
00:15:27.841 --> 00:15:32.841
<v Speaker 1>should consider when you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the broad spectrum of illnesses and </v>

311
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:36.771
<v Speaker 1>diseases and injuries and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>different factors that are involved in </v>

312
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:39.750
<v Speaker 1>making someone ill that this is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying seems so common sense,</v>

313
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's not common at all.</v>

314
00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Not Common at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

315
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.760
<v Speaker 2>it does seem common sense to me and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think part of the problem.</v>

316
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hinted at it before with big Pharma,</v>

317
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's little incentive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>big Pharma,</v>

318
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.720
<v Speaker 2>big Pharma to promote this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>

319
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

320
00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's their interest in doing that?</v>

321
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means less sales for them.</v>

322
00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:05.781
<v Speaker 2>They're there for profit corporations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are publicly owned and it's in </v>

323
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:09.921
<v Speaker 2>their best interests of the shareholders</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do things that grow the company and </v>

324
00:16:10.531 --> 00:16:11.410
<v Speaker 2>grow the business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

325
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.950
<v Speaker 2>That's just how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how,</v>

326
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.140
<v Speaker 2>that's how our system is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

327
00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.730
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole nother discussion.</v>

328
00:16:17.731 --> 00:16:20.280
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

329
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.360
<v Speaker 2>it's problematic when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare because you know,</v>

330
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 2>the way it really should work is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go into your doctor and you have high </v>

331
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.170
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high blood pressure,</v>

332
00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:32.700
<v Speaker 2>your doctor sits down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

333
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.640
<v Speaker 2>asked you a whole bunch of questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what you're eating,</v>

334
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.170
<v Speaker 2>how you living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sleeping,</v>

335
00:16:37.171 --> 00:16:39.510
<v Speaker 2>are you exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you taking care of yourself,</v>

336
00:16:39.511 --> 00:16:40.710
<v Speaker 2>you managing your stress?</v>

337
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.990
<v Speaker 2>And then they do a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing.</v>

338
00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.760
<v Speaker 2>They don't just test your blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure,</v>

339
00:16:44.761 --> 00:16:47.610
<v Speaker 2>they don't just test your cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they test your gut,</v>

340
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.550
<v Speaker 2>they test your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hpa axis,</v>

341
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:52.680
<v Speaker 2>which is what governs your whole stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

342
00:16:52.681 --> 00:16:56.250
<v Speaker 2>They list HPA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.</v>

343
00:16:56.251 --> 00:16:58.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain,</v>

344
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 2>basically the connection between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains and the brain and the adrenal </v>

345
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:03.840
<v Speaker 2>glands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it governs our stress response.</v>

346
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.430
<v Speaker 2>So there are ways that we can test it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see how you're being affected by stress.</v>

347
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:13.850
<v Speaker 2>So if you're under a lot of stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's causing hormonal changes in your </v>

348
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:18.381
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can affect every aspect of your how </v>

349
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:20.630
<v Speaker 2>we can test for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they would do a lot of testing </v>

350
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.200
<v Speaker 2>upfront,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be more expensive initially,</v>

351
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.740
<v Speaker 2>but down the line it would save </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands or hundreds of thousands of </v>

352
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.730
<v Speaker 2>dollars per patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's take someone with type full </v>

353
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.151
<v Speaker 2>fledge type two diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on the estimate that I've </v>

354
00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:36.750
<v Speaker 2>seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can cost anywhere from 60 to 80,000</v>

355
00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:39.970
<v Speaker 2>to $400,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to care for that patient over the,</v>

356
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.330
<v Speaker 2>their lifetime to the insurance company.</v>

357
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Because insurance is paying for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these procedures.</v>

358
00:17:45.451 --> 00:17:48.180
<v Speaker 2>They develop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say retinopathy later.</v>

359
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>They go blind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

360
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:50.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

361
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 2>they require multiple operations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeries.</v>

362
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 2>They're taking expensive drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this stuff adds up.</v>

363
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.540
<v Speaker 2>But let's say we could have spent $1,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>right off the bat when before they even </v>

364
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.191
<v Speaker 2>develop type two diabetes to identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was happening and you know,</v>

365
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.010
<v Speaker 2>catch it before it happened and </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervene.</v>

366
00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you spend a little bit more upfront,</v>

367
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:19.130
<v Speaker 2>but you ended up saving tens if not </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of dollars over </v>

368
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.611
<v Speaker 2>the lifetime of the patient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think eventually the insurance </v>

369
00:18:22.611 --> 00:18:27.051
<v Speaker 2>companies are going to realize this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are also for profit </v>

370
00:18:27.051 --> 00:18:30.171
<v Speaker 2>businesses and they're interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately in things that can save </v>

371
00:18:30.171 --> 00:18:33.321
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't yet see functional </v>

372
00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.441
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we're talking about right </v>

373
00:18:36.441 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 2>here as something that could potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>save them a lot of money.</v>

374
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:41.190
<v Speaker 2>They see it as something that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to spend money on because the testing is</v>

375
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:46.191
<v Speaker 2>more expensive upfront,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not looking at the longterm </v>

376
00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:46.191
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

377
00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if pharmaceutical companies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just going to buy up the insurance </v>

378
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 1>companies and use it like as a write </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

379
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:57.270
<v Speaker 1>A cynical person may have that thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would,</v>

380
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.440
<v Speaker 1>if I was a pharmaceutical company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the writing on the wall like,</v>

381
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are having way more access to </v>

382
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 1>information about health than ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

383
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.540
<v Speaker 1>They're going to start to make these </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy choices and we're kind of fuck </v>

384
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:09.540
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

385
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:09.910
<v Speaker 1>What we're going to do is we've got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in there early.</v>

386
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Stranger things have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of problems with this in </v>

387
00:19:17.801 --> 00:19:20.560
<v Speaker 1>terms of like doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

388
00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:21.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a doctor,</v>

389
00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:26.761
<v Speaker 1>you have a line of patients waiting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into your office and you have </v>

390
00:19:26.761 --> 00:19:30.220
<v Speaker 1>standard model of treatment that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been sort of practicing for a long time.</v>

391
00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.610
<v Speaker 1>So to deviate from this path and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

392
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole rock in the shoe analogy that</v>

393
00:19:36.161 --> 00:19:37.270
<v Speaker 1>you brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is brilliant,</v>

394
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:42.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a perfect way to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all makes sense and it's logical </v>

395
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:42.330
<v Speaker 1>and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

396
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:42.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

397
00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:47.791
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance is not going to cover all </v>

398
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:49.801
<v Speaker 1>these different tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a giant issue also in getting </v>

399
00:19:49.801 --> 00:19:52.570
<v Speaker 1>people to be proactive to actually do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

400
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.290
<v Speaker 1>How many people do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a bunch that are fat,</v>

401
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.890
<v Speaker 1>that talk about being fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have poor diets that drink too much</v>

402
00:19:59.891 --> 00:20:03.790
<v Speaker 1>and eat too much sugar and constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating crap and not exercising.</v>

403
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:09.210
<v Speaker 1>They're 100 percent intellectually aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this and they don't do a goddamn </v>

404
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:09.210
<v Speaker 1>thing about it.</v>

405
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

406
00:20:09.611 --> 00:20:12.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a systemic problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if we break it down,</v>

407
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

408
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.290
<v Speaker 2>on the doctor care providers side and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the inpatient side,</v>

409
00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:20.860
<v Speaker 2>so the care provider's side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're as much victims as,</v>

410
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.480
<v Speaker 2>as we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as,</v>

411
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:27.870
<v Speaker 2>as patients are to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this whole system that's been set up </v>

412
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.970
<v Speaker 2>because as you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way the system works,</v>

413
00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:36.030
<v Speaker 2>most doctors who were working in an Hmo </v>
<v Speaker 2>type of setting have like seven to 10 </v>

414
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.300
<v Speaker 2>minutes to spend with a patient that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so crazy.</v>

415
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:42.330
<v Speaker 2>That's not enough time to have the kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of conversation that you need to have </v>

416
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.110
<v Speaker 2>even even to get beyond saying hello and</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing a prescription,</v>

417
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.220
<v Speaker 2>a prescription,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically what happens in of </v>

418
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.261
<v Speaker 2>those encounters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you also mentioned that the </v>

419
00:20:52.261 --> 00:20:53.210
<v Speaker 2>standard of care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're legally required to,</v>

420
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:58.250
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take certain actions and certain </v>

421
00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.091
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their medical license and their whole </v>

422
00:21:00.091 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 2>career could be at risk if they don't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

423
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 2>So even if they question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

424
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:07.150
<v Speaker 2>prescribing statens to a patient who has</v>
<v Speaker 2>a total cholesterol of 2:40</v>

425
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:09.820
<v Speaker 2>but no other risk factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't do that,</v>

426
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.420
<v Speaker 2>then they could actually lose their job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

427
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.490
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

428
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being critical of individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors here.</v>

429
00:21:18.401 --> 00:21:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm criticizing the whole system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've created that,</v>

430
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 2>that I know many doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained doctors and I know many </v>

431
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.931
<v Speaker 2>doctors and I can say that most of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>are aware that the way that we're doing </v>

432
00:21:30.931 --> 00:21:33.070
<v Speaker 2>things is not working and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change it as much as anybody else,</v>

433
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:38.071
<v Speaker 2>but they feel constrained by the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other problem is,</v>

434
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>us as individuals,</v>

435
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.790
<v Speaker 2>like the level of responsibility for our</v>
<v Speaker 2>own health that we take.</v>

436
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:47.350
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

437
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

438
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.470
<v Speaker 2>we all ultimately are responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

439
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>so let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just say that,</v>

440
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's also true that we're influenced</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the system that we are part of.</v>

441
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.170
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

442
00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

443
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.800
<v Speaker 2>you get this whole culture which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically oriented around disease </v>

444
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.900
<v Speaker 2>management and suppressing symptoms with</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

445
00:22:06.901 --> 00:22:11.901
<v Speaker 2>And that's what patients come to expect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've heard from many doctors and </v>

446
00:22:11.901 --> 00:22:16.891
<v Speaker 2>there've actually been studies on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that patients will go in to the </v>

447
00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:19.210
<v Speaker 2>doctor and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll request a drug and they won't be</v>

448
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:22.420
<v Speaker 2>satisfied unless they leave with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription for that drug,</v>

449
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:27.421
<v Speaker 2>whether it's indicated for them or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is because we're one of only </v>

450
00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 2>two countries in the world that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct to consumer drug advertising,</v>

451
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:35.490
<v Speaker 2>the US and New Zealand and only two </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in the whole world that allow </v>

452
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:40.350
<v Speaker 2>ads in magazines that are targeted </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards consumers for drugs and the risk</v>

453
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 2>in doing this is exactly what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about now.</v>

454
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.180
<v Speaker 2>You get someone who's seen a drug ad in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a magazine.</v>

455
00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:47.410
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need that drug.</v>

456
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.570
<v Speaker 2>They go into the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ask for it.</v>

457
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.550
<v Speaker 2>The doctor knows it's not right for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

458
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.240
<v Speaker 2>but the patient's not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfied unless they get that </v>

459
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.631
<v Speaker 2>prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the doctor caves and gives them that </v>

460
00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:00.631
<v Speaker 2>prescription.</v>

461
00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I did not know we were one of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the whole world.</v>

462
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I thought new New Zealand was a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more on the ball.</v>

463
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.430
<v Speaker 1>It's surprising in a way that New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand,</v>

464
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you're a stupid as we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

465
00:23:11.401 --> 00:23:12.810
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant problem.</v>

466
00:23:12.811 --> 00:23:14.790
<v Speaker 1>The did that advertising model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

467
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.120
<v Speaker 1>advertising is a giant problem period </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people because we're so susceptible </v>

468
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:20.120
<v Speaker 1>to influence</v>

469
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 2>and they've shown this with food in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular that you know this the </v>

470
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:27.990
<v Speaker 2>advert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big,</v>

471
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.260
<v Speaker 2>there's big Pharma and there's big food </v>
<v Speaker 2>and big food.</v>

472
00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:36.261
<v Speaker 2>Capital B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>capital F is this whole industrial food </v>

473
00:23:36.261 --> 00:23:40.311
<v Speaker 2>production system that is invested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling us crap and they are well aware </v>

474
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.640
<v Speaker 2>of how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

475
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.690
<v Speaker 2>they study how to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have food scientists on staff </v>

476
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:48.920
<v Speaker 2>that study the palatability and reward </v>
<v Speaker 2>value of food.</v>

477
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:52.950
<v Speaker 2>This is like technical stuff like how </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods stimulates the,</v>

478
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 2>the reward centers in our brain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

479
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 2>that pringles add hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bet you can't just eat one.</v>

480
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.050
<v Speaker 2>They will win that bet because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

481
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists on staff that have engineered</v>

482
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:10.550
<v Speaker 2>that food to make sure that you do eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than just one because they,</v>

483
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.580
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they study things like mouth feel and </v>

484
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.700
<v Speaker 2>all of the different things that go into</v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulating the reward centers in our </v>

485
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 2>brain to make us eat more than we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>

486
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.030
<v Speaker 2>And so we are being manipulated and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

487
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 2>we have a responsibility to see that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get beyond it.</v>

488
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's not a cop out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

489
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.070
<v Speaker 2>people aren't responsible for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions,</v>

490
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:35.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

491
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:36.620
<v Speaker 2>there's more to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

492
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:41.621
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in this environment where we're </v>

493
00:24:41.621 --> 00:24:41.621
<v Speaker 2>being consistently manipulated every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

494
00:24:41.621 --> 00:24:44.270
<v Speaker 2>It is very sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pringles things in particular.</v>

495
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

496
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan pulled that out there.</v>

497
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I think about like if you had a plate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a,</v>

498
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:55.290
<v Speaker 2>you have a baked potato with no salt or </v>
<v Speaker 2>butter on one plate and then you've got </v>

499
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.470
<v Speaker 2>another plate and it's potato.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pringles.</v>

500
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.030
<v Speaker 2>What do you think you're going to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of?</v>

501
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:04.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are hardwired evolutionary </v>

502
00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:04.031
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

503
00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:04.031
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

504
00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:08.050
<v Speaker 2>we're hardwired to seek out novelty </v>
<v Speaker 2>variety because it would ensure in an,</v>

505
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.720
<v Speaker 2>in a preindustrial food environment that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of hard wiring would actually be a </v>

506
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:19.601
<v Speaker 2>selective advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning it would help us survive in a </v>

507
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Paleolithic type of environment because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we would seek out foods that had a </v>

508
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.861
<v Speaker 2>variety of flavors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually different flavors means </v>

509
00:25:26.861 --> 00:25:26.861
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of nutrients.</v>

510
00:25:26.861 --> 00:25:28.720
<v Speaker 2>So we would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

511
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.270
<v Speaker 2>someone who had that kind of programming</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be more likely to survive.</v>

512
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:37.330
<v Speaker 2>But when you take that evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>programming that was designed when we </v>

513
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.570
<v Speaker 2>are living in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

514
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:40.580
<v Speaker 2>in a payload Olympic type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

515
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 2>and you transfer that into this modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment that we live in where you've</v>

516
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:49.391
<v Speaker 2>got the 7:11</v>
<v Speaker 2>on every corner with Doritos and big </v>

517
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Gulps and candy and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a total unmitigated disaster.</v>

518
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that environment,</v>

519
00:25:56.091 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 2>that environment of like a seven slash </v>
<v Speaker 2>11 when you go in there and there's just</v>

520
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.840
<v Speaker 2>zero healthy choices and all of it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar drinks and these fucked up snacks </v>

521
00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:08.330
<v Speaker 2>that have no nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

522
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>

523
00:26:09.421 --> 00:26:14.421
<v Speaker 2>it's such a bizarre common place that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just pull into any one of those </v>

524
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:16.430
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them and they're just</v>

525
00:26:16.431 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmed with unhealthy choices all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world to now and you know,</v>

526
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:24.820
<v Speaker 2>we've exported our crap to all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries in the world and,</v>

527
00:26:24.821 --> 00:26:26.690
<v Speaker 2>and pretty much any country.</v>

528
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

529
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.740
<v Speaker 2>in my twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I traveled all over the world surfing </v>

530
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.160
<v Speaker 2>and I was shocked at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

531
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be in this really remote place in </v>

532
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia and I'd see like a coca cola </v>
<v Speaker 2>barge going,</v>

533
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.720
<v Speaker 2>going by from island to island in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>little archipelago where there was </v>

534
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:43.720
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

535
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.110
<v Speaker 2>just huts on every assignment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you come up to this little hut </v>

536
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 2>and there'd be like a thing of coca cola</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles,</v>

537
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

538
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:56.340
<v Speaker 2>And we've managed to export this </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and it's just,</v>

539
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

540
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:04.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to go against evolutionary </v>

541
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 2>programming because this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real and it's until unconscious.</v>

542
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:08.670
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's below the,</v>

543
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.080
<v Speaker 2>the cognitive center of our brain where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can rationally think about it.</v>

544
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:18.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned before people who are </v>

545
00:27:18.081 --> 00:27:18.081
<v Speaker 2>overweight but don't make healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>choices,</v>

546
00:27:18.081 --> 00:27:21.270
<v Speaker 2>that's not because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually understand that they need</v>

547
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:26.271
<v Speaker 2>to make healthy choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that they're fighting against this </v>

548
00:27:26.271 --> 00:27:29.720
<v Speaker 2>deeply hardwired programming that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally incompatible with the modern </v>

549
00:27:29.911 --> 00:27:33.350
<v Speaker 2>food environment that we have and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

550
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:38.390
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are more successful at </v>

551
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 2>getting past that than others.</v>

552
00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About being able to attach </v>

553
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:44.620
<v Speaker 1>intellectually detached from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts where you,</v>

554
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a fact that all these things are </v>

555
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.050
<v Speaker 1>definitely bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's a compelling desire </v>

556
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.710
<v Speaker 1>to take them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this ability to step back.</v>

557
00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

558
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.340
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of a learn thing.</v>

559
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a learn thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

560
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not a natural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

561
00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.090
<v Speaker 2>if you it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's more natural is to see something </v>

562
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.200
<v Speaker 2>that you crave and to eat and to eat it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or drink it.</v>

563
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean not that is a natural animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>human experience.</v>

564
00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.480
<v Speaker 2>What's less natural is to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel it,</v>

565
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.210
<v Speaker 2>and then have a thought that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

566
00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:18.190
<v Speaker 2>this is actually not going to be good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

567
00:28:18.191 --> 00:28:20.050
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm going to make a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

568
00:28:20.051 --> 00:28:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

569
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

570
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.760
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we even experienced those </v>

571
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:27.940
<v Speaker 2>cravings in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there are.</v>

572
00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

573
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:35.140
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone has a really screwed up gut </v>

574
00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.620
<v Speaker 2>and they've got a lot of bad bacteria or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some fun,</v>

575
00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.490
<v Speaker 2>they have fungal overgrowth or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in there,</v>

576
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 2>those bacteria we now know and yeast can</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce chemicals that actually affect </v>

577
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.831
<v Speaker 2>our brain chemistry so that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's got a disrupted gut microbiome </v>

578
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:53.230
<v Speaker 2>might experience those cravings way more</v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly than I do.</v>

579
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.740
<v Speaker 2>And so it's harder for them to intervene</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stop that because it's almost like </v>

580
00:28:59.021 --> 00:29:01.790
<v Speaker 2>they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an alien presence in,</v>

581
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.510
<v Speaker 2>in their body that is creating these </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods.</v>

582
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's really hard to overcome that.</v>

583
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you brought that up because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things I was going </v>

584
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.070
<v Speaker 1>to bring up next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

585
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.100
<v Speaker 1>the idea that your gut biome actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls your cravings and controls </v>

586
00:29:14.381 --> 00:29:19.381
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your desires for things and also when </v>

587
00:29:19.381 --> 00:29:23.221
<v Speaker 1>you cure that up or when you heal it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start taking in healthy probiotics,</v>

588
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:29.100
<v Speaker 1>your desires for different foods sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge for me over the last few years,</v>

589
00:29:30.641 --> 00:29:35.410
<v Speaker 1>like say three years plus I've really </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten into probiotics,</v>

590
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.220
<v Speaker 1>got really heavily into drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kombucha on a daily basis.</v>

591
00:29:39.221 --> 00:29:44.221
<v Speaker 1>And then I started eating a lot of Chee </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of fermented cabbage and then </v>

592
00:29:44.221 --> 00:29:46.720
<v Speaker 1>it became Kiefer and a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

593
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:51.721
<v Speaker 1>And now I take on it total gut health </v>
<v Speaker 1>package with every food that I eat every</v>

594
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:58.561
<v Speaker 1>time I eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that like really </v>

595
00:29:58.561 --> 00:30:00.700
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on probiotics has boosted </v>
<v Speaker 1>my immune system.</v>

596
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm very rarely sick if I'm sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I travel so much.</v>

597
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 1>If I'm sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for very short amount of time.</v>

598
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I snapped back pretty quickly </v>

599
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.150
<v Speaker 1>and my desire for sugary foods is almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent unless I'm drunk or I just </v>

600
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:23.191
<v Speaker 1>want to indulge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I used to have this massive </v>

601
00:30:23.191 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 1>desire all the time to eat like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich or eat a bowl of pasta or,</v>

602
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.370
<v Speaker 1>and now I look at it and if it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>even really food like it,</v>

603
00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 1>my mind has sort of reached a tipping </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

604
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.350
<v Speaker 1>And then also my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my gut biome,</v>

605
00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:40.351
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm just guessing has changed </v>

606
00:30:40.351 --> 00:30:40.960
<v Speaker 1>where like if someone is a piece of cake</v>
<v Speaker 1>laying around,</v>

607
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at that piece of cake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

608
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.170
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to stuff that in my face.</v>

609
00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a lot of problems.</v>

610
00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:49.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of not good for you.</v>

611
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to give me some mouth </v>

612
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:54.990
<v Speaker 1>pleasure and then I'm going to feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking terrible our</v>

613
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

614
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's all true.</v>

615
00:30:57.761 --> 00:31:01.030
<v Speaker 2>All supported by the research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of research now on the gut</v>

616
00:31:01.031 --> 00:31:06.031
<v Speaker 2>brain access which recognizes the bi </v>
<v Speaker 2>directional connection between the gut </v>

617
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:07.330
<v Speaker 2>and the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>

618
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.960
<v Speaker 2>how the health of our gut and our gut </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome directly influences brain </v>

619
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 2>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Likewise,</v>

620
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:19.081
<v Speaker 2>our brain chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I directly influences our gut so it can </v>

621
00:31:19.081 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 2>work in both directions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're under severe stress,</v>

622
00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:27.031
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people recognize the </v>

623
00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 2>phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>butterflies in my stomach before you go </v>

624
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.400
<v Speaker 2>onstage and perform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you feel that,</v>

625
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you experienced that now</v>

626
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.410
<v Speaker 2>since he performed so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you still,</v>

627
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.390
<v Speaker 2>do you still get the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something's really important.</v>

628
00:31:37.391 --> 00:31:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to do a</v>

629
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy special that I'm gonna fail or </v>

630
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.921
<v Speaker 1>something like that and I get like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little nervous most of the time you </v>

631
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:45.060
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a heightened sense of like,</v>

632
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go right now.</v>

633
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.490
<v Speaker 1>But when you were about to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's scary,</v>

634
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:53.960
<v Speaker 2>your pants right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another less for fine example of</v>

635
00:31:53.961 --> 00:31:58.961
<v Speaker 2>the gut brain connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's been in our lexicon for a long </v>

636
00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:00.860
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think like on a popular basis,</v>

637
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.540
<v Speaker 2>most people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duh.</v>

638
00:32:02.541 --> 00:32:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know my brain's connected,</v>

639
00:32:04.311 --> 00:32:07.130
<v Speaker 2>my gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's only been in the last 20,</v>

640
00:32:07.131 --> 00:32:09.950
<v Speaker 2>30 years that the research has really </v>
<v Speaker 2>come around to,</v>

641
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clarifying what those relationships are.</v>

642
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

643
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 2>we know that changes in the gut </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome can affect our brain </v>

644
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:20.700
<v Speaker 2>chemistry and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

645
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.570
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

646
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:26.090
<v Speaker 2>the prevailing theory now of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually causes depression is called the</v>

647
00:32:26.091 --> 00:32:28.670
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory cytokine model of </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

648
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:34.060
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your serotonin levels are </v>

649
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:34.110
<v Speaker 2>different than you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

650
00:32:34.111 --> 00:32:39.111
<v Speaker 2>and that's why you're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that you have inflammation </v>

651
00:32:39.111 --> 00:32:42.400
<v Speaker 2>primarily in the gut and inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>cytokines travel from your gut through </v>

652
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.420
<v Speaker 2>the bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up into your brain,</v>

653
00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:45.740
<v Speaker 2>across the blood brain barrier.</v>

654
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:50.740
<v Speaker 2>And they suppress the activity in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frontal cortex which basically causes </v>

655
00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 2>the symptoms of depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

656
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.690
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is totally mainstream,</v>

657
00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 2>not fringe science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they recognize that depression may</v>

658
00:32:57.471 --> 00:33:01.070
<v Speaker 2>be caused and anxiety may be caused by </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation in the gut.</v>

659
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:06.670
<v Speaker 2>So this is where the direction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science has been heading up.</v>

660
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.520
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

661
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.880
<v Speaker 2>it stands to reason that if you take </v>
<v Speaker 2>probiotics,</v>

662
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 2>you eat fermented foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat fermentable fibers that grow,</v>

663
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.720
<v Speaker 2>help feed the beneficial bacteria that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are already in your gut.</v>

664
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.240
<v Speaker 2>You can influence that bank brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemistry.</v>

665
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:23.150
<v Speaker 2>And so not only change your mood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:27.020
<v Speaker 2>potentially heal depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then even,</v>

667
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive behavioral disorders,</v>

668
00:33:29.091 --> 00:33:34.091
<v Speaker 2>Adhd and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could also profoundly changed </v>

669
00:33:34.091 --> 00:33:38.410
<v Speaker 2>the creating of food that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if pathogenic bacteria feed on </v>

670
00:33:39.141 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you may not just be dealing with your</v>

671
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:47.981
<v Speaker 2>own cravings when you're craving sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with the cravings of </v>

672
00:33:47.981 --> 00:33:47.981
<v Speaker 2>those pathogenic bacteria.</v>

673
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:53.170
<v Speaker 2>We know there are examples in nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria and microorganisms changing the</v>

674
00:33:55.011 --> 00:33:58.340
<v Speaker 2>behavior of their host in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>propagate their own survival.</v>

675
00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

676
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably gonna Butcher,</v>

677
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the exact species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

678
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:08.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a parasite that gets into a </v>

679
00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.160
<v Speaker 2>particular insect and aquatic wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that.</v>

680
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 2>And there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a land one that causes it to crawl up to</v>

681
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:18.071
<v Speaker 2>the top of a blade of grass where it can</v>
<v Speaker 2>then be eaten by the ultimate host that,</v>

682
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:20.860
<v Speaker 2>that parasite wants to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

683
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.000
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not remembering the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>species,</v>

684
00:34:23.001 --> 00:34:26.710
<v Speaker 2>but there's a biologist know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>microorganisms can,</v>

685
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 2>can change our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our behavior.</v>

686
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:33.610
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we like to think that we're not </v>

687
00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.861
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're subject to these same </v>

688
00:34:35.861 --> 00:34:35.861
<v Speaker 2>influences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

689
00:34:35.861 --> 00:34:35.861
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

690
00:34:35.861 --> 00:34:38.720
<v Speaker 2>it is a very bizarre distinction that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to think we're people,</v>

691
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:40.820
<v Speaker 2>we're not animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're special.</v>

692
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:42.940
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we've evolved beyond being animal</v>

693
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.430
<v Speaker 1>switch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cute.</v>

694
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.200
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's nice to separate ourselves </v>

695
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:50.200
<v Speaker 1>because we're conscious and we're aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our actions and,</v>

696
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are all absolutely correct,</v>

697
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:54.350
<v Speaker 1>but we're just a heightened state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal life.</v>

698
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>End of the day.</v>

699
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:57.620
<v Speaker 1>We're subject to the same influences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

700
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it causes a lot of harm to </v>

701
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:03.440
<v Speaker 2>see ourselves as separate.</v>

702
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The term leaky gut,</v>

703
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.520
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people hear leaky gut,</v>

704
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 1>they've heard it a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

705
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:14.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that gets talked about a </v>

706
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.991
<v Speaker 1>lot when people deal with in quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>unquote gut health and probiotics,</v>

707
00:35:17.151 --> 00:35:19.190
<v Speaker 1>like what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is leaky gut mean?</v>

708
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.120
<v Speaker 2>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an interesting example of how,</v>

709
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.450
<v Speaker 2>of what happens in research over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

710
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.480
<v Speaker 2>20 or 30 years ago if you went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were like a medical conference </v>

711
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.261
<v Speaker 2>and you use the term leaky gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have been laughed out of the </v>

712
00:35:38.261 --> 00:35:38.261
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

713
00:35:38.261 --> 00:35:41.711
<v Speaker 2>it was really the province of </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative medicine providers and </v>

714
00:35:41.711 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 2>quacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet today,</v>

715
00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:44.900
<v Speaker 2>if you go search on pub med,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 2>the major clearinghouse of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of medical studies,</v>

717
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 2>you can find thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles on leaky gut.</v>

718
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 2>It will be actually talked about with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the term intestinal permeability.</v>

719
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.640
<v Speaker 2>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what this means is a,</v>

720
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.740
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

721
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of interesting think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

722
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 2>but your intestine is bake is basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

723
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

724
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a hollow tube that goes from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth to your anus and anything inside </v>

725
00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 2>the intestine is technically outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the body.</v>

726
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to think of that way,</v>

727
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:21.530
<v Speaker 2>but if you have a tube that's going all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way through your body and anything </v>

728
00:36:22.321 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 2>that's inside that tube is not actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside your body.</v>

729
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

730
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.160
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tubes job is to decide what gets </v>

731
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.611
<v Speaker 2>inside of the body and what stays out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because anything that doesn't get </v>

732
00:36:37.611 --> 00:36:39.990
<v Speaker 2>absorbed just gets eliminated as waste </v>
<v Speaker 2>without ever getting into your body.</v>

733
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:45.380
<v Speaker 2>And we couldn't survive if we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this ability to discern friend from</v>

734
00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:50.931
<v Speaker 2>foe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to let nutrients that we </v>

735
00:36:50.931 --> 00:36:51.780
<v Speaker 2>need in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but keep toxins and other wastes out.</v>

736
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the,</v>

737
00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:53.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

738
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:57.540
<v Speaker 2>one of the fundamental purposes of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gut barriers to it,</v>

739
00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 2>it's other guide is to be a barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically diarrhea when you're not well,</v>

740
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.020
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clear that stuff out.</v>

741
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Let's go everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

742
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:08.400
<v Speaker 2>everybody out right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

743
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:09.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

744
00:37:09.201 --> 00:37:11.040
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guide is primarily a barrier.</v>

745
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:16.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a barrier system and when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that's working well it opens and </v>

746
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.280
<v Speaker 2>closes appropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

747
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:17.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

748
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:18.630
<v Speaker 2>nutrient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

749
00:37:18.631 --> 00:37:21.620
<v Speaker 2>open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let that in talks and waste closed.</v>

750
00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Don't let that in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

751
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.240
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so everyone's gut is permeable in an</v>

752
00:37:27.241 --> 00:37:28.750
<v Speaker 2>appropriate way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

753
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.810
<v Speaker 2>When it's working well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if it wasn't permeable,</v>

754
00:37:31.811 --> 00:37:33.450
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would die,</v>

755
00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:36.220
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be able to absorb nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

756
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:42.020
<v Speaker 2>but the other side of that spectrum is </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it stops being permeable at the right</v>

757
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:47.301
<v Speaker 2>times and starts letting things in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be in there in the first </v>

758
00:37:47.301 --> 00:37:49.230
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's called leaky gut.</v>

759
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you basically have an inability to to </v>

760
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.550
<v Speaker 2>keep out stuff that's not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into your body.</v>

761
00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:00.990
<v Speaker 2>And then like so some of some examples </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be large protein molecules.</v>

762
00:38:00.991 --> 00:38:05.991
<v Speaker 2>Typically we digest protein into small </v>
<v Speaker 2>peptides that our immune system doesn't </v>

763
00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:11.901
<v Speaker 2>recognize it as foreign invaders and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to use to grow muscle and do all </v>

764
00:38:11.901 --> 00:38:15.480
<v Speaker 2>the things that protein helps us to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if large protein molecules that have</v>

765
00:38:15.481 --> 00:38:19.470
<v Speaker 2>not been properly digested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sneak into the bloodstream,</v>

766
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:25.190
<v Speaker 2>our body rec sees those things as </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign presence and creates antibodies </v>

767
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.100
<v Speaker 2>to attack them.</v>

768
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we develop food allergies</v>
<v Speaker 2>or food intolerances.</v>

769
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Another thing that gets through the gut </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shouldn't is called endotoxins.</v>

770
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 2>So these are toxins produced by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain species of bacteria.</v>

771
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Things like lipopolysaccharide and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get through the gut barrier and then</v>

772
00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:47.971
<v Speaker 2>our body produces antibodies to them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks them as if they're foreign </v>

773
00:38:47.971 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 2>invaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they are in that case,</v>

774
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't be in there in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

775
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.240
<v Speaker 2>And all of this basically creates a </v>
<v Speaker 2>systemic inflammatory response.</v>

776
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

777
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:02.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's food antigens that are </v>

778
00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.441
<v Speaker 2>getting in there that shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whether it's back bacterial </v>

779
00:39:04.441 --> 00:39:07.561
<v Speaker 2>endotoxins that are getting in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shouldn't be leaky gut leads to </v>

780
00:39:07.561 --> 00:39:11.221
<v Speaker 2>this chronic low grade infection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and basically all modern </v>

781
00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 2>diseases that kill us like diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease,</v>

782
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:20.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even some of the ones we've already </v>

783
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.710
<v Speaker 2>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression doesn't necessarily kill us,</v>

784
00:39:20.711 --> 00:39:23.410
<v Speaker 2>but all of the mental and behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases,</v>

785
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.120
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which now in fact one in four women and </v>

786
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.440
<v Speaker 2>one in six men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just crazy.</v>

787
00:39:30.441 --> 00:39:35.441
<v Speaker 2>And given that they don't really exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>in traditional hunter gatherer </v>

788
00:39:35.441 --> 00:39:38.400
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these are inflammatory </v>

789
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:38.400
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

790
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that contributes to </v>

791
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.731
<v Speaker 2>inflammation is going to significantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase our risk of acquiring one of </v>

792
00:39:44.731 --> 00:39:48.901
<v Speaker 2>these diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually dying from one of </v>

793
00:39:48.901 --> 00:39:48.901
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when we say inflammation,</v>

794
00:39:48.901 --> 00:39:50.560
<v Speaker 2>that's another term that people here </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

795
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.880
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

796
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.020
<v Speaker 1>It's along the lines of</v>

797
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.420
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you did an awesome job clearing </v>

798
00:39:59.420 --> 00:39:59.570
<v Speaker 2>the thing for me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's solidified,</v>

799
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 2>but inflammation.</v>

800
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Why is inflammation caused by sugars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why's it caused by simple sugars and </v>

801
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.250
<v Speaker 1>corn syrup and things on those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much simple carbohydrates,</v>

802
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 1>like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is causing that?</v>

803
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.920
<v Speaker 2>So there's this great paper published a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few years ago by a professor from New </v>

804
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually Ian Spread,</v>

805
00:40:22.991 --> 00:40:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Barry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is his name.</v>

806
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgive me if I'm not getting that right</v>

807
00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.260
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

808
00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:32.770
<v Speaker 2>a distinguished between two different </v>
<v Speaker 2>types of carbohydrates,</v>

809
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.240
<v Speaker 2>a cellular and cellular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cellular meaning lacking cell membrane</v>

810
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:42.690
<v Speaker 2>and a cellular carbs are carbs that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been heavily processed where their </v>

811
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.080
<v Speaker 2>natural cells that would be found in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant,</v>

812
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.640
<v Speaker 2>in a whole plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a start,</v>

813
00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:50.641
<v Speaker 2>like a sweet potato or a potato or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that have been broken </v>

814
00:40:51.311 --> 00:40:54.670
<v Speaker 2>down in the processing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have white flour for example.</v>

815
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

816
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.220
<v Speaker 2>originally came from a whole wheat plant</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had its cells intact,</v>

817
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:04.230
<v Speaker 2>but then it's been the seed or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kernel of the whole wheat has been </v>

818
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 2>removed and you just have the starch </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no cell cells anymore.</v>

819
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

820
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.700
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cellular carbohydrates,</v>

821
00:41:12.701 --> 00:41:17.701
<v Speaker 2>our body has to really work to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>those down and the actual glucose,</v>

822
00:41:17.871 --> 00:41:22.871
<v Speaker 2>the carbohydrate itself is relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>inaccessible because we have to work so </v>

823
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:23.650
<v Speaker 2>hard to digest it and get at it.</v>

824
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.760
<v Speaker 2>If you think of an analogy like a nut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

825
00:41:27.761 --> 00:41:29.440
<v Speaker 2>like a whole walnut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

826
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do a lot to get to that.</v>

827
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.090
<v Speaker 2>So it's gonna be hard to overeat those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

828
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:41.170
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a kind of a traditional setting </v>

829
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:41.840
<v Speaker 2>because there's so much work involved at</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting at it.</v>

830
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you have a bag of walnuts </v>
<v Speaker 2>from trader Joe's that have already been</v>

831
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:46.650
<v Speaker 2>shelled and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

832
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:51.680
<v Speaker 2>and they're just sitting there salted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just pound a whole bunch of </v>

833
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.100
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with this,</v>

834
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:57.190
<v Speaker 2>a cellular carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically the equivalent of </v>

835
00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:01.061
<v Speaker 2>removing the shells from the nuts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just making those carbohydrates super </v>

836
00:42:01.061 --> 00:42:04.631
<v Speaker 2>accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only to us but to the bacteria in </v>

837
00:42:04.631 --> 00:42:08.771
<v Speaker 2>our gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so his argument was that when we eat</v>

838
00:42:09.441 --> 00:42:11.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot of processed and refined sugars </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

839
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:16.700
<v Speaker 2>that are highly accessible to to to us </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also to our gut bacteria,</v>

840
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:21.701
<v Speaker 2>we basically create an imbalance in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gut where you have a proliferation of </v>

841
00:42:21.701 --> 00:42:25.601
<v Speaker 2>bad pathogenic bacteria that thrive on </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar and a reduction of good bacteria </v>

842
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.770
<v Speaker 2>that we need to be healthy and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>imbalanced.</v>

843
00:42:30.771 --> 00:42:35.771
<v Speaker 2>Then creates an inflammatory gut </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiota and as I described before </v>

844
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:39.080
<v Speaker 2>that those inflammatory cytokines that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are produced in the gut,</v>

845
00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:42.920
<v Speaker 2>they can travel out from the gut and </v>
<v Speaker 2>affect the whole body systemically.</v>

846
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.110
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 years,</v>

847
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.880
<v Speaker 2>100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippocrates said,</v>

848
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 2>all disease begins in the gut and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know,</v>

849
00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:50.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>

850
00:42:50.451 --> 00:42:53.540
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have any of this modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>science that we have now that shows that</v>

851
00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:54.500
<v Speaker 2>this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

852
00:42:54.501 --> 00:42:56.080
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was right.</v>

853
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.420
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ancients sayings like,</v>

854
00:42:59.421 --> 00:43:04.421
<v Speaker 1>follow your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we found out like fairly </v>

855
00:43:04.421 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the last few decades at the heart</v>

856
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:07.270
<v Speaker 1>is filled with neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

857
00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.360
<v Speaker 1>And that there might actually be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of memory or thinking,</v>

858
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote going on in your heart</v>

859
00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:20.130
<v Speaker 2>and then having a sense of purpose is </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with greater longevity and </v>

860
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.250
<v Speaker 2>better health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also following your heart.</v>

861
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Very strange sort of sentiments that </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be like,</v>

862
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you think of them as just sort of old </v>
<v Speaker 1>tales or old things that people say old </v>

863
00:43:32.821 --> 00:43:37.821
<v Speaker 1>expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they turn out to actually have some </v>

864
00:43:37.821 --> 00:43:37.821
<v Speaker 1>basis in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost instinctually</v>

865
00:43:37.821 --> 00:43:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of recovering lost knowledge </v>

866
00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.821
<v Speaker 2>at this point in a lot of ways and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're recovering it in different </v>

867
00:43:45.821 --> 00:43:45.821
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're,</v>

868
00:43:45.821 --> 00:43:50.550
<v Speaker 2>we're using modern scientific tools to </v>
<v Speaker 2>validate or clarify ancient wisdom </v>

869
00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:55.460
<v Speaker 2>that's been around for a long time and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think they both have a place.</v>

870
00:43:55.461 --> 00:44:00.461
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I personally think it's fascinating </v>

871
00:44:00.461 --> 00:44:00.730
<v Speaker 2>to learn what the mechanisms are that </v>
<v Speaker 2>explained that,</v>

872
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:05.750
<v Speaker 2>that wisdom in those sayings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think we can sometimes be too </v>

873
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.000
<v Speaker 2>quick to dismiss that wisdom as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

874
00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly or stupid or not nonscientific.</v>

875
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

876
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

877
00:44:15.091 --> 00:44:20.091
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>today in this day have the tools to use </v>

878
00:44:21.531 --> 00:44:26.531
<v Speaker 1>science to sort of explain unequivocably</v>
<v Speaker 1>why these things are factors in why </v>

879
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 1>these things exist and that we've proven</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these studies.</v>

880
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 1>These are peer reviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

881
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Here's the studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It showed that.</v>

882
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's neurons in the heart.</v>

883
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that makes sense.</v>

884
00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 1>You think that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

885
00:44:37.501 --> 00:44:39.210
<v Speaker 1>there's biome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

886
00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:44.220
<v Speaker 1>there's actually like organisms and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the way you described as great </v>

887
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.930
<v Speaker 1>that there's like an alien living inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that wants sugar because it really </v>

888
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.140
<v Speaker 1>kind of is that there's organisms in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

889
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

890
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I heard it explained once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never forgot it,</v>

891
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:57.050
<v Speaker 1>that there's more eco lie living inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>your gut than there have ever been </v>

892
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.870
<v Speaker 1>people ever.</v>

893
00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

894
00:44:59.131 --> 00:45:04.131
<v Speaker 2>And there are more microorganisms in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut than there are stars in the </v>

895
00:45:04.131 --> 00:45:05.970
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some crazy stuff.</v>

896
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.540
<v Speaker 2>So that's where I step in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's that possible?</v>

897
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.630
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Universe is infinite.</v>

898
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

899
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:14.850
<v Speaker 2>there is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

900
00:45:14.851 --> 00:45:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early conception.</v>

901
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:21.771
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they maybe haven't read about the </v>

902
00:45:21.771 --> 00:45:21.771
<v Speaker 2>multiverse theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

903
00:45:21.771 --> 00:45:21.771
<v Speaker 2>Because someone</v>

904
00:45:21.771 --> 00:45:23.450
<v Speaker 1>who's like enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ralphie May,</v>

905
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:25.730
<v Speaker 1>he has more cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

906
00:45:25.731 --> 00:45:26.590
<v Speaker 1>So he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

907
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.310
<v Speaker 1>he's a bigger universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how does that work?</v>

908
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you said about science is really </v>

909
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.870
<v Speaker 2>true and I mean I love science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dead.</v>

910
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spend most of my days in interacting </v>

911
00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.611
<v Speaker 2>with science in some way and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth pointing out that there is </v>

912
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:45.411
<v Speaker 2>some real um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with the way science is </v>

913
00:45:45.411 --> 00:45:48.670
<v Speaker 2>conducted today and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we run the risk of,</v>

914
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of worshiping like the randomized </v>

915
00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.911
<v Speaker 2>clinical trial and at the expense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other kinds of knowledge that can be </v>

916
00:45:56.911 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 2>just as important or more important in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in certain ways.</v>

917
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you brought up </v>

918
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.621
<v Speaker 1>that I think is very important is who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>funding some of these trials on </v>

919
00:46:08.341 --> 00:46:13.341
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical drugs and the efficacy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and how they profit off of it and </v>

920
00:46:13.341 --> 00:46:17.811
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many studies are sort of thrown out </v>

921
00:46:17.811 --> 00:46:17.811
<v Speaker 1>that don't fit the narrative.</v>

922
00:46:17.811 --> 00:46:20.520
<v Speaker 2>The file drawer phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

923
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

924
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:27.400
<v Speaker 2>so two thirds of medical research is </v>
<v Speaker 2>funded by big Pharma and that makes,</v>

925
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two thirds.</v>

926
00:46:28.941 --> 00:46:30.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

927
00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just human nature.</v>

928
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Upton Sinclair said it's difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a man to understand something when </v>

929
00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:40.340
<v Speaker 2>his salary depends on him not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding it.</v>

930
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:43.880
<v Speaker 2>It's one of my favorite quotes because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it explains a lot,</v>

931
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

932
00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:50.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can look at it just in terms of </v>

933
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:51.230
<v Speaker 2>basic human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a researcher,</v>

934
00:46:51.231 --> 00:46:53.690
<v Speaker 2>you're being funded by a pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

935
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

936
00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.550
<v Speaker 2>even if it's not conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a subconscious thing there where</v>

937
00:46:58.551 --> 00:47:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you know that if your results are </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative and don't support that drug,</v>

938
00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:08.380
<v Speaker 2>you're less likely to get the next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your next project funded and you're a </v>

939
00:47:09.681 --> 00:47:11.390
<v Speaker 2>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to have a job,</v>

940
00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.490
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want your work to be funded.</v>

941
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

942
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.550
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

943
00:47:16.551 --> 00:47:20.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not like these are bad people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are all like in conspiracy to,</v>

944
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.890
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

945
00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.680
<v Speaker 2>push drugs on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most researchers are good,</v>

946
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.780
<v Speaker 2>good people and trying to do the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

947
00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a way that the system set up,</v>

948
00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem where they need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>depend on pharmaceutical companies for </v>

949
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.860
<v Speaker 2>their funding and it's really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

950
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 2>don't bite the hand that feeds you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

951
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:39.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a time,</v>

952
00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the age old saying,</v>

953
00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.440
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

954
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:51.270
<v Speaker 2>up until recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there've been some recent </v>

955
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.270
<v Speaker 2>changes here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

956
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers,</v>

957
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:56.881
<v Speaker 2>we're not required.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A pharmaceutical companies were not </v>

958
00:47:56.881 --> 00:47:59.310
<v Speaker 2>required to publish negative results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they did a drug trial and the </v>

959
00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.280
<v Speaker 2>results didn't support the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out that placebo,</v>

960
00:48:01.281 --> 00:48:05.740
<v Speaker 2>it was more effective or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their drug had side effects that made it</v>

961
00:48:05.741 --> 00:48:08.260
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not usable.</v>

962
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:13.290
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those studies just basically go into </v>

963
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.320
<v Speaker 2>file drawer that they wouldn't actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>be published in a journal.</v>

964
00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.290
<v Speaker 2>And there's been a movement to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to where,</v>

965
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:19.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a study is conducted,</v>

966
00:48:19.781 --> 00:48:23.470
<v Speaker 2>it needs to be registered and then no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what the results are,</v>

967
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:28.530
<v Speaker 2>they need to be published so that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a chance to see not just the </v>

968
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 2>positive results that support the drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>trials.</v>

969
00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:32.350
<v Speaker 2>But the ones that didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be nice if that was retroactive,</v>

970
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:33.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

971
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:37.120
<v Speaker 2>but then there are other problems like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraud and so,</v>

972
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:42.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a pretty big study published </v>

973
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:45.421
<v Speaker 2>in Jama a little while back by Java is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Journal of American Medical Association,</v>

974
00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:50.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very prominent prestigious journal and </v>

975
00:48:50.611 --> 00:48:53.551
<v Speaker 2>it was a guy named Charles siefert and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he basically looked at the FDA,</v>

976
00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:00.360
<v Speaker 2>a monitoring of drug trials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the FDA's job,</v>

977
00:49:00.701 --> 00:49:04.150
<v Speaker 2>one of their jobs is to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trial is being done to,</v>

978
00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:09.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>determine whether a medication is </v>

979
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:09.520
<v Speaker 2>effective or done the way they should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

980
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no falsification of patient data</v>

981
00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:14.310
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that patients are being there,</v>

982
00:49:14.311 --> 00:49:19.311
<v Speaker 2>their health is being protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>adequately and there's no fraud going </v>

983
00:49:19.311 --> 00:49:19.311
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

984
00:49:19.311 --> 00:49:23.700
<v Speaker 2>So what he found was that in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a shocking number of cases where </v>

985
00:49:23.771 --> 00:49:28.771
<v Speaker 2>there was fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the FDA actually I did identify </v>

986
00:49:28.771 --> 00:49:31.780
<v Speaker 2>fraud and it was serious enough that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they took action in 96 percent of cases,</v>

987
00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:36.550
<v Speaker 2>the action that they took was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>reported in any scientific journal.</v>

988
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.580
<v Speaker 2>So let me give you a few examples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in one case,</v>

989
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:45.180
<v Speaker 2>a researcher changed patient data to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hide the patient had preexisting kidney </v>

990
00:49:45.281 --> 00:49:50.281
<v Speaker 2>and liver problems and they gave this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy chemotherapy treatment and he died </v>

991
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:55.310
<v Speaker 2>and then the researcher ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending six years in jail and that was </v>

992
00:49:55.310 --> 00:50:00.061
<v Speaker 2>never mentioned in the study that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on that trial data lake that was </v>

993
00:50:00.061 --> 00:50:02.200
<v Speaker 2>later published.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one example.</v>

994
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Another example I did they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the most note?</v>

995
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.670
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

996
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 2>the motivation is to get the drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>approved and why would they hide the </v>

997
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.960
<v Speaker 2>fact that this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the FDA doesn't require companies,</v>

998
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:22.620
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies to publish that</v>
<v Speaker 2>data and because they say in their </v>

999
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:26.410
<v Speaker 2>language and according to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see for it in this paper,</v>

1000
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:31.990
<v Speaker 2>it's more essentially more important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the FDA to protect the commercial </v>

1001
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:33.530
<v Speaker 2>interests of these companies than it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect public health.</v>

1002
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Even though this is an agency that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>ostensibly there to protect public </v>

1003
00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:38.860
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

1004
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.910
<v Speaker 3>skype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe I'm getting it wrong.</v>

1005
00:50:42.911 --> 00:50:45.160
<v Speaker 3>He had preexisting liver disease,</v>

1006
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:50.830
<v Speaker 2>liver and kidney issues and cancer and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>researcher thought changed,</v>

1007
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:57.220
<v Speaker 2>falsified his data and covered up that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1008
00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:02.610
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this was known when he was given </v>

1009
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:02.610
<v Speaker 2>this chemotherapy drug.</v>

1010
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 3>But why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand why they would </v>

1011
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.450
<v Speaker 3>cover up the fact that it guy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>already sick.</v>

1012
00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:11.690
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you think that that would be </v>

1013
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.690
<v Speaker 3>the opposite?</v>

1014
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Let me use another example because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think this will help show what's </v>

1015
00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:18.540
<v Speaker 2>happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a Chinese site,</v>

1016
00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:19.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most drug trials,</v>

1017
00:51:19.721 --> 00:51:24.070
<v Speaker 2>they take place at different sites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have multiple locations that are</v>

1018
00:51:24.071 --> 00:51:27.040
<v Speaker 2>testing so that they can get data on </v>
<v Speaker 2>different populations,</v>

1019
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just in white Americans,</v>

1020
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.970
<v Speaker 2>also Chinese people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they do it different centers.</v>

1021
00:51:33.971 --> 00:51:38.971
<v Speaker 2>And so there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a trial for an anticoagulant </v>

1022
00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:38.971
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1023
00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:40.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1024
00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:45.720
<v Speaker 2>they found that this Chinese center had </v>
<v Speaker 2>falsified a whole bunch of patient data </v>

1025
00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:49.831
<v Speaker 2>and change the results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they took that Chinese center's </v>

1026
00:51:49.831 --> 00:51:51.820
<v Speaker 2>data out of the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that drug would have failed.</v>

1027
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:54.940
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't have been more effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>than placebo.</v>

1028
00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:59.230
<v Speaker 2>But even though the FDA busted this </v>
<v Speaker 2>group in China,</v>

1029
00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.830
<v Speaker 2>the study that was published on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug,</v>

1030
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:08.150
<v Speaker 2>it's still included that data from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>study in China and even studies that </v>

1031
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:11.950
<v Speaker 2>were being published 18 months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still included that data in the original</v>

1032
00:52:11.951 --> 00:52:12.610
<v Speaker 2>data set.</v>

1033
00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:16.540
<v Speaker 2>So the FDA busted them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was clear that they had falsified the</v>

1034
00:52:16.541 --> 00:52:20.770
<v Speaker 2>data and yet that data is still being </v>
<v Speaker 2>included in the studies that doctors are</v>

1035
00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:25.771
<v Speaker 2>relying on all over the world to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions about whether to prescribe </v>

1036
00:52:25.771 --> 00:52:27.260
<v Speaker 2>these drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

1037
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.800
<v Speaker 2>there's fraud happening and whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1038
00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from financial interests or just human </v>

1039
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.141
<v Speaker 2>error that's not actually being reported</v>
<v Speaker 2>and translating into clinical decisions </v>

1040
00:52:37.961 --> 00:52:39.520
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doctors are making.</v>

1041
00:52:39.521 --> 00:52:43.570
<v Speaker 2>So there are a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the whole peer review process,</v>

1042
00:52:43.571 --> 00:52:48.571
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned peer review to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a pretty big study where,</v>

1043
00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1044
00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:51.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1045
00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:57.060
<v Speaker 2>paper was submitted to Bmj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>British Medical Journal and other big </v>

1046
00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:00.330
<v Speaker 2>medical journal with eight major errors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not a single one of the 221 </v>

1047
00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:01.960
<v Speaker 2>scientists that were asked to review the</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper,</v>

1048
00:53:01.961 --> 00:53:06.961
<v Speaker 2>caught all of the errors and only 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent recommended rejecting the paper.</v>

1049
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:12.690
<v Speaker 2>And this was even more problematic </v>
<v Speaker 2>because half of those scientists were </v>

1050
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.610
<v Speaker 2>warned in advance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to give you a paper that has</v>

1051
00:53:15.611 --> 00:53:17.220
<v Speaker 2>a lot of errors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1052
00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:22.560
<v Speaker 2>and the ones who were warned didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>any more of the errors than the </v>

1053
00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.180
<v Speaker 2>scientists that weren't warned in </v>
<v Speaker 2>advance.</v>

1054
00:53:23.181 --> 00:53:28.181
<v Speaker 2>They broke them up into two groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that just lack of time to do the </v>

1055
00:53:28.181 --> 00:53:29.940
<v Speaker 2>research and people being overwhelmed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>a workload?</v>

1056
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really an excuse.</v>

1057
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1058
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:39.980
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem with peer review because </v>

1059
00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:39.980
<v Speaker 2>our artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1060
00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:41.140
<v Speaker 2>it is a big part of the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>method to,</v>

1061
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>to have the results validated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>

1062
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Or two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to review the work and make sure that </v>

1063
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.681
<v Speaker 2>it's sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what this paper indicated is that a </v>

1064
00:53:51.681 --> 00:53:54.621
<v Speaker 2>lot of findings that we take to be true </v>
<v Speaker 2>and valid might not actually be true and</v>

1065
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:55.830
<v Speaker 2>valid.</v>

1066
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.920
<v Speaker 2>And you may have heard about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually made the news,</v>

1067
00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a recent,</v>

1068
00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.580
<v Speaker 2>the open science collaboration did a </v>
<v Speaker 2>review of 100 psychology studies and </v>

1069
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 2>that had never been replicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Replicating findings is really important</v>

1070
00:54:11.941 --> 00:54:16.941
<v Speaker 2>in the scientific method to like if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>design a study and you do it and you </v>

1071
00:54:16.941 --> 00:54:18.960
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find a certain result in science,</v>

1072
00:54:18.961 --> 00:54:22.560
<v Speaker 2>it's not really considered to be valid </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless I do it and,</v>

1073
00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:24.210
<v Speaker 2>and confirm your results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1074
00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:26.880
<v Speaker 2>or someone else does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's independent of you.</v>

1075
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.570
<v Speaker 2>And in a shocking number of studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this never happens.</v>

1076
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:35.630
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this group went back and looked at 100 </v>

1077
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:36.000
<v Speaker 2>psychology studies and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicate them using the,</v>

1078
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:41.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost identical conditions from the </v>

1079
00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.120
<v Speaker 2>original studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in they were only able to do that in</v>

1080
00:54:42.121 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 2>35 percent of cases there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1081
00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 2>another group looked at a precancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a clinical studies and found they could </v>

1082
00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.320
<v Speaker 2>only replicate 11 percent of those.</v>

1083
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:55.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a well known saying in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical world that,</v>

1084
00:54:55.770 --> 00:55:00.770
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like more than half of the drug trials </v>

1085
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:02.250
<v Speaker 2>can't be replicated and have a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers from Bayer,</v>

1086
00:55:02.251 --> 00:55:05.910
<v Speaker 2>from a pharmaceutical company tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that in 2011.</v>

1087
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.940
<v Speaker 2>They took a bunch of trials and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicate them less than one quarter of </v>

1088
00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.580
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were able to replicate the results.</v>

1089
00:55:11.581 --> 00:55:14.610
<v Speaker 2>So what this means is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1090
00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a study can be done,</v>

1091
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:21.890
<v Speaker 2>it's never validated and then a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other studies are done that </v>

1092
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:25.761
<v Speaker 2>refer to that study and whole fields of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific research are spawn on a study</v>

1093
00:55:27.571 --> 00:55:32.010
<v Speaker 2>that was never confirmed or validated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a house of cards built on a</v>

1094
00:55:32.011 --> 00:55:34.210
<v Speaker 2>foundation of falsehood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1095
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.490
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1096
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.030
<v Speaker 2>science is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to keep improving science,</v>

1097
00:55:39.031 --> 00:55:44.031
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that studies are performed right </v>

1098
00:55:44.031 --> 00:55:44.031
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1099
00:55:44.031 --> 00:55:44.031
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1100
00:55:44.031 --> 00:55:44.730
<v Speaker 2>it's both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1101
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.760
<v Speaker 2>conflicts of interest that are based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and it's just also human human </v>

1102
00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:54.501
<v Speaker 2>error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is it also just the overwhelming </v>

1103
00:55:54.501 --> 00:55:56.691
<v Speaker 2>number of studies that are being done </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how many people would have to be </v>

1104
00:55:56.691 --> 00:55:56.720
<v Speaker 2>there to validate all the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

1105
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:59.310
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money basically like a,</v>

1106
00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:04.311
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to some research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking to some researchers </v>

1107
00:56:04.311 --> 00:56:04.311
<v Speaker 2>about this and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1108
00:56:04.311 --> 00:56:06.750
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to be the second person to </v>
<v Speaker 2>discover something.</v>

1109
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:10.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just not as cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1110
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:15.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not as prestigious for your career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like going around replicating other </v>

1111
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 2>people's studies is not as exciting as </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing your own original verbally.</v>

1112
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1113
00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:24.450
<v Speaker 2>You're a cover band and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to get funding for it to </v>

1114
00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:24.450
<v Speaker 2>replicate studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas</v>

1115
00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 2>if you find you have an original </v>
<v Speaker 2>finding,</v>

1116
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:30.991
<v Speaker 2>especially one that's tied that </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential therapeutic use and a drug </v>

1117
00:56:30.991 --> 00:56:32.860
<v Speaker 2>that can be made out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the real money and interest</v>

1118
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:33.550
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1119
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the big problems.</v>

1120
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one is just how long studies are</v>

1121
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 2>done for like a omega,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Omega three fats.</v>

1122
00:56:44.711 --> 00:56:48.070
<v Speaker 2>We've all heard about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are good for us and you know,</v>

1123
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:52.060
<v Speaker 2>fish oil and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at studies,</v>

1124
00:56:52.061 --> 00:56:57.061
<v Speaker 2>most of those studies are really short </v>
<v Speaker 2>term and a back in the seventies or </v>

1125
00:56:57.061 --> 00:57:01.531
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some longer term studies that are were </v>

1126
00:57:01.531 --> 00:57:02.290
<v Speaker 2>like eight or 10 years we're done that </v>
<v Speaker 2>found really different results for.</v>

1127
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.470
<v Speaker 2>And what they showed is that early on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the results for one way,</v>

1128
00:57:05.471 --> 00:57:10.471
<v Speaker 2>but the longer the study went on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the results started to go back in the </v>

1129
00:57:10.471 --> 00:57:11.800
<v Speaker 2>other direction for Omega threes.</v>

1130
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We allow,</v>

1131
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:15.230
<v Speaker 2>we can come back to that in a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1132
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:20.610
<v Speaker 2>the point is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that happens in two weeks is </v>

1133
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.790
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>over four years,</v>

1134
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:26.850
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that the typical </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies are only lasts for two or three </v>

1135
00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:28.150
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're a randomized trial</v>

1136
00:57:28.151 --> 00:57:30.450
<v Speaker 2>because they're enormously expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1137
00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:35.680
<v Speaker 2>to isolate all the variables and make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that patients are not changing too </v>

1138
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.110
<v Speaker 2>many different things and are just doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intervention and to,</v>

1139
00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:43.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do everything that needs to be done </v>

1140
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:43.180
<v Speaker 2>is incredibly expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1141
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:43.180
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1142
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:48.001
<v Speaker 2>we have a whole bunch of research </v>
<v Speaker 2>findings that are based on two week </v>

1143
00:57:48.001 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 2>periods that aren't applicable to how we</v>
<v Speaker 2>live our life.</v>

1144
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:50.480
<v Speaker 3>That is also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1145
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:55.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an issue with some anecdotal reports </v>

1146
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:55.500
<v Speaker 3>that people have about changing their </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>

1147
00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:00.640
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that change </v>
<v Speaker 3>their diet and short term they feel </v>

1148
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.550
<v Speaker 3>fantastic and they started having all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these benefits.</v>

1149
00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.150
<v Speaker 3>But then over the course of maybe three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four or five years or so,</v>

1150
00:58:05.151 --> 00:58:06.680
<v Speaker 3>they started having real issues</v>

1151
00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:11.980
<v Speaker 2>and they don't necessarily tie that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Diet because they remember feeling </v>

1152
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.940
<v Speaker 2>so much better when they first switched </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1153
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:16.460
<v Speaker 2>So they don't think that what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

1154
00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.230
<v Speaker 2>what's happening three or four years </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

1155
00:58:18.231 --> 00:58:23.231
<v Speaker 2>It could be the cause of their problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see this all the time with vegetarian </v>

1156
00:58:23.231 --> 00:58:26.381
<v Speaker 2>and Vegan diets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I wanted to talk to </v>

1157
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:26.381
<v Speaker 2>you about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:29.930
<v Speaker 3>In terms of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because most people who switched to a </v>

1159
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:34.281
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian or Vegan Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see some instant </v>

1160
00:58:34.281 --> 00:58:35.130
<v Speaker 3>benefits because of the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have much more nutrient dense foods.</v>

1161
00:58:35.131 --> 00:58:36.720
<v Speaker 3>You're eating a lot of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1162
00:58:36.721 --> 00:58:41.721
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're changing your diet and a lot of </v>

1163
00:58:41.721 --> 00:58:42.150
<v Speaker 3>ways to the positive or towards a </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>

1164
00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:47.420
<v Speaker 3>away from what you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those primary foods that Americans tend </v>

1165
00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:50.841
<v Speaker 3>to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the process sugar or the just </v>

1166
00:58:50.841 --> 00:58:51.630
<v Speaker 3>nonsense and chicken tenders and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that crap that people eat,</v>

1167
00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.340
<v Speaker 3>which is just so goddamn common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1168
00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:57.120
<v Speaker 3>so automatically over that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to see some longterm benefits,</v>

1169
00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:02.540
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading is about people that have found </v>

1170
00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.840
<v Speaker 3>that over the longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lack.</v>

1171
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.930
<v Speaker 3>This is contrary to what a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

1172
00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Lack of saturated fat and cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dietary cholesterol and saturated fat </v>

1173
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.720
<v Speaker 3>leads to hormonal imbalances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leads to your body having a harder time </v>

1174
00:59:18.811 --> 00:59:23.811
<v Speaker 3>producing sex hormones and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different with your health or your body </v>

1175
00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:29.351
<v Speaker 3>almost starts robbing itself to make up </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the nutritional deficiencies of your</v>

1176
00:59:30.441 --> 00:59:30.890
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>

1177
00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1178
00:59:32.171 --> 00:59:34.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about this before,</v>

1179
00:59:34.331 --> 00:59:36.960
<v Speaker 2>but humans are animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

1180
00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:38.560
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're omnivores.</v>

1181
00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:39.620
<v Speaker 2>And wait a minute,</v>

1182
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:44.910
<v Speaker 3>I saw a video on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a guy that says there's no way </v>

1183
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:48.541
<v Speaker 3>that we're herbivores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then if we were some fucking wacky </v>

1184
00:59:48.541 --> 00:59:49.070
<v Speaker 3>dude was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're really a,</v>

1185
00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.660
<v Speaker 3>an Omnivore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to eat a squirrel.</v>

1186
00:59:52.661 --> 00:59:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Just grab it and eat it raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1187
00:59:54.521 --> 00:59:54.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1188
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:58.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was the most bizarre,</v>

1189
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.370
<v Speaker 2>some strange arguments like we shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink milk because,</v>

1190
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were the only,</v>

1191
01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:05.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1192
01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:10.620
<v Speaker 2>we're the only animal in nature in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in nature that drinks the milk of </v>

1193
01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:10.620
<v Speaker 2>another animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1194
01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Well we're the only animal nature that </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses iphones to have a whole.</v>

1195
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.660
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that.</v>

1196
01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:18.750
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Appointed people do fly planes,</v>

1197
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:23.990
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call each other on the phone and tell </v>

1198
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:23.990
<v Speaker 2>each other how awesome milk is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a ridiculous argument.</v>

1199
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.000
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1200
01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.730
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting back to,</v>

1201
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>to their ideological arguments more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific.</v>

1202
01:00:30.691 --> 01:00:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1203
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.380
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't stand up to scrutiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with,</v>

1204
01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:39.420
<v Speaker 2>with a vegetarian or Vegan Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's lots of different ways to </v>

1205
01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:42.741
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This starting with an evolutionary </v>

1206
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:42.741
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I was getting at,</v>

1207
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:44.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>omnivores or opportunistic,</v>

1208
01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.160
<v Speaker 2>they will eat whatever is available and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll eat the most nutrient dense </v>

1209
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.100
<v Speaker 2>foods that are available if they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

1210
01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:51.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1211
01:00:51.211 --> 01:00:52.560
<v Speaker 2>that's survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1212
01:00:52.561 --> 01:00:57.561
<v Speaker 2>that an animal that is able to utilize </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nutrients that are available in its </v>

1213
01:00:57.561 --> 01:01:01.671
<v Speaker 2>environment to its maximum advantage is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to survive compared to one that </v>

1214
01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:04.080
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's basic evolutionary theory.</v>

1215
01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:05.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1216
01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:09.900
<v Speaker 2>if you study traditional peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know,</v>

1217
01:01:09.901 --> 01:01:13.590
<v Speaker 2>still there's never been a traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>pe group that,</v>

1218
01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:18.690
<v Speaker 2>that has ever been identified that </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily followed a Vegan or even </v>

1219
01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:22.851
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian diet that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that should tell you something right </v>

1220
01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:23.520
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ironically,</v>

1221
01:01:23.521 --> 01:01:26.190
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you and I are even having </v>
<v Speaker 2>this conversation,</v>

1222
01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.380
<v Speaker 2>this wouldn't even be happening if </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans had not learned it's eaten meat.</v>

1223
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of anthropologists who </v>

1224
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.640
<v Speaker 2>now believe that eating meat was </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially what made us human.</v>

1225
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:43.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we came down out of the trees and we </v>

1226
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:46.431
<v Speaker 2>develop the development of tools that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could crack bones to give us access to </v>

1227
01:01:46.431 --> 01:01:50.511
<v Speaker 2>the marrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is super nutrient dense or to </v>

1228
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:53.031
<v Speaker 2>sliced meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which allowed us to be able to digest </v>

1229
01:01:53.031 --> 01:01:53.031
<v Speaker 2>the meat more quickly.</v>

1230
01:01:53.031 --> 01:01:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number one.</v>

1231
01:01:53.821 --> 01:01:58.821
<v Speaker 2>And then to the development of fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which allowed us to cook meat and </v>

1232
01:01:58.821 --> 01:02:00.360
<v Speaker 2>cooking makes the nutrients in meat more</v>
<v Speaker 2>bioavailable,</v>

1233
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:04.020
<v Speaker 2>allowed us to spend less time foraging </v>
<v Speaker 2>for food.</v>

1234
01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:09.290
<v Speaker 2>So most large primates like gorillas or </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees spend over 80 percent of </v>

1235
01:02:11.221 --> 01:02:16.221
<v Speaker 2>their day foraging for food because most</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the foods that we eat are really not </v>

1236
01:02:16.221 --> 01:02:20.870
<v Speaker 2>nutrient dense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have to eat a boatload of stuff </v>

1237
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:21.630
<v Speaker 2>and just sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chew on the plants all day to get enough</v>

1238
01:02:21.631 --> 01:02:22.990
<v Speaker 2>nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1239
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:28.100
<v Speaker 2>and so this evolutionary theory is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we learned to extract and harvest much </v>

1240
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:32.580
<v Speaker 2>more nutrient dense foods from animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fats and,</v>

1241
01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Speaker 2>and other nutrients in the meats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>organ meats.</v>

1242
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.280
<v Speaker 2>And we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could then spend a lot less of our </v>

1243
01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.501
<v Speaker 2>time going around getting food which </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed us and then develop bigger </v>

1244
01:02:42.501 --> 01:02:47.061
<v Speaker 2>brains and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become human and have this conversation </v>

1245
01:02:47.061 --> 01:02:49.230
<v Speaker 2>where we're talking about a vegetarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Vegan diets.</v>

1246
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:51.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of interesting.</v>

1247
01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:56.580
<v Speaker 3>And it's also important to differentiate</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between what you're </v>

1248
01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.091
<v Speaker 3>saying is essentially the science behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>the development of the human animal </v>

1249
01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.160
<v Speaker 3>versus the moral and ethical debates </v>
<v Speaker 3>that lead environmental and </v>

1250
01:03:05.921 --> 01:03:07.660
<v Speaker 3>environmental debates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is awesome.</v>

1251
01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:08.760
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1252
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.060
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about that too.</v>

1253
01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Which would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what influences people to </v>

1254
01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.090
<v Speaker 3>become vegetarians and vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I totally respect.</v>

1255
01:03:16.091 --> 01:03:21.091
<v Speaker 3>I understand what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is when they distort </v>

1256
01:03:21.091 --> 01:03:23.830
<v Speaker 3>the reality of the scientific findings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human animal and diet.</v>

1257
01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 3>And that's an issue with a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are vegetarians and vegans that go </v>

1258
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.240
<v Speaker 3>on about how healthy they feel and about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how awesome,</v>

1259
01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:36.241
<v Speaker 3>but they're not doing blood lipid </v>
<v Speaker 3>profiles and when they do like Sam </v>

1260
01:03:36.241 --> 01:03:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is from an ethical perspective for </v>

1261
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:42.750
<v Speaker 3>ethical reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just tried Vegan diet and his health is </v>

1262
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:46.141
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's giving real issues with his blood </v>

1263
01:03:46.141 --> 01:03:48.361
<v Speaker 3>lipids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What can someone do if they want to </v>

1264
01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:48.670
<v Speaker 3>follow that diet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

1265
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.480
<v Speaker 3>what is imperative as far as healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>fats as far as getting,</v>

1266
01:03:52.481 --> 01:03:57.481
<v Speaker 3>making sure that your body doesn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not taking in too many simple </v>

1267
01:03:57.481 --> 01:03:57.780
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>

1268
01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:02.820
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what steps need to be taken place and </v>

1269
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.010
<v Speaker 3>this is obviously not saying that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't follow a Vegan diet,</v>

1270
01:04:03.011 --> 01:04:05.260
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't follow a vegetarian diet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you do whatever you want to do,</v>

1271
01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.320
<v Speaker 3>but there's gotta be some ways to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mitigate some of the health </v>

1272
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:10.320
<v Speaker 3>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1273
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>

1274
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.021
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that I agree with you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people should be free to make their own </v>

1275
01:04:15.021 --> 01:04:16.890
<v Speaker 2>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never pushed a particular diet.</v>

1276
01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:18.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people sometimes ask me,</v>

1277
01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:20.280
<v Speaker 2>how do you convince someone to go Paleo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1278
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't spend my time doing that.</v>

1279
01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:26.190
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone wants my advice and asked me,</v>

1280
01:04:26.191 --> 01:04:28.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not going around,</v>

1281
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:33.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proselytizing for a particular way of </v>

1282
01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:33.290
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1283
01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's break this down.</v>

1284
01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:38.331
<v Speaker 2>We talked about the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument for eating animal products and </v>

1285
01:04:38.331 --> 01:04:41.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a scientific argument which now </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what we're talking about,</v>

1286
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:47.510
<v Speaker 2>the issue with [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should even kind of distinguish </v>

1287
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 2>between vegetarian and Vegan diets </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're actually quite different</v>

1288
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:54.620
<v Speaker 2>and I think it is possible for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to be healthy with a vegetarian </v>

1289
01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:01.310
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a lot less likely with a </v>

1290
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Vegan diet and I guess I would say it </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>

1291
01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have,</v>

1292
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're Vegan and you're eating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan Diet,</v>

1293
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:11.361
<v Speaker 2>you need to have a perfect vegan diet to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be healthy and you need to know what </v>

1294
01:05:11.361 --> 01:05:14.601
<v Speaker 2>you're doing in terms of supplementation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how to meet the nutrient needs that </v>

1295
01:05:14.601 --> 01:05:15.770
<v Speaker 2>aren't being met through diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

1296
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:20.900
<v Speaker 2>at least in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are very few that actually do it </v>

1297
01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:20.900
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1298
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>when it's done right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible for some people to</v>

1299
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:25.930
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be healthy and thrive.</v>

1300
01:05:25.931 --> 01:05:30.100
<v Speaker 2>And that's obvious because there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like rich roll who's out there.</v>

1301
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>He's a Vegan triathlete who's out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing centuries and killing it,</v>

1302
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:35.730
<v Speaker 2>ultra marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1303
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>he is just an amazing athlete and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan and so,</v>

1304
01:05:40.031 --> 01:05:45.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say that it's not working for </v>

1305
01:05:45.031 --> 01:05:45.480
<v Speaker 2>it and if you try to say that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

1306
01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.030
<v Speaker 2>it looks like he's 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1307
01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:49.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

1308
01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.620
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy.</v>

1309
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I've met him a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1310
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so certainly it works for some people,</v>

1311
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:59.980
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of factors that </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine whether it's gonna work.</v>

1312
01:05:59.981 --> 01:06:02.080
<v Speaker 2>So one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how well you do it.</v>

1313
01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm too is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you know,</v>

1314
01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:09.661
<v Speaker 2>what you're dealing with supplementation</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of getting the necessary </v>

1315
01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:10.000
<v Speaker 2>nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three is genetics.</v>

1316
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:15.030
<v Speaker 2>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are genetic differences that </v>

1317
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:19.501
<v Speaker 2>determine how well we convert precursor </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients into the nutrients that we </v>

1318
01:06:19.501 --> 01:06:24.031
<v Speaker 2>actually need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let me give three examples to make </v>

1319
01:06:24.031 --> 01:06:24.970
<v Speaker 2>this more real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one is EPA and Dha.</v>

1320
01:06:24.971 --> 01:06:28.390
<v Speaker 2>These are these long chain Omega three </v>
<v Speaker 2>fats that we've heard so much about that</v>

1321
01:06:28.391 --> 01:06:31.120
<v Speaker 2>are crucial for brain function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardiovascular function,</v>

1322
01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.040
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we primarily,</v>

1323
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:37.390
<v Speaker 2>you get them by eating fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There Are no sources of those in a plant</v>

1324
01:06:37.391 --> 01:06:41.590
<v Speaker 2>based diet except for algae.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1325
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:43.830
<v Speaker 2>but an lg is not the bioavailable.</v>

1326
01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many people do you know that eat</v>

1327
01:06:46.281 --> 01:06:48.050
<v Speaker 2>algae?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

1328
01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

1329
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:55.020
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that famous green </v>

1330
01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:55.020
<v Speaker 2>supplementation stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

1331
01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.470
<v Speaker 2>You can use it as a supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very few people are eating it.</v>

1332
01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.910
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1333
01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:03.040
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is something called alpha </v>

1334
01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:03.040
<v Speaker 2>linolenic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in walnuts and flax seed.</v>

1335
01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:07.681
<v Speaker 2>That's an omega three plant fat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans in theory can convert some of </v>

1336
01:07:07.871 --> 01:07:12.850
<v Speaker 2>that plant based omega three into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>long chain epa and dha that we need.</v>

1337
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.500
<v Speaker 2>But the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

1338
01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.420
<v Speaker 2>only about five to 10 percent of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets converted into epa and even less to</v>

1339
01:07:19.421 --> 01:07:21.070
<v Speaker 2>dha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two to five percent.</v>

1340
01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:26.130
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be chugging tablespoons </v>
<v Speaker 2>of flax oil in order to get as much epa </v>

1341
01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:29.980
<v Speaker 2>or dha that you would get from eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a little bit of fish.</v>

1342
01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:35.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's if everything is going well </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you have deficiency of any </v>

1343
01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:39.541
<v Speaker 2>nutrients that are involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enzymatic conversion of those plant </v>

1344
01:07:39.541 --> 01:07:42.010
<v Speaker 2>based fats into the long chain fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you won't make those conversions at</v>

1345
01:07:42.011 --> 01:07:42.970
<v Speaker 2>that optimal rate.</v>

1346
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:47.970
<v Speaker 2>IT'll be even less and ironically many </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those nutrients and nutrients that </v>

1347
01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:50.530
<v Speaker 2>are not well represented in a vegan or </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian diet.</v>

1348
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's one example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another would be vitamin k two,</v>

1349
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:55.070
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1350
01:07:55.370 --> 01:08:00.040
<v Speaker 2>a different form of vitamin k that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently been discovered and it's really</v>

1351
01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 2>important for cardiovascular and bone </v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

1352
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:06.040
<v Speaker 2>It basically puts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that calcium gets in our bones</v>

1353
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:09.220
<v Speaker 2>and our teeth and our heart tissues </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it belongs and keeps it out of the</v>

1354
01:08:09.221 --> 01:08:14.221
<v Speaker 2>soft tissues like our arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where calcium would make our arteries </v>

1355
01:08:14.221 --> 01:08:14.770
<v Speaker 2>heart and increase the risk of a heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>

1356
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:20.440
<v Speaker 2>So I'm two is only really in animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods with the exception of some </v>

1357
01:08:21.081 --> 01:08:26.081
<v Speaker 2>fermented foods like natto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a japanese fermented soybean </v>

1358
01:08:26.081 --> 01:08:28.540
<v Speaker 2>product that most people cannot stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1359
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a strong taste.</v>

1360
01:08:30.081 --> 01:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Not very many people are eating it here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kefir and,</v>

1361
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.410
<v Speaker 2>and sauerkraut and kimchi.</v>

1362
01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 2>You have k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>k,</v>

1363
01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:38.040
<v Speaker 2>two in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could fear.</v>

1364
01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:43.050
<v Speaker 2>I've been dot kiefer my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I've never heard it sets how </v>

1365
01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:46.670
<v Speaker 2>they say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where firas from every other person I've</v>

1366
01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:48.440
<v Speaker 2>ever met so says key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't worry about it.</v>

1367
01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying kaffir from now,</v>

1368
01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:55.820
<v Speaker 2>ari shaffir fear you'll be in the select</v>
<v Speaker 2>few that know how to feel good about it </v>

1369
01:08:57.231 --> 01:08:59.990
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

1370
01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:04.991
<v Speaker 2>you can feel superior now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I stop you real quick just because </v>

1371
01:09:04.991 --> 01:09:08.630
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna want to get a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto this track of what you were </v>

1372
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:13.061
<v Speaker 2>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fish oil conversion and the difference </v>

1373
01:09:13.061 --> 01:09:17.471
<v Speaker 2>between flax seed oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What convenience take in order to sort </v>

1374
01:09:17.471 --> 01:09:22.061
<v Speaker 2>of recommend that vegans take micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>algae because it has preformed dha in </v>

1375
01:09:22.761 --> 01:09:27.761
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you bypass that whole conversion </v>

1376
01:09:27.761 --> 01:09:28.100
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they do take micro algae,</v>

1377
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 2>is that sufficient or how much different</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that than eating fish?</v>

1378
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite different because fish have a</v>

1379
01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:38.360
<v Speaker 2>lot of other nutrients aside from epa </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dha team,</v>

1380
01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.390
<v Speaker 2>they have salinium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1381
01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.470
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of other bioavailable </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients.</v>

1382
01:09:42.471 --> 01:09:43.160
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1383
01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.180
<v Speaker 2>and the other disadvantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to take a boatload of,</v>

1384
01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:51.270
<v Speaker 2>of algae.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boatload give me a call.</v>

1385
01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I think so there are different products </v>
<v Speaker 2>have different amounts.</v>

1386
01:09:54.831 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1387
01:09:56.211 --> 01:10:01.211
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd have to take six to nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>caps capsules a day of the average algae</v>

1388
01:10:02.451 --> 01:10:05.370
<v Speaker 2>supplement in order to meet your dha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not bad.</v>

1389
01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:09.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely possible,</v>

1390
01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:12.680
<v Speaker 2>but that would be a good way to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy with the vegan diet.</v>

1391
01:10:12.681 --> 01:10:17.681
<v Speaker 2>That would be one way to address the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shortcoming of know of lack of dha on </v>

1392
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:20.120
<v Speaker 2>the vegan diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are other shortcomings,</v>

1393
01:10:20.121 --> 01:10:23.350
<v Speaker 2>other nutrients like b 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are shoe.</v>

1394
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a big issue and vegans need to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplementing with that.</v>

1395
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:32.620
<v Speaker 2>TheRe's a myth out there that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>some plant sources of b12 like seaweed </v>

1396
01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.750
<v Speaker 2>and in spirit like spirulina and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutritional yeast,</v>

1397
01:10:35.751 --> 01:10:40.390
<v Speaker 2>but those actually contain a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>phony forms of b 12 that,</v>

1398
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:44.540
<v Speaker 2>that can block the absorption of true </v>
<v Speaker 2>b12,</v>

1399
01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.930
<v Speaker 2>which is only found in animal products </v>
<v Speaker 2>or supplements.</v>

1400
01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:51.140
<v Speaker 2>So a 12 supplement would be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important as well.</v>

1401
01:10:51.141 --> 01:10:54.560
<v Speaker 2>It's the source of a b 12 supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1402
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.750
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's synthetic,</v>

1403
01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.420
<v Speaker 2>it's synthetic I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just,</v>

1404
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 2>there's three forms of be 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1405
01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:05.480
<v Speaker 2>there's hydroxocobalamin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>methylcobalamin or,</v>

1406
01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:10.650
<v Speaker 2>or four forms that you can supplement </v>
<v Speaker 2>with cyanocobalamin and </v>

1407
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:13.100
<v Speaker 2>adenosylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a synthetic form.</v>

1408
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.290
<v Speaker 2>And then the other ones are natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of b,</v>

1409
01:11:15.291 --> 01:11:20.291
<v Speaker 2>12 that you would encounter in food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people can supplement with any of </v>

1410
01:11:20.291 --> 01:11:21.450
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the natural forms,</v>

1411
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 2>they're better to supplement with </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're more bioavailable.</v>

1412
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:31.010
<v Speaker 2>But definitely if a vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend supplementing with b </v>

1413
01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:32.790
<v Speaker 2>12 because there aren't any sources of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in the diet.</v>

1414
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:37.170
<v Speaker 2>And studies have shown that 68 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of vegetarians are deficient in b,</v>

1415
01:11:37.171 --> 01:11:42.171
<v Speaker 2>12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 three percent of vegans are versus </v>

1416
01:11:42.171 --> 01:11:42.171
<v Speaker 2>just five percent of omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1417
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not,</v>

1418
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:46.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a factor in,</v>

1419
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.250
<v Speaker 2>in many different issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1420
01:11:47.251 --> 01:11:49.770
<v Speaker 2>It's A factor in the production of </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle,</v>

1421
01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all production of all red blood cells </v>

1422
01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.000
<v Speaker 2>depends on [inaudible] and full eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I mean that's pretty fundamental,</v>

1423
01:11:57.001 --> 01:12:02.001
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the myelin sheath requires be </v>

1424
01:12:02.001 --> 01:12:02.001
<v Speaker 2>12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why b,</v>

1425
01:12:02.001 --> 01:12:06.020
<v Speaker 2>12 deficiency can mimic the signs of </v>
<v Speaker 2>parkinson's or alzheimer's to these </v>

1426
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.110
<v Speaker 2>people who are aging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>B,</v>

1427
01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:11.650
<v Speaker 2>12 deficiency happens in elderly people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because they're on a vegan diet beat</v>

1428
01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:16.690
<v Speaker 2>because they have low stomach acid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't absorb the b12 as well as we </v>

1429
01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:20.841
<v Speaker 2>do when we're younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of people who are elderly </v>

1430
01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:22.230
<v Speaker 2>who have symptoms of parkinson's or </v>
<v Speaker 2>alzheimer's,</v>

1431
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:27.560
<v Speaker 2>they can sometimes be misdiagnosed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these conditions when they're actually </v>

1432
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:27.560
<v Speaker 2>just be 12 deficient.</v>

1433
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.060
<v Speaker 2>So it's a series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real,</v>

1434
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.600
<v Speaker 2>really important nutrient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1435
01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:35.601
<v Speaker 2>how can a vegans be assured that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] that they're buying does not</v>

1436
01:12:35.761 --> 01:12:38.510
<v Speaker 2>have a animal products?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1437
01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:43.670
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they have betweeN when you bind the </v>

1438
01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:43.670
<v Speaker 2>supplement fat typically it's usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>

1439
01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1440
01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the best person to ask about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because I'm,</v>

1441
01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a vegan myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a macrobiotic vegan at one point.</v>

1442
01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:51.900
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

1443
01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:55.920
<v Speaker 2>That's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a macrame.</v>

1444
01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Macrobiotics is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a whole nother system of way of </v>

1445
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.970
<v Speaker 2>looking at food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a job,</v>

1446
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:03.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>japanese,</v>

1447
01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:06.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach and um,</v>

1448
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:11.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole reason I came to do what I'm </v>

1449
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.750
<v Speaker 2>doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I goT really,</v>

1450
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:15.330
<v Speaker 2>really sick in my twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost died and I spent about 10 years</v>

1451
01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.690
<v Speaker 2>just trying to get back to health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did you pick from?</v>

1452
01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:22.200
<v Speaker 2>I was in Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned earlier,</v>

1453
01:13:22.201 --> 01:13:27.201
<v Speaker 2>I'd traveled around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was surfing and I got the classic </v>

1454
01:13:27.201 --> 01:13:28.770
<v Speaker 2>tropical illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like immediate dysentery,</v>

1455
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.800
<v Speaker 2>giardia and blast assistance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hominis so to parasites and an amoeba </v>

1456
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.260
<v Speaker 2>and was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1457
01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.500
<v Speaker 2>coming out of both ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>delirious,</v>

1458
01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 2>didn't remember really anything for </v>
<v Speaker 2>three days.</v>

1459
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>luckily there was one other australian </v>

1460
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.381
<v Speaker 2>guy in the village that I was in who had</v>
<v Speaker 2>some antibiotics and this medical kit </v>

1461
01:13:48.381 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 2>that kind of brought me back from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brink,</v>

1462
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:55.070
<v Speaker 2>but between the parasites and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple rounds of antibiotics I had to </v>

1463
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Speaker 2>take to get rid of the parasites after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1464
01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.320
<v Speaker 2>it just wreaked havoc on my gut and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>took me basically 10 years to recover.</v>

1465
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years.</v>

1466
01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:09.410
<v Speaker 2>It was like the last decade when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>at 10 years because you approached it </v>

1467
01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>incorrectly and you could do it now or </v>
<v Speaker 2>was</v>

1468
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.890
<v Speaker 1>it just such a devastating round of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease?</v>

1469
01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I think a little of both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm 42 now and I was 25 when this</v>

1470
01:14:19.991 --> 01:14:24.991
<v Speaker 2>first happened and we didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about the gut and the </v>

1471
01:14:24.991 --> 01:14:29.101
<v Speaker 2>microbiome compared to what we know now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was very little awareness on </v>

1472
01:14:29.101 --> 01:14:29.740
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1473
01:14:29.741 --> 01:14:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Just in 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1474
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:32.160
<v Speaker 2>or 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1475
01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.600
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1476
01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:37.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Took way more antibiotics than I would</v>

1477
01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:42.290
<v Speaker 2>have done in retrospect because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the doctors were prescribing and </v>

1478
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.610
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1479
01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:44.580
<v Speaker 2>you've got these parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to get rid of them.</v>

1480
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:49.630
<v Speaker 2>This is how you do it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the antibiotics if could </v>

1481
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:54.200
<v Speaker 2>have been like the treatment was </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably worse than the disease for me </v>

1482
01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:54.200
<v Speaker 2>at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1483
01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.960
<v Speaker 2>after the number of courses of </v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics that I took.</v>

1484
01:14:56.830 --> 01:15:01.830
<v Speaker 2>So along that path I tried to spell </v>
<v Speaker 2>everY special diet you can possibly </v>

1485
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:06.220
<v Speaker 2>imagine including becoming a vegetarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a vegan and then a macrobiotic vegan</v>

1486
01:15:06.221 --> 01:15:07.420
<v Speaker 2>and raw food vegan.</v>

1487
01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:11.050
<v Speaker 2>I've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>done that and I'm.</v>

1488
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:13.900
<v Speaker 2>so I'm completely sympathetic like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1489
01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.410
<v Speaker 2>And I'm also a longtime meditater in </v>
<v Speaker 2>buddhist.</v>

1490
01:15:17.411 --> 01:15:20.080
<v Speaker 2>So I understand the ethical argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

1491
01:15:20.081 --> 01:15:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Many of my friends don't eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sympathetic and I'm,</v>

1492
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care about the environment.</v>

1493
01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm sympathetic to that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not,</v>

1494
01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:34.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming to this from a place of I </v>

1495
01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:34.560
<v Speaker 2>think a pretty balanced viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1496
01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:37.630
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1497
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:44.100
<v Speaker 2>the issues for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I eventually brought </v>

1498
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.120
<v Speaker 2>animal products back into my diet was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

1499
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became clear that I needed to do that</v>

1500
01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:53.881
<v Speaker 2>for my own health and I was able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reach a level of understanding and a </v>

1501
01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:59.170
<v Speaker 2>about the moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical and environmental choices that I</v>

1502
01:15:59.171 --> 01:16:00.460
<v Speaker 2>was making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1503
01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.870
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I felt good about.</v>

1504
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Sam has brought up mollusks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying that one option that </v>

1505
01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:13.141
<v Speaker 1>vegans might want to consider is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mollusks and that mollusks mollusks </v>

1506
01:16:13.141 --> 01:16:16.240
<v Speaker 1>mollusks what a weird word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clams,</v>

1507
01:16:16.241 --> 01:16:21.241
<v Speaker 1>mussels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things along those lines are so </v>

1508
01:16:21.241 --> 01:16:23.251
<v Speaker 1>primitive that the argument can be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>that although they have movement where </v>

1509
01:16:23.251 --> 01:16:26.620
<v Speaker 1>they open and close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they lacked pain sensors.</v>

1510
01:16:26.621 --> 01:16:29.890
<v Speaker 1>They lack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fundamental things that make us</v>

1511
01:16:29.891 --> 01:16:34.891
<v Speaker 1>distinguish the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and plant life and that people </v>

1512
01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:39.100
<v Speaker 1>might want to consider the consumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mollusks same way they consider it.</v>

1513
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:44.770
<v Speaker 1>People eat mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms which are in a vegan diet or </v>

1514
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:47.500
<v Speaker 1>healthy or closer to an animal than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are to a plant.</v>

1515
01:16:47.501 --> 01:16:52.501
<v Speaker 1>They actually take in oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They breathe out carbon dioxide and </v>

1516
01:16:52.501 --> 01:16:57.060
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally they reSemble living </v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms that we consider like animals </v>

1517
01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:00.130
<v Speaker 1>more than they consider plants more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they resemble places.</v>

1518
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Really</v>

1519
01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:01.920
<v Speaker 2>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it starts,</v>

1520
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:06.270
<v Speaker 2>the lines start to get blurry because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that some plants,</v>

1521
01:17:06.271 --> 01:17:11.271
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they recognize that they're being </v>

1522
01:17:11.271 --> 01:17:13.191
<v Speaker 2>eaten by a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they secrete toxins to protect </v>

1523
01:17:13.191 --> 01:17:13.191
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1524
01:17:13.191 --> 01:17:15.510
<v Speaker 3>not just recognize that they're being </v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten,</v>

1525
01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:20.690
<v Speaker 3>but they've played recordings of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>caterpillar eating a plant next to a </v>

1526
01:17:20.821 --> 01:17:25.770
<v Speaker 3>plant and it's changed the actual taste </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the leaves to the point where animals</v>

1527
01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:29.550
<v Speaker 3>find them disgusting and it causes some </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals to starve to death.</v>

1528
01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Not some level of awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1529
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:35.760
<v Speaker 2>you may not call that intelligence or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctions,</v>

1530
01:17:35.761 --> 01:17:36.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1531
01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.320
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference there between um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mollusk for example,</v>

1532
01:17:40.321 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like you described blAcks,</v>

1533
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:47.270
<v Speaker 2>pain sensors and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should we be prioritizing in that </v>

1534
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:51.741
<v Speaker 2>situation if we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're using an ethical argument </v>

1535
01:17:51.741 --> 01:17:54.300
<v Speaker 2>against eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's even thornier issue,</v>

1536
01:17:54.301 --> 01:17:59.301
<v Speaker 2>which is there's no system of food </v>
<v Speaker 2>production that does not involve the </v>

1537
01:17:59.301 --> 01:18:01.080
<v Speaker 2>death of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and.</v>

1538
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:04.590
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about monocropping big,</v>

1539
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.120
<v Speaker 2>you know tiller with blades going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through these fields,</v>

1540
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:11.250
<v Speaker 2>you're killing vols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're killing rabbits,</v>

1541
01:18:11.251 --> 01:18:16.251
<v Speaker 2>you're killing snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're killing all kinds of small </v>

1542
01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:19.730
<v Speaker 2>animals and is the value of a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal life less than the value of a </v>

1543
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:24.411
<v Speaker 2>large animal life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some philosophers or people who look at </v>

1544
01:18:24.411 --> 01:18:28.371
<v Speaker 2>this morally have actually argued that </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing a larger before like a cow that </v>

1545
01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:32.370
<v Speaker 2>can feed many people is superior </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically or morally.</v>

1546
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Then you know a method of food </v>
<v Speaker 2>production that kills many small animals</v>

1547
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.890
<v Speaker 2>in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1548
01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.930
<v Speaker 2>and won't feed as many people can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People treat density per.</v>

1549
01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Don't like to look at that</v>

1550
01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:47.980
<v Speaker 3>because it's inconvenient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have friends that I have a good </v>

1551
01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:50.861
<v Speaker 3>buddy of mine who has a farm in Iowa and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says when they run the combines over </v>

1552
01:18:50.861 --> 01:18:53.660
<v Speaker 3>corn and grain and chopped down all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things that they grow.</v>

1553
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:57.890
<v Speaker 3>You'll see vultures and crows and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things circling the fields because</v>

1554
01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:00.950
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of animals that get </v>
<v Speaker 3>chewed up in that process.</v>

1555
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:06.010
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more animals get chewed up to create a </v>

1556
01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:08.780
<v Speaker 3>pound of grain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like more animals,</v>

1557
01:19:08.781 --> 01:19:10.780
<v Speaker 3>more more insects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1558
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean when insects are animals by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1559
01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:18.930
<v Speaker 3>there are a life form and more different</v>
<v Speaker 3>things get chewed up in creating that </v>

1560
01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.180
<v Speaker 3>then would be if you've got a pound of </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>

1561
01:19:23.181 --> 01:19:26.910
<v Speaker 3>because as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one cow could to consolidate.</v>

1562
01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:29.790
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people consume it over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>course of a year and</v>

1563
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:34.790
<v Speaker 2>the nutrient density is far superior to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pound of grains or even an equivalent </v>

1564
01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:35.970
<v Speaker 2>amount of weight</v>

1565
01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.760
<v Speaker 3>grains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you don't hear that argument.</v>

1566
01:19:37.761 --> 01:19:41.510
<v Speaker 3>You hear the opposite argument where a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cow consumes so much grass,</v>

1567
01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:44.090
<v Speaker 3>it needs so much land to graze and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

1568
01:19:44.091 --> 01:19:45.890
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately it's actually been </v>
<v Speaker 3>distorted.</v>

1569
01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.450
<v Speaker 3>I had some guys on from the documentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>cowspiracy,</v>

1570
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:53.480
<v Speaker 3>which I don't think they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally trying to deceive.</v>

1571
01:19:53.481 --> 01:19:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I think they're really good guys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're making,</v>

1572
01:19:55.620 --> 01:20:00.620
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think they're making a really good </v>

1573
01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.591
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you talk to ranchers and you </v>

1574
01:20:02.591 --> 01:20:04.100
<v Speaker 3>get the actual number of how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>acreage it takes to feed a cow,</v>

1575
01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:05.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not as much as they thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1576
01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:07.860
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1577
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:09.260
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1578
01:20:09.261 --> 01:20:14.261
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the interest to ethical argument is </v>

1579
01:20:14.261 --> 01:20:14.261
<v Speaker 4>really interesting too for all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons,</v>

1580
01:20:14.261 --> 01:20:16.080
<v Speaker 4>but then you think about the method of </v>
<v Speaker 4>death,</v>

1581
01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:19.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's take like a,</v>

1582
01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:24.810
<v Speaker 4>a humane slaughterhouse where there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of care and consideration that goes </v>

1583
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:28.611
<v Speaker 4>into how the animals last moments are </v>
<v Speaker 4>and how they actually slaughter the </v>

1584
01:20:28.681 --> 01:20:33.681
<v Speaker 4>animals so that it's painless and quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can hear the vegans going crazy right </v>

1585
01:20:33.681 --> 01:20:33.900
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is jumbo shrimp.</v>

1586
01:20:33.901 --> 01:20:37.360
<v Speaker 4>This is military intelligence is versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see this,</v>

1587
01:20:37.361 --> 01:20:42.361
<v Speaker 4>this combine that goes through the field</v>
<v Speaker 4>decapitates the mother vole and her </v>

1588
01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:47.810
<v Speaker 4>babies in the nest die of starvation </v>
<v Speaker 4>because their mother is not able to </v>

1589
01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:49.080
<v Speaker 4>provide food for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

1590
01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:52.980
<v Speaker 4>that's a arguably worse way for an </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal to die.</v>

1591
01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.160
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or even any of your rancher friends know</v>

1592
01:20:56.161 --> 01:20:57.450
<v Speaker 4>what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1593
01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.450
<v Speaker 4>they found one of their animals that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been killed by a predator.</v>

1594
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:05.870
<v Speaker 4>And if you go on youtube and watch how </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a hyena kill an animal to animal </v>

1595
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:07.600
<v Speaker 4>will still be alive while it's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>disemboweled yeah,</v>

1596
01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:09.670
<v Speaker 4>that's not a very nice way to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1597
01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:12.360
<v Speaker 4>And that's what wolves will do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I mean,</v>

1598
01:21:12.361 --> 01:21:13.950
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a giant issue.</v>

1599
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:19.250
<v Speaker 4>The difference between the way a </v>
<v Speaker 4>predator kill something in the way a </v>

1600
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.250
<v Speaker 4>person does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on the other hand,</v>

1601
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:22.560
<v Speaker 4>of course it's impossible to deny the </v>
<v Speaker 4>real issues with factory farming and the</v>

1602
01:21:22.561 --> 01:21:26.180
<v Speaker 4>inhumane methods that are so common when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're buying these chicken nuggets.</v>

1603
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:31.340
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you these are not ethically </v>
<v Speaker 4>sourced ethically and humanely raised </v>

1604
01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:35.871
<v Speaker 4>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just not and know when you're </v>

1605
01:21:35.871 --> 01:21:37.050
<v Speaker 4>driving on the highway and you see those</v>
<v Speaker 4>trucks that are stuffed full of chickens</v>

1606
01:21:37.051 --> 01:21:42.051
<v Speaker 4>and the chickens literally the little </v>
<v Speaker 4>faces or poking out of the side of the </v>

1607
01:21:42.051 --> 01:21:42.051
<v Speaker 4>truck that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1608
01:21:42.051 --> 01:21:44.850
<v Speaker 4>that is in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bigger issue.</v>

1609
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>

1610
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interestingly enough,</v>

1611
01:21:47.911 --> 01:21:52.911
<v Speaker 4>this is something where I think I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>more in common with vegans than I do </v>

1612
01:21:52.911 --> 01:21:56.310
<v Speaker 4>with like the average person is we both </v>
<v Speaker 4>care about how food is produced.</v>

1613
01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.560
<v Speaker 4>We care about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1614
01:21:58.561 --> 01:22:01.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't eat factory farmed meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't eat factory farmed vegetables.</v>

1615
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:03.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

1616
01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:07.770
<v Speaker 4>I try to eat meat that's from local,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from local farmer.</v>

1617
01:22:07.771 --> 01:22:10.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm lucky that where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's accessible.</v>

1618
01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:13.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I buy produce from the farmers market,</v>

1619
01:22:13.381 --> 01:22:16.290
<v Speaker 4>we grow a lot of produce in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>backyard.</v>

1620
01:22:16.730 --> 01:22:21.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this whole food system that needs </v>

1621
01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:24.561
<v Speaker 4>to change both in terms of conventional </v>
<v Speaker 4>agriculture and the monocropping of </v>

1622
01:22:24.561 --> 01:22:24.990
<v Speaker 4>wheat and corn and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1623
01:22:24.991 --> 01:22:28.920
<v Speaker 4>and these kinds of and soybeans and </v>
<v Speaker 4>plant foods,</v>

1624
01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:31.440
<v Speaker 4>but also the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1625
01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:34.080
<v Speaker 4>mass production,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conventional,</v>

1626
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.200
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a animal operations need to change as </v>

1627
01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.980
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not arguing for that.</v>

1628
01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:45.060
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's absolutely a losing </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument,</v>

1629
01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:50.800
<v Speaker 4>but there is a lot of land that two </v>
<v Speaker 4>thirds of the surface land in this in </v>

1630
01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.680
<v Speaker 4>the world is not suitable for crop </v>
<v Speaker 4>production and we,</v>

1631
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:56.360
<v Speaker 4>but it is suitable for raising animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1632
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.700
<v Speaker 4>and if those animals are raised in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sustainable way,</v>

1633
01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:00.930
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1634
01:23:00.931 --> 01:23:03.360
<v Speaker 4>I think it is possible to feed the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

1635
01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:08.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not the amount of animal products </v>

1636
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 4>that the average american is eating now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1637
01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can utilize the available land in a </v>

1638
01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.540
<v Speaker 4>much smarter way to produce nutrient </v>
<v Speaker 4>dense foods.</v>

1639
01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.260
<v Speaker 4>And we just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1640
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.330
<v Speaker 4>we need to consider the whole cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we,</v>

1641
01:23:20.331 --> 01:23:23.920
<v Speaker 4>we like to remove ourselves from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cycle of life and from nature.</v>

1642
01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:26.740
<v Speaker 4>We're not animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're humans or separate from it.</v>

1643
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:30.550
<v Speaker 4>But when you consider that whole cycle </v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you consider like the soil,</v>

1644
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:35.551
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think you think of it as a bank </v>

1645
01:23:35.551 --> 01:23:35.551
<v Speaker 4>account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you plant crops,</v>

1646
01:23:35.551 --> 01:23:40.350
<v Speaker 4>you're withdrawing from that bank </v>
<v Speaker 4>account and if you want the soil to be </v>

1647
01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:41.800
<v Speaker 4>healthy and continue to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>support life,</v>

1648
01:23:41.801 --> 01:23:43.030
<v Speaker 4>you need to put input.</v>

1649
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.370
<v Speaker 4>You need To make a deposit back in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>bank account.</v>

1650
01:23:45.371 --> 01:23:48.100
<v Speaker 4>And the way we've been doing that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>conventional agriculture is with,</v>

1651
01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:52.270
<v Speaker 4>is with chemicals and thOse chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>fertilizers,</v>

1652
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:54.670
<v Speaker 4>they do kind of make a deposit in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1653
01:23:54.671 --> 01:23:59.671
<v Speaker 4>but they also make it less the soil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less able to sequester carbon.</v>

1654
01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:05.101
<v Speaker 4>They cause all kinds of problems with </v>
<v Speaker 4>runoff and gi toxicity and water and </v>

1655
01:24:05.101 --> 01:24:07.220
<v Speaker 4>local watershed systems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1656
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:12.330
<v Speaker 4>and any organic farmer will tell you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the best way to add those inputs </v>

1657
01:24:12.330 --> 01:24:15.190
<v Speaker 4>back in is the poop of animals along </v>
<v Speaker 4>with their blood and their bone.</v>

1658
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:20.170
<v Speaker 4>And so that's that cycle of life where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the animal inputs go into the soil.</v>

1659
01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Those inputs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1660
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:25.000
<v Speaker 4>the urine adds water to the soil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the poop ads,</v>

1661
01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:30.090
<v Speaker 4>microorganisms that help the soil </v>
<v Speaker 4>sequester carbon so that studies have </v>

1662
01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:34.771
<v Speaker 4>shown that pasture raised animals are </v>
<v Speaker 4>either net neutral in terms of carbon </v>

1663
01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:38.140
<v Speaker 4>out put her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually even help sequester carbon</v>

1664
01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:43.380
<v Speaker 4>so you could even argue that raising </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals and eating animals is necessary </v>

1665
01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.760
<v Speaker 4>for the benefit of our soils and our </v>
<v Speaker 4>ecosystems in general yet,</v>

1666
01:24:47.761 --> 01:24:50.200
<v Speaker 4>so if someone has has a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a large,</v>

1667
01:24:50.201 --> 01:24:53.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 acre plot of land and the using it to</v>

1668
01:24:53.771 --> 01:24:57.880
<v Speaker 4>grow alfalfa or something that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat or soybeans or something along those</v>

1669
01:24:57.881 --> 01:24:58.210
<v Speaker 4>lines.</v>

1670
01:24:58.690 --> 01:25:03.690
<v Speaker 4>If they're not in some way contributing </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of animal product to that </v>

1671
01:25:04.541 --> 01:25:09.541
<v Speaker 4>soil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the soil is going to become </v>

1672
01:25:09.541 --> 01:25:11.761
<v Speaker 4>nutritionally deficient and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who eat the plants that come out </v>

1673
01:25:11.761 --> 01:25:14.260
<v Speaker 4>of that soil are going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutritionally deficient.</v>

1674
01:25:14.261 --> 01:25:19.261
<v Speaker 4>Plants minerally deficient in particular</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's a giant issue with the United </v>

1675
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:21.760
<v Speaker 4>States farmlands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a booklet.</v>

1676
01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:26.780
<v Speaker 4>It's received a lot of criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it brings up some interesting </v>

1677
01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:26.780
<v Speaker 4>points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called dead doctors don't lie.</v>

1678
01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:31.640
<v Speaker 4>It's this guy dr joel wallach and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of is the things that he said have been </v>

1679
01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:36.570
<v Speaker 4>rightly criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what's interesting about what he's </v>

1680
01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:39.691
<v Speaker 4>saying is when he's talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>minerally deficient plants and soil and </v>

1681
01:25:39.691 --> 01:25:41.520
<v Speaker 4>that the United States is known,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1682
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:45.760
<v Speaker 4>when they've done studies on farm lands </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the 19 thirties and forties,</v>

1683
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:48.970
<v Speaker 4>that there was an issue with mineral </v>
<v Speaker 4>deficiency and so,</v>

1684
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:54.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where they started adding </v>

1685
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.610
<v Speaker 4>nitrogen and from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the hopper method,</v>

1686
01:25:54.611 --> 01:25:55.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1687
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.880
<v Speaker 4>into soil and it helps and you can grow </v>
<v Speaker 4>crops,</v>

1688
01:25:57.881 --> 01:26:02.881
<v Speaker 4>but the difference between the food that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting that is grown with </v>

1689
01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:08.650
<v Speaker 4>chemical fertilizers that address sOme </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the issues that you're talking abouT </v>

1690
01:26:08.650 --> 01:26:12.821
<v Speaker 4>versus the traditional method of compost</v>
<v Speaker 4>and manure and animal products.</v>

1691
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 4>Like you're getting away healthier plant</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you're consuming it,</v>

1692
01:26:18.081 --> 01:26:20.570
<v Speaker 4>you're getting a far more nutrient dense</v>
<v Speaker 4>plant.</v>

1693
01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:25.630
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to mention the environmental </v>

1694
01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:25.780
<v Speaker 4>implications of chemical fertilizers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pesticides,</v>

1695
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:30.850
<v Speaker 4>I know dial got bone cancer because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>grew up next to a golf course and the </v>

1696
01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:36.940
<v Speaker 4>pesticides and all the shit that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would pump onto thE golf course to keeP </v>

1697
01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:40.301
<v Speaker 4>the weeds from growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got into the well system And a bunch of </v>

1698
01:26:40.301 --> 01:26:41.960
<v Speaker 4>people in this community like a huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount got cancer,</v>

1699
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:46.990
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to go back to something you were </v>

1700
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:46.990
<v Speaker 4>saying about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1701
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:50.210
<v Speaker 4>vegans and vegetarians anD how to kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of optimize if you're doing that diet.</v>

1702
01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:51.360
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1703
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.680
<v Speaker 4>two things that I wanted to address.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One was you asked about mollusks and </v>

1704
01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:00.351
<v Speaker 4>that I've actually argued that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetarian diet with shellfish and organ</v>

1705
01:27:00.531 --> 01:27:05.531
<v Speaker 4>meats would be better than a paleo diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>with no shellfish and organ meats.</v>

1706
01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:11.170
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's Because what we talked about </v>

1707
01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:11.170
<v Speaker 4>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>muscle meats,</v>

1708
01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:15.700
<v Speaker 4>organ meats and shellfish are the two </v>
<v Speaker 4>most nutrient dense classes of foods.</v>

1709
01:27:15.801 --> 01:27:20.801
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just been finishing the curriculum </v>

1710
01:27:20.801 --> 01:27:24.431
<v Speaker 4>for my clinician training program where </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going through systematically every </v>

1711
01:27:24.981 --> 01:27:29.540
<v Speaker 4>nutrient and I'm looking at in nutrition</v>
<v Speaker 4>data what the most,</v>

1712
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:31.910
<v Speaker 4>the highest food sources for those </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrients are.</v>

1713
01:27:31.911 --> 01:27:36.911
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I had the thing to just lay it </v>

1714
01:27:36.911 --> 01:27:36.911
<v Speaker 4>out and show you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1715
01:27:36.911 --> 01:27:39.950
<v Speaker 4>in almost every case it's an organ meat </v>
<v Speaker 4>or a shellfish.</v>

1716
01:27:39.951 --> 01:27:44.951
<v Speaker 4>that's the highest source of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether you're talking about 12 or iron </v>

1717
01:27:44.951 --> 01:27:47.810
<v Speaker 4>or copper or zinc or full eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always beef,</v>

1718
01:27:47.811 --> 01:27:48.590
<v Speaker 4>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chicken,</v>

1719
01:27:48.591 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 4>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clams,</v>

1720
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:51.260
<v Speaker 4>oysters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

1721
01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:56.680
<v Speaker 4>And so if someone was a veggie </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetarian who was willing to fudge a </v>

1722
01:27:56.721 --> 01:27:59.480
<v Speaker 4>little bit and eat organ meats and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shellfish,</v>

1723
01:27:59.750 --> 01:28:04.750
<v Speaker 4>I think that would be a healthier </v>
<v Speaker 4>approach than someone who's just eating </v>

1724
01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:04.750
<v Speaker 4>lean muscle.</v>

1725
01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:04.960
<v Speaker 4>Neat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1726
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:07.730
<v Speaker 4>organs get tossed out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a really.</v>

1727
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:13.120
<v Speaker 4>It's a real problem in the hunting world</v>
<v Speaker 4>where when people got an animal,</v>

1728
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:18.580
<v Speaker 4>they leave the gut pile and there's even</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gutless method that a lot of people </v>

1729
01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:18.580
<v Speaker 4>use when they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1730
01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:22.160
<v Speaker 4>they take on a big game animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an elk or something like that.</v>

1731
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.960
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they leave it behind.</v>

1732
01:28:23.961 --> 01:28:25.430
<v Speaker 4>They leave the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they leave the liver.</v>

1733
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:30.850
<v Speaker 4>But I saw this documentary on wolves and</v>
<v Speaker 4>was really fascinating was one of the </v>

1734
01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:32.000
<v Speaker 4>ways that they distinguish who the alpha</v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

1735
01:28:32.001 --> 01:28:37.001
<v Speaker 4>In the wolf pack is the alpha wolf is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the one who eats the liver the liver </v>

1736
01:28:37.001 --> 01:28:41.260
<v Speaker 4>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are other animals that that's </v>

1737
01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:42.971
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that was true in hunter </v>

1738
01:28:42.971 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 4>gather societies as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And someone was trying to say to me,</v>

1739
01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:45.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll livers process toxins,</v>

1740
01:28:45.231 --> 01:28:46.850
<v Speaker 4>don't you think they'd be filled with </v>
<v Speaker 4>toxins?</v>

1741
01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a common misconception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The liver processes then,</v>

1742
01:28:49.641 --> 01:28:51.350
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fat stores them.</v>

1743
01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:55.130
<v Speaker 4>So if you're concerned about toxins in </v>
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>

1744
01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.190
<v Speaker 4>you should make sure that you're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1745
01:28:57.410 --> 01:29:02.410
<v Speaker 4>pasture raised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>organic fats like butter and cream and </v>

1746
01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:02.410
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you dairy products,</v>

1747
01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:03.780
<v Speaker 4>animal fats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grass fed,</v>

1748
01:29:03.781 --> 01:29:08.781
<v Speaker 4>grass fed butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you eat lard or tallow or anything </v>

1749
01:29:08.781 --> 01:29:13.191
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should come from pasture raised </v>

1750
01:29:13.191 --> 01:29:13.191
<v Speaker 4>animals because the fat is where toxins </v>
<v Speaker 4>are stored.</v>

1751
01:29:13.191 --> 01:29:14.260
<v Speaker 4>The liver processes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

1752
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:16.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you,</v>

1753
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:21.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so when you're eating anything that </v>

1754
01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:21.330
<v Speaker 4>comes from an animal that's been fed </v>
<v Speaker 4>grain,</v>

1755
01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:26.570
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with an animal that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same sort of inflammation issuEs </v>

1756
01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:31.131
<v Speaker 4>that a Person hAs from processing things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's not naturally supposed to </v>

1757
01:29:31.131 --> 01:29:34.911
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like pat processed wheat and the </v>

1758
01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:38.160
<v Speaker 4>bleached flour and things besides </v>
<v Speaker 4>antibiotic residue.</v>

1759
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:43.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you're taking in those animal </v>

1760
01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:46.881
<v Speaker 4>products that we traditionally do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's butter or milk or dairy or </v>

1761
01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:51.021
<v Speaker 4>cheese or things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're taking those from an animal </v>

1762
01:29:51.021 --> 01:29:52.200
<v Speaker 4>that's eating grain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually getting the fats.</v>

1763
01:29:52.410 --> 01:29:53.290
<v Speaker 4>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1764
01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:56.520
<v Speaker 4>it's less healthy than actually eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>the liver of that animal.</v>

1765
01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:57.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

1766
01:29:57.990 --> 01:30:02.990
<v Speaker 4>It may be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the liver is more nutrient dense </v>

1767
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:02.990
<v Speaker 4>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1768
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:08.390
<v Speaker 4>pasture raised animal fats a have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>more nutrients than conventionally </v>

1769
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:13.311
<v Speaker 4>raiseD fats because the animals are </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating grass and grasses way more </v>

1770
01:30:13.311 --> 01:30:14.540
<v Speaker 4>nutrient dense than the grains that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1771
01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:16.500
<v Speaker 4>conventional animals are fed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

1772
01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:19.020
<v Speaker 4>the omega threes and sixes are </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

1773
01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:24.420
<v Speaker 4>The ratio a mega six is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but omega three is three or four times </v>

1774
01:30:24.751 --> 01:30:28.050
<v Speaker 4>higher in pasture raised animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why does it make it six percent?</v>

1775
01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.850
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1776
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
<v Speaker 4>it used to be the kind of a consensus </v>
<v Speaker 4>was that omega sixes would be higher in </v>

1777
01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:41.300
<v Speaker 4>omega threes will be lower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it actually looks like omega six is </v>

1778
01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:44.040
<v Speaker 4>constant and omega three is higher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The omega three is higher because of the</v>

1779
01:30:44.041 --> 01:30:46.650
<v Speaker 4>grass probably has more alpha linolenic </v>
<v Speaker 4>acid,</v>

1780
01:30:46.651 --> 01:30:48.400
<v Speaker 4>which is the plant based form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1781
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:48.780
<v Speaker 4>that day.</v>

1782
01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Then animal does the conversion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1783
01:30:51.121 --> 01:30:52.730
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting to,</v>

1784
01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:57.890
<v Speaker 4>to consider here too is humans are </v>
<v Speaker 4>really inefficient at making these </v>

1785
01:30:57.890 --> 01:31:00.630
<v Speaker 4>conversions of these less active </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrients to the more active ones.</v>

1786
01:31:00.631 --> 01:31:03.090
<v Speaker 4>We started talk about it with epa and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dha,</v>

1787
01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:04.470
<v Speaker 4>k,</v>
<v Speaker 4>k,</v>

1788
01:31:04.530 --> 01:31:09.530
<v Speaker 4>vitamin k,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one is what's converted into k two cows </v>

1789
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:10.770
<v Speaker 4>are experts at doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're really good at it.</v>

1790
01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:13.870
<v Speaker 4>HumanS not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when we eat the animal,</v>

1791
01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:15.750
<v Speaker 4>the animals basically done the work for </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

1792
01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:20.810
<v Speaker 4>We get the preformed final nutrient that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need rather than having to do those </v>

1793
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:25.761
<v Speaker 4>steps ourselves and starting to rub is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this a function of the adaptation of </v>

1794
01:31:25.801 --> 01:31:27.870
<v Speaker 4>people developing while eating these </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals?</v>

1795
01:31:27.871 --> 01:31:29.070
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1796
01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:34.150
<v Speaker 4>A beta carotenes another example that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a precursor to active vitamin a or </v>

1797
01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:37.440
<v Speaker 4>retinol and beta carotenes have some </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits in our bodies,</v>

1798
01:31:37.441 --> 01:31:39.300
<v Speaker 4>but retinols is the real thing.</v>

1799
01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:40.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we need more than anything.</v>

1800
01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:45.980
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that conversion is as low as three to </v>

1801
01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:46.380
<v Speaker 4>five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some people on facts there,</v>

1802
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:51.390
<v Speaker 4>there are some who don't make the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversion at all and those are the </v>

1803
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:52.260
<v Speaker 4>people who turn orange after a carrot </v>
<v Speaker 4>juice fast,</v>

1804
01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:54.900
<v Speaker 4>ever see me when I'm with like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>orange palms.</v>

1805
01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:59.920
<v Speaker 4>but it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend andy used to drink so much </v>

1806
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:03.540
<v Speaker 4>characteristic the inside of his hands </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his skin would turn orange so he </v>

1807
01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:07.441
<v Speaker 4>probably wasn't good at converting beta </v>
<v Speaker 4>carotene into retinol because we should </v>

1808
01:32:07.441 --> 01:32:09.160
<v Speaker 4>be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But some people can't but isn't just the</v>

1809
01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:12.340
<v Speaker 4>mass quantities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it could be that too,</v>

1810
01:32:12.341 --> 01:32:17.341
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a retinol is only really present</v>
<v Speaker 4>in organ meats and pasture raised fats.</v>

1811
01:32:19.811 --> 01:32:21.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not even really in muscle meats </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1812
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:24.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lean ground beef or chicken breast,</v>

1813
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:29.340
<v Speaker 4>boneless chicken breast or um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so in order to get retinol we need to </v>

1814
01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:30.010
<v Speaker 4>consume these pasture raise.</v>

1815
01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:32.320
<v Speaker 4>Fats are where we need to consume organ </v>
<v Speaker 4>meats.</v>

1816
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:33.950
<v Speaker 4>And as you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be.</v>

1817
01:32:33.951 --> 01:32:36.580
<v Speaker 4>It's really fallen out of favor in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

1818
01:32:36.581 --> 01:32:41.581
<v Speaker 4>And this is only recent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I bet you our grandparents ate a </v>

1819
01:32:41.581 --> 01:32:44.500
<v Speaker 4>lot more organ meats than we eat still </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some parts of the world.</v>

1820
01:32:44.501 --> 01:32:49.501
<v Speaker 4>They still eat organ meats more try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do liver and onions are very famous </v>

1821
01:32:49.501 --> 01:32:50.210
<v Speaker 4>dish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1822
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

1823
01:32:51.431 --> 01:32:55.840
<v Speaker 4>And so you'll see like within the paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>primal kind of world,</v>

1824
01:32:55.841 --> 01:33:00.841
<v Speaker 4>the organ meats are making a comeback </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we understand now with the </v>

1825
01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:04.471
<v Speaker 4>nutrient density of these foods is and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's less now even in the mainstream </v>

1826
01:33:04.471 --> 01:33:09.091
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's less of a solid argument that </v>

1827
01:33:09.091 --> 01:33:11.821
<v Speaker 4>can be made about these having </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol or high levels of saturated </v>

1828
01:33:11.821 --> 01:33:16.471
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would prevent us from meeting them </v>

1829
01:33:16.471 --> 01:33:18.360
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will it be the difference in terms of </v>

1830
01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.420
<v Speaker 4>the nutritional density of mollusks </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus organ meat?</v>

1831
01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:22.510
<v Speaker 4>So like if you were trying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had a vegetarian or a vegan who's</v>

1832
01:33:22.511 --> 01:33:27.511
<v Speaker 4>on the fence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you made these arguments that are very </v>

1833
01:33:27.511 --> 01:33:27.890
<v Speaker 4>rational and logical and you said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1834
01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:32.770
<v Speaker 4>mollusks are essentially a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very primitive form of life that doesn't</v>

1835
01:33:32.771 --> 01:33:37.771
<v Speaker 4>feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could argue that there's more </v>

1836
01:33:37.771 --> 01:33:40.630
<v Speaker 4>evidence that some plants feel pain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>plants also have some very intense level</v>

1837
01:33:40.631 --> 01:33:44.020
<v Speaker 4>of communication where there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a really interesting,</v>

1838
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1839
01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:50.180
<v Speaker 4>addition of radio lab recently where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they went into this were they sort of </v>

1840
01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 4>are trying to understand the difference </v>
<v Speaker 4>between,</v>

1841
01:33:52.190 --> 01:33:53.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1842
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.440
<v Speaker 4>not the difference rather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

1843
01:33:55.441 --> 01:34:00.441
<v Speaker 4>the complicated relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 4>these different plants and the mycelium </v>

1844
01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:07.380
<v Speaker 4>in the soil and all of the different </v>
<v Speaker 4>fungus in the soil that also acts as </v>

1845
01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:10.090
<v Speaker 4>sort of a transportation method.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The various nutrients and minerals.</v>

1846
01:34:10.091 --> 01:34:15.091
<v Speaker 4>And they're actually pulling these </v>
<v Speaker 4>minerals out of the rock and they're </v>

1847
01:34:15.091 --> 01:34:15.640
<v Speaker 4>getting sugars from the plants and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're exchanging them for minerals.</v>

1848
01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:20.850
<v Speaker 4>And that there's this really complex </v>
<v Speaker 4>interaction that we have sort of just </v>

1849
01:34:21.190 --> 01:34:22.030
<v Speaker 4>looked at and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1850
01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:23.390
<v Speaker 4>there's dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's plants in it.</v>

1851
01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.770
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot going on between these</v>
<v Speaker 4>various life forms.</v>

1852
01:34:26.771 --> 01:34:31.771
<v Speaker 4>And one of them being fungus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which again is closEr to an animal than </v>

1853
01:34:31.771 --> 01:34:36.701
<v Speaker 4>it is to a PlAnt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is imperative for the life of these </v>

1854
01:34:36.701 --> 01:34:39.901
<v Speaker 4>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>AnD then somehow know that there were </v>

1855
01:34:39.901 --> 01:34:42.021
<v Speaker 4>actually even sharing resources where if</v>
<v Speaker 4>they find or they're allotting resources</v>

1856
01:34:42.731 --> 01:34:47.731
<v Speaker 4>to certain plants that are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>deficient or they're trying to channel </v>

1857
01:34:47.731 --> 01:34:50.431
<v Speaker 4>resources to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's some form of communication </v>

1858
01:34:50.431 --> 01:34:50.431
<v Speaker 4>and exchange here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1859
01:34:50.431 --> 01:34:51.370
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's intelligence,</v>

1860
01:34:51.371 --> 01:34:52.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1861
01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:56.830
<v Speaker 4>paul stamets has done amazing work on </v>
<v Speaker 4>this youngest in.</v>

1862
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's a really good </v>

1863
01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:03.160
<v Speaker 2>option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1864
01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:06.970
<v Speaker 2>when you look at nutrients like specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients that it goes back and forth </v>

1865
01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:07.280
<v Speaker 2>between liver and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1866
01:35:07.281 --> 01:35:09.740
<v Speaker 2>organ meats and shellfish and some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some nutrients.</v>

1867
01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:14.970
<v Speaker 2>A organ meats are higher like vitamin a </v>
<v Speaker 2>or iron and other nutrients.</v>

1868
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Shellfish are generally higher like with</v>
<v Speaker 2>zinc or copper.</v>

1869
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly even,</v>

1870
01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:26.650
<v Speaker 2>even a shellfish are higher in almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the key nutrients that we need.</v>

1871
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Then a lot of the plant based food </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternatives that they would be choosing</v>

1872
01:35:32.511 --> 01:35:37.511
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if it's a vegan was willing to </v>

1873
01:35:37.511 --> 01:35:37.670
<v Speaker 2>eat molluscs I would say that that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a great idea.</v>

1874
01:35:37.671 --> 01:35:38.030
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1875
01:35:38.031 --> 01:35:43.031
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefit there is you don't need to </v>

1876
01:35:43.031 --> 01:35:43.031
<v Speaker 2>eat a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like three ounces,</v>

1877
01:35:43.031 --> 01:35:47.210
<v Speaker 2>a single serving a can meet your copper </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement for the entire week.</v>

1878
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one time.</v>

1879
01:35:49.930 --> 01:35:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Waste oysters and I've history and same </v>
<v Speaker 2>with iron.</v>

1880
01:35:52.881 --> 01:35:54.530
<v Speaker 2>I think if I'm going off the top of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

1881
01:35:54.531 --> 01:35:59.531
<v Speaker 2>I'll iron and zinc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can nearly meet your entire weekly </v>

1882
01:35:59.531 --> 01:36:03.190
<v Speaker 2>requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like you have to eat a ton </v>

1883
01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:03.190
<v Speaker 2>of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1884
01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:06.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a serving of clams once a week </v>

1885
01:36:06.331 --> 01:36:06.331
<v Speaker 2>and you have a serving of oysters once a</v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

1886
01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:07.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1887
01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.300
<v Speaker 2>on top of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1888
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:11.840
<v Speaker 2>getting as much nutrient density as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1889
01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.510
<v Speaker 2>that should do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be 12.</v>

1890
01:36:14.511 --> 01:36:16.940
<v Speaker 2>That's iron that sink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's copper,</v>

1891
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:20.360
<v Speaker 2>epa and dha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The launching of omega three fats are in</v>

1892
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:21.150
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1893
01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:24.030
<v Speaker 2>in these mollusks because as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1894
01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:27.380
<v Speaker 2>and they're typically low on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>toxicity,</v>

1895
01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.270
<v Speaker 2>a scale to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

1896
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:31.190
<v Speaker 2>they don't tend to hAve a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mercury.</v>

1897
01:36:31.191 --> 01:36:36.191
<v Speaker 2>They don't bio accumulate a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>toxins compared to some other predator </v>

1898
01:36:36.191 --> 01:36:40.630
<v Speaker 2>species of fish that are higher in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>food chain that accumulated a lot of </v>

1899
01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:40.630
<v Speaker 2>toxins.</v>

1900
01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Is there any benefit to eating them </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooked versus raw one way or the other?</v>

1901
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1902
01:36:45.621 --> 01:36:49.220
<v Speaker 2>there's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is the chance of disease in eating</v>

1903
01:36:49.221 --> 01:36:51.200
<v Speaker 2>raw oysters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1904
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:54.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty minimal compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some other risks,</v>

1905
01:36:54.351 --> 01:36:56.900
<v Speaker 2>but it is there and cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1906
01:36:56.901 --> 01:37:01.670
<v Speaker 2>mitigates that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So definitely I think in general cooking</v>

1907
01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:06.730
<v Speaker 2>makes the nutrients in meat and animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>products more bioavailable rather than </v>

1908
01:37:06.730 --> 01:37:06.960
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1909
01:37:06.970 --> 01:37:09.440
<v Speaker 2>and that's in vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1910
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:13.310
<v Speaker 2>it depends on the vegetable and the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the method of cooking.</v>

1911
01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:14.290
<v Speaker 2>But a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1912
01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a mixed bag,</v>

1913
01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:19.520
<v Speaker 2>but with me to generally improve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bioavailability.</v>

1914
01:37:19.730 --> 01:37:24.730
<v Speaker 2>So it really is in a lot of ways an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological issue where it's sort of </v>

1915
01:37:25.221 --> 01:37:27.200
<v Speaker 2>framed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1916
01:37:27.201 --> 01:37:28.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>

1917
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:32.570
<v Speaker 2>but these things really don't suffer </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1918
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even there,</v>

1919
01:37:33.771 --> 01:37:35.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we talked about,</v>

1920
01:37:35.210 --> 01:37:37.370
<v Speaker 2>you're going to control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna contribute to suffering and</v>

1921
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.880
<v Speaker 2>potentially more if you're looking on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the scale of individual lives,</v>

1922
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:43.340
<v Speaker 2>and it might sound like this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>nitpicky,</v>

1923
01:37:43.341 --> 01:37:46.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about actual lives,</v>

1924
01:37:46.050 --> 01:37:46.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1925
01:37:46.791 --> 01:37:51.791
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to start evaluating </v>
<v Speaker 2>like is a cow more attention or worth </v>

1926
01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>the life of the cow worth more than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>life of a rabbit or a</v>

1927
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.620
<v Speaker 4>fall or the kind of animals that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>being killed.</v>

1928
01:37:58.690 --> 01:38:02.700
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the production of these plant foods,</v>

1929
01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real question.</v>

1930
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:07.980
<v Speaker 4>And then you have insecticides and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

1931
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of insects that get her </v>

1932
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:13.000
<v Speaker 4>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Killed.</v>

1933
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:13.560
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're processing crops,</v>

1934
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:18.950
<v Speaker 4>there's just no getting around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're buying anything that is from </v>

1935
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:23.511
<v Speaker 4>large scale agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were involved in the death of some </v>

1936
01:38:23.511 --> 01:38:25.320
<v Speaker 4>sort of animals or insects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know the argument is like,</v>

1937
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:27.930
<v Speaker 4>there's an argument about intentionality</v>
<v Speaker 4>and whether,</v>

1938
01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:28.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1939
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:32.850
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I intended to kill this animal to eat</v>

1940
01:38:32.851 --> 01:38:35.430
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's different than if you didn't intend</v>

1941
01:38:35.490 --> 01:38:37.080
<v Speaker 4>to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me that's,</v>

1942
01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:39.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm not so sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1943
01:38:39.570 --> 01:38:43.260
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like willful ignorance that,</v>

1944
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:44.160
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1945
01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:49.220
<v Speaker 4>that these animals are being killed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the production of these plants that I'm </v>

1946
01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:49.220
<v Speaker 4>eating.</v>

1947
01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:50.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see the argument,</v>

1948
01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.760
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not sure I buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do as well.</v>

1949
01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:58.761
<v Speaker 4>And I see the willful ignorance argument</v>
<v Speaker 4>up until the point where it gets </v>

1950
01:38:58.761 --> 01:39:01.821
<v Speaker 4>explained to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So as soon as someone explained to you </v>

1951
01:39:01.821 --> 01:39:04.191
<v Speaker 4>like you've just done about the combines</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how they're chewing up all these </v>

1952
01:39:04.191 --> 01:39:04.191
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way fonz too,</v>

1953
01:39:04.191 --> 01:39:08.811
<v Speaker 4>it's a huge issue with deers because if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've ever seen a baby deer out in the </v>

1954
01:39:08.811 --> 01:39:09.600
<v Speaker 4>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's one of the weirdest things about</v>

1955
01:39:09.601 --> 01:39:10.740
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they're very young,</v>

1956
01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:14.280
<v Speaker 4>they do not move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in the face of danger,</v>

1957
01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:19.281
<v Speaker 4>they have this instinct freeze so you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can literally go up to a fawn and </v>

1958
01:39:19.281 --> 01:39:23.511
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll be tucked up on the ground and </v>

1959
01:39:23.511 --> 01:39:23.511
<v Speaker 4>they're healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely healthy.</v>

1960
01:39:23.511 --> 01:39:24.570
<v Speaker 4>And you could walk right next to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>font and the headlights.</v>

1961
01:39:24.630 --> 01:39:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could stomp on the ground next to </v>

1962
01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:29.630
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't move.</v>

1963
01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:29.940
<v Speaker 4>They sit around and wait for their </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother to retail.</v>

1964
01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:32.820
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get chewed up by combines.</v>

1965
01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:37.850
<v Speaker 4>It's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean because these animals bed in </v>

1966
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:38.340
<v Speaker 4>these fields all the time and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>something happens to the mother,</v>

1967
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:43.610
<v Speaker 4>especially if she gets attacked by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>coyote or something along those lines </v>

1968
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:44.190
<v Speaker 4>and then the babies just get chewed up </v>
<v Speaker 4>by the,</v>

1969
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.130
<v Speaker 4>by the combines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1970
01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:51.860
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's another interesting question </v>

1971
01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:53.490
<v Speaker 4>here too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is more around like privilege and </v>

1972
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:58.530
<v Speaker 4>again like whether we see ourselves as </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the ecosystem and the food cycle</v>

1973
01:39:58.531 --> 01:40:02.160
<v Speaker 4>or as separate from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you think about like native american</v>

1974
01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:07.660
<v Speaker 4>or traditional hunter gather or even </v>
<v Speaker 4>contemporary people living in let's say </v>

1975
01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:10.830
<v Speaker 4>in Afghanistan and all they can they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have is a goat,</v>

1976
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:12.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they.</v>

1977
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:17.160
<v Speaker 4>Or a poor family in India who has access</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a backyard cow,</v>

1978
01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.590
<v Speaker 4>should they not eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1979
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:24.680
<v Speaker 4>milk and butter and those animal foods </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of moral or ethical argument </v>

1980
01:40:25.441 --> 01:40:30.441
<v Speaker 4>against that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or it seems like an argument coming from</v>

1981
01:40:30.781 --> 01:40:33.990
<v Speaker 4>a tremendous place of privilege for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for us to,</v>

1982
01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:39.250
<v Speaker 4>to say that the choices that they make </v>
<v Speaker 4>are somehow wrong or immoral because </v>

1983
01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:42.780
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1984
01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.230
<v Speaker 4>we can afford to make these different </v>
<v Speaker 4>choices in defense of vegans.</v>

1985
01:40:46.230 --> 01:40:47.960
<v Speaker 4>I never hear that argument honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

1986
01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:52.440
<v Speaker 4>I think I hear the argument that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America today you have the choice and in</v>

1987
01:40:52.530 --> 01:40:54.370
<v Speaker 4>westernized you have the choice</v>

1988
01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.000
<v Speaker 3>and so that you can choose to contribute</v>
<v Speaker 3>less to suffering,</v>

1989
01:40:58.150 --> 01:41:00.880
<v Speaker 3>which I think ideologically makes a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of sense.</v>

1990
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:06.510
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when you deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality of it that you've sort of </v>

1991
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:08.170
<v Speaker 3>described about large scale agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

1992
01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:12.490
<v Speaker 3>It means you're not immune to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering of animals in the death.</v>

1993
01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.990
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just not the case.</v>

1994
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you talk about insects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>

1995
01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:19.960
<v Speaker 3>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just an insects,</v>

1996
01:41:20.710 --> 01:41:21.730
<v Speaker 3>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1997
01:41:21.731 --> 01:41:26.170
<v Speaker 3>in my mind are more complex and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated than mollusks.</v>

1998
01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean certainly the,</v>

1999
01:41:29.041 --> 01:41:33.150
<v Speaker 2>if you look at some of the studies on an</v>
<v Speaker 2>insect behavior,</v>

2000
01:41:33.151 --> 01:41:35.430
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be born out.</v>

2001
01:41:35.490 --> 01:41:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we have these like weird hierarchy,</v>

2002
01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:39.540
<v Speaker 2>so we love bees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bees are super important.</v>

2003
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:45.090
<v Speaker 2>These are another species that gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally decimated by factory farming.</v>

2004
01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pesticides are really,</v>

2005
01:41:47.670 --> 01:41:50.100
<v Speaker 2>really harmful for the bees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2006
01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:51.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I agree with you.</v>

2007
01:41:51.991 --> 01:41:55.200
<v Speaker 2>I think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say we have this because we have</v>

2008
01:41:55.201 --> 01:41:57.480
<v Speaker 2>that privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the imperative not to cause more</v>

2009
01:41:57.481 --> 01:41:59.730
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think what I get out of looking at</v>

2010
01:41:59.731 --> 01:42:04.731
<v Speaker 2>those cultures is it's more clear to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>how intertwined with with nature and the</v>

2011
01:42:06.091 --> 01:42:09.570
<v Speaker 2>natural food systems that humans are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those circumstances,</v>

2012
01:42:09.630 --> 01:42:13.950
<v Speaker 2>they're less removed from the basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle of life and it,</v>

2013
01:42:14.010 --> 01:42:15.960
<v Speaker 2>it seems natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>

2014
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:20.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the mussai pastoralist people to,</v>

2015
01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:25.180
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to drink the blood of the cows and eat </v>

2016
01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.940
<v Speaker 2>and drink the milk and eat the meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's inexorably intertwined to</v>

2017
01:42:26.941 --> 01:42:28.590
<v Speaker 2>their culture and their way of life.</v>

2018
01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:32.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's why they survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2019
01:42:32.690 --> 01:42:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2020
01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2021
01:42:34.670 --> 01:42:36.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a really nuanced,</v>

2022
01:42:36.991 --> 01:42:41.991
<v Speaker 2>complex topic and there's a lot more to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it than is typically shows up in the </v>

2023
01:42:44.610 --> 01:42:48.540
<v Speaker 2>internet debates of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go back and forth.</v>

2024
01:42:48.541 --> 01:42:53.541
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I've seen as a clinician </v>

2025
01:42:53.541 --> 01:42:54.600
<v Speaker 2>working with a lot of patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ex vegans,</v>

2026
01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:59.601
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ex vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that some people can pull it off for </v>

2027
01:43:00.271 --> 01:43:05.271
<v Speaker 2>a relatively long period of time and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think this is because they have the </v>

2028
01:43:05.271 --> 01:43:08.841
<v Speaker 2>genes and the preexisting nutrient </v>
<v Speaker 2>status and allows them to make those </v>

2029
01:43:08.841 --> 01:43:11.460
<v Speaker 2>conversions of a less active nutrients </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the more active forms.</v>

2030
01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm better than the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you see someone who goes on a vegan</v>

2031
01:43:16.501 --> 01:43:21.501
<v Speaker 2>diet and falls apart within a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>months and this is the person who does </v>

2032
01:43:21.501 --> 01:43:23.310
<v Speaker 2>not have the genes to make the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2033
01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:28.360
<v Speaker 2>they're poor converter and they also </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably had preexisting nutrient </v>

2034
01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.750
<v Speaker 2>deficiencies which made them less able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make those conversions.</v>

2035
01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:33.810
<v Speaker 2>and so this kind of solves the question </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2036
01:43:34.110 --> 01:43:36.060
<v Speaker 2>or addresses the question you hear some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

2037
01:43:36.061 --> 01:43:37.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does that person,</v>

2038
01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:39.570
<v Speaker 2>that person does a vegan diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's pretty healthy,</v>

2039
01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're rich roll.</v>

2040
01:43:41.730 --> 01:43:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it can't be,</v>

2041
01:43:44.130 --> 01:43:45.130
<v Speaker 2>can't be problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2042
01:43:45.131 --> 01:43:47.160
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't all respond the same way to the</v>

2043
01:43:47.161 --> 01:43:49.110
<v Speaker 2>same choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2044
01:43:49.210 --> 01:43:50.400
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BIo,</v>

2045
01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference in</v>

2046
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.980
<v Speaker 4>the way human beings respond to various </v>
<v Speaker 4>foods can obviously be exhibited really </v>

2047
01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:59.270
<v Speaker 4>quickly and easily with allergies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Food allergies,</v>

2048
01:43:59.390 --> 01:44:00.750
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people,</v>

2049
01:44:00.751 --> 01:44:03.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all know someone who has,</v>

2050
01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.540
<v Speaker 4>like my friend brian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his mother,</v>

2051
01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:10.720
<v Speaker 4>if she eats a Brazil nut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's dead and she will chew those </v>

2052
01:44:12.231 --> 01:44:15.110
<v Speaker 4>things all day and nothing happens other</v>
<v Speaker 4>than I get bored with them,</v>

2053
01:44:15.630 --> 01:44:18.350
<v Speaker 4>especially if she has to pay 600 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 4>for an epi pen.</v>

2054
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:19.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2055
01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:24.140
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of different things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>show the biodiversity of just human </v>

2056
01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:26.060
<v Speaker 4>beings when we come from different parts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world.</v>

2057
01:44:26.061 --> 01:44:28.130
<v Speaker 4>Our ancestors came from different parts </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world.</v>

2058
01:44:28.131 --> 01:44:31.910
<v Speaker 4>They developed and evolved under </v>
<v Speaker 4>different diets.</v>

2059
01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.720
<v Speaker 4>And that's where I think paleo is kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of fallen like a.</v>

2060
01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:41.980
<v Speaker 4>Maybe has been less successful as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>concept then it could have been </v>

2061
01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:46.600
<v Speaker 4>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really believe there's no one size </v>

2062
01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:49.670
<v Speaker 4>fits all approach to diet or life in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

2063
01:44:49.670 --> 01:44:51.390
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2064
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:53.390
<v Speaker 4>if you take two different people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2065
01:44:53.391 --> 01:44:56.760
<v Speaker 4>like a off a person who is primarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>sedentary,</v>

2066
01:44:56.761 --> 01:44:59.180
<v Speaker 4>it works in an office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>60 pounds overweight,</v>

2067
01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prediabetic,</v>

2068
01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:02.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2069
01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:07.660
<v Speaker 4>not doing really any physical activity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you take someone like Michael </v>

2070
01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:09.960
<v Speaker 4>Phelps who's super athlete training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2071
01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 4>burning calories every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's clear.</v>

2072
01:45:12.501 --> 01:45:17.501
<v Speaker 4>It's clear to me that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>need a completely different dietary </v>

2073
01:45:17.501 --> 01:45:20.951
<v Speaker 4>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if we talk about within a certain </v>

2074
01:45:20.951 --> 01:45:20.951
<v Speaker 4>template or are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2075
01:45:20.951 --> 01:45:21.620
<v Speaker 4>choice of foods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2076
01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.900
<v Speaker 4>Michael Phelps is going to need a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>more carbohydrate.</v>

2077
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:26.600
<v Speaker 4>He's going to need lot higher calorie </v>
<v Speaker 4>intake in general.</v>

2078
01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:32.020
<v Speaker 4>He's going to need more nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gonna need to be eating more </v>

2079
01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:32.020
<v Speaker 4>regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2080
01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:34.070
<v Speaker 4>intermittent fasting is not going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>work for him probably.</v>

2081
01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:37.220
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's amazing to me how often that is</v>

2082
01:45:37.221 --> 01:45:38.990
<v Speaker 4>completely left out of the equation.</v>

2083
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.590
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2084
01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.720
<v Speaker 4>when there's discussion of diets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>

2085
01:45:41.721 --> 01:45:44.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the books on everyone should be on a low</v>

2086
01:45:44.001 --> 01:45:46.640
<v Speaker 4>fat diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the next crazy low carb,</v>

2087
01:45:46.641 --> 01:45:47.340
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2088
01:45:47.370 --> 01:45:52.370
<v Speaker 4>carbs are toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't eat carbs and then you </v>

2089
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:54.931
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone should be on paleo and never </v>

2090
01:45:54.931 --> 01:45:55.760
<v Speaker 4>touched another grain or lagoon or dairy</v>
<v Speaker 4>product for the rest of their life.</v>

2091
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:57.500
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just stupid.</v>

2092
01:45:57.530 --> 01:46:02.530
<v Speaker 4>That's not the way it works is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>important when you're talking about </v>

2093
01:46:02.530 --> 01:46:06.761
<v Speaker 4>people like ultra marathon runners or </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like Michael Phelps or just </v>

2094
01:46:06.761 --> 01:46:10.210
<v Speaker 4>burning off massive amounts of calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you think about how much energy is </v>

2095
01:46:10.210 --> 01:46:14.441
<v Speaker 4>involved in those sprints that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing across the pool and the training </v>

2096
01:46:14.441 --> 01:46:16.430
<v Speaker 4>for those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just unbelieVably grueling.</v>

2097
01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:21.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read this thing about him eating like </v>

2098
01:46:21.670 --> 01:46:21.830
<v Speaker 4>several pizzas at night and you look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>him and he's shredded.</v>

2099
01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:26.831
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't zero body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like obviously his body's doing </v>

2100
01:46:26.831 --> 01:46:26.831
<v Speaker 4>something with that.</v>

2101
01:46:26.831 --> 01:46:28.790
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that is very important.</v>

2102
01:46:28.791 --> 01:46:31.100
<v Speaker 4>Also when you're talking about sedentary</v>
<v Speaker 4>lifestyles,</v>

2103
01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:36.160
<v Speaker 4>contributing to diseases and in factors </v>
<v Speaker 4>like high blood pressure and clogging of</v>

2104
01:46:38.571 --> 01:46:40.610
<v Speaker 4>the arteries and you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2105
01:46:40.611 --> 01:46:45.611
<v Speaker 4>your body is less likely to be healthy </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're not doing much with it,</v>

2106
01:46:46.130 --> 01:46:47.810
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>AbSolutely.</v>

2107
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:50.440
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2108
01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:52.770
<v Speaker 4>I think that can work both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the one hand,</v>

2109
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:57.270
<v Speaker 4>phelps would probably be better off </v>
<v Speaker 4>choosing a different calorie source than</v>

2110
01:46:57.271 --> 01:46:59.040
<v Speaker 4>pizzas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2111
01:46:59.041 --> 01:47:00.200
<v Speaker 4>arguably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2112
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:05.290
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he can get away with a lot more than </v>

2113
01:47:05.290 --> 01:47:08.390
<v Speaker 4>I can say that he shouldn't be doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything differently than what is the </v>

2114
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:11.600
<v Speaker 4>most successful swimmer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't he like the most successful </v>

2115
01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:11.600
<v Speaker 4>olympian?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2116
01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:12.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anyone's one any more gold</v>

2117
01:47:12.361 --> 01:47:13.770
<v Speaker 4>medal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what the heck do I know?</v>

2118
01:47:14.170 --> 01:47:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Just keep on doing whatever you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

2119
01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:16.710
<v Speaker 4>It's working.</v>

2120
01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2121
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:19.610
<v Speaker 4>but I think genes play a role,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2122
01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:23.190
<v Speaker 4>for sure you take a coming back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like michael are rich,</v>

2123
01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:26.370
<v Speaker 4>like I think rich could probably eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost,</v>

2124
01:47:26.690 --> 01:47:31.690
<v Speaker 4>could have a lot of different diets and </v>
<v Speaker 4>still be and still be phenomenal.</v>

2125
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:37.570
<v Speaker 4>I've had rich on the podcast before and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he sort of explained his transition to </v>

2126
01:47:37.570 --> 01:47:40.380
<v Speaker 4>being a vegan and it came from being </v>
<v Speaker 4>really unhealthy and eating terrible,</v>

2127
01:47:40.381 --> 01:47:44.970
<v Speaker 4>piss poor diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating super healthy and eating a really</v>

2128
01:47:44.971 --> 01:47:49.971
<v Speaker 4>nutrient dense vegetables constantly and</v>
<v Speaker 4>only that primarily and you know,</v>

2129
01:47:50.131 --> 01:47:54.780
<v Speaker 4>obviously had a massive benefit from </v>
<v Speaker 4>changing from the standard american diet</v>

2130
01:47:54.781 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 4>that you outlined to this vegan diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2131
01:47:57.580 --> 01:47:58.840
<v Speaker 4>MAkes you wonder what he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2132
01:47:58.850 --> 01:48:02.190
<v Speaker 4>what might have happened if he had done </v>
<v Speaker 4>switch to like a paleo diet.</v>

2133
01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:03.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't say that.</v>

2134
01:48:03.130 --> 01:48:07.410
<v Speaker 4>So nobody wants to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2135
01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.700
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

2136
01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.720
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things that gets a </v>

2137
01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:13.720
<v Speaker 4>hit.</v>

2138
01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.070
<v Speaker 4>There's an ideological wall that cannot </v>
<v Speaker 4>be crossed and so no one even wants to </v>

2139
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:18.540
<v Speaker 4>look at the possibility of it being </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically beneficial.</v>

2140
01:48:18.541 --> 01:48:20.190
<v Speaker 4>You just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is not an option.</v>

2141
01:48:20.191 --> 01:48:22.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm a vegan and this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

2142
01:48:22.891 --> 01:48:23.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2143
01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:29.180
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not invested in changing anyone's </v>

2144
01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:29.180
<v Speaker 4>mind about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nor should you be.</v>

2145
01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:29.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2146
01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:31.470
<v Speaker 4>I want to go back to two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One thing I want to go back to was your,</v>

2147
01:48:31.490 --> 01:48:33.720
<v Speaker 4>you're talk about talking about fish </v>
<v Speaker 4>oil,</v>

2148
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:35.580
<v Speaker 4>like the long term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2149
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:39.780
<v Speaker 4>negative aspects of consuming fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what were those?</v>

2150
01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:41.740
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2151
01:48:41.970 --> 01:48:46.970
<v Speaker 4>early on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the history is kind of important </v>

2152
01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:50.031
<v Speaker 4>to see how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it illustrates the number of </v>

2153
01:48:50.031 --> 01:48:50.031
<v Speaker 4>principles that we've been talKing </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

2154
01:48:50.031 --> 01:48:50.130
<v Speaker 4>So early research that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2155
01:48:50.150 --> 01:48:53.160
<v Speaker 4>they looked at traditionally knew it </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and said,</v>

2156
01:48:53.190 --> 01:48:58.190
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people don't really have heart </v>

2157
01:48:58.190 --> 01:48:58.190
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

2158
01:48:58.190 --> 01:48:58.190
<v Speaker 4>What is it about their diet that could </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain this?</v>

2159
01:48:58.410 --> 01:49:03.410
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They eat mostly seal blubber and they </v>

2160
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:04.650
<v Speaker 4>have enormous intake of omega three </v>
<v Speaker 4>fats,</v>

2161
01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:09.710
<v Speaker 4>so it could be an omega three fats and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they start doing research and they </v>

2162
01:49:09.710 --> 01:49:13.911
<v Speaker 4>find that there is an inverse </v>
<v Speaker 4>association between omega three fat </v>

2163
01:49:14.761 --> 01:49:19.761
<v Speaker 4>consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in seafood and cardiovascular </v>

2164
01:49:19.761 --> 01:49:19.761
<v Speaker 4>disease risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

2165
01:49:19.761 --> 01:49:23.960
<v Speaker 4>people who eat more fish have fewer </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart attacks and die of cardiovascular </v>

2166
01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:23.960
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much less.</v>

2167
01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.800
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So pretty promising so far.</v>

2168
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:27.600
<v Speaker 4>So then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2169
01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.230
<v Speaker 4>why don't we then give people fish oil </v>
<v Speaker 4>supplements?</v>

2170
01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:34.110
<v Speaker 4>And so they give people fish oil </v>
<v Speaker 4>supplements.</v>

2171
01:49:34.111 --> 01:49:35.820
<v Speaker 4>They do some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some research on that,</v>

2172
01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:38.570
<v Speaker 4>that short term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And find that yes,</v>

2173
01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:41.130
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there do appear to be some benefits from</v>

2174
01:49:41.131 --> 01:49:42.990
<v Speaker 4>fish oil supplementation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>short term,</v>

2175
01:49:43.770 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 4>but then over a longer period of time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and met analysis</v>

2176
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:53.220
<v Speaker 2>of longer term studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find that the benefits of fish oil </v>

2177
01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:54.820
<v Speaker 2>I've probably been significantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>overstated.</v>

2178
01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:59.440
<v Speaker 2>And then in fact in some cases high </v>
<v Speaker 2>doses of fish oil for an extended period</v>

2179
01:49:59.441 --> 01:50:04.441
<v Speaker 2>of time actually appear to cause harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there are few few important </v>

2180
01:50:05.711 --> 01:50:10.711
<v Speaker 2>principles here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one is the the folly of looKing </v>

2181
01:50:10.901 --> 01:50:15.901
<v Speaker 2>at one super isolated unusual population</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the traditional in us who live in a</v>

2182
01:50:16.331 --> 01:50:21.331
<v Speaker 2>really marginalized environment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at their diet and then </v>

2183
01:50:21.331 --> 01:50:25.021
<v Speaker 2>extrapolating that to us who don't live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the arctic and don't have their diet </v>

2184
01:50:28.271 --> 01:50:31.360
<v Speaker 2>or lifestyle and didn't evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can evolve up there.</v>

2185
01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:33.730
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and interestingly enough,</v>

2186
01:50:33.731 --> 01:50:38.731
<v Speaker 2>some recent studies have found that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nun have certain genetic adaptations </v>

2187
01:50:38.731 --> 01:50:43.210
<v Speaker 2>that allow them to thrive on very high </v>
<v Speaker 2>doses of omega three,</v>

2188
01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:45.970
<v Speaker 2>which we don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2189
01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:48.400
<v Speaker 2>so that illustrates the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking,</v>

2190
01:50:48.401 --> 01:50:48.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

2191
01:50:48.941 --> 01:50:51.430
<v Speaker 2>oh this works for the anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it should work for us.</v>

2192
01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:53.920
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't actually work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now we know why,</v>

2193
01:50:53.921 --> 01:50:56.270
<v Speaker 2>it's because of the genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2194
01:50:56.650 --> 01:51:01.650
<v Speaker 2>the second folly and this happens all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and it's kind of a uniquely </v>

2195
01:51:01.931 --> 01:51:03.220
<v Speaker 2>american thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2196
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:04.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit as good.</v>

2197
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot must be even better.</v>

2198
01:51:07.050 --> 01:51:12.050
<v Speaker 2>That's me as he stares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is bullet proof coffee over there?</v>

2199
01:51:14.530 --> 01:51:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2200
01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.350
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2201
01:51:17.351 --> 01:51:18.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2202
01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I think what is becoming more clear is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that eating fish is good.</v>

2203
01:51:23.890 --> 01:51:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Taking really high doses of fish oil for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long period of time may not be now </v>

2204
01:51:28.890 --> 01:51:32.821
<v Speaker 2>what were the negative health benefits </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the negative health effects rather </v>

2205
01:51:32.821 --> 01:51:36.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an increase in cardiovascular disease </v>

2206
01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:37.840
<v Speaker 2>risk in some cases and increase in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory markers.</v>

2207
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:41.770
<v Speaker 2>The thing to understand about omega </v>
<v Speaker 2>three fats is they're very fragile.</v>

2208
01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:47.010
<v Speaker 2>so fats have different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>susceptibility to something called </v>

2209
01:51:47.381 --> 01:51:52.381
<v Speaker 2>oxidative damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means a [inaudible] and they </v>

2210
01:51:52.381 --> 01:51:55.591
<v Speaker 2>combine with oxygen and the fat becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>damaged and rancid and then can be </v>

2211
01:51:55.931 --> 01:51:56.590
<v Speaker 2>harmful.</v>

2212
01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:57.690
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2213
01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:00.040
<v Speaker 2>brief description without going into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

2214
01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so saturated fats,</v>

2215
01:52:03.250 --> 01:52:07.150
<v Speaker 2>because they are saturated with hydrogen</v>
<v Speaker 2>atoms,</v>

2216
01:52:07.151 --> 01:52:11.050
<v Speaker 2>they're not susceptible to oxidative </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage and they're relatively stable.</v>

2217
01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:14.050
<v Speaker 2>It can tolerate the application of </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature,</v>

2218
01:52:14.051 --> 01:52:17.410
<v Speaker 2>like when you cook with it or light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2219
01:52:17.411 --> 01:52:22.411
<v Speaker 2>so if they're stored in a clear jar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to decompose and </v>

2220
01:52:22.411 --> 01:52:25.510
<v Speaker 2>become rancid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas polyunsaturated fats are,</v>

2221
01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:30.560
<v Speaker 2>are lacking in hydrogen atoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become more susceptible to </v>

2222
01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:33.451
<v Speaker 2>oxidative stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the most unsaturated fats are the </v>

2223
01:52:33.451 --> 01:52:37.380
<v Speaker 2>long chain omega three fats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this means that they,</v>

2224
01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:42.720
<v Speaker 2>this is why you don't cook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never hear anyone saying that you </v>

2225
01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:42.720
<v Speaker 2>should cook with fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2226
01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:43.390
<v Speaker 2>if you cook with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

2227
01:52:43.570 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 2>you'll damage the fats will become </v>
<v Speaker 2>rancid and oxidize.</v>

2228
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:51.500
<v Speaker 2>This is why fish oil is stored in opaque</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles to protect it from light because</v>

2229
01:52:51.501 --> 01:52:54.260
<v Speaker 2>if light hits it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will oxidize and become rancid.</v>

2230
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And the suspicion is that if we eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2231
01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:02.480
<v Speaker 2>we take these high doses of unsaturated </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

2232
01:53:02.481 --> 01:53:05.060
<v Speaker 2>we actually increased the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxidative stress,</v>

2233
01:53:05.061 --> 01:53:08.360
<v Speaker 2>which can cause inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in turn is the root of all chronic</v>

2234
01:53:09.230 --> 01:53:11.240
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2235
01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:14.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I advise my patients is,</v>

2236
01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:17.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just eat fish and if for some reason you</v>

2237
01:53:17.151 --> 01:53:20.840
<v Speaker 2>can't eat fish or won't eat fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then taking some,</v>

2238
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:22.840
<v Speaker 2>some fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2239
01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I prefer cod liver oil because it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins a and d in addition to epa and </v>

2240
01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:30.530
<v Speaker 2>dha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at a relatively low dose or moderate</v>

2241
01:53:30.531 --> 01:53:31.190
<v Speaker 2>dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2242
01:53:31.191 --> 01:53:33.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe like a teaspoon a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2243
01:53:34.130 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 2>rather than going for like 20 grams or </v>
<v Speaker 2>15 grams a day of fish oil.</v>

2244
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:43.250
<v Speaker 2>So the real issue is in the oxidative </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>

2245
01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also the,</v>

2246
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the potential of something being </v>

2247
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.880
<v Speaker 2>rancid sort of mitigates or a diminishes</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the positive benefits from it.</v>

2248
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:58.200
<v Speaker 2>But if you can be assured that there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>no rancid,</v>

2249
01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 2>well no because it can become damaged in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

2250
01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:06.420
<v Speaker 2>So there's two types of data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be damaged by heat or lighting </v>

2251
01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:09.140
<v Speaker 2>outside of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's less of an issue because storage,</v>

2252
01:54:09.230 --> 01:54:10.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know this,</v>

2253
01:54:10.521 --> 01:54:12.540
<v Speaker 2>the producers of these oils,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no it.</v>

2254
01:54:12.541 --> 01:54:16.010
<v Speaker 2>So they store them in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a opaque bottles and when you get the</v>

2255
01:54:16.011 --> 01:54:21.011
<v Speaker 2>fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're instructed to put it in the </v>

2256
01:54:21.011 --> 01:54:21.011
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>preserve it,</v>

2257
01:54:21.011 --> 01:54:23.650
<v Speaker 2>but inside of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fats can become oxidized to.</v>

2258
01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at traditional diets,</v>

2259
01:54:26.871 --> 01:54:31.871
<v Speaker 2>you see that the majority of fat is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from saturated or mono unsaturated</v>

2260
01:54:31.941 --> 01:54:35.090
<v Speaker 2>fat and there's only a small amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat that comes,</v>

2261
01:54:35.170 --> 01:54:40.170
<v Speaker 2>it's polyunsaturated that they would get</v>
<v Speaker 2>from eating nuts or seeds which are </v>

2262
01:54:40.170 --> 01:54:42.010
<v Speaker 2>pretty high in polyunsaturated fats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>olives.</v>

2263
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:47.050
<v Speaker 2>All of olive oil has some avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has some polyunsaturated fats,</v>

2264
01:54:48.891 --> 01:54:50.890
<v Speaker 2>omega sixes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2265
01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but there weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2266
01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:58.060
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't really an opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to be getting really high doses of </v>

2267
01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:02.170
<v Speaker 2>polyunsaturated fat that you would get </v>
<v Speaker 2>from taking multiple fish oil capsules </v>

2268
01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:02.690
<v Speaker 2>in a day.</v>

2269
01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that.</v>

2270
01:55:04.851 --> 01:55:09.851
<v Speaker 2>So that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also actually why </v>

2271
01:55:09.851 --> 01:55:11.600
<v Speaker 2>industrialized seed oils are bad for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2272
01:55:11.601 --> 01:55:13.790
<v Speaker 2>things like corn oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soybean oil,</v>

2273
01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:19.120
<v Speaker 2>a sunflower and safflower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the stuff that's in chips and </v>

2274
01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:22.691
<v Speaker 2>crackers and cookies and restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods primarily is that when those oils </v>

2275
01:55:23.811 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 2>get heated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become rancid.</v>

2276
01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:29.810
<v Speaker 2>And those rancid oils can be harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2277
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:33.120
<v Speaker 2>That is really important information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2278
01:55:33.150 --> 01:55:38.150
<v Speaker 2>it's also interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're bringing up cod liver oil that's </v>

2279
01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:41.231
<v Speaker 2>more like sort of ancient knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grandma and grandpa people would have </v>

2280
01:55:41.231 --> 01:55:43.830
<v Speaker 2>you take a tablespoon of cod liver oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You build</v>

2281
01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:46.710
<v Speaker 4>your house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they were right,</v>

2282
01:55:46.711 --> 01:55:48.780
<v Speaker 4>we talked about retinol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin a,</v>

2283
01:55:48.781 --> 01:55:52.110
<v Speaker 4>the active form of vitamin a in how it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not found in very many foods,</v>

2284
01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:57.111
<v Speaker 4>just organ meats and pasture raised fats</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a cod liver oil is from liver cod </v>

2285
01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:02.250
<v Speaker 4>livers and the oil is very high in </v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamin a.</v>

2286
01:56:02.251 --> 01:56:06.230
<v Speaker 4>It's also high in vitamin d,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which a lot of people are deficient in a</v>

2287
01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:08.980
<v Speaker 4>and it's has epa and dha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

2288
01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:11.520
<v Speaker 4>this is traditional wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our ancestors knew.</v>

2289
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:12.690
<v Speaker 4>They had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2290
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:15.660
<v Speaker 4>they may not have scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 4>understood what the benefit was,</v>

2291
01:56:15.661 --> 01:56:17.760
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they knew through trial and error.</v>

2292
01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:23.030
<v Speaker 4>That is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's another thing that I wanted to </v>

2293
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:25.800
<v Speaker 4>bring up that we talked about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The misconception that unsat,</v>

2294
01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:30.860
<v Speaker 4>that saturated fats rather saturated </v>
<v Speaker 4>fats and cholesterol are bad for you.</v>

2295
01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:32.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2296
01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:37.230
<v Speaker 4>this is something that you hear vegans </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about all the time.</v>

2297
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:42.350
<v Speaker 4>They don't do videos about it as </v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fats are terrible for you and </v>

2298
01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:43.430
<v Speaker 4>it's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2299
01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:45.510
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not current with the science.</v>

2300
01:56:45.511 --> 01:56:50.511
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the us dietary guidelines now have </v>

2301
01:56:50.511 --> 01:56:53.691
<v Speaker 4>no restriction on dietary cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the most recent version of the </v>

2302
01:56:53.691 --> 01:56:54.840
<v Speaker 4>dietary guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at him,</v>

2303
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:57.240
<v Speaker 4>there is no restriction on dietary </v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol.</v>

2304
01:56:57.270 --> 01:57:02.270
<v Speaker 4>So the vegans are aligning themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>with science that's decades old at this </v>

2305
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:04.500
<v Speaker 4>point and they're out of step even with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the conventional,</v>

2306
01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:07.590
<v Speaker 4>totally vanilla mainstream dietary </v>
<v Speaker 4>guidelines.</v>

2307
01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:11.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an ideological thing.</v>

2308
01:57:11.371 --> 01:57:16.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is something that they </v>

2309
01:57:16.371 --> 01:57:17.871
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have their bullet points and </v>

2310
01:57:17.871 --> 01:57:17.871
<v Speaker 4>saturated fats bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:57:17.871 --> 01:57:19.650
<v Speaker 4>And they go to at saturated fats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>consumption of animal products,</v>

2312
01:57:19.651 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 4>bad cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

2313
01:57:21.451 --> 01:57:22.820
<v Speaker 4>So this is based on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2314
01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:25.470
<v Speaker 4>an old understanding of how heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease develops,</v>

2315
01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:28.530
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of the pipe analogy we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>call it.</v>

2316
01:57:28.530 --> 01:57:30.140
<v Speaker 4>So like break it down for us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chris,</v>

2317
01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:34.350
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat and cholesterol are like </v>
<v Speaker 4>gunk that clog up your pipes,</v>

2318
01:57:34.410 --> 01:57:36.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kinda how we all were taught,</v>

2319
01:57:36.330 --> 01:57:37.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all conceive of it.</v>

2320
01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you eat,</v>

2321
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:44.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a burger and egg yolks and that just </v>

2322
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:48.411
<v Speaker 4>gradually will build up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as gunk in your arteries and eventually </v>

2323
01:57:48.481 --> 01:57:52.250
<v Speaker 4>those arteries clogged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the occlusion of the arteries,</v>

2324
01:57:52.251 --> 01:57:57.251
<v Speaker 4>this is what causes a heart attack </v>
<v Speaker 4>because blood can't get through to the </v>

2325
01:57:57.251 --> 01:57:57.870
<v Speaker 4>heart and it causes a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an ischemic event,</v>

2326
01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:00.240
<v Speaker 4>no oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>heart attack,</v>

2327
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:02.460
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

2328
01:58:02.461 --> 01:58:05.890
<v Speaker 4>platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the plaque ruptures and that in</v>

2329
01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:11.040
<v Speaker 4>it blocks the artery and blood can't get</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the heart and you have a heart </v>

2330
01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:11.040
<v Speaker 4>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's kinda the,</v>

2331
01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:13.830
<v Speaker 4>the dominant idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it turns out it's not actually true.</v>

2332
01:58:14.090 --> 01:58:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for one thing,</v>

2333
01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:21.460
<v Speaker 4>there was actually just a study </v>
<v Speaker 4>published that reviewed all of the </v>

2334
01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:25.311
<v Speaker 4>randomized clinical trials that looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>at substituting saturated </v>

2335
01:58:25.311 --> 01:58:29.300
<v Speaker 4>polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they took away people's butter and </v>

2336
01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:33.801
<v Speaker 4>gave them corn oil and soybean oil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't know how they found that </v>

2337
01:58:33.801 --> 01:58:34.890
<v Speaker 4>people were willing to take that trade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2338
01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:35.960
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegans,</v>

2339
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:36.420
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2340
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:41.750
<v Speaker 4>this was at a time where saturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>was seen as harmful and they probably </v>

2341
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.750
<v Speaker 4>gave them margarine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2342
01:58:41.770 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 4>some</v>

2343
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:46.980
<v Speaker 2>of that other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when that was supposed to be </v>

2344
01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:46.980
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it's not butter,</v>

2345
01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:49.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So terrible for you.</v>

2346
01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:52.960
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they reviewed 10 studies and they</v>

2347
01:58:52.961 --> 01:58:56.110
<v Speaker 2>found that only one supported this </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion,</v>

2348
01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:01.260
<v Speaker 2>one of 10 supported this notion that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that replacing saturated fat with </v>

2349
01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:02.980
<v Speaker 2>polyunsaturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was good for you,</v>

2350
01:59:02.981 --> 01:59:07.981
<v Speaker 2>and even that study was flawed because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>much higher percentage of people in the </v>

2351
01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:12.850
<v Speaker 2>control group were we're smoke were </v>
<v Speaker 2>smokers,</v>

2352
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:17.910
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had some other characteristics that </v>

2353
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:21.661
<v Speaker 2>would have made them more susceptible to</v>
<v Speaker 2>having heart disease independent of </v>

2354
01:59:21.661 --> 01:59:22.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with their diet.</v>

2355
01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:24.070
<v Speaker 2>WaS that intentional?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2356
01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:26.930
<v Speaker 2>It was poorly designed study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2357
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2358
01:59:28.631 --> 01:59:33.631
<v Speaker 2>I guess it depends on whether you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the researchers were trying to get a </v>

2359
01:59:33.631 --> 01:59:35.410
<v Speaker 2>particular outcome or whether you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just poor design.</v>

2360
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's the early studies suggested </v>

2361
01:59:41.070 --> 01:59:43.120
<v Speaker 2>that if you eat more saturated fat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol,</v>

2362
01:59:43.150 --> 01:59:48.150
<v Speaker 2>the cholesterol level in your blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go up and they use that as a way </v>

2363
01:59:48.150 --> 01:59:52.621
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then everyone knew that high </v>

2364
01:59:52.621 --> 01:59:52.621
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol in your blood causes heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>

2365
01:59:52.621 --> 01:59:56.861
<v Speaker 2>So if a plus b and b plus c equals c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a equals c,</v>

2366
01:59:57.581 --> 01:59:58.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2367
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:04.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that turned out to not actually be </v>

2368
02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:04.420
<v Speaker 2>true on two counts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

2369
02:00:04.450 --> 02:00:09.450
<v Speaker 2>when they just looked at the direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between saturated fat </v>

2370
02:00:09.671 --> 02:00:11.920
<v Speaker 2>intake and cholesterol intake and heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

2371
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:17.070
<v Speaker 2>just taking blood cholesterol completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the equation like let's forget </v>

2372
02:00:17.070 --> 02:00:21.391
<v Speaker 2>about the mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just see if people who eat more </v>

2373
02:00:21.391 --> 02:00:21.430
<v Speaker 2>fat and cholesterol actually have more </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart attacks.</v>

2374
02:00:21.490 --> 02:00:24.610
<v Speaker 2>When they did those studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no difference.</v>

2375
02:00:25.450 --> 02:00:30.450
<v Speaker 2>People who eat more fat and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol did not have more heart </v>

2376
02:00:30.450 --> 02:00:33.331
<v Speaker 2>attacks than people who eat less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was a huge problem and then more</v>

2377
02:00:33.821 --> 02:00:36.130
<v Speaker 2>recent studies have found that on </v>
<v Speaker 2>average,</v>

2378
02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:41.220
<v Speaker 2>saturated certainly dietary cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 2>intake has nothing to do with serum </v>

2379
02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:41.440
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol levels.</v>

2380
02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:46.440
<v Speaker 2>For the vast majority of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of patients won't see any </v>

2381
02:00:46.901 --> 02:00:51.901
<v Speaker 2>change in their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their blood cholesterol levels by </v>

2382
02:00:51.901 --> 02:00:53.350
<v Speaker 2>changing their dietary cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels one way or the other,</v>

2383
02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:58.380
<v Speaker 2>and how do you account for the other 30?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're called hyper responders and that</v>

2384
02:00:58.961 --> 02:01:02.820
<v Speaker 2>may be genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they may have a certain ape geno type</v>

2385
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:07.830
<v Speaker 2>that predisposes them to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to the effects of dietary </v>

2386
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:11.491
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may be hyper absorbers of dietary </v>

2387
02:01:11.491 --> 02:01:14.221
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they actually absorb more through </v>

2388
02:01:14.221 --> 02:01:16.060
<v Speaker 2>their gut than a typical person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even those hyper responders,</v>

2389
02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:20.140
<v Speaker 2>they found that both their total,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their total cholesterol went up,</v>

2390
02:01:20.530 --> 02:01:25.530
<v Speaker 2>but that was because both the good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad cholesterol went up at the same </v>

2391
02:01:25.530 --> 02:01:29.761
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the effects were seen as being not </v>

2392
02:01:29.761 --> 02:01:32.380
<v Speaker 2>clinically relevant because although you</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw an increase in the total,</v>

2393
02:01:32.381 --> 02:01:37.381
<v Speaker 2>it was driven by good going up as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the bad going up a little bit.</v>

2394
02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:39.650
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't thought to be clinically </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant.</v>

2395
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that like what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about before longterm studies </v>

2396
02:01:45.190 --> 02:01:48.560
<v Speaker 3>would reveal more because we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about a certain nutrients.</v>

2397
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:53.561
<v Speaker 3>When you eliminate them from the diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes a long time to find the effect </v>

2398
02:01:53.561 --> 02:01:57.821
<v Speaker 3>or what we're talking about with fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>oil that maybe if a longterm study </v>

2399
02:01:57.821 --> 02:01:59.570
<v Speaker 3>showed an increase in dietary </v>
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol,</v>

2400
02:01:59.571 --> 02:02:00.740
<v Speaker 3>you can see negative effects.</v>

2401
02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think long longterm studies could </v>

2402
02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:08.751
<v Speaker 2>certainly reveal different effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the biggest question here is </v>

2403
02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:14.750
<v Speaker 2>should we be looking at a blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol levels as the sole arbiter </v>

2404
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:17.910
<v Speaker 2>of whether something is good or or bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us?</v>

2405
02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:23.030
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say someone switches to a </v>

2406
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:26.550
<v Speaker 2>nutrient dense low carb diet from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard american diet,</v>

2407
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:29.610
<v Speaker 2>and let's say every single thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their health improves.</v>

2408
02:02:29.611 --> 02:02:31.080
<v Speaker 2>They lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2409
02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.370
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2410
02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:37.700
<v Speaker 2>their insulin levels decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their blood sugar levels go down on </v>

2411
02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:39.060
<v Speaker 2>their blood pressure levels go down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their inflammatory markers go down.</v>

2412
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:41.400
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a theoretical thing.</v>

2413
02:02:41.401 --> 02:02:43.920
<v Speaker 2>This is something I see every day in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>

2414
02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.320
<v Speaker 2>but their total cholesterol goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a bad thing?</v>

2415
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Is that a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2416
02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:55.760
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should they go back to the standard </v>

2417
02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:55.760
<v Speaker 2>american diet eating?</v>

2418
02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:55.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>

2419
02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:59.940
<v Speaker 3>could you explain what is the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between bad cholesterol and good </v>

2420
02:02:59.940 --> 02:02:59.940
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol to the people that.</v>

2421
02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a really big over </v>

2422
02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:09.351
<v Speaker 2>simplification and it was created I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think by the drug companies to make it </v>

2423
02:03:09.351 --> 02:03:10.120
<v Speaker 2>seem very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2424
02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good cholesterol,</v>

2425
02:03:12.370 --> 02:03:13.420
<v Speaker 2>bad cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

2426
02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:15.730
<v Speaker 2>our drug lowers your bad cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2427
02:03:15.731 --> 02:03:17.860
<v Speaker 2>You know that that's how simple they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want it to be.</v>

2428
02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:23.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not actually that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So called bad cholesterol actually has </v>

2429
02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:25.720
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some important roles that it plays.</v>

2430
02:03:25.721 --> 02:03:29.470
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't actually just dare to give us </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart attacks contrary to that,</v>

2431
02:03:29.530 --> 02:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that model would assume.</v>

2432
02:03:31.630 --> 02:03:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's even more wrong about </v>

2433
02:03:36.910 --> 02:03:41.910
<v Speaker 2>referring to a cholesterol is we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually what's important is not really </v>

2434
02:03:44.861 --> 02:03:48.340
<v Speaker 2>how much cholesterol we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's important is the lipoproteins.</v>

2435
02:03:48.341 --> 02:03:51.790
<v Speaker 2>So let me see if I can use an analogy </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2436
02:03:51.791 --> 02:03:56.791
<v Speaker 2>So imagine your bloodstream is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>highway and uh,</v>

2437
02:03:56.980 --> 02:04:01.980
<v Speaker 2>the cars on the highway or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lipoproteins and the passengers in the </v>

2438
02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:05.761
<v Speaker 2>car are the cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lipoproteins carry around the body </v>

2439
02:04:05.761 --> 02:04:08.680
<v Speaker 2>and a lipoproteins also carry fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>soluble vitamins,</v>

2440
02:04:08.681 --> 02:04:12.440
<v Speaker 2>like vitamin a and vitamin d and </v>
<v Speaker 2>triglycerides and other things that,</v>

2441
02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:13.690
<v Speaker 2>that our body actually needs.</v>

2442
02:04:13.690 --> 02:04:18.690
<v Speaker 2>So they're like a taxi service that </v>
<v Speaker 2>carries cholesterol aNd fats and other </v>

2443
02:04:18.690 --> 02:04:21.280
<v Speaker 2>nutrients all around the body and takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to the cells where they're actually</v>

2444
02:04:21.281 --> 02:04:22.210
<v Speaker 2>used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2445
02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:28.080
<v Speaker 2>So for years it was thought that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of cholesterol inside the </v>

2446
02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:32.551
<v Speaker 2>lipoproteins was the big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's measured when you go </v>

2447
02:04:32.551 --> 02:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>and you get a liquid panel and uc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get your total cholesterol,</v>

2448
02:04:34.301 --> 02:04:39.301
<v Speaker 2>your ldl and your hdl cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're measuring the passengers in the </v>

2449
02:04:39.301 --> 02:04:43.980
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how much cholesterol is inside of </v>

2450
02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:46.491
<v Speaker 2>those particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was thought to be the driving </v>

2451
02:04:46.491 --> 02:04:49.431
<v Speaker 2>factor for risk for heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We now know that it's not really the </v>

2452
02:04:49.921 --> 02:04:52.710
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol inside of the particles that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a difference.</v>

2453
02:04:52.711 --> 02:04:56.130
<v Speaker 2>It's how many particles you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to use,</v>

2454
02:04:56.131 --> 02:05:01.131
<v Speaker 2>come back to this analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a highway and you've got a </v>

2455
02:05:01.131 --> 02:05:04.101
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of cars on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as likely that want more likely </v>

2456
02:05:04.101 --> 02:05:05.880
<v Speaker 2>when I'm gonna go off the road and </v>
<v Speaker 2>crash,</v>

2457
02:05:05.970 --> 02:05:06.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2458
02:05:07.250 --> 02:05:09.480
<v Speaker 2>And they'll crash into the artery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the site,</v>

2459
02:05:09.490 --> 02:05:14.190
<v Speaker 2>the endothelial wall of the artery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it'll damage the artery and they.</v>

2460
02:05:14.250 --> 02:05:19.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's what initiates this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of plaque formation that </v>

2461
02:05:19.250 --> 02:05:20.070
<v Speaker 2>eventually leads to heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's literally like volume.</v>

2462
02:05:20.490 --> 02:05:25.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a gradient driven process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a high number of </v>

2463
02:05:25.490 --> 02:05:27.130
<v Speaker 2>particles in the luminal space of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>artery,</v>

2464
02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:31.110
<v Speaker 2>they will try to diffuse across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lumen.</v>

2465
02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:34.790
<v Speaker 2>So it was an issue with overeating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2466
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:36.000
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2467
02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:41.600
<v Speaker 2>so what we're talking about here is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of particles and all of the </v>

2468
02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.070
<v Speaker 2>things that I talked about earlier that </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised cholesterol.</v>

2469
02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:47.820
<v Speaker 2>What I was actually referring to is </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that raise ldl particles.</v>

2470
02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I Just didn't want to go into all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this nuance at the risk of confusing </v>

2471
02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:54.840
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ldl versus hdl.</v>

2472
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have ldl particles and you have </v>

2473
02:05:59.870 --> 02:06:00.300
<v Speaker 2>hdl particles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ldl stands for low density lipoprotein,</v>

2474
02:06:00.301 --> 02:06:02.340
<v Speaker 2>hdl for high density lipoprotein.</v>

2475
02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:07.020
<v Speaker 2>And traditionally ldl particles have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been viewed as bad.</v>

2476
02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the bad cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hdl particles have been viewed as </v>

2477
02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:13.740
<v Speaker 2>good and there is something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely something to that.</v>

2478
02:06:13.741 --> 02:06:15.090
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2479
02:06:15.150 --> 02:06:18.690
<v Speaker 2>the single most important risk factor </v>
<v Speaker 2>like marker from a,</v>

2480
02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:23.770
<v Speaker 2>from a blood lipid standpoint are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two most would be l,</v>

2481
02:06:23.970 --> 02:06:28.970
<v Speaker 2>ldl particle number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and another lipoprotein called </v>

2482
02:06:28.970 --> 02:06:33.410
<v Speaker 2>lipoprotein little a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm coming back to our analogy.</v>

2483
02:06:33.991 --> 02:06:37.740
<v Speaker 2>If you have a whole lot of ldl particles</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a whole lot of cars on the road,</v>

2484
02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:42.890
<v Speaker 2>there's more of a chance that one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them's going to damage the artery and </v>

2485
02:06:42.890 --> 02:06:44.430
<v Speaker 2>then that whole process of plaque </v>
<v Speaker 2>formation is going to,</v>

2486
02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>is going to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what increases the risk of </v>

2487
02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:54.171
<v Speaker 2>heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the name of the game is to keep your </v>

2488
02:06:54.171 --> 02:06:58.881
<v Speaker 2>ldl particle number down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when we talk about the things that </v>

2489
02:06:58.881 --> 02:06:59.480
<v Speaker 2>increase it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2490
02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:03.210
<v Speaker 2>going back to early in the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetics do play a role.</v>

2491
02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:08.240
<v Speaker 2>diet definitely plays a role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then also things like thyroid </v>

2492
02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:08.340
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infections,</v>

2493
02:07:08.341 --> 02:07:13.341
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and leaky gut play a role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not happening in isolation,</v>

2494
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:15.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our,</v>

2495
02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:15.930
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>

2496
02:07:15.931 --> 02:07:17.920
<v Speaker 2>we have to look at our whole health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2497
02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:19.800
<v Speaker 2>our diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we sleep,</v>

2498
02:07:19.801 --> 02:07:24.801
<v Speaker 2>how we live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether we have infections or </v>

2499
02:07:24.801 --> 02:07:24.801
<v Speaker 2>inflammation or guts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guts,</v>

2500
02:07:24.801 --> 02:07:28.050
<v Speaker 2>stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have many patients,</v>

2501
02:07:28.290 --> 02:07:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm often guys who kind of be their only</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaint is that they have high </v>

2502
02:07:33.290 --> 02:07:34.620
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol and now I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

2503
02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.390
<v Speaker 2>If they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really are 100 percent healthy.</v>

2504
02:07:37.391 --> 02:07:40.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's the only complaint we test </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ldl particle number.</v>

2505
02:07:40.811 --> 02:07:43.420
<v Speaker 2>It's high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say they have no gUt issues,</v>

2506
02:07:43.421 --> 02:07:45.340
<v Speaker 2>they have no fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2507
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:50.370
<v Speaker 2>no other health problems at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I test their gut and I do all </v>

2508
02:07:50.370 --> 02:07:54.361
<v Speaker 2>these testing and we find issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We address those issues and their ldl </v>

2509
02:07:54.361 --> 02:07:55.810
<v Speaker 2>particle drops by 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

2510
02:07:55.811 --> 02:07:58.330
<v Speaker 2>even 50 percent sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2511
02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Which is more than you would expect from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a staton.</v>

2512
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.690
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this again,</v>

2513
02:08:04.691 --> 02:08:09.691
<v Speaker 2>this is another one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way more nuanced than it than it's </v>

2514
02:08:09.691 --> 02:08:13.261
<v Speaker 2>made out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is true that ldl particles play </v>

2515
02:08:13.821 --> 02:08:17.620
<v Speaker 2>an important role in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in how heart disease develops,</v>

2516
02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:22.980
<v Speaker 2>but this dominant paradigm notion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat and dietary cholesterol </v>

2517
02:08:23.981 --> 02:08:27.460
<v Speaker 2>are the main things that influence our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ldl particle number is false.</v>

2518
02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:32.610
<v Speaker 3>My friend anthony bourdain was taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>statents cause he,</v>

2519
02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:37.620
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to eat a lot when still eats a </v>

2520
02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:39.130
<v Speaker 3>lot and he was developing high blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure and you know,</v>

2521
02:08:39.210 --> 02:08:42.630
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the issues that were just outlining,</v>

2522
02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.210
<v Speaker 3>he started training every day doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>brazilian jujitsu,</v>

2523
02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:49.350
<v Speaker 3>like got really obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No longer has to take stanton's right.</v>

2524
02:08:49.630 --> 02:08:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Changed his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed his cholesterol profile,</v>

2525
02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:56.250
<v Speaker 3>which is really kind of fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's eating healthier,</v>

2526
02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:59.490
<v Speaker 3>but to me that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

2527
02:08:59.550 --> 02:09:01.200
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very strange thing.</v>

2528
02:09:01.201 --> 02:09:06.201
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is happeNing that's causing his </v>

2529
02:09:06.201 --> 02:09:07.360
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol to drop because of exercise </v>
<v Speaker 3>at 58.</v>

2530
02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Did he lose weight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lost a lot of ways.</v>

2531
02:09:10.230 --> 02:09:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Thirty pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fastest way you can normalize your </v>

2532
02:09:15.230 --> 02:09:15.370
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol profile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a profile in your,</v>

2533
02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:20.550
<v Speaker 2>your really your ldl particle number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is even more important and your </v>

2534
02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:24.430
<v Speaker 2>blood pressure is weight loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why is it a contributing factor?</v>

2535
02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:29.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just there's a whole constellation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of metabolic changes that happens when </v>

2536
02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:33.130
<v Speaker 2>we become overweight that include </v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin resistance and leptin resistance</v>

2537
02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:35.890
<v Speaker 2>of the gut issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you outlines all the gut issues,</v>

2538
02:09:35.891 --> 02:09:40.891
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this creates like a glue that leads </v>

2539
02:09:40.891 --> 02:09:41.200
<v Speaker 2>to dyslipidemia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this.</v>

2540
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:47.430
<v Speaker 2>So each particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we talked about this at the cars on </v>

2541
02:09:48.011 --> 02:09:50.320
<v Speaker 2>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a car can only hold so much,</v>

2542
02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:52.300
<v Speaker 2>so many passengers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2543
02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:57.840
<v Speaker 2>and if you have a lot of fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fats will take up all the space and </v>

2544
02:09:58.691 --> 02:10:03.691
<v Speaker 2>the cars and you will need more cars to </v>
<v Speaker 2>carry a given amount of cholesterol </v>

2545
02:10:04.330 --> 02:10:09.330
<v Speaker 2>around the body because we need </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol for sex hormone production </v>

2546
02:10:09.330 --> 02:10:10.690
<v Speaker 2>and other things that you mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier in the show.</v>

2547
02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:14.800
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a lot of triglyceride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of fat in your liver,</v>

2548
02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:20.280
<v Speaker 2>the liver will maKe more ldl particles </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it needs more particles to carry</v>

2549
02:10:20.771 --> 02:10:23.170
<v Speaker 2>the amount of cholesterol that needs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get around the body.</v>

2550
02:10:23.230 --> 02:10:26.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's actually what's happening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that might've been too much detail,</v>

2551
02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:30.460
<v Speaker 2>but that's why when you're overweight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have more fat,</v>

2552
02:10:31.090 --> 02:10:34.670
<v Speaker 2>you actually have a higher ldl particle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you loSe weight,</v>

2553
02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:36.800
<v Speaker 2>the converse happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2554
02:10:36.810 --> 02:10:40.280
<v Speaker 2>you need fewer particles to transport </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same amount of cholesterol,</v>

2555
02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:43.670
<v Speaker 2>so your ldl particle will go down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2556
02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:44.810
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2557
02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:47.480
<v Speaker 2>insulin and leptin sensitivity will </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve,</v>

2558
02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:52.540
<v Speaker 2>your gut may improve also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your blood pressure will typically </v>

2559
02:10:52.911 --> 02:10:56.360
<v Speaker 2>go down because the heart doesn't need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work as hard to pump as much blood.</v>

2560
02:10:56.580 --> 02:10:58.800
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2561
02:10:58.970 --> 02:11:00.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terminology of</v>

2562
02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:05.150
<v Speaker 3>bad cholesterol versus good cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 3>is Kind of problematic,</v>

2563
02:11:05.151 --> 02:11:08.870
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it doesn't ldl play some sort of</v>

2564
02:11:08.871 --> 02:11:11.780
<v Speaker 3>beneficial roles if you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminate ldl?</v>

2565
02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:12.680
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2566
02:11:12.681 --> 02:11:14.810
<v Speaker 2>some have argued that it should be zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

2567
02:11:14.970 --> 02:11:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that makes much sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically.</v>

2568
02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm one role that it plaYs is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>antimicrobial ldl particles are </v>

2569
02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:24.630
<v Speaker 2>antimicrobial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2570
02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:27.280
<v Speaker 2>so that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if toxins do get into the bloodstream,</v>

2571
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:31.820
<v Speaker 2>like lip lipopolysaccharide for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ldl particles can be,</v>

2572
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:36.850
<v Speaker 2>will be manufactured to deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one reason why chronic </v>

2573
02:11:36.850 --> 02:11:40.091
<v Speaker 2>infections increase ldl particle number </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the body is attempting to deal </v>

2574
02:11:40.091 --> 02:11:42.380
<v Speaker 2>with that infection and the toxins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2575
02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:47.980
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ldl particles are like a taxi </v>

2576
02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:48.800
<v Speaker 2>service that carry nutrients to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the body,</v>

2577
02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>fat soluble vitamins and fats liKe </v>
<v Speaker 2>triglycerides and antioxidants too that </v>

2578
02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:58.160
<v Speaker 2>we need to function properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a question of balance.</v>

2579
02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:03.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to keep our ldl particle and </v>

2580
02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:05.990
<v Speaker 2>arrange that contributes to health and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't increase our risk substantially </v>

2581
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.020
<v Speaker 2>for</v>

2582
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:07.680
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2583
02:12:07.681 --> 02:12:12.681
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so over simplified in the way </v>

2584
02:12:13.561 --> 02:12:16.680
<v Speaker 3>people describe them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sort of leads people to think,</v>

2585
02:12:16.681 --> 02:12:21.681
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just need to take a stat and almost </v>

2586
02:12:21.681 --> 02:12:23.910
<v Speaker 3>take a pill and this is the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>being described to people that have </v>

2587
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:27.861
<v Speaker 3>these issues by doctors and these very </v>
<v Speaker 3>brief seven minute minute meetings that </v>

2588
02:12:27.861 --> 02:12:32.040
<v Speaker 3>they're having with their doctors for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next person in line gets in this.</v>

2589
02:12:32.370 --> 02:12:37.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a really bad system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really bad system that and look </v>

2590
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:42.430
<v Speaker 3>where we're having this conversation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a person who obviously I didn't go </v>

2591
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:46.521
<v Speaker 3>to school for this and I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take all this stuff in over a period of </v>

2592
02:12:46.531 --> 02:12:51.210
<v Speaker 3>years of reading and watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentaries and talking to people like</v>

2593
02:12:51.211 --> 02:12:55.090
<v Speaker 3>you and dr rhonda patrick and and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2594
02:12:55.170 --> 02:13:00.170
<v Speaker 3>so many different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rob wolf and so many dIfferent people </v>

2595
02:13:00.170 --> 02:13:03.291
<v Speaker 3>that are experts in nutrition and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way the body processes nutrients and I'm</v>

2596
02:13:04.231 --> 02:13:09.231
<v Speaker 3>still baffled by a massive amount of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Given the many,</v>

2597
02:13:09.241 --> 02:13:09.810
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

2598
02:13:09.811 --> 02:13:12.570
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many hours I've been paying attention to</v>

2599
02:13:12.571 --> 02:13:13.130
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2600
02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:15.240
<v Speaker 3>it's incredibly complex.</v>

2601
02:13:15.490 --> 02:13:17.890
<v Speaker 2>So complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's liKe any other pursuit.</v>

2602
02:13:17.891 --> 02:13:20.490
<v Speaker 2>I think the more you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last,</v>

2603
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:22.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you can just say,</v>

2604
02:13:23.170 --> 02:13:25.660
<v Speaker 2>you realize that you can spend your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime,</v>

2605
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:30.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning about this and you still have </v>

2606
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 2>many lifetimes to go before you felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you really could master it.</v>

2607
02:13:32.290 --> 02:13:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think dennis mckenna had a great way </v>

2608
02:13:37.290 --> 02:13:37.290
<v Speaker 3>of describing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm learning something and realizing how</v>

2609
02:13:37.290 --> 02:13:38.170
<v Speaker 3>little you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one,</v>

2610
02:13:38.230 --> 02:13:43.230
<v Speaker 3>the bonfire of understanding increases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IT illuminates the surface layer of </v>

2611
02:13:44.411 --> 02:13:45.520
<v Speaker 3>ignorance greater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2612
02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2613
02:13:47.010 --> 02:13:50.700
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly how I feel about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

2614
02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I think our knowledge is advancing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are in a different place even just 10</v>

2615
02:13:55.741 --> 02:13:57.500
<v Speaker 2>years ago than we were 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2616
02:13:57.540 --> 02:13:58.980
<v Speaker 2>We understand things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2617
02:13:59.430 --> 02:14:01.410
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe some doctors know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2618
02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of people that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to their doctor and dr.</v>

2619
02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:04.480
<v Speaker 3>Golf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2620
02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:06.200
<v Speaker 2>that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2621
02:14:06.210 --> 02:14:10.920
<v Speaker 2>well these guys and these so called </v>
<v Speaker 2>experts and they'll go on about it.</v>

2622
02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Here's the interesting thing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one is that,</v>

2623
02:14:15.090 --> 02:14:20.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real lag time between what's </v>

2624
02:14:20.090 --> 02:14:23.080
<v Speaker 2>in the scientific literature that anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>can access.</v>

2625
02:14:23.081 --> 02:14:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they may not,</v>

2626
02:14:24.821 --> 02:14:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you may average person doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to the full text,</v>

2627
02:14:27.521 --> 02:14:32.521
<v Speaker 2>but anyone could go to pubmed.gov</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pull up abstracts from the hundreds </v>

2628
02:14:32.521 --> 02:14:37.030
<v Speaker 2>of thousands of scientific studies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are published and you will see if you do</v>

2629
02:14:37.031 --> 02:14:38.790
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're inclined to do that,</v>

2630
02:14:39.230 --> 02:14:40.490
<v Speaker 2>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2631
02:14:40.650 --> 02:14:45.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of recent research </v>

2632
02:14:45.650 --> 02:14:48.481
<v Speaker 2>suggests that saturated dietary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat and dietary cholesterol </v>

2633
02:14:48.481 --> 02:14:50.260
<v Speaker 2>are not major risk factors for heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

2634
02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:55.800
<v Speaker 2>But the time it will take for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge to percolate down to the </v>

2635
02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:00.151
<v Speaker 2>average primary care provider is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks or months or even years.</v>

2636
02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:05.340
<v Speaker 2>It's probably decades because that's how</v>
<v Speaker 2>long it took for the idea that saturated</v>

2637
02:15:06.761 --> 02:15:10.120
<v Speaker 2>fat and dietary cholesterol are bad for </v>
<v Speaker 2>us to get hammered into our heads.</v>

2638
02:15:10.121 --> 02:15:15.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that started in the fifties and it </v>

2639
02:15:15.121 --> 02:15:17.491
<v Speaker 2>didn't really sink in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think until the eighties or the </v>

2640
02:15:17.491 --> 02:15:17.491
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2641
02:15:17.491 --> 02:15:21.481
<v Speaker 2>with the boneless chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skinless chicken breast and the bagels </v>

2642
02:15:21.481 --> 02:15:22.440
<v Speaker 2>with no butter or cream cheese and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2643
02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:24.980
<v Speaker 2>like that was my generation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2644
02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:27.670
<v Speaker 2>pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carb loading and that whole thing.</v>

2645
02:15:28.150 --> 02:15:31.210
<v Speaker 2>That was 30 years aFter this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign started.</v>

2646
02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:37.020
<v Speaker 2>and unfortunately I think it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take another couple of decades and </v>

2647
02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:40.810
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it will go faster this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in there are some signs that it is </v>

2648
02:15:40.810 --> 02:15:43.300
<v Speaker 2>going faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the average primary care provider,</v>

2649
02:15:43.630 --> 02:15:46.450
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing patients 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 hours a week.</v>

2650
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:48.880
<v Speaker 2>They have families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have other,</v>

2651
02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:51.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that theIr own health to consider.</v>

2652
02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:54.100
<v Speaker 2>They're not going home at night and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the scientific literature.</v>

2653
02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:57.430
<v Speaker 2>They are trying to take care of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients,</v>

2654
02:15:57.431 --> 02:16:02.431
<v Speaker 2>trying to live their own life and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>only know what they were taught in </v>

2655
02:16:02.431 --> 02:16:02.470
<v Speaker 2>medical school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2656
02:16:02.650 --> 02:16:07.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they're doing continuing </v>

2657
02:16:07.650 --> 02:16:09.031
<v Speaker 2>education and the medical school tech </v>
<v Speaker 2>textbooks are out of date as soon as </v>

2658
02:16:09.031 --> 02:16:10.170
<v Speaker 2>they're printed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2659
02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:14.140
<v Speaker 2>and they're based on studies that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>done 50 or 40 or 50 years ago.</v>

2660
02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:19.860
<v Speaker 2>So this is a huge problem in medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>education is that the current research,</v>

2661
02:16:20.590 --> 02:16:21.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2662
02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:26.280
<v Speaker 2>the public policy and the standard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>care is not based on the most recent </v>

2663
02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:31.231
<v Speaker 2>research and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the peer reviewed evidence that we </v>

2664
02:16:31.231 --> 02:16:34.290
<v Speaker 2>available to us now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's based off and on research that's </v>

2665
02:16:34.290 --> 02:16:34.290
<v Speaker 2>decades old.</v>

2666
02:16:34.290 --> 02:16:38.350
<v Speaker 3>This stuff takes so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The process people have these podcasts </v>

2667
02:16:38.350 --> 02:16:42.461
<v Speaker 3>and they go over him three or four times</v>
<v Speaker 3>and start taking notes and just try to </v>

2668
02:16:42.461 --> 02:16:46.331
<v Speaker 3>make these changes in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to give someone advice as </v>

2669
02:16:46.331 --> 02:16:50.111
<v Speaker 3>to what is the best way to proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone's listening to this podcast </v>

2670
02:16:50.111 --> 02:16:50.111
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2671
02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:53.600
<v Speaker 3>obviously I really need to know what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in my gut.</v>

2672
02:16:53.690 --> 02:16:55.610
<v Speaker 3>I need to know what'S going on with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2673
02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:56.690
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2674
02:16:56.780 --> 02:16:59.110
<v Speaker 3>my overall blood lipids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my health.</v>

2675
02:16:59.510 --> 02:17:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my nutrient density.</v>

2676
02:17:01.221 --> 02:17:01.850
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2677
02:17:01.851 --> 02:17:03.680
<v Speaker 3>what do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does the average person to do?</v>

2678
02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2679
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:08.390
<v Speaker 2>So I think the first very first thing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can set them up in three words,</v>

2680
02:17:08.391 --> 02:17:11.540
<v Speaker 2>eat real food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2681
02:17:11.541 --> 02:17:13.400
<v Speaker 2>you can talk about paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>primal,</v>

2682
02:17:13.401 --> 02:17:14.600
<v Speaker 2>paleo template.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2683
02:17:14.601 --> 02:17:15.930
<v Speaker 2>that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2684
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that that's a step above,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just eating real food,</v>

2685
02:17:19.521 --> 02:17:22.280
<v Speaker 2>like avoiding things that come in a bag </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a box,</v>

2686
02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:24.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>butter comes into box.</v>

2687
02:17:24.081 --> 02:17:25.910
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not get too hung up on that.</v>

2688
02:17:25.911 --> 02:17:27.400
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When can say that,</v>

2689
02:17:27.470 --> 02:17:30.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actual actual real food,</v>

2690
02:17:30.650 --> 02:17:35.650
<v Speaker 2>vegetables that come out come out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and fruits and nuts and seeds and</v>

2691
02:17:36.141 --> 02:17:38.090
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even some tubers,</v>

2692
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:40.790
<v Speaker 2>sweet potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think white potatoes get a bad rap and</v>

2693
02:17:40.791 --> 02:17:43.070
<v Speaker 2>they're fine for most people as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

2694
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:48.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fried and crappy oil and the skins are </v>

2695
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.150
<v Speaker 2>actually really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

2696
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.830
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat some,</v>

2697
02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:51.770
<v Speaker 2>some good pasture raised organic if </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

2698
02:17:51.771 --> 02:17:55.490
<v Speaker 2>animal products and wild caught fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2699
02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:58.340
<v Speaker 2>if yOu can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really think that,</v>

2700
02:17:58.390 --> 02:18:03.390
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would solve 80 percent of people's </v>

2701
02:18:03.390 --> 02:18:06.221
<v Speaker 2>problems if you're already doing that or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've already got that down and you're </v>

2702
02:18:06.221 --> 02:18:10.841
<v Speaker 2>still having additional issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThIs is where functional medicine comes </v>

2703
02:18:10.841 --> 02:18:14.321
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we've kind of touched on at </v>

2704
02:18:14.321 --> 02:18:14.321
<v Speaker 2>various points along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2705
02:18:14.321 --> 02:18:18.820
<v Speaker 2>but this is an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a relatively new and fast growing </v>

2706
02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:22.751
<v Speaker 2>branch of medicine that is focused on </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing the underlying cause of </v>

2707
02:18:22.751 --> 02:18:22.751
<v Speaker 2>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you Know,</v>

2708
02:18:22.751 --> 02:18:26.480
<v Speaker 2>taking the pebble out of the shoe </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of just suppressing symptoms.</v>

2709
02:18:26.570 --> 02:18:30.320
<v Speaker 2>And there are several training </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations out there.</v>

2710
02:18:30.321 --> 02:18:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Institute for functional medicine is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2711
02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:35.420
<v Speaker 2>is been around the longest and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty well known.</v>

2712
02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I have kresser institute which just </v>
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>

2713
02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:42.150
<v Speaker 2>we're trAining the 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have 200 doctors and other healthcare</v>

2714
02:18:42.170 --> 02:18:43.880
<v Speaker 2>professionalS in the program now.</v>

2715
02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:49.440
<v Speaker 2>And you can go to these websites and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look for practitioners that practice </v>

2716
02:18:49.791 --> 02:18:54.791
<v Speaker 2>functional medicine and unfortunately </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not yet at the level where there's </v>

2717
02:18:54.791 --> 02:18:57.890
<v Speaker 2>one on every corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even like a yoga studio.</v>

2718
02:18:58.470 --> 02:19:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's changing fast.</v>

2719
02:19:00.381 --> 02:19:02.000
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2720
02:19:02.390 --> 02:19:07.390
<v Speaker 2>mark hyman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a nine time number one New York </v>

2721
02:19:07.390 --> 02:19:10.730
<v Speaker 2>times bestselling author dot a health </v>
<v Speaker 2>expert.</v>

2722
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:15.790
<v Speaker 2>He recently was tapped to start the </v>
<v Speaker 2>center for functional medicine at the </v>

2723
02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:20.770
<v Speaker 2>cleveland clinic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very prestigious medical </v>

2724
02:19:20.770 --> 02:19:22.700
<v Speaker 2>institution and they already have a six </v>
<v Speaker 2>month wait list and it's just,</v>

2725
02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:25.380
<v Speaker 2>it's blowing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the tide is turning and,</v>

2726
02:19:25.381 --> 02:19:30.381
<v Speaker 2>and pretty soon a lot of people will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing functional medicine </v>

2727
02:19:30.381 --> 02:19:31.500
<v Speaker 2>practitioners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2728
02:19:31.970 --> 02:19:36.970
<v Speaker 2>but these are the practitioners that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to be knowledgeable about how to </v>

2729
02:19:36.970 --> 02:19:37.190
<v Speaker 2>properly test your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>

2730
02:19:37.250 --> 02:19:40.380
<v Speaker 2>how to assess your hpa access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stress tolerance and,</v>

2731
02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:41.270
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2732
02:19:41.350 --> 02:19:42.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resilience.</v>

2733
02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:46.190
<v Speaker 2>How to look at your functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood chemistry panel.</v>

2734
02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:48.140
<v Speaker 2>So look at your blood sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your lipids,</v>

2735
02:19:48.141 --> 02:19:50.480
<v Speaker 2>your metabolic function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your vitamin d or b,</v>

2736
02:19:50.481 --> 02:19:55.481
<v Speaker 2>12 levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>take all of that information and then </v>

2737
02:19:55.481 --> 02:19:59.770
<v Speaker 2>create a customized individual plan for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you based on all of your lab test </v>

2738
02:20:00.951 --> 02:20:04.400
<v Speaker 2>results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your current symptoms and signs,</v>

2739
02:20:04.401 --> 02:20:06.650
<v Speaker 2>your health history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your family history,</v>

2740
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:11.840
<v Speaker 2>and your lifestyle and put all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and then make a plan for you.</v>

2741
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:14.690
<v Speaker 2>And as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that takes time.</v>

2742
02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:15.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2743
02:20:15.231 --> 02:20:18.140
<v Speaker 2>the typical first appointment is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>like an hour and a half,</v>

2744
02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 2>then seven minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also,</v>

2745
02:20:22.510 --> 02:20:27.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be more expensive because there's a </v>

2746
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:29.471
<v Speaker 2>lot of lab work that's done up front to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out what's causing the </v>

2747
02:20:29.471 --> 02:20:33.431
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would argue that it's less </v>

2748
02:20:33.431 --> 02:20:36.320
<v Speaker 2>expensive over the longterm because when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you address the root of the problem,</v>

2749
02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:41.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the treatment is going to be way more </v>

2750
02:20:41.770 --> 02:20:42.170
<v Speaker 2>effective and it's going to be way </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer lasting.</v>

2751
02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:48.200
<v Speaker 3>And I think I can say from my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal experience from someone who's </v>

2752
02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:53.091
<v Speaker 3>changed their diet in eliminated almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>all sugar in terms of like added sugar,</v>

2753
02:20:54.330 --> 02:20:55.440
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very little.</v>

2754
02:20:55.470 --> 02:20:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Do I take in a daily basis are </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminated.</v>

2755
02:20:58.050 --> 02:21:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Almost all simple carbs and my energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels are so much better.</v>

2756
02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't craSh like I used to.</v>

2757
02:21:05.610 --> 02:21:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I feel like overall my health is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked about my,</v>

2758
02:21:09.391 --> 02:21:14.391
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>increased over the last few years of </v>

2759
02:21:14.391 --> 02:21:14.910
<v Speaker 3>probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made a giant benefit,</v>

2760
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:19.950
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It made a huge impact in terms of my </v>

2761
02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:21.450
<v Speaker 3>ability to recover from illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my ability to avoid on the sis.</v>

2762
02:21:21.630 --> 02:21:24.300
<v Speaker 3>And I have little kids so my kids are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>travel,</v>

2763
02:21:24.301 --> 02:21:27.960
<v Speaker 3>which I travel in airplanes and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like disease vector labs,</v>

2764
02:21:27.961 --> 02:21:32.961
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I survived them so much better than </v>

2765
02:21:32.961 --> 02:21:34.020
<v Speaker 3>a lot of my peers who don't take care of</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves the same way.</v>

2766
02:21:34.050 --> 02:21:39.050
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes a big difference in that </v>

2767
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:41.750
<v Speaker 3>overall quality of life difference is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>significant and it has such an impact on</v>

2768
02:21:42.421 --> 02:21:45.060
<v Speaker 3>your productivity and your energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>

2769
02:21:45.070 --> 02:21:50.070
<v Speaker 3>your happiness because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly fighting diseases and </v>

2770
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:53.691
<v Speaker 3>illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is another thing that people I </v>

2771
02:21:53.691 --> 02:21:56.691
<v Speaker 3>think ignore or maybe you are not really</v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of is the function of your health </v>

2772
02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:04.940
<v Speaker 3>and your immune system and your gut </v>
<v Speaker 3>biome and how it translates into your </v>

2773
02:22:05.191 --> 02:22:06.600
<v Speaker 3>actual personality.</v>

2774
02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:10.010
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad you brought that up.</v>

2775
02:22:10.130 --> 02:22:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it does that in a Couple of </v>

2776
02:22:15.130 --> 02:22:17.051
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Is just the actual chemical </v>

2777
02:22:17.051 --> 02:22:17.990
<v Speaker 2>influence that we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year gut bacteria,</v>

2778
02:22:17.991 --> 02:22:21.380
<v Speaker 2>how it influences your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brain chemistry can affect your mood,</v>

2779
02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:24.570
<v Speaker 2>but the other I think is more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2780
02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:29.640
<v Speaker 2>related to just how you experienced your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2781
02:22:29.641 --> 02:22:32.520
<v Speaker 2>When you feel good versus when you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>crappy.</v>

2782
02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:35.160
<v Speaker 2>like you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your productivity increases,</v>

2783
02:22:35.161 --> 02:22:38.220
<v Speaker 2>you're just happier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have more time to be effective,</v>

2784
02:22:38.250 --> 02:22:43.220
<v Speaker 2>and you're probably able to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>present with your kids and your,</v>

2785
02:22:43.310 --> 02:22:48.310
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a relationship with your </v>

2786
02:22:48.310 --> 02:22:48.310
<v Speaker 2>partner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it's,</v>

2787
02:22:48.310 --> 02:22:52.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a dramatic difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the downsides of how </v>

2788
02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:56.901
<v Speaker 2>adaptable we are as human beings is we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get used to some pretty heavy stuff </v>

2789
02:22:57.540 --> 02:23:02.540
<v Speaker 2>and people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people I think are sick and </v>

2790
02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:03.510
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least they're not.</v>

2791
02:23:03.511 --> 02:23:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2792
02:23:04.411 --> 02:23:08.390
<v Speaker 2>they're not really healthy and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of normalization of that.</v>

2793
02:23:08.410 --> 02:23:11.520
<v Speaker 2>The top that happens in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2794
02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just common to that people are </v>

2795
02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:18.810
<v Speaker 2>taking drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are taking more than one drug.</v>

2796
02:23:18.811 --> 02:23:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2797
02:23:19.410 --> 02:23:21.330
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't feel well,</v>

2798
02:23:21.331 --> 02:23:23.720
<v Speaker 2>they're not sleeping well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2799
02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:26.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's common,</v>

2800
02:23:26.371 --> 02:23:31.371
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's normal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a really important difference </v>

2801
02:23:31.371 --> 02:23:33.891
<v Speaker 2>between what's common and what's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an awesome point and I </v>

2802
02:23:33.891 --> 02:23:33.891
<v Speaker 2>think</v>
