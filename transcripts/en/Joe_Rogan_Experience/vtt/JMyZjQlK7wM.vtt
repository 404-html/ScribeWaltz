<v Speaker 2>Carlos condit and Irwin the core.</v>

4
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Welcome gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome.</v>

5
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate you.</v>

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having us.</v>

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 2>for folks who are not aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Carlos Professional MMA fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best in the world,</v>

11
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:32.991
<v Speaker 2>just fought for the welterweight title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extremely close fight against Robbie </v>

12
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.811
<v Speaker 2>lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you spent a lot of your time this </v>

13
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many camps was it?</v>

14
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Were you trained with Irwin to now to </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

15
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Irwin,</v>

16
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 2>you are a movement specialist and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is all the rage in mma right now.</v>

17
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 2>It's gets really kind of fascinating as </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sport grows and develops.</v>

18
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.110
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at a sport that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>only realistically been around since </v>

19
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.031
<v Speaker 2>1993.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when it sort of form martial </v>

20
00:00:59.031 --> 00:00:59.031
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course had been around forever,</v>

21
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:03.050
<v Speaker 2>but as a sport where people really </v>
<v Speaker 2>started picking it apart and trying to </v>

22
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's the best way to pursue</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

23
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 2>It's really only been since about 1993 </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the UFC first started and the most </v>

24
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:13.791
<v Speaker 2>recent trend is guys trying to improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon balance movement and their ability </v>

25
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:21.381
<v Speaker 2>to close distances and attack and be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a position to constantly be able to do </v>

26
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:28.911
<v Speaker 2>that in between those techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of concentrating on just </v>

27
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 2>hitting pads or just doing shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>doubles or doing various drills,</v>

28
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 2>you're concentrating on the movements </v>
<v Speaker 2>that take place in between those </v>

29
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 2>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a fair way to describe it?</v>

30
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

31
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that the movement,</v>

32
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also helps,</v>

33
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

34
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 3>in the techniques themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

35
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:50.050
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can focus specifically</v>

36
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 2>play on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

37
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts technique techniques which </v>

38
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 2>are know on a base level movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

39
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how did you guys get hooked up?</v>

40
00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I reached out to,</v>

41
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.850
<v Speaker 3>to Carlos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of your requirements that you </v>

43
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 3>were commenting on one of those UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>events and uh,</v>

44
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talked about the current state of </v>

45
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 3>the welterweight division and at some </v>
<v Speaker 3>point you talked about Carlos and he was</v>

46
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 3>still recovering from his injury and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you said that at this point,</v>

47
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

48
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:18.720
<v Speaker 3>he was 31 or four years old back then </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

49
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 3>it was a serious injury and that from </v>
<v Speaker 3>then on it could only somewhat gets </v>

50
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 3>slower and that made me react because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was both true and not true.</v>

51
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From a conventional standpoint,</v>

52
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But from a,</v>

53
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a training,</v>

54
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 3>coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a movement practice standpoint,</v>

55
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I knew that there was a possibility to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

56
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reverse that,</v>

57
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 3>to improve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

58
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 3>And that this is actually a vacuum and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that made me think Carlos is right </v>

59
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

60
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.520
<v Speaker 3>I need to reach out to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can train him and I can show that </v>

61
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Speaker 3>there are some different methods that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can bring results.</v>

62
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Even in a seasoned fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

63
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.930
<v Speaker 3>like Carlos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is your background turning in the </v>

64
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.821
<v Speaker 3>woods a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The window was a kid moving in the </v>

65
00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:05.821
<v Speaker 3>woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing trees,</v>

66
00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:07.760
<v Speaker 3>jumping from rock to rock and being </v>
<v Speaker 3>lonely,</v>

67
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 3>being encouraged to do that by my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>dad.</v>

68
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

69
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.990
<v Speaker 3>in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then later on I did some extreme </v>

70
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:23.161
<v Speaker 3>trainings I would say in Paris with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very small group and we would climb </v>

71
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:27.620
<v Speaker 3>scaffoldings and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will jump off bridges and we would </v>

72
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 3>balance on top of the class scaffoldings</v>
<v Speaker 3>like popcorn type stuff.</v>

73
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a part of the movement because,</v>

74
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the founder of par core,</v>

75
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 3>David Bill was almost my neighbor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>practically we're the same age,</v>

76
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:45.121
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't know each other back then </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was filling in all the guy and we </v>

77
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 3>would do these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

78
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 3>these trainings because we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat,</v>

79
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to go against the normalcy that,</v>

80
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how heavy the nurse you have normalcy of</v>

81
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 3>wanting to do a to know ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

82
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.090
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through movements and exercises and </v>

83
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 3>challenges that were complete out of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of this world.</v>

84
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by heavy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The inertia of normalcy?</v>

85
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 3>What exactly do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

86
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to save at normal of silent </v>
<v Speaker 3>killer.</v>

87
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.380
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are just extremely bored</v>
<v Speaker 3>by their day to day routines and kills </v>

88
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.821
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shrinks their comfort zone all the </v>

89
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:23.821
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

90
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:24.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it rubs their,</v>

91
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their creativity,</v>

92
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their vitality,</v>

93
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're not meant to live such </v>

94
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 3>predictable lives and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

95
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 3>we're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to be extremely </v>

96
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.860
<v Speaker 3>adaptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mental and physical level and we,</v>

97
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.900
<v Speaker 3>we need to train that adaptability by a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>presenting ourselves with the challenges</v>

98
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 3>that are going to maintain that </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptability.</v>

99
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's we need a strategy.</v>

100
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a lifestyle is boring,</v>

101
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 3>if we're born in our lives board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our lifestyle,</v>

102
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing in this world that's </v>

103
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 3>going to really a change that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertain ourselves.</v>

104
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 3>We can consume tons of entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we need truly to get out of </v>

105
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.441
<v Speaker 3>this is a strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a to a perception of oneself that is </v>

106
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

107
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 3>And then the strategy that's in line </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that perception of a strongest self</v>

108
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 3>have a more free self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

109
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a very philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you asked me about it.</v>

110
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just telling you,</v>

111
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

112
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 3>the West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it,</v>

113
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.820
<v Speaker 3>if I had followed a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

114
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.210
<v Speaker 3>what the box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the textbooks,</v>

115
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.290
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

116
00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 3>the conventions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not be in the place I am today,</v>

117
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.860
<v Speaker 3>I would not have done what I've created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a philosophy as much as it's a </v>

118
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 3>training modality because everything in </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is philosophy,</v>

119
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 3>but you call it philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outlook,</v>

120
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion,</v>

121
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 3>values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you call it,</v>

122
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 3>it's something in your mind is a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>perception</v>

123
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 4>that makes you see yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see the world a certain way and behave </v>

124
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 4>accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bodybuilder,</v>

125
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 4>you may,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may think that it's purely physical,</v>

126
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a philosophy.</v>

127
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 4>The guy who wants to be big as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>perception of himself as being very big </v>

128
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.950
<v Speaker 4>and he's getting to train accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it always starts with the perception </v>

129
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 4>and then you behave accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everything in that sense,</v>

130
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.110
<v Speaker 4>his philosophy now when you met this </v>
<v Speaker 4>character will apply to all these </v>

131
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:33.371
<v Speaker 4>movement teachers look like Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's a question that's been </v>

132
00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 4>coming up over and over again on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>forums when I feel obligated to ask.</v>

133
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there are a lot of the,</v>

134
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the naturalistic persuasion.</v>

135
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.260
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

136
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 4>first first impression of Irwin was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's very intense.</v>

137
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.630
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went and we know there's a wooded </v>

138
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 4>area there in albuquerque and we thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go play around,</v>

139
00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk on some,</v>

140
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk on some blogs and just kick in </v>

141
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>

142
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

143
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.020
<v Speaker 4>we're working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was from the first time that we </v>

144
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 4>started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was demanding excellence and,</v>

145
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>demanding,</v>

146
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite a bit of,</v>

147
00:07:15.271 --> 00:07:15.880
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

148
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.730
<v Speaker 4>of focus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for me,</v>

149
00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:22.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of like an add type of person </v>

150
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:22.731
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

151
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I fight.</v>

152
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of different things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can move,</v>

153
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 4>I can play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can focus at certain times,</v>

154
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:29.800
<v Speaker 4>then go fuck around at other times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

155
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.140
<v Speaker 4>and I'm working with Erwin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not only been a beneficial for,</v>

156
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 4>for me physically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also,</v>

157
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

158
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 4>as far as my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

159
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.580
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

160
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.170
<v Speaker 4>focus and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just my,</v>

161
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 4>my attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm physically.</v>

162
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 4>Initially it was hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

163
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was maybe seven or eight months off my</v>

164
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:51.960
<v Speaker 4>knee surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

165
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.550
<v Speaker 4>my body was stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a great physical therapist and we </v>

166
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 4>were making progress in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that respect.</v>

167
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.320
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

168
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a lot of imbalances.</v>

169
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was still kind of fucked up.</v>

170
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.770
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

171
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 4>what type of knee surgery you had?</v>
<v Speaker 4>ACL reconstruction.</v>

172
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 4>Did you get cadaver or Patella?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an allograft or cadaver.</v>

173
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 4>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my favorite one.</v>

174
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:20.711
<v Speaker 4>I encourage people to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know the guys have said that it </v>

175
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 4>doesn't take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when guys say it doesn't take,</v>

176
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 4>I always wonder if they were training </v>
<v Speaker 4>too hard,</v>

177
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.430
<v Speaker 4>too quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

178
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a good friend who's a,</v>

179
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:27.400
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

180
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.570
<v Speaker 4>a orthopedic surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

181
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 4>he told me that it's strong initially </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they use somebody,</v>

182
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.920
<v Speaker 4>a Achilles tendon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is four times thicker than your </v>

183
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 4>actual 50 percent stronger than a </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular acl.</v>

184
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 4>But as your body's assimilating it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

185
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.950
<v Speaker 4>it gets weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It apparently your body does this </v>

186
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.540
<v Speaker 4>scaffolding of its own cells around it </v>
<v Speaker 4>as it's assimilating it to your own </v>

187
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 4>tissue and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets weaker during that point.</v>

188
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 4>Eventually you wait a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 months,</v>

189
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be stronger than it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

190
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 4>But even that period,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>

191
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 4>eight months where you're feeling good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

192
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 4>the inflammation's gone away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the swelling has gone down.</v>

193
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

194
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 4>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel amazing.</v>

195
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 4>I can go fucking train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can go spar.</v>

196
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You blow it.</v>

197
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they say it didn't take.</v>

198
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 4>But that's not really true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

199
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's true.</v>

200
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've thankfully,</v>

201
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 4>from what I've talked to doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

202
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:28.041
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly how they said it too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you feel really good and you start </v>

203
00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 4>training hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you blow it out at Herman did that,</v>

204
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 4>Dominick Cruz did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of guys have done that and it's,</v>

205
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very common.</v>

206
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

207
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

208
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 4>Erwin and I started working together </v>
<v Speaker 4>initially.</v>

209
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.270
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

210
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do hardly any of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm a high level athlete and it was </v>

211
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 4>frustrating.</v>

212
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

213
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.440
<v Speaker 4>I would go and I didn't put a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>of information from him,</v>

214
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 4>I'd work a little bit by myself and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next time we worked at I had,</v>

215
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 4>I would have made some progress and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd worked together for,</v>

216
00:09:58.261 --> 00:09:59.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once a week,</v>

217
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 4>maybe twice a week for over a year now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now how,</v>

218
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.340
<v Speaker 4>how are your camp structured?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because a lot of people,</v>

219
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 4>they structure the camps are very </v>
<v Speaker 4>regimented.</v>

220
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:12.531
<v Speaker 4>They have the particular days for </v>
<v Speaker 4>strength and conditioning and it's all </v>

221
00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:15.720
<v Speaker 4>sort of design so that they have enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>time to recover for their skill work and</v>

222
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:20.721
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're working in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific techniques for a specific type </v>

223
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:23.961
<v Speaker 4>of fighter and you would have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>incorporate all these things and then </v>

224
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.790
<v Speaker 4>this movement training and stuff as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

225
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 4>Like how would you figure out when to </v>
<v Speaker 4>put that in?</v>

226
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:33.621
<v Speaker 4>Did you have to experiment or every camp</v>
<v Speaker 4>really isn't experiment because as I've </v>

227
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 4>grown as an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've changed as I've got older,</v>

228
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to take more time off than I did </v>

229
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:43.460
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

230
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:43.460
<v Speaker 4>I have to really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

231
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.790
<v Speaker 4>pay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay attention to my body.</v>

232
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.370
<v Speaker 4>So we do have somewhat of a structure </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

233
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 4>but it's also every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

234
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 4>all the scheduling is tentative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

235
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:53.670
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

236
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:56.700
<v Speaker 4>I have this scheduled on this day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I'm feeling like shit,</v>

237
00:10:56.701 --> 00:10:57.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to go in there and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

238
00:10:57.921 --> 00:10:59.150
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good way to get hurt.</v>

239
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 4>It's a big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

240
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 4>I can't get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you feel like real worn out,</v>

241
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 4>you have to sort of like really be </v>
<v Speaker 4>paying attention to your body?</v>

242
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

243
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we do active recovery.</v>

244
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 4>My strength conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the place that I,</v>

245
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.190
<v Speaker 4>that I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

246
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.630
<v Speaker 4>we do a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They use some biofeedback,</v>

247
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 4>a dove,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a software that is pretty cool.</v>

248
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:29.421
<v Speaker 4>You stick some fucking sticky pads on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your body and like ekg thing and it can </v>

249
00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:33.300
<v Speaker 4>actually tell you physiologically what </v>
<v Speaker 4>your readiness level is.</v>

250
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 4>And this is being used by a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

251
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:40.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm a professional athlete or </v>
<v Speaker 4>professional teams.</v>

252
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm a collegiate teams and professional </v>
<v Speaker 4>teams and Olympians.</v>

253
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 4>So the checking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like muscle balance,</v>

254
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.560
<v Speaker 4>a lactic acid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

255
00:11:49.561 --> 00:11:50.430
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

256
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 4>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does,</v>

257
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:56.211
<v Speaker 4>is it measures heart rate variability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a central nervous system activity </v>

258
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:01.470
<v Speaker 4>and the correlation between the two and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever their algorithm is that they </v>

259
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.980
<v Speaker 4>come up with to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

260
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:04.010
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

261
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the correlation means.</v>

262
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 4>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

263
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:09.710
<v Speaker 4>you got a little dumb screen that shows </v>
<v Speaker 4>you blue,</v>

264
00:12:09.711 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 4>blue or green,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yellow,</v>

265
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.360
<v Speaker 4>red as far as your trainability I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

266
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.600
<v Speaker 4>I can do strength and speed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

267
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 4>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my power and strength,</v>

268
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a level readiness is,</v>

269
00:12:22.181 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 4>is down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then so we,</v>

270
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 4>we use that as a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's sometimes you just got to go.</v>

271
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you've got to go old school </v>
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>

272
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:29.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

273
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

274
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.320
<v Speaker 4>this is fancy but I need to push through</v>
<v Speaker 4>the um,</v>

275
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:38.510
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a tool to help mitigate </v>

276
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:38.510
<v Speaker 4>overtraining.</v>

277
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

278
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:43.281
<v Speaker 4>that's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it seems like experience is probably </v>

279
00:12:43.281 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 4>the most important thing then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

280
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's hard though.</v>

281
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.570
<v Speaker 4>When I'm in training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a race horse man,</v>

282
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 4>I want to fucking run and I really need </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody to pull back the reigns.</v>

283
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:57.580
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes I can do that myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But sometimes I'm in fucking,</v>

284
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in shark frenzy mode,</v>

285
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 4>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

286
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:00.760
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

287
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:02.300
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

288
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

289
00:13:03.411 --> 00:13:04.430
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

290
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.570
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to have people around me to be </v>

291
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:09.570
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

292
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:09.570
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

293
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.160
<v Speaker 4>ticket to you to kick back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your relationship with Irwin,</v>

294
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.960
<v Speaker 4>when you guys first started with how did</v>
<v Speaker 4>you work in the movement training with </v>

295
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.071
<v Speaker 4>all the other stuff that you were doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you have like a specific day you'd </v>

296
00:13:23.071 --> 00:13:23.071
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

297
00:13:23.071 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 4>we're going to meet on Tuesday and.</v>

298
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty much who's Day aside?</v>

299
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

300
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 4>we would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

301
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>block out maybe three or four hours </v>

302
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.390
<v Speaker 4>later in the week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

303
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

304
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.330
<v Speaker 4>just hit it and it wasn't always </v>
<v Speaker 4>intense.</v>

305
00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 4>That was a cool thing about working with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Irwin.</v>

306
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like physically intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was um,</v>

307
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mentally and neurologically taxing.</v>

308
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 4>So after we did this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was absolutely wiped out,</v>

309
00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:48.870
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

310
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.120
<v Speaker 4>I got my heart rate up a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these weren't hard work as they </v>

311
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 4>weren't taking anatomy physically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

312
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:56.320
<v Speaker 4>So what was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what wiped you out about it?</v>

313
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

314
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.130
<v Speaker 4>we're training the neuromuscular system </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're training the,</v>

315
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could probably tell you more about it</v>

316
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:08.680
<v Speaker 4>than I than I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

317
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.090
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

318
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

319
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:13.500
<v Speaker 4>really precise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

320
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>movements that just tax tax tax you </v>

321
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.320
<v Speaker 4>neurologically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

322
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:21.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

323
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of,</v>

324
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.760
<v Speaker 3>for so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

325
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Carlos is surrounded by a war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a team of world class people,</v>

326
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:37.200
<v Speaker 3>a person who was talking about Adrian </v>
<v Speaker 3>have elevate I,</v>

327
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 3>albuquerque is a strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning coach.</v>

328
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 3>So he works specifically with him on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this area,</v>

329
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.290
<v Speaker 3>this trending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there is Brendan Gibson and </v>

330
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.671
<v Speaker 3>then there's and Dale and of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is Greg Jackson and when </v>

331
00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 3>controlling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

332
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so me,</v>

333
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

334
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 3>to address areas of training that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe the,</v>

335
00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:01.530
<v Speaker 3>where we're lacking a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was to find a word to describe what</v>

336
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:03.710
<v Speaker 3>we've been training with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

337
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlos would have been training your </v>

338
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.481
<v Speaker 3>brain because the number one reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a brain from an evolutionary </v>

339
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:15.671
<v Speaker 3>perspective is for movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not to discuss fine wine or the </v>

340
00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:16.640
<v Speaker 3>history of art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

341
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 3>But originally it's so about a year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>can navigate,</v>

342
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through complex movement,</v>

343
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 3>through complex environments.</v>

344
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason why we have a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

345
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.900
<v Speaker 3>so intensity is not necessarily a </v>
<v Speaker 3>raising the heart rate,</v>

346
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going real hard and burning all over.</v>

347
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Intensity can be in the mindfulness that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you apply to,</v>

348
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:46.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally perform movement very </v>

349
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.031
<v Speaker 3>specifically with a high level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>efficiency that requires a level of </v>

350
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:53.730
<v Speaker 3>focus that a challenges stimulates and </v>
<v Speaker 3>help the,</v>

351
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the connective,</v>

352
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>functions grope as a matter of fact,</v>

353
00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:01.940
<v Speaker 3>movement itself is a major,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not the major,</v>

354
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a secret or,</v>

355
00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:05.830
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

356
00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:08.150
<v Speaker 3>or reason for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

357
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 3>helping conductive functions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does a whole deal of,</v>

358
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

359
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:15.950
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

360
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:16.540
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

361
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>processes in the brain that's going to,</v>

362
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

363
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:26.111
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help it grow and what you acquire </v>

364
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:27.800
<v Speaker 3>through movement transfers to any area </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>

365
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.830
<v Speaker 3>But obviously transfers to better </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement and better movement is not </v>

366
00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:36.720
<v Speaker 3>always just more power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more uh,</v>

367
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 3>or new techniques.</v>

368
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 3>I told Carlos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlos,</v>

369
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been 20 for 13 years.</v>

370
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Your extremely seasoned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely experienced.</v>

371
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:51.340
<v Speaker 3>And I bet that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've tried a diverse modalities of </v>

372
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:51.780
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

373
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.830
<v Speaker 3>but that currently you are a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every camp is pretty much the same in </v>

374
00:16:57.681 --> 00:17:02.681
<v Speaker 3>term of preparation except what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific to a game plane for a given </v>

375
00:17:02.681 --> 00:17:06.830
<v Speaker 3>opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said you might try to acquire more,</v>

376
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:12.010
<v Speaker 3>more power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna take a lot of energy because </v>

377
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.330
<v Speaker 3>you have already a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

378
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.090
<v Speaker 3>of power for your while you're awake </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree,</v>

379
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may try to acquire more endurance,</v>

380
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:25.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's gonna be putting a lot of </v>

381
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:25.030
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of energy to get that.</v>

382
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.150
<v Speaker 3>You can try to learn more techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But do you have a hurry?</v>

383
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Know already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many techniques.</v>

384
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that you can do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

385
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.600
<v Speaker 3>to move better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So any technique that you already know,</v>

386
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.990
<v Speaker 3>we wanted to perform them better.</v>

387
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is involved in movement </v>

388
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:44.050
<v Speaker 3>training?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say it's day one,</v>

389
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.820
<v Speaker 3>you get a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

390
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 3>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

391
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

392
00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I love this idea that hooked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

393
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the case of Carlos,</v>

394
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 3>it had to be something specific to him </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a fighter to what I saw.</v>

395
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

396
00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 3>what are his fortes is strong points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also saw what I believed were </v>

397
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 3>deficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

398
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.710
<v Speaker 3>and that may seem presumptuous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I talked to him about it,</v>

399
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:14.340
<v Speaker 3>what I saw that could be improved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

400
00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:19.341
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what I've been told for </v>

401
00:18:19.341 --> 00:18:20.500
<v Speaker 3>years by my coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what was that a thought that he's,</v>

402
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:25.550
<v Speaker 3>his stance was too high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used these two narrow slowly these </v>

403
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:25.550
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

404
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>typically Thai boxing square stance,</v>

405
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

406
00:18:29.561 --> 00:18:31.950
<v Speaker 3>with his feet and the l shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

407
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.980
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to me that caused a ton of </v>

408
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.161
<v Speaker 3>instabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also preventing him from being as </v>

409
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.570
<v Speaker 3>fast as I believe he could be in moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and out or,</v>

410
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 3>or sideways.</v>

411
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 3>So what adjustments did you make as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the stance?</v>

412
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.230
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

413
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.650
<v Speaker 3>we move the position of his back foot is</v>
<v Speaker 3>orientated,</v>

414
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a 90 degree angle.</v>

415
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 3>So we moved it forward more at a 45 </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree angle.</v>

416
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 3>But the problem when we did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we have a square stance,</v>

417
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.870
<v Speaker 3>basically your feet are in line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you move you are relatively stable</v>

418
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:11.871
<v Speaker 3>only because the foot is going that way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you move it that way you,</v>

419
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.510
<v Speaker 3>you shrink a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

420
00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 3>your base of support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creates even more instability.</v>

421
00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 3>So what you need to do is to have your </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet wider to widen,</v>

422
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bit wider on the,</v>

423
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.340
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the front or to the back and then to the</v>

424
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.780
<v Speaker 3>sites like something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

425
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a shoulder width or her hip width.</v>

426
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.300
<v Speaker 3>So that was really a lot of when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was tweaking something,</v>

427
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.150
<v Speaker 3>it will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may create an,</v>

428
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:43.100
<v Speaker 3>a negative consequence that we had to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of drilling to,</v>

429
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.970
<v Speaker 3>to improve that stance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it,</v>

430
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:46.770
<v Speaker 3>to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it better.</v>

431
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Now the stance that you developed a sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of classics dance,</v>

432
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're a tall guy,</v>

433
00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:58.011
<v Speaker 3>you would fight and stand up high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were there any issues when he started </v>

434
00:19:58.011 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 3>adjusting the way you place your feet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or did you have to relearn things and.</v>

435
00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

436
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 3>without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

437
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been training,</v>

438
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

439
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.510
<v Speaker 3>we tired since I was 15 years old and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

440
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean these things have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

441
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been a stratified in my,</v>

442
00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 3>in my fricking my muscle memory for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for years.</v>

443
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

444
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.640
<v Speaker 3>it took quite a bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I probably,</v>

445
00:20:23.641 --> 00:20:25.920
<v Speaker 3>you still see me going back to my old </v>
<v Speaker 3>habits.</v>

446
00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:30.921
<v Speaker 3>You're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're tired or you're </v>

447
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:30.921
<v Speaker 3>stressed or you're in different </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations,</v>

448
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:31.890
<v Speaker 3>you are going to revert back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you've trained the most.</v>

449
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.040
<v Speaker 3>But when I'm mindful of it for the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>

450
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

451
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that the improvements</v>

452
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:39.870
<v Speaker 3>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

453
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.950
<v Speaker 3>the adjustments we made were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

454
00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.470
<v Speaker 3>were major improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

455
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.720
<v Speaker 3>we also worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of being real,</v>

456
00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 3>real heavy on my front leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having more</v>

457
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 5>of like an upright stance and upright </v>
<v Speaker 5>stance as far as my torso and not,</v>

458
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:57.361
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not being so heavy be more 50 slash 50 </v>

459
00:20:57.361 --> 00:20:59.941
<v Speaker 5>on my legs and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that allowed me to move in and out </v>

460
00:20:59.941 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 5>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only forward but,</v>

461
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.540
<v Speaker 5>but back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

462
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:04.720
<v Speaker 5>and that showed big time in the fighting</v>
<v Speaker 5>is Tiago Elvis.</v>

463
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.020
<v Speaker 5>I think that was the reason I was able </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get in,</v>

464
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 5>get inside land with the elbows as </v>
<v Speaker 5>effectively as I did and you know,</v>

465
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.740
<v Speaker 5>and then kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

466
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the fight rolling.</v>

467
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:20.670
<v Speaker 5>We're seeing some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love watching different sort of </v>

468
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 5>patterns that are developing the fighter</v>
<v Speaker 5>start following.</v>

469
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:28.200
<v Speaker 5>But one of the things that we're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that are </v>

470
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.051
<v Speaker 5>standing and more of a karate stance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more sideways and wider stance and that </v>

471
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 5>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like sort of Leo Machida style a gunner,</v>

472
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:38.260
<v Speaker 5>Nelson likes to fight like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can bounce conor Mcgregor,</v>

473
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.520
<v Speaker 5>you bounce in and out easier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like a,</v>

474
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.300
<v Speaker 5>a lighter foot print sort of stuff.</v>

475
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

476
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 3>And that's very much what we were aiming</v>
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>

477
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I executed the way that I do because I'm</v>

478
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:54.040
<v Speaker 3>a flat footed kind of fucking goofy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do,</v>

479
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I do my best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

480
00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:56.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

481
00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:01.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky I got a hard head sometimes </v>

482
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:01.610
<v Speaker 3>because I'm not Mr technique all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

483
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we definitely made an improvement.</v>

484
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 3>I must say that working with Carlos and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

485
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.960
<v Speaker 3>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's extremely focused actually when one</v>

486
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.610
<v Speaker 3>trend there wasn't like no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a zero fat kind of training,</v>

487
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:20.611
<v Speaker 3>like completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely focused from the beginning to </v>

488
00:22:20.611 --> 00:22:22.600
<v Speaker 3>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always really applied himself during the</v>

489
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 3>training and I know that he drilled a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot also on these own,</v>

490
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.930
<v Speaker 3>in between every session to make those </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjustments to make them become second </v>

491
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:35.821
<v Speaker 3>nature because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you change any aspect of your </v>

492
00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 3>technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at first it feels unnatural because your</v>

493
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:39.430
<v Speaker 3>brain is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

494
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:42.850
<v Speaker 3>you have something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain patterns that are ingrained in</v>

495
00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:46.800
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a neuromuscular memory and they are,</v>

496
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 3>there are a little hard to change.</v>

497
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:52.620
<v Speaker 3>But Carlos was able to change things </v>
<v Speaker 3>really fast actually.</v>

498
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.830
<v Speaker 3>And I was always impressed about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast he would make those progresses.</v>

499
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.540
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those progress is,</v>

500
00:22:58.541 --> 00:23:03.180
<v Speaker 3>were not up that much physical and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

501
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 3>in the sense of strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning,</v>

502
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:08.940
<v Speaker 3>like it would have to work hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It it,</v>

503
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the changes were always told him,</v>

504
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:17.580
<v Speaker 3>you have the body has it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you need is that that map being </v>

505
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 3>newer in your brain somewhere to really </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

506
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:27.901
<v Speaker 3>recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identify and assimilate fully vet </v>

507
00:23:27.901 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 3>particular pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've done so many movements,</v>

508
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:32.110
<v Speaker 3>so many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much footwork,</v>

509
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:37.111
<v Speaker 3>so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way to do it requires a </v>

510
00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 3>different wiring between the mind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the body,</v>

511
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 3>between the brain and the body.</v>

512
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.510
<v Speaker 5>That's a big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

513
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 5>Is just patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Getting those patterns</v>

514
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 2>ingrained in your system to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they come out automatically,</v>

515
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:50.850
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

516
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:56.060
<v Speaker 2>those movements that happen either </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiring or in competition where all of</v>

517
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:59.600
<v Speaker 2>a sudden you're executing something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had zero thought.</v>

518
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your training takes over.</v>

519
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.240
<v Speaker 2>You slip upon and counter and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even.</v>

520
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:10.420
<v Speaker 2>There's no conscious thought at all and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to sort of similarly be </v>

521
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:12.200
<v Speaker 2>achieved through movement.</v>

522
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Exactly in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

523
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 4>that's what stimulated Carla's brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>that much that he had to take a nap </v>

524
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.271
<v Speaker 4>after every training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas he's used to reread hard </v>

525
00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:23.790
<v Speaker 4>trenton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with that training,</v>

526
00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:26.790
<v Speaker 4>which is relatively low intensity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

527
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:33.470
<v Speaker 4>the brand is so stimulated that he needs</v>
<v Speaker 4>to recover because it needs to process </v>

528
00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:36.750
<v Speaker 4>while it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like if the movement,</v>

529
00:24:36.751 --> 00:24:41.751
<v Speaker 4>the mindful movement is the input that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the body that the brain needs to do that</v>

530
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.410
<v Speaker 4>read circuiting a differently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

531
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 4>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

532
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.880
<v Speaker 4>to deconstruct old patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>replace them with newer,</v>

533
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 4>more efficient butter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that didn't happen while we were </v>

534
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

535
00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.450
<v Speaker 4>while we were doing a lot of the times I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was struggling with this stuff.</v>

536
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'd go home and I would rest and I'd</v>

537
00:25:04.711 --> 00:25:07.680
<v Speaker 4>go back to my room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my regular training work a little bit on</v>

538
00:25:07.681 --> 00:25:08.430
<v Speaker 4>and not a whole lot.</v>

539
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.550
<v Speaker 4>But then the next time I would come back</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was almost as if my,</v>

540
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:16.590
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mind and my body had digested this </v>

541
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.121
<v Speaker 4>stuff and assimilated and it put it into</v>
<v Speaker 4>practical application without like a </v>

542
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.740
<v Speaker 4>unconsciously without me even really </v>
<v Speaker 4>working on it too much.</v>

543
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:26.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

544
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.880
<v Speaker 4>he says that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I would work in in the meantime </v>

545
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:31.880
<v Speaker 4>between our sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I did.</v>

546
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.210
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I had a lot of their stuff,</v>

547
00:25:33.211 --> 00:25:36.560
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

548
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.660
<v Speaker 4>but it looked like I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

549
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.860
<v Speaker 4>because I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

550
00:25:41.861 --> 00:25:46.861
<v Speaker 4>I think this is kind of a consensus that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you make gains,</v>

551
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:54.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during your rest you can lift and lift </v>

552
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.110
<v Speaker 4>and lift and lift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you never rest,</v>

553
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.560
<v Speaker 4>you're never going to make those gains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same thing with,</v>

554
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.780
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with your technique and um,</v>

555
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

556
00:25:58.431 --> 00:25:59.790
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this neurological training,</v>

557
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.740
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it works the exact same way</v>

558
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 2>that is the whole movement that's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on right now is really fascinating </v>

559
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.790
<v Speaker 2>because there's a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of branches of it.</v>

560
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's like what ido portal is </v>

561
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.330
<v Speaker 2>doing is what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a curse on is doing.</v>

562
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.510
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy who's just trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>action coach for Fabry Silverdome and </v>

563
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.370
<v Speaker 2>heartfelt dos Anjos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had him on the podcast and I asked</v>

564
00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:30.371
<v Speaker 2>him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is like one of the most important </v>

565
00:26:30.371 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 2>things that fighters are lacking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you try to improve on?</v>

566
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:37.090
<v Speaker 2>And he said foot strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found that to be really </v>

567
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.570
<v Speaker 2>interesting and when I watched what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys were doing,</v>

568
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.780
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this barefoot jumping and </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaping and balancing and it requires </v>

569
00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 2>some pretty</v>

570
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 3>extreme foot stability is the number one</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing we addressed with car number one </v>

571
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:53.590
<v Speaker 3>and number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said your feet are not strong and </v>

572
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.850
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not smart enough,</v>

573
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.790
<v Speaker 3>not that that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fee to have a brain,</v>

574
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.750
<v Speaker 3>but there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

575
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.760
<v Speaker 3>an extremely strong correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the proprioception in the foot and the </v>

576
00:27:04.741 --> 00:27:07.680
<v Speaker 3>brain and movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most of the time when we move,</v>

577
00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 3>we're on our feet and that's the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>why there are so many sensors,</v>

578
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 3>a nerve terminations in the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of them.</v>

579
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:21.261
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's about intelligence </v>

580
00:27:21.261 --> 00:27:21.540
<v Speaker 3>intelligence in the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

581
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.330
<v Speaker 3>We talk about proprioception,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extra reception,</v>

582
00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:29.331
<v Speaker 3>which is the particular perception of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a given surface and to dixter and he's </v>

583
00:27:29.971 --> 00:27:31.460
<v Speaker 3>asleep or reuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>

584
00:27:31.461 --> 00:27:33.300
<v Speaker 3>it gives them traction and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

585
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

586
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.060
<v Speaker 3>is it stable or shaky anyways?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the moment you place your feet,</v>

587
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:43.020
<v Speaker 3>a boom sends information to the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain processes,</v>

588
00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 3>and gives order to all the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body to shift the way to,</v>

589
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.300
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

590
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

591
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.990
<v Speaker 3>give some order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some intention,</v>

592
00:27:51.991 --> 00:27:56.430
<v Speaker 3>it happens without you having to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and it happens extremely fast.</v>

593
00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.910
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you feed are sensitive in that </v>

594
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.501
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the faster information travels up and </v>

595
00:28:06.501 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 3>back down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

596
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:12.291
<v Speaker 3>and secondly also the stronger of foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the more reliable your base of </v>

597
00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:16.551
<v Speaker 3>support is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we talk about the strength of the </v>

598
00:28:16.551 --> 00:28:20.841
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talk about the elasticity of the </v>

599
00:28:20.841 --> 00:28:21.280
<v Speaker 3>muscles in the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

600
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.760
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be sometimes more bouncy,</v>

601
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.890
<v Speaker 3>just simply faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

602
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.980
<v Speaker 3>to be also a more endurance to last </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer with elasticy and speed.</v>

603
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we did a lot of that through a </v>

604
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 3>balancing drills even like loaded </v>
<v Speaker 3>balancing drills,</v>

605
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:44.450
<v Speaker 3>but also specific footwork drills and </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving in and out in.</v>

606
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.610
<v Speaker 3>And it was not only a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the footwork itself,</v>

607
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:52.611
<v Speaker 3>it's also how the level of alertness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have in relation to an open net</v>

608
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:58.070
<v Speaker 3>and the level of responsiveness that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have in your movement in relation to </v>

609
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.530
<v Speaker 3>open it because it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforcing a particular part of your </v>

610
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 3>body as if you're made of parts it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to work as a whole.</v>

611
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.560
<v Speaker 3>We had to make sure that anything would </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve specifically then would be </v>

612
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.490
<v Speaker 3>brought back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole spectrum,</v>

613
00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 3>which is movement in a fight and work </v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually improve.</v>

614
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:20.420
<v Speaker 3>And that's what Carlos did every time </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you would go sparring and then he </v>

615
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:23.640
<v Speaker 3>would see by himself and then telling me</v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

616
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:29.210
<v Speaker 3>I've improved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These have improved that in my coach's </v>

617
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.750
<v Speaker 3>seat too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the proof is in the pudding as,</v>

618
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.200
<v Speaker 3>as Carlos would always say it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

619
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.320
<v Speaker 3>most people would think that if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fit guy and you're a strong guy and you </v>

620
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:39.960
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say maybe you do squats or something</v>

621
00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have strong.</v>

622
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

623
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that shocked me the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most when I started doing yoga is,</v>

624
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:47.740
<v Speaker 2>that's what would give out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my feet would give out.</v>

625
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so bizarre.</v>

626
00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

627
00:29:51.221 --> 00:29:56.221
<v Speaker 2>if I could stand on one foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you made me stand here on one </v>

628
00:29:56.221 --> 00:29:56.500
<v Speaker 2>foot with my sneakers on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not hard.</v>

629
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.410
<v Speaker 2>They'll stand on one foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

630
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.480
<v Speaker 2>no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're balancing my feet would </v>

631
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:03.480
<v Speaker 2>fucking ache,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.211
<v Speaker 2>like you're doing like bow pose or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you've got one </v>

633
00:30:08.211 --> 00:30:08.211
<v Speaker 2>leg up here and your arm is stretched </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

634
00:30:08.211 --> 00:30:11.260
<v Speaker 2>And you were balancing my feet would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was giving out.</v>

635
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.580
<v Speaker 2>And I started thinking about how little </v>
<v Speaker 2>stability,</v>

636
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:20.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people probably have from training </v>

637
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 2>with shoes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights,</v>

638
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:22.390
<v Speaker 2>with shoes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

639
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 2>running with big thick cushy shoes.</v>

640
00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Even even elite elite athletes and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>our elite MMA fighters.</v>

641
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even even when they are training </v>

642
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.280
<v Speaker 3>barefoot in Dojo or in teams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

643
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:41.570
<v Speaker 3>but you have to think of what's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background of a given person.</v>

644
00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Most people today in modern populations </v>
<v Speaker 3>grow up indoors.</v>

645
00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.460
<v Speaker 3>We have shoes on all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're walking,</v>

646
00:30:49.461 --> 00:30:52.850
<v Speaker 3>we're walking on flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smooth surfaces are predictable.</v>

647
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.220
<v Speaker 3>There's no challenge to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the body.</v>

648
00:30:55.221 --> 00:30:58.100
<v Speaker 3>There's no challenge to the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The feet become numb,</v>

649
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.010
<v Speaker 3>feet become weak structurally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

650
00:31:01.011 --> 00:31:01.640
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

651
00:31:01.641 --> 00:31:04.520
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in term of strength in term of it,</v>

652
00:31:04.521 --> 00:31:07.220
<v Speaker 3>just sorta get a tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

653
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

654
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.840
<v Speaker 3>if you try and MMA because you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting to,</v>

655
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do uh,</v>

656
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:14.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

657
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.820
<v Speaker 3>so striking move on your feet is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to help,</v>

658
00:31:16.821 --> 00:31:18.870
<v Speaker 3>definitely is going to help your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your food scraps,</v>

659
00:31:18.871 --> 00:31:23.871
<v Speaker 3>your foot mobility or stability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not as much as what you're going to </v>

660
00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:28.110
<v Speaker 3>gain when you have to balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

661
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

662
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:34.820
<v Speaker 3>on narrow surfaces and ordinance certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>positions in certain transitions and </v>

663
00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.910
<v Speaker 3>kneeling and sitting and get up and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

664
00:31:36.911 --> 00:31:40.160
<v Speaker 3>And especially we've loads on or at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain pace,</v>

665
00:31:40.161 --> 00:31:43.880
<v Speaker 3>at a certain speed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different.</v>

666
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:48.560
<v Speaker 3>And when you make the feet stronger than</v>
<v Speaker 3>your footwork is stronger.</v>

667
00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.210
<v Speaker 3>When we talk about movement coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

668
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:56.290
<v Speaker 3>some people are confused because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they hear movement in relation to </v>

669
00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.100
<v Speaker 3>fighting the footwork and it is work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also more than that.</v>

670
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember a few years back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

671
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 2>it was all the rage you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hearing about a lot of nfl </v>

672
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.130
<v Speaker 2>players were doing ballet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember this?</v>

673
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.110
<v Speaker 2>It was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people will like mocking it,</v>

674
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.120
<v Speaker 2>joking around about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>

675
00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:18.650
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is really interesting.</v>

676
00:32:18.651 --> 00:32:23.651
<v Speaker 2>Very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must have some sort of benefit in </v>

677
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:24.890
<v Speaker 2>that if they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you think about ballet,</v>

678
00:32:24.891 --> 00:32:29.891
<v Speaker 2>the movements are incredibly difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially if you're a 260 pound </v>

679
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:33.160
<v Speaker 2>fucking stud athlete covered in muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're a thing,</v>

680
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:38.190
<v Speaker 2>like there was a guy that was in a yoga </v>
<v Speaker 2>class where he leaves his former </v>

681
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 2>football player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real big guys like six,</v>

682
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:43.310
<v Speaker 2>four and real thick and heavy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much harder for him to do these </v>

683
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:46.610
<v Speaker 2>movements and say like a girl who weighs</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 pounds,</v>

684
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.300
<v Speaker 3>it's like a castle in the sand </v>
<v Speaker 3>inaccurately standard.</v>

685
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like an Achilles food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

686
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 3>you have a whole mountain that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's built on on the very weak </v>

687
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.591
<v Speaker 3>foundations and ballet of even for nfl </v>
<v Speaker 3>players was actually a very smart move </v>

688
00:33:02.381 --> 00:33:04.690
<v Speaker 3>because when you look at the strength of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

689
00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.770
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cows,</v>

690
00:33:05.771 --> 00:33:10.040
<v Speaker 3>I had a cousin who was a professional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a denser,</v>

691
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

692
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.970
<v Speaker 3>her cows or bootstrap was completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing because,</v>

693
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do these gracious movement.</v>

694
00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:23.610
<v Speaker 3>People see the grace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they make extraordinarily movement </v>

695
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:23.610
<v Speaker 3>look easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not</v>

696
00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:28.620
<v Speaker 2>like floor gymnast too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine because they have to </v>

697
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.740
<v Speaker 2>stick your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your foot has to have the ability to </v>

698
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.771
<v Speaker 2>catch you and then just stay in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>position completely locked.</v>

699
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:38.640
<v Speaker 3>Then you absorb of foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ankle,</v>

700
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.590
<v Speaker 3>knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hip stability,</v>

701
00:33:40.591 --> 00:33:41.700
<v Speaker 3>core stability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

702
00:33:41.701 --> 00:33:42.150
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

703
00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:43.140
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it starts,</v>

704
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.570
<v Speaker 3>starts in the foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm balanced.</v>

705
00:33:45.571 --> 00:33:48.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is integrated of course.</v>

706
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

707
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.280
<v Speaker 3>it starts to feet.</v>

708
00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I saw you doing some of the countdown </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>

709
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.800
<v Speaker 2>You were doing a lot of jumping over </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

710
00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:01.970
<v Speaker 2>standing and jumping onto a board and </v>
<v Speaker 2>landing on like,</v>

711
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.670
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a two by four or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

712
00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:08.940
<v Speaker 2>And locking in place on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was pretty impressive stuff </v>

713
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:08.940
<v Speaker 2>because there it is right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

714
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.620
<v Speaker 2>how you're on the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like this kind of stuff,</v>

715
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.310
<v Speaker 2>like when you were doing these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements,</v>

716
00:34:15.311 --> 00:34:15.610
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

717
00:34:15.611 --> 00:34:18.130
<v Speaker 2>you'd see it here on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you,</v>

718
00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.160
<v Speaker 2>how do you design these Erewhon and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you looking for different </v>

719
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.600
<v Speaker 2>things specific to Carlos</v>

720
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.560
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent specific to Carlos </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the point.</v>

721
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:33.880
<v Speaker 3>A movement coaching for lack of better </v>
<v Speaker 3>term.</v>

722
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not giving a fighter random </v>

723
00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.400
<v Speaker 3>movements that are not fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements,</v>

724
00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.450
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bollywood,</v>

725
00:34:43.451 --> 00:34:48.280
<v Speaker 3>dancing or whatever for a tight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She couldn't be anything.</v>

726
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.980
<v Speaker 3>It could be any movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Movement is such a very.</v>

727
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:55.720
<v Speaker 3>It's a vast world or universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're lucky,</v>

728
00:34:55.721 --> 00:34:57.910
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>

729
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:03.050
<v Speaker 3>If you'd give something randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to find something that </v>

730
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.050
<v Speaker 3>happens to be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in,</v>

731
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:07.210
<v Speaker 3>in the case of Carlos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked at his fights and analyze these</v>

732
00:35:07.211 --> 00:35:08.890
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some,</v>

733
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.590
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some intuitions about what was there,</v>

734
00:35:11.591 --> 00:35:15.670
<v Speaker 3>what was missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Isaiah was draining him.</v>

735
00:35:15.671 --> 00:35:19.570
<v Speaker 3>I was constantly adjusting the movement </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs.</v>

736
00:35:19.571 --> 00:35:23.230
<v Speaker 3>What was in every session to what I saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>was working,</v>

737
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.280
<v Speaker 3>what was not working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I,</v>

738
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.240
<v Speaker 3>depending on the level of progress that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't making,</v>

739
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.960
<v Speaker 3>we would do something more difficult or </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the higher level of intensity.</v>

740
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.670
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tailored,</v>

741
00:35:33.671 --> 00:35:35.560
<v Speaker 3>it's customized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not random.</v>

742
00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>How did you develop this program?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This</v>

743
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.750
<v Speaker 2>is very interesting because I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you would get athletes from</v>

744
00:35:42.751 --> 00:35:44.550
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of different sports that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to you,</v>

745
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:46.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

746
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not looking.</v>

747
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I told Carlos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlos,</v>

748
00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:53.250
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm focusing harper sent on you,</v>

749
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no other athlete that I want to</v>

750
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 2>travel like a gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

751
00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have this move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nat Is this company of this website?</v>

752
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a,</v>

753
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 2>we have thousands of certified trainers </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are using our methods,</v>

754
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:09.320
<v Speaker 2>thousands of trainers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think somewhere around $3,000</v>

755
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:14.190
<v Speaker 2>to run the wellness world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The company since 2009.</v>

756
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.720
<v Speaker 2>So this is all your creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've developed this all yourself.</v>

757
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.270
<v Speaker 3>My method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the method is my creation,</v>

758
00:36:21.271 --> 00:36:24.000
<v Speaker 3>but however I do draw from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

759
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:28.350
<v Speaker 3>from the history of physical education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I have studied a lot,</v>

760
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:33.390
<v Speaker 3>especially what comes from Europe and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my case because I'm originally from </v>

761
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.750
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

762
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:38.970
<v Speaker 3>they used to be a method called a </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural method by a guy called Georgia </v>

763
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.140
<v Speaker 3>bear who himself was not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was seen as a pioneer,</v>

764
00:36:43.141 --> 00:36:45.510
<v Speaker 3>but he himself was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

765
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.540
<v Speaker 3>at some point of that long line of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people before him was a morrows and </v>

766
00:36:51.361 --> 00:36:56.361
<v Speaker 3>pistol lindsay and mercury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys who were working on these </v>

767
00:36:56.361 --> 00:36:58.760
<v Speaker 3>different methods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're talking a,</v>

768
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 3>a 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19th century,</v>

769
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 3>18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and before and before,</v>

770
00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:08.661
<v Speaker 3>and before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and back then people didn't have </v>

771
00:37:08.661 --> 00:37:10.710
<v Speaker 3>exercise science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is it that they were training.</v>

772
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.460
<v Speaker 3>They were training the most down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>

773
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.130
<v Speaker 3>practical movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would jump,</v>

774
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.830
<v Speaker 3>they would run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would crawl,</v>

775
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.740
<v Speaker 3>they will lift and carry things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw and catch things.</v>

776
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because these are the movements that </v>

777
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.861
<v Speaker 3>people needed back then that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the military or firefighters.</v>

778
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:37.610
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at it today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a situation that say </v>

779
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:43.040
<v Speaker 3>potentially life threatening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are still the movements that you </v>

780
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.940
<v Speaker 3>need to do to save your life or to save </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else's life.</v>

781
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:46.590
<v Speaker 3>They're extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're natural,</v>

782
00:37:46.591 --> 00:37:49.380
<v Speaker 3>but they're natural also to the point </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they are vital.</v>

783
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 2>So you have this gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

784
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:52.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

785
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.900
<v Speaker 2>what is your normal clientele?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like?</v>

786
00:37:54.901 --> 00:37:57.020
<v Speaker 2>The normal person that comes to a move </v>
<v Speaker 2>net,</v>

787
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>

788
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.110
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible to a shrink to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular category because</v>

789
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:07.160
<v Speaker 2>do you get like housewives?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get athletes of all sports?</v>

790
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

791
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.300
<v Speaker 2>All than young men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woman comes in,</v>

792
00:38:11.301 --> 00:38:12.560
<v Speaker 2>she's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a housewife.</v>

793
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Women hate that fucking expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A woman comes in who's a non </v>

794
00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:21.961
<v Speaker 2>professional athlete who's just looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get back in shape maybe after having </v>

795
00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:22.100
<v Speaker 2>a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

796
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Do you design a protocol specifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>for her?</v>

797
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you would do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

798
00:38:26.401 --> 00:38:29.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the movements,</v>

799
00:38:29.331 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 2>there are some movements</v>

800
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.200
<v Speaker 3>that are a fundamental movements that </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody can do a.</v>

801
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:40.290
<v Speaker 3>and then you have more advanced movement</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you have say a simple jump.</v>

802
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:46.170
<v Speaker 3>You see Carlos jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this woman you're talking about </v>

803
00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.590
<v Speaker 3>won't be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

804
00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:51.010
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not at the same level of intensity.</v>

805
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

806
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would have her do it alleged </v>

807
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.271
<v Speaker 3>shorter jumps over lower jump on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot where he jumped two inches above </v>

808
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:03.760
<v Speaker 3>ground and lend in the same spot where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were standing to inches.</v>

809
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:05.710
<v Speaker 3>I think she could do for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you got a pusher?</v>

810
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

811
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.090
<v Speaker 3>Well it just needs to keep the training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

812
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never too hard,</v>

813
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.750
<v Speaker 3>too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was actually also my concern when I</v>

814
00:39:16.751 --> 00:39:21.751
<v Speaker 3>started to try and Carlos because he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>recovering and I was extremely worried </v>

815
00:39:21.751 --> 00:39:25.741
<v Speaker 3>that I wouldn't do anything that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>compromise these recovery in any way </v>

816
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 3>that would actually help him recover </v>
<v Speaker 3>even even faster.</v>

817
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.060
<v Speaker 3>So a method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a method,</v>

818
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:36.061
<v Speaker 3>only one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's scalable and also when it is </v>

819
00:39:36.061 --> 00:39:36.520
<v Speaker 3>progressive and because these movements </v>
<v Speaker 3>are natural,</v>

820
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 3>they belong to all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like,</v>

821
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would be the best way to train a </v>

822
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:45.750
<v Speaker 3>wild tiger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

823
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.910
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine that you're going to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to isolate their,</v>

824
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:54.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hang legs and then try to have </v>

825
00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 3>them do another workout for the front </v>
<v Speaker 3>legs and then put them on the,</v>

826
00:39:55.511 --> 00:39:57.160
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

827
00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.400
<v Speaker 3>treadmill for cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I wouldn't make any sense.</v>

828
00:40:00.401 --> 00:40:05.401
<v Speaker 3>That would be hilarious because to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>optimally strong and that Joel and like </v>

829
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 3>a good hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good Predator,</v>

830
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.080
<v Speaker 3>the well tiger just needs to be and </v>
<v Speaker 3>behave and move like a wall tiger in its</v>

831
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.700
<v Speaker 3>original environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But could it be any different?</v>

832
00:40:15.701 --> 00:40:20.701
<v Speaker 3>Tiger on an inverted treadmill and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really pushed that motherfucker some </v>

833
00:40:20.701 --> 00:40:22.900
<v Speaker 3>good music on maybe some motivational </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos,</v>

834
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.530
<v Speaker 3>heater up a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a drug go tiger.</v>

835
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

836
00:40:27.011 --> 00:40:28.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do that with,</v>

837
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.340
<v Speaker 3>with pit bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pit Bulls.</v>

838
00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:33.610
<v Speaker 3>When they train them for fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put them on treadmills.</v>

839
00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put them on a,</v>

840
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.210
<v Speaker 3>a treadmill that sort of self propelled </v>
<v Speaker 3>the animals propelling the treadmill and</v>

841
00:40:40.211 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 3>they'll put something in front of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it wants to get to.</v>

842
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.340
<v Speaker 3>So exercise science for four pit bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

843
00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a real thing.</v>

844
00:40:46.901 --> 00:40:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean they sell these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

845
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:49.520
<v Speaker 3>they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have weigh ins,</v>

846
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.600
<v Speaker 3>a serious moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

847
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.130
<v Speaker 3>But my point was everybody needs the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental of,</v>

848
00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.680
<v Speaker 3>I believe everybody needs the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental of,</v>

849
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.100
<v Speaker 3>of movements before you go through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very specific science based exercise </v>

850
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:09.100
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for anybody.</v>

851
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people don't need that.</v>

852
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Most people just need to move in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>

853
00:41:14.451 --> 00:41:16.360
<v Speaker 3>There's only men move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't even squat.</v>

854
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Most people are just sedentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just sitting on offices and </v>

855
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.650
<v Speaker 3>cubicles or what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cause of most of their,</v>

856
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical ailments is that improper </v>

857
00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:28.930
<v Speaker 3>movement behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of movement,</v>

858
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 3>or to specialize movement and the lack </v>
<v Speaker 3>of diversity and the good things that,</v>

859
00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:40.190
<v Speaker 3>the antidote for that is movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also movement behaviors,</v>

860
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:45.191
<v Speaker 3>movement behavior is the cause and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution to a lot of physical issues.</v>

861
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:45.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

862
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 4>When you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we do?</v>

863
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.210
<v Speaker 4>We fucking stand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We sit,</v>

864
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 4>we lay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we bend.</v>

865
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.480
<v Speaker 4>That's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like four,</v>

866
00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 4>four things right throughout our day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

867
00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is so,</v>

868
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:01.490
<v Speaker 4>so narrow of a movement spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 4>compared to what should we do.</v>

869
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Speaker 4>We should throw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should run,</v>

870
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:04.160
<v Speaker 4>we should catch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could,</v>

871
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 4>should swim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should bounce,</v>

872
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 4>we should pull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should carry,</v>

873
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:10.670
<v Speaker 4>we should fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could all,</v>

874
00:42:10.671 --> 00:42:15.671
<v Speaker 4>all this a variety of things that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>human body is supposed to do.</v>

875
00:42:16.341 --> 00:42:19.790
<v Speaker 4>And yet we are like in these constraints</v>
<v Speaker 4>of our,</v>

876
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have chairs,</v>

877
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:22.420
<v Speaker 4>we're sitting here on fucking chairs </v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

878
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.270
<v Speaker 4>there was chairs or fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

879
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.240
<v Speaker 4>a low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low squat or kneel or,</v>

880
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

881
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:31.680
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also the,</v>

882
00:42:31.681 --> 00:42:36.681
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the neurological benefit of doing those </v>

883
00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 4>things because to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for you to,</v>

884
00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

885
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:44.750
<v Speaker 4>to move that way your body has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or your brain has to do it for you.</v>

886
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.060
<v Speaker 4>Be Fire those stamps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not,</v>

887
00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:48.400
<v Speaker 4>we're not doing that by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

888
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.090
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this boring as shit you or,</v>

889
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.840
<v Speaker 4>or even if we're a fit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

890
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.580
<v Speaker 4>we're still laying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're still,</v>

891
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 4>we were sitting on machines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing,</v>

892
00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

893
00:42:57.021 --> 00:42:58.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elevated,</v>

894
00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

895
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

896
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:02.660
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

897
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

898
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:07.100
<v Speaker 3>we're still kind of isolated and very </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimal.</v>

899
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Very minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were not supposed to be like that.</v>

900
00:43:10.731 --> 00:43:12.710
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to fucking move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly the,</v>

901
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

902
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:18.430
<v Speaker 3>even the people who who are brave enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go against the inertia of normalcy,</v>

903
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:23.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go to the gym and they will exercise</v>

904
00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:28.061
<v Speaker 3>with machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see a huge problem with that type </v>

905
00:43:28.061 --> 00:43:32.261
<v Speaker 3>machines because machines dictates your </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>

906
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:34.550
<v Speaker 3>shrinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

907
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:36.030
<v Speaker 3>shapes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

908
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:41.510
<v Speaker 3>you have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You follow a very simplified pattern </v>

909
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.560
<v Speaker 3>that's imposed by the machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

910
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.760
<v Speaker 3>This is not who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not what she's supposed to be </v>

911
00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:48.760
<v Speaker 3>and move like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

912
00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.260
<v Speaker 3>because you're supposed to be highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptable in the way you move.</v>

913
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.320
<v Speaker 3>But when you do try to isolate your </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles,</v>

914
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.050
<v Speaker 3>you're treating yourself like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fricking machine.</v>

915
00:43:57.051 --> 00:44:02.051
<v Speaker 3>It's like a factory when you should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a wild forest or permaculture </v>

916
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:07.750
<v Speaker 3>garden or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not what you're designed by </v>

917
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.470
<v Speaker 3>evolution or creation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever to do.</v>

918
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.250
<v Speaker 4>And so bringing it back around to mma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

919
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.190
<v Speaker 4>stepping in the octagon to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fighting,</v>

920
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:23.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nature of our sport has so many </v>

921
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:23.680
<v Speaker 4>different variables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

922
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.390
<v Speaker 4>anything can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We go through,</v>

923
00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're using various energy systems.</v>

924
00:44:28.511 --> 00:44:29.710
<v Speaker 4>We go from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

925
00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:34.711
<v Speaker 4>going a Arabic to anaerobic to using an </v>
<v Speaker 4>isometric hold all the way back through,</v>

926
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

927
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:42.200
<v Speaker 4>so many different things involved </v>
<v Speaker 4>because basically we're able to do </v>

928
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck we want it with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

929
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>under a very limited amount of rules.</v>

930
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.840
<v Speaker 4>So training this way just just makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

931
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's,</v>

932
00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:55.020
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's much more a along the lines of what</v>

933
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:56.850
<v Speaker 4>we're actually going to do in </v>
<v Speaker 4>competition.</v>

934
00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.120
<v Speaker 4>How much of a factor is flexibility play</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how often do you train flexibility.</v>

935
00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.870
<v Speaker 3>A lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of,</v>

936
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.800
<v Speaker 3>so flexibility's is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is huge.</v>

937
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:15.801
<v Speaker 3>Mobility is huge because the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>mobility and you can explore,</v>

938
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:20.250
<v Speaker 3>manifest physically have full range of </v>
<v Speaker 3>motion,</v>

939
00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:25.251
<v Speaker 3>but it's also plays a huge role in how </v>
<v Speaker 3>relaxed you are and therefore how much </v>

940
00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:29.040
<v Speaker 3>power you can generate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually what was the,</v>

941
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:34.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the main point of focus on the </v>

942
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.800
<v Speaker 3>second camp that we did for the fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>for robey.</v>

943
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:40.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we established a strategy I proposed </v>

944
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.680
<v Speaker 3>as a movement strategy to Carlos and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

945
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:44.610
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

946
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:48.090
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he talked to Greg Jackson about his</v>

947
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:49.020
<v Speaker 3>game plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

948
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:54.150
<v Speaker 3>they came up with the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was to use his ranch to always keep</v>

949
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:56.880
<v Speaker 3>control of the ranch and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 3>two's,</v>

950
00:45:56.950 --> 00:46:01.950
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's reached through using these kicks </v>

951
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.700
<v Speaker 3>more and better and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had to address some,</v>

952
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:07.990
<v Speaker 3>some deficiencies in flexibility because</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we,</v>

953
00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 3>what we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we noticed right away is that when </v>

954
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:16.041
<v Speaker 3>you was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Carlos was trying to reach a </v>

955
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:16.041
<v Speaker 3>certain height,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

956
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 3>he had to somewhat go a little beyond </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

957
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.140
<v Speaker 3>his bag then current level of immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>height.</v>

958
00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

959
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.830
<v Speaker 3>And so when you try to somewhat forced </v>
<v Speaker 3>solidity or mobility,</v>

960
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.630
<v Speaker 3>what creates instability and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

961
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:32.670
<v Speaker 3>and slows down the movement and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>also lose this occurs in power and </v>

962
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:33.780
<v Speaker 3>accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we did tons of,</v>

963
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.080
<v Speaker 3>of stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we did that stretching through </v>

964
00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.380
<v Speaker 3>natural movements through all lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement on the ground and,</v>

965
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.640
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

966
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:46.140
<v Speaker 3>for those natural patterns.</v>

967
00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.920
<v Speaker 4>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

968
00:46:48.921 --> 00:46:53.921
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell me if you agree in MMA as opposed </v>

969
00:46:53.921 --> 00:46:58.631
<v Speaker 4>to traditional martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we skip over a lot of the </v>

970
00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.610
<v Speaker 4>intricacies because I know you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial artist,</v>

971
00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:02.120
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

972
00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:06.950
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you came up in taekwondo and I feel like</v>

973
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.290
<v Speaker 4>traditional martial arts really </v>
<v Speaker 4>emphasized,</v>

974
00:47:09.291 --> 00:47:12.090
<v Speaker 4>you don't go past this point until </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've mastered this,</v>

975
00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:17.110
<v Speaker 4>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's very a very specialized in mma.</v>

976
00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.630
<v Speaker 4>I think we get a guy and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling background.</v>

977
00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.240
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll teach him a little bit of boxing.</v>

978
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we won't get him necessarily super </v>

979
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.701
<v Speaker 4>crisp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>teach them how to stab a few </v>

980
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:33.701
<v Speaker 4>submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

981
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:36.950
<v Speaker 4>get him real strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get them in shape and then put them out </v>

982
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.691
<v Speaker 4>there and let him go with intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of times that'll carry a lot </v>

983
00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:43.411
<v Speaker 4>of guys to the top levels and yet </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've missed some of these smaller,</v>

984
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:47.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basic nuts and bolts kind of thing with,</v>

985
00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.610
<v Speaker 4>with the movement.</v>

986
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.420
<v Speaker 4>And I think that going back to I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

987
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:54.050
<v Speaker 4>that's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all well and good.</v>

988
00:47:54.051 --> 00:47:54.430
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

989
00:47:54.431 --> 00:47:56.140
<v Speaker 4>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need that mix of stuff.</v>

990
00:47:56.141 --> 00:47:59.080
<v Speaker 4>You need the intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to be able to get out there and</v>

991
00:47:59.081 --> 00:48:01.900
<v Speaker 4>bring in by down on your mouthpiece and </v>
<v Speaker 4>throw down when it,</v>

992
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the time comes,</v>

993
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:08.460
<v Speaker 4>but if you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can always go back and work on that </v>

994
00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.271
<v Speaker 4>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I feel like I did quite a </v>

995
00:48:12.271 --> 00:48:12.271
<v Speaker 4>bit with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

996
00:48:12.271 --> 00:48:12.500
<v Speaker 4>with Irwin is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

997
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm making these tweaks on these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

998
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 4>these very fundamental things that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>been,</v>

999
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.360
<v Speaker 4>had been skipped over because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1000
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm built.</v>

1001
00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:26.200
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the fighter thing here and you put</v>

1002
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 4>me against whoever I'm to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fucking go,</v>

1003
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.490
<v Speaker 4>but now let's refine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>refine,</v>

1004
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:37.510
<v Speaker 4>less refined and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maximize and maximize the potential </v>

1005
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 4>of what I can do.</v>

1006
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like almost having that kind of</v>

1007
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 2>go go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go mentality,</v>

1008
00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:49.771
<v Speaker 2>that fighter mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously a huge benefit when </v>

1009
00:48:49.771 --> 00:48:51.430
<v Speaker 2>you're in a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it almost seems like maybe sometimes</v>

1010
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:56.460
<v Speaker 2>it's against your benefit when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>training because when you're training </v>

1011
00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:00.040
<v Speaker 2>you almost should be looking at it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a science do.</v>

1012
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:05.130
<v Speaker 2>You almost should be looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of like just trying to be the </v>

1013
00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:07.531
<v Speaker 2>toughest guy in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should almost be looking at it like </v>

1014
00:49:07.531 --> 00:49:10.471
<v Speaker 2>you're building a castle and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure the foundation is good and in </v>

1015
00:49:10.471 --> 00:49:15.331
<v Speaker 2>traditional martial arts you have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>white belt techniques and then you know </v>

1016
00:49:15.331 --> 00:49:17.890
<v Speaker 2>as you develop in the ranks and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>new new belts,</v>

1017
00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:22.891
<v Speaker 2>you move up and you get a higher ranks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you say you get a </v>

1018
00:49:22.891 --> 00:49:23.950
<v Speaker 2>higher techniques are more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques,</v>

1019
00:49:23.951 --> 00:49:28.120
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things you see in mma is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's guys that have mastered,</v>

1020
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.210
<v Speaker 2>like truly mastered one particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of MMA.</v>

1021
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Like Damien Maia is perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are legitimate jujitsu master </v>

1022
00:49:36.281 --> 00:49:41.281
<v Speaker 2>world champion and because of that his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his specialty is so strong that he,</v>

1023
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:48.450
<v Speaker 2>when he gets to that spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just got this massive advantage over </v>

1024
00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:52.531
<v Speaker 2>almost anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see that when he fights like </v>

1025
00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:53.420
<v Speaker 2>really good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know like Gunnar Nelson.</v>

1026
00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Nelson's a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a motherfucker on the ground yet,</v>

1027
00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:02.100
<v Speaker 2>but Damien so goddamn good like neil </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnets and other one neil magnet is so </v>

1028
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.160
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so tough and so,</v>

1029
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:08.400
<v Speaker 2>so good at avoiding submissions is </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense is excellent and Damien just ran</v>

1030
00:50:08.501 --> 00:50:13.501
<v Speaker 2>right through them and he runs right </v>
<v Speaker 2>through him because his technique is </v>

1031
00:50:13.501 --> 00:50:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Samurai's sword sharp and he has </v>
<v Speaker 2>polished it down and then now he's </v>

1032
00:50:18.191 --> 00:50:23.191
<v Speaker 2>learned all the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's learned kickboxing and in the </v>

1033
00:50:23.191 --> 00:50:25.351
<v Speaker 2>beginning you didn't have that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why like nate marquardt knocked </v>

1034
00:50:25.351 --> 00:50:25.660
<v Speaker 2>him out or all these other guys were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were able to beat him.</v>

1035
00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.640
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't have those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standup skills.</v>

1036
00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have all the other attributes </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1037
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:35.680
<v Speaker 2>of MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one thing he had honed to like </v>

1038
00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:39.461
<v Speaker 2>sort of a mastery level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas some guys never get to that in </v>

1039
00:50:39.461 --> 00:50:39.461
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really good at everything,</v>

1040
00:50:39.461 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 2>but they never get to a mastery level in</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1041
00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:42.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 4>And I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1043
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.780
<v Speaker 4>I would say that that's probably me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1044
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm good at a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1045
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:54.070
<v Speaker 4>maybe not a master at necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything stand up is pretty high level.</v>

1046
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:55.720
<v Speaker 4>Pretty high level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:59.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stand up pretty much anybody,</v>

1048
00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:00.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1049
00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put your standup at a very high level,</v>

1050
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.700
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your submissions are very good too,</v>

1051
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:09.730
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you spent five years it did </v>

1052
00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:14.051
<v Speaker 2>nothing but you Jitsu every day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>started competing in the Monday aisles </v>

1053
00:51:14.051 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 2>and Abu Dhabi and Naga and all that shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who knows what the fuck your Jujitsu</v>

1054
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:18.710
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

1055
00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.970
<v Speaker 4>which sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1056
00:51:19.971 --> 00:51:21.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was coming up,</v>

1057
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:25.370
<v Speaker 4>Greg Jackson's gym now is very much a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1058
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 4>seen as kind of kickboxing strike lots </v>
<v Speaker 4>and lots of striking some,</v>

1059
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:30.490
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1060
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.480
<v Speaker 4>some wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some Jiu Jitsu,</v>

1061
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:37.481
<v Speaker 4>but mainly striking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right back in the day when I first </v>

1062
00:51:37.481 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 4>started with Greg and his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his system and his affiliates,</v>

1063
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.070
<v Speaker 4>it was mainly a grappling school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was guided Jitsu,</v>

1064
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:42.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1065
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.960
<v Speaker 4>Jitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes sir.</v>

1066
00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:46.050
<v Speaker 4>Created.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1067
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.590
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well him and some other guys kind of got</v>

1068
00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:52.460
<v Speaker 4>together and created this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does he still call it that or is that.</v>

1069
00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:53.570
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1070
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.800
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's history,</v>

1071
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:55.480
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just,</v>

1072
00:51:55.530 --> 00:52:00.530
<v Speaker 4>that's old school stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the fuck I still </v>

1073
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:00.530
<v Speaker 4>remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1074
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.930
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy like Keith Jardine,</v>

1075
00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:06.230
<v Speaker 4>who by the time he got into the UFC was </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickbox and everybody,</v>

1076
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.560
<v Speaker 4>when I first met Keith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keith was a Jujitsu Guy,</v>

1077
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:14.561
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was competing and in the advanced </v>

1078
00:52:14.561 --> 00:52:14.561
<v Speaker 4>level at these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1079
00:52:14.561 --> 00:52:18.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grapplers quest tournaments and that </v>

1080
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:18.550
<v Speaker 4>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then kind of got away from that.</v>

1081
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:20.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1082
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:24.380
<v Speaker 4>I think my first 12 or 12 or 13 wins or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1083
00:52:24.381 --> 00:52:29.381
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're by submission and now I haven't </v>

1084
00:52:29.381 --> 00:52:29.381
<v Speaker 4>had a submission in years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:52:29.381 --> 00:52:34.090
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just got away from that and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think the sport kind of evolves and then</v>

1086
00:52:36.561 --> 00:52:39.970
<v Speaker 4>it comes full circle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it goes one way and then,</v>

1087
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.620
<v Speaker 4>and then the other and you see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

1088
00:52:41.621 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 4>with</v>

1089
00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.340
<v Speaker 2>fighters as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Paul felder's,</v>

1090
00:52:43.341 --> 00:52:48.341
<v Speaker 2>perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids is excellent striker and he had </v>

1091
00:52:48.341 --> 00:52:51.140
<v Speaker 2>couple really close decision losses to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barboza and Ross Pearson.</v>

1092
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:56.380
<v Speaker 2>And then he wins his next fight by </v>
<v Speaker 2>submission and attacked with another </v>

1093
00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.740
<v Speaker 2>submission before he got the rear naked </v>
<v Speaker 2>choke.</v>

1094
00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:59.870
<v Speaker 2>You almost got him in a gay teen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you see guys going,</v>

1095
00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:01.970
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other ways to skin a cat.</v>

1096
00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Like I gotta I gotta figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be more predictable or unpredictable </v>

1097
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:11.111
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's one of the real </v>

1098
00:53:11.111 --> 00:53:11.111
<v Speaker 2>problems with guys who were specialists </v>
<v Speaker 2>strikers,</v>

1099
00:53:11.111 --> 00:53:13.550
<v Speaker 2>is that when you fight a guy who's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialist striker,</v>

1100
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:15.620
<v Speaker 2>you know that he's not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting on you.</v>

1101
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:17.240
<v Speaker 2>So you're more relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1102
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:19.100
<v Speaker 2>you can loosen your legs up a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

1103
00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:20.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your footwork,</v>

1104
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.700
<v Speaker 2>your stance takes a different position </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not,</v>

1105
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:25.160
<v Speaker 2>you're not squared off always looking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprawl,</v>

1106
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:25.990
<v Speaker 2>hit under hugs.</v>

1107
00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

1108
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you bring that up in.</v>

1109
00:53:29.761 --> 00:53:33.690
<v Speaker 5>That makes me think about my last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1110
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a well rounded fighter,</v>

1111
00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:38.800
<v Speaker 5>but I said I went in there and had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>kickboxing fight with Robbie.</v>

1112
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.890
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I thought that would actually be to</v>

1113
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:45.390
<v Speaker 5>your benefit because what I said in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pre fight thing was that you,</v>

1114
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:48.480
<v Speaker 5>you issues you've had in the past with </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys who have been able to hold onto you</v>

1115
00:53:48.481 --> 00:53:53.481
<v Speaker 5>and grab you down like Hendrix and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that might be a benefit to you in the </v>

1116
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:55.710
<v Speaker 5>Robbie lawler fight because fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>Robbie,</v>

1117
00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:57.360
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a gladiator.</v>

1118
00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he is so rare in that regard.</v>

1119
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 5>He what you see is what you get that </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>

1120
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:09.411
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he is all bike down the mouthpiece and </v>

1121
00:54:09.411 --> 00:54:09.750
<v Speaker 5>move forward and he's got excellent </v>
<v Speaker 5>technique and he's.</v>

1122
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:12.330
<v Speaker 5>She's fucking tough as nails,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's a born fighter.</v>

1123
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.070
<v Speaker 5>Born funds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1124
00:54:14.071 --> 00:54:17.040
<v Speaker 5>that's why that fight was so good </v>
<v Speaker 5>between you guys that last round,</v>

1125
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:18.390
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

1126
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:21.570
<v Speaker 5>When the fucking round was over and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys both put your arms on the cage.</v>

1127
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:23.250
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the.</v>

1128
00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:28.340
<v Speaker 5>That was the perfect example of leaving </v>
<v Speaker 5>it all in the octagon.</v>

1129
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys just emptied out the tank.</v>

1130
00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:35.370
<v Speaker 5>You were on fumes and then the Buzzer </v>
<v Speaker 5>rang and you both did the same thing.</v>

1131
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:40.400
<v Speaker 5>When the fuck is that ever happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's ever happened in a </v>

1132
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.510
<v Speaker 5>fight with the fights over and both guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>just walk to the cage.</v>

1133
00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:43.770
<v Speaker 5>He didn't hug each other like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking happened.</v>

1134
00:54:43.771 --> 00:54:44.880
<v Speaker 5>Later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can look at this.</v>

1135
00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:46.680
<v Speaker 5>Look at this picture right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's you guys.</v>

1136
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.020
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking never happened man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen that.</v>

1137
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't conscious of that at that </v>
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

1138
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:54.330
<v Speaker 5>I think I was on oxygen deprived.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hypoxic,</v>

1139
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:56.560
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably mildly concussed.</v>

1140
00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.750
<v Speaker 5>Taking shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a fucking amazing fight.</v>

1141
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:04.680
<v Speaker 5>It was an amazing fight and it was an </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing round.</v>

1142
00:55:04.681 --> 00:55:07.440
<v Speaker 5>That fifth round was just goddamn chaos </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean.</v>

1143
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:12.860
<v Speaker 5>That to me is all of the scariest </v>
<v Speaker 5>aspects of mma as far as damage and you </v>

1144
00:55:14.551 --> 00:55:19.551
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you guys are doing to each other </v>

1145
00:55:19.551 --> 00:55:20.520
<v Speaker 5>and all the greatest aspects of mma as </v>
<v Speaker 5>far as like display of heart and courage</v>

1146
00:55:20.521 --> 00:55:25.521
<v Speaker 5>and willpower and just determination </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you had to be burning.</v>

1147
00:55:25.711 --> 00:55:27.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was it like in there?</v>

1148
00:55:27.571 --> 00:55:28.290
<v Speaker 5>That fifth round?</v>

1149
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.990
<v Speaker 5>I came out and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was feeling good.</v>

1150
00:55:33.991 --> 00:55:37.670
<v Speaker 5>I think I came out and finishing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fourth round I finished strong.</v>

1151
00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.850
<v Speaker 5>Almost almost had him finished.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1152
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.330
<v Speaker 5>in that fifth round I knew that he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to come out like,</v>

1153
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a bat out of hell.</v>

1154
00:55:44.671 --> 00:55:47.380
<v Speaker 5>So I wanted to finish strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you never know what the,</v>

1155
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.080
<v Speaker 5>what the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know where I was.</v>

1156
00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:51.150
<v Speaker 5>I felt like I was maybe up on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scorecards,</v>

1157
00:55:51.151 --> 00:55:51.990
<v Speaker 5>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it,</v>

1158
00:55:51.991 --> 00:55:54.270
<v Speaker 5>I need to go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I started the round really,</v>

1159
00:55:54.271 --> 00:55:57.860
<v Speaker 5>really strong I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he woke up and you know,</v>

1160
00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:00.270
<v Speaker 5>came on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turned on is beast mode,</v>

1161
00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:02.540
<v Speaker 5>like he does at the end of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights and you know,</v>

1162
00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Speaker 5>had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had led into some really heavy strikes.</v>

1163
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.320
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>

1164
00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:10.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean we were just digging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even remember.</v>

1165
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.030
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

1166
00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:16.130
<v Speaker 5>I remember at certain points,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess the only thing that I could </v>

1167
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:21.380
<v Speaker 5>compare it to was like being in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ocean and having waves crashing on you </v>

1168
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:26.320
<v Speaker 5>and you're just getting your head above </v>
<v Speaker 5>water just to get enough breath and then</v>

1169
00:56:26.321 --> 00:56:28.540
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're getting another one crashing down</v>

1170
00:56:28.541 --> 00:56:33.541
<v Speaker 5>upon you and you are out of breath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're fucking struggling for survival </v>

1171
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:40.080
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're just doing your best to </v>

1172
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:40.080
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1173
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to come up a moment like that in a fight</v>

1174
00:56:41.891 --> 00:56:46.891
<v Speaker 5>like that has got to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuels you in a way that nothing else can</v>

1175
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:52.891
<v Speaker 5>when you're in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you know that those moments can </v>

1176
00:56:52.891 --> 00:56:55.351
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you're thinking about slowing </v>

1177
00:56:55.351 --> 00:56:57.631
<v Speaker 5>down and a strength and conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 5>program or when you're doing rounds in </v>

1178
00:56:57.631 --> 00:56:58.840
<v Speaker 5>the bag and you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>slowing down that moments,</v>

1179
00:56:58.841 --> 00:57:00.430
<v Speaker 5>like thinking about that fight.</v>

1180
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that has got to be.</v>

1181
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:08.040
<v Speaker 5>That's something tangible you fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>grab onto when you're hitting those,</v>

1183
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.480
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those points.</v>

1184
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 5>You're hitting your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1185
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:16.020
<v Speaker 5>your edge and you don't know if you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>go any farther than that sort of thing </v>

1186
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:18.040
<v Speaker 5>that can bring you through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1187
00:57:18.041 --> 00:57:23.041
<v Speaker 5>there's the debate in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is the most important aspect </v>

1188
00:57:23.041 --> 00:57:24.220
<v Speaker 5>of training?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it strength and conditioning?</v>

1189
00:57:24.221 --> 00:57:26.110
<v Speaker 5>Is it skill training?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>

1190
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:28.600
<v Speaker 5>how do you quantify that when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>to a fight camp?</v>

1191
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:33.990
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that nickerson was </v>

1192
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:36.181
<v Speaker 5>saying when I talked to him about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like he believes that one of </v>

1193
00:57:36.181 --> 00:57:37.870
<v Speaker 5>fighter comes to him or when a fighter </v>
<v Speaker 5>is preparing for a fight,</v>

1194
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:40.720
<v Speaker 5>they already have all these skills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They already know how to fight.</v>

1195
00:57:40.721 --> 00:57:44.950
<v Speaker 5>They already know how to kickbox here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I already know Jujitsu when it comes</v>

1196
00:57:44.951 --> 00:57:49.951
<v Speaker 5>down to what a camp is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he believes that the primary focus </v>

1197
00:57:49.961 --> 00:57:51.670
<v Speaker 5>should be on physical preparation.</v>

1198
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:56.880
<v Speaker 5>The primary focus should be on getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>your body to be able to perform at an </v>

1199
00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.350
<v Speaker 5>extremely high output for a long time or</v>
<v Speaker 5>recover quickly.</v>

1200
00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:04.620
<v Speaker 5>And if you can get there that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>benefits of that are greater than the </v>

1201
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:08.761
<v Speaker 5>benefits of just consistently working on</v>
<v Speaker 5>skill training and drilling and all </v>

1202
00:58:08.761 --> 00:58:08.761
<v Speaker 5>these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1203
00:58:08.761 --> 00:58:12.500
<v Speaker 5>I think there has to be a balance </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you can be in phenomenal fucking</v>

1204
00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:17.520
<v Speaker 5>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ready to go five rounds and then step </v>

1205
00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:17.520
<v Speaker 5>out and get knocked the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1206
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.650
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1207
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:20.590
<v Speaker 5>or you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could freeze up.</v>

1208
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.590
<v Speaker 5>So I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1209
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.120
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mental aspect of it,</v>

1210
00:58:24.121 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 5>the psychological aspect is super,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super important drill,</v>

1211
00:58:27.611 --> 00:58:28.970
<v Speaker 5>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you,</v>

1212
00:58:28.971 --> 00:58:33.971
<v Speaker 5>do you have a mental coach or do you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a visualization drills or anything </v>

1213
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:34.930
<v Speaker 5>along those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I visualize,</v>

1214
00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:36.160
<v Speaker 5>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

1215
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.410
<v Speaker 5>and I've done this quite a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1216
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:43.440
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a coach I work with ricky lundell talks </v>

1217
00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.320
<v Speaker 5>about bringing it to the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1218
00:58:44.321 --> 00:58:46.360
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's about being a game day player.</v>

1219
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:47.950
<v Speaker 5>I love ricky by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just love that guy.</v>

1223
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Good all around dude for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm being a game day player,</v>

1224
00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get a lot of these guys in the gym,</v>

1225
00:58:59.711 --> 00:59:01.750
<v Speaker 5>they're killers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>world beaters,</v>

1226
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:04.900
<v Speaker 5>but then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bell rings that are under the bright</v>

1227
00:59:04.901 --> 00:59:09.901
<v Speaker 5>lights and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wilt and the doubts and then come </v>

1228
00:59:09.901 --> 00:59:10.060
<v Speaker 5>haunting home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:59:10.061 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 5>Well you get and then you get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These other guys are like,</v>

1230
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:12.670
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

1231
00:59:12.671 --> 00:59:15.250
<v Speaker 5>he's fighting in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're seeing training.</v>

1232
00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:16.090
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>

1233
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:17.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how well this,</v>

1234
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:19.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I want to watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a nice guy.</v>

1235
00:59:19.301 --> 00:59:23.180
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get worked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he goes out there and you know,</v>

1236
00:59:23.181 --> 00:59:24.110
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and does work.</v>

1237
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:27.740
<v Speaker 5>It rises to the occasion and have </v>
<v Speaker 5>accomplished as something that,</v>

1238
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you maybe not even.</v>

1239
00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:33.540
<v Speaker 5>He realized that he could do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1240
00:59:33.541 --> 00:59:38.541
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an interesting thing to try to </v>

1241
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:39.440
<v Speaker 5>figure out where the balance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the focus should be.</v>

1242
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:40.880
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's different for </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody,</v>

1243
00:59:40.881 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's different for everybody.</v>

1244
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:43.460
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no one answer.</v>

1245
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:48.130
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing about martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I've heard some,</v>

1246
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:51.200
<v Speaker 5>I heard this guy talking about this one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's not an art,</v>

1247
00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's just people beating each other</v>

1248
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 5>up and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1249
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:58.610
<v Speaker 5>that is such an ignorant thing to say </v>
<v Speaker 5>because when you watch someone fight,</v>

1250
00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.670
<v Speaker 5>you are watching art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just violent.</v>

1251
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.820
<v Speaker 5>It's a violent art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I watch like your fight with Tiago </v>

1252
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.430
<v Speaker 5>Elvis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't tell me that was an art.</v>

1253
01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:12.550
<v Speaker 5>That was an artistic performance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like your interpretation of the </v>

1254
01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:16.610
<v Speaker 5>movements in the moment to step in and </v>
<v Speaker 5>blast that elbow.</v>

1255
01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:17.630
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1256
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:22.660
<v Speaker 5>that's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not beautiful to him or </v>

1257
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.120
<v Speaker 5>anybody who cares about him or his </v>
<v Speaker 5>facial structure or.</v>

1258
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.100
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's its beauty.</v>

1259
01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:26.900
<v Speaker 5>There's beauty in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's beauty in that.</v>

1260
01:00:26.901 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1261
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:32.771
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when he did that to Matt Hughes and </v>

1262
01:00:32.771 --> 01:00:32.771
<v Speaker 5>when he hit Matt Hughes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that flying knee,</v>

1263
01:00:32.771 --> 01:00:34.140
<v Speaker 5>there's beauty in martial arts there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is,</v>

1264
01:00:34.141 --> 01:00:35.930
<v Speaker 5>it's a well for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

1265
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.750
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it always has been a creative outlet.</v>

1266
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:44.020
<v Speaker 5>I can put together all these sequences </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all these different things and in a </v>

1267
01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 5>way to solve a particular problem while </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

1268
01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:51.500
<v Speaker 5>somebody else is trying to do the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing against me.</v>

1269
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:55.040
<v Speaker 5>And the margin for error is really </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking thin.</v>

1270
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:56.230
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I,</v>

1271
01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.410
<v Speaker 5>if I zig when I should have zagged </v>
<v Speaker 5>kitchen,</v>

1272
01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.680
<v Speaker 5>a shin upside my head and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1273
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:04.070
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be bone exposed and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1274
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:06.100
<v Speaker 5>that's why this is a great thing as </v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

1275
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:07.610
<v Speaker 5>That's why I'm amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So fucking cool.</v>

1276
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.500
<v Speaker 5>It's so fucking cool to watch.</v>

1277
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.880
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the preparation for one night,</v>

1278
01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:19.180
<v Speaker 5>like the idea that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially for a guy like you who came </v>

1279
01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.291
<v Speaker 5>off of a knee surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're out for a year and then you have </v>

1280
01:01:23.291 --> 01:01:24.600
<v Speaker 5>to hold out for more than a year for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>geography.</v>

1281
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:25.550
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how long was it?</v>

1282
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:30.580
<v Speaker 5>Probably a 16 months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have all this time building up to</v>

1283
01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:39.221
<v Speaker 5>this one moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How difficult is it to just to just be </v>

1284
01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:46.060
<v Speaker 5>in the moment when that happens and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>be overwhelmed by the fact that so much </v>

1285
01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:51.911
<v Speaker 5>of your future is riding on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not entirely set for life </v>

1286
01:01:51.911 --> 01:01:53.040
<v Speaker 5>financially yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1287
01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:55.640
<v Speaker 5>there's all these different variables.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but yet here you are preparing for this </v>

<v Speaker 5>it just slips through your fingers this </v>

1292
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:14.411
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This moment is just there that you </v>

1293

<v Speaker 5>you can't hold down and you're,</v>

1294
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:19.421
<v Speaker 5>you're sharing this moment with another </v>
<v Speaker 5>trained killer and you're just locked </v>

1295
01:02:19.421 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 5>into a cage and you</v>

<v Speaker 4>emotions.</v>

1302
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:40.710
<v Speaker 4>And I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel happy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I feel fucking nervous.</v>

1304
01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:43.580

<v Speaker 4>and be in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in trust,</v>

1309

<v Speaker 4>in my training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trust,</v>

1310
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:58.860
<v Speaker 4>in the preparation that I've done up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that point.</v>

1311
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:04.130
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because me and my mind and my emotions </v>

1312
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:06.231
<v Speaker 4>do all sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just have to know that I've done </v>

1313

<v Speaker 4>what I need to do in preparation for </v>
<v Speaker 4>this fight that I'm going to be all </v>

1314

1315
01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:17.190
<v Speaker 4>less than 100 percent than my best.</v>

1316
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:20.290
<v Speaker 4>I will never give anything less than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1317
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:24.150
<v Speaker 4>what you saw in that fight.</v>

1318
01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:25.440
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1321
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 4>It may be a terrible night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's out of my control.</v>

1322
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:34.020
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave everything that I could to each,</v>

1323
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:36.060
<v Speaker 4>each round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>each training session,</v>

1324
01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>each,</v>

1325
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.480

<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1326
01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.640
<v Speaker 4>of the training camps.</v>

1327
01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've done everything in my control to </v>

<v Speaker 4>the best of my ability.</v>

1330
01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:55.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also the things that are out of </v>

1331
01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:55.540
<v Speaker 4>your control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't worry about that shit.</v>

1332
01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.150
<v Speaker 4>Injuries like injuries,</v>

1333
01:03:57.151 --> 01:03:59.100

<v Speaker 4>that one that you don't see.</v>

1334
01:03:59.160 --> 01:03:59.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1335
01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.600
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1336
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.100
<v Speaker 4>shit happens,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's the thrill of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make the highlights sweeter </v>

1339
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.120
<v Speaker 4>knowing that those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

1340
01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bad moments are out there that </v>

1341
01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:18.040
<v Speaker 4>they're possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1342
01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:18.040
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1343
01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.520
<v Speaker 4>it's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're walking on a razor's razor's edge </v>

1344
01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.130
<v Speaker 4>on this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1345
01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:25.140
<v Speaker 4>it could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be a phenomenal night.</v>

1346
01:04:25.141 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 4>It could be terrible night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1347
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.420
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1348
01:04:27.421 --> 01:04:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's died in MMA at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not in the UFC and the UFC,</v>

1349
01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:34.260
<v Speaker 4>but it shit could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a tough thing.</v>

1350
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.510
<v Speaker 4>What are your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your feelings on weight cutting?</v>

1351
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could be assured that</v>

1352
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.520
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cutting.</v>

1353
01:04:44.521 --> 01:04:49.521
<v Speaker 2>We'd be out of the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's just throw all the weight </v>

1354
01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:49.521
<v Speaker 2>classes out and then let's just say </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1355
01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:50.820
<v Speaker 2>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you walk around like one 85,</v>

1356
01:04:50.821 --> 01:04:55.821
<v Speaker 2>one 90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that between [inaudible] </v>

1357
01:04:55.821 --> 01:04:58.011
<v Speaker 2>91 95.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could be assured that that is </v>

1358
01:04:58.011 --> 01:05:01.581
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what your opponent's going away </v>

1359
01:05:01.581 --> 01:05:01.581
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you're going to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to cut any weight,</v>

1360
01:05:01.581 --> 01:05:03.840
<v Speaker 2>would wouldn't you think that that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a better way to compete,</v>

1361
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.750
<v Speaker 2>to just completely eliminate that from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the equation.</v>

1362
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Just find out whatever is your natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy weight and competed that instead</v>

1363
01:05:12.151 --> 01:05:17.151
<v Speaker 2>of this insane thing that everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing where they're dehydrating </v>

1364
01:05:17.151 --> 01:05:19.000
<v Speaker 2>themselves a massive percentage of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body weight,</v>

1365
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:21.470
<v Speaker 2>sometimes as much as 10 percent of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body weight,</v>

1366
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 2>which is getting sucked away in water to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where you could literally only</v>

1367
01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:28.900
<v Speaker 2>exist in that state for a short period </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>

1368
01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Couple of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1369
01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:35.070
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking bananas that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of cage fighting that one day.</v>

1370
01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:40.740
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the athletic commissions are</v>

1371
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:46.771
<v Speaker 2>sleeping on a potential time bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just ignoring that this is a </v>

1372
01:05:46.961 --> 01:05:51.961
<v Speaker 2>huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While they're concentrating on steroids </v>

1373
01:05:51.961 --> 01:05:52.810
<v Speaker 2>and epo and all these other things which</v>
<v Speaker 2>are real issues,</v>

1374
01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.330
<v Speaker 2>those things are unquestionably real </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

1375
01:05:55.750 --> 01:06:00.750
<v Speaker 2>but just as big of an issue is massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydration 24 hours before a cage </v>

1376
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:06.331
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially now that they've eliminated </v>

1377
01:06:06.331 --> 01:06:09.930
<v Speaker 2>the ivy rehydration methods and the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we know now there's medical science</v>

1378
01:06:12.641 --> 01:06:17.641
<v Speaker 2>has proven that the brain does not </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehydrate as fast as the rest of the </v>

1379
01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes longer.</v>

1380
01:06:18.561 --> 01:06:23.230
<v Speaker 2>It takes as much as 70 hours or 70 hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1381
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or</v>

1382
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 5>the yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To rehydrate your brain.</v>

1383
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:30.280
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1384
01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:35.940
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it'd be interesting to see </v>

1385
01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.881
<v Speaker 5>different proposals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that one fc is doing something </v>

1386
01:06:38.881 --> 01:06:39.040
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've eliminated it there.</v>

1387
01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:39.480
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1388
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:41.890
<v Speaker 5>What are they gonna check your hydration</v>
<v Speaker 5>levels.</v>

1389
01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.570
<v Speaker 5>They're going to eliminate weight </v>
<v Speaker 5>cutting.</v>

1390
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I know that they're doing the </v>

1391
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.140
<v Speaker 5>hydration levels on like a collegiate </v>
<v Speaker 5>and high school wrestling,</v>

1392
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:51.200
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1393
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:54.250
<v Speaker 5>a level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I still,</v>

1394
01:06:54.251 --> 01:06:56.200
<v Speaker 5>I still know guys that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>game that system.</v>

1395
01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll let him try to game that system.</v>

1396
01:06:58.511 --> 01:07:01.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you can eliminate that and tasked</v>

1397
01:07:01.571 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 5>hydration levels and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine like a guy like Johnny Hendricks</v>

1398
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:09.571
<v Speaker 5>who never made it to the fight with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Tyron Woodley because the weight </v>

1399
01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:12.181
<v Speaker 5>cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine them getting to a point where </v>

1400
01:07:12.181 --> 01:07:12.181
<v Speaker 5>they check them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>

1401
01:07:12.181 --> 01:07:12.340
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're fucking dehydrated.</v>

1402
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.460
<v Speaker 5>You can't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1403
01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.890
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't make weight like you,</v>

1404
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.920
<v Speaker 5>you're not where you're supposed to be.</v>

1405
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm on the side of health for fighters </v>

1406
01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:26.470
<v Speaker 5>and these guys taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

1407
01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.570
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're doing this for a very brief period</v>

1408
01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:33.571
<v Speaker 5>of time in our lives and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the repercussions longterm from a lot </v>

1409
01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:37.861
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The lot of the different stuff involve </v>

1410
01:07:37.861 --> 01:07:37.861
<v Speaker 5>including weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1411
01:07:37.861 --> 01:07:42.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is gonna have longterm </v>

1412
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:42.520
<v Speaker 5>ramifications.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for internal organs,</v>

1413
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.480
<v Speaker 5>specifically kidneys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1414
01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:47.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think it ages you man,</v>

1415
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:52.390
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're not doing it </v>

1416
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:54.211
<v Speaker 5>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're not living a </v>

1417
01:07:54.211 --> 01:07:54.211
<v Speaker 5>healthy lifestyle year round,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden,</v>

1418
01:07:54.211 --> 01:07:58.020
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to change the way that I eat </v>

1419
01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.080
<v Speaker 5>so drastically that my body's go freak </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck out.</v>

1420
01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.220
<v Speaker 5>Which you see a lot of these guys and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then they don't make it to the,</v>

1421
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:07.260
<v Speaker 5>they don't make it to the way because </v>
<v Speaker 5>their system isn't used to eating like </v>

1422
01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:07.260
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of you know,</v>

1423
01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.420
<v Speaker 5>eating a bunch of bullshit and now all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden eating Greens,</v>

1424
01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:15.540
<v Speaker 5>which is good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but your body's still going to have </v>

1425
01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:15.540
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1426
01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:15.540
<v Speaker 5>this reaction to it.</v>

1427
01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you're not used to it.</v>

1428
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:17.990
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

1429
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:23.050
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would definitely like to see some </v>

1430
01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:23.050
<v Speaker 5>change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1431
01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it benefits the health of fighters,</v>

1432
01:08:23.211 --> 01:08:28.211
<v Speaker 5>I'm all for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it could possibly not </v>

1433
01:08:28.211 --> 01:08:30.761
<v Speaker 5>benefit them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that would be the biggest thing </v>

1434
01:08:30.761 --> 01:08:31.190
<v Speaker 5>that we could do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even more so than I think what the,</v>

1435
01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:36.270
<v Speaker 5>what Jeff Novitsky and the UFC is trying</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do with eliminating performance </v>

1436
01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 5>enhancing drugs is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love the fact that catching people.</v>

1437
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:40.670
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe that they caught ul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Romero.</v>

1438
01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.040
<v Speaker 5>Who would've thought that that guy was </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking steroids.</v>

1439
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.170
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who would have thought that?</v>

1440
01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.110
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Couple of those guys,</v>

1441
01:08:48.111 --> 01:08:49.790
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would've never believed it.</v>

1442
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:54.050
<v Speaker 5>Him or Hector Lombard was another one </v>
<v Speaker 5>who saw that common.</v>

1443
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.600
<v Speaker 5>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Vito Belfort,</v>

1444
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 5>are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nuts.</v>

1445
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.290
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1446
01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:02.120
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

1447
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1448
01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1449
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.450
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's awesome because,</v>

1450
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:08.590
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're,</v>

1451
01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:13.690
<v Speaker 5>we're going to come to a point in time </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the real near future where it's </v>

1452
01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:13.690
<v Speaker 5>impossible.</v>

1453
01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:13.690
<v Speaker 5>Cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1454
01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:18.371
<v Speaker 5>they're pretty close to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're pretty close to it now where </v>

1455
01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:19.130
<v Speaker 5>they are so good at catching people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're,</v>

1456
01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.770
<v Speaker 5>they're also saving urine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think is fascinating.</v>

1457
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:26.830
<v Speaker 5>See Urine and blood for eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to test in case they don't have a </v>

1458
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:30.641
<v Speaker 5>test that detects whatever it is you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>testing at this point where we can test </v>

1459
01:09:30.641 --> 01:09:31.800
<v Speaker 5>you down the down the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1460
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:35.330
<v Speaker 5>And you can come up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is cool.</v>

1461
01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:38.600
<v Speaker 5>They're super close to being able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>catch you doing anything now.</v>

1462
01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:42.500
<v Speaker 5>But what they're doing is they're coming</v>
<v Speaker 5>up with all these little designer things</v>

1463
01:09:42.501 --> 01:09:47.501
<v Speaker 5>and peptides and that's what you'll all </v>
<v Speaker 5>were got caught for some designer </v>

1464
01:09:47.501 --> 01:09:50.981
<v Speaker 5>peptide which artificially increases </v>
<v Speaker 5>your body's own production of </v>

1465
01:09:50.981 --> 01:09:52.010
<v Speaker 5>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1466
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:57.070
<v Speaker 5>So they're doing all this sneaky weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit that used to be totally </v>

1467
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:58.100
<v Speaker 5>undetectable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1468
01:09:58.101 --> 01:09:59.720
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six years ago or what have you.</v>

1469
01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:00.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well at that,</v>

1470
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.210
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what they'd been doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a long time.</v>

1471
01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:03.010
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>

1472
01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:08.020
<v Speaker 5>it's been like an arms race between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dopers and antidote with.</v>

1473
01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:14.150
<v Speaker 5>That's what I understand with the Lance </v>
<v Speaker 5>Armstrong who was like a clear thing,</v>

1474
01:10:14.151 --> 01:10:19.151
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were like some super sophisticated </v>

1475
01:10:19.151 --> 01:10:22.010
<v Speaker 5>fucking programs to beat these tests.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1476
01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:27.011
<v Speaker 5>And with Lance Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the interesting things was </v>

1477
01:10:27.011 --> 01:10:31.040
<v Speaker 5>everybody was dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not like mma where you have,</v>

1478
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:33.950
<v Speaker 5>there's a few guys that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Novitsky,</v>

1479
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.680
<v Speaker 5>I think he calls it the smell test or </v>
<v Speaker 5>the look test while you look at them and</v>

1480
01:10:37.681 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck's going on over there?</v>

1481
01:10:40.161 --> 01:10:41.000
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

1482
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:45.850
<v Speaker 5>But with Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like none of those guys looked like your</v>

1483
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:50.970
<v Speaker 5>marrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were just little skinny guys on </v>

1484
01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:50.970
<v Speaker 5>bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the nature of the sport.</v>

1485
01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:55.120
<v Speaker 5>And I think what they were probably what</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were taking is different than what </v>

1486
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:55.120
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1487
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:57.700
<v Speaker 5>big muscled up a prize.</v>

1488
01:10:57.710 --> 01:10:58.670
<v Speaker 5>Fighters are taking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1489
01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:03.671
<v Speaker 5>another important distinction about </v>
<v Speaker 5>these bands and about the banning of Ivy</v>

1490
01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:11.230
<v Speaker 5>Rehydration is now you can't blood dope </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they used to be able to blood </v>

1491
01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:11.750
<v Speaker 5>dope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He used to be able to pretty,</v>

1492
01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.110
<v Speaker 5>pretty easy to just take your blood out </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then reinserted into your body.</v>

1493
01:11:16.111 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 5>You have more blood and you get the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of benefits that you would get with</v>

1494
01:11:18.871 --> 01:11:23.871
<v Speaker 5>epo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can't do that anymore because </v>

1495
01:11:23.871 --> 01:11:23.871
<v Speaker 5>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll be able to detect.</v>

1496
01:11:23.871 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 5>They can actually detect plastics in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>blood that come from the bags and from </v>

1497
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.670
<v Speaker 5>the tubes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking nuts.</v>

1498
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.530
<v Speaker 5>It's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1499
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 5>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking crazy what they can do.</v>

1500
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 5>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard though,</v>

1501
01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.240
<v Speaker 5>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1502
01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:42.690
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about the arms race that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people can use a glass syringe class and</v>

1503
01:11:44.671 --> 01:11:47.090
<v Speaker 5>then um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the van,</v>

1504
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:50.790
<v Speaker 5>like a sterilized veins from animals as </v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

1505
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:51.840
<v Speaker 5>as their tubing.</v>

1506
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's whatever.</v>

1507
01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1508
01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:57.000
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 5>Like sausage casing and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1510
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:04.120
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they're going to check for big veins</v>

1511
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.760
<v Speaker 5>down the rabbit hole with all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1512
01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:09.820
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1513
01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Novitsky was telling me that they've now</v>
<v Speaker 5>figured out a way to develop </v>

1514
01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.891
<v Speaker 5>testosterone from animals and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>semi theoretical at this point where </v>

1515
01:12:19.091 --> 01:12:24.091
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they haven't caught anybody who's done </v>

1516
01:12:24.091 --> 01:12:25.971
<v Speaker 5>it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then maybe one of the reasons why </v>

1517
01:12:25.971 --> 01:12:25.971
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1518
01:12:25.971 --> 01:12:25.971
<v Speaker 5>they're holding onto this blood for </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight years,</v>

1519
01:12:25.971 --> 01:12:29.040
<v Speaker 5>but he said they've figured out a way </v>
<v Speaker 5>because right now I don't understand the</v>

1520
01:12:29.041 --> 01:12:34.041
<v Speaker 5>process,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but right now the way they develop </v>

1521
01:12:34.041 --> 01:12:34.170
<v Speaker 5>artificial testosterone is through wild </v>
<v Speaker 5>yams.</v>

1522
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:38.100
<v Speaker 5>They use Mexican yams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking don't understand it,</v>

1523
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:42.720
<v Speaker 5>but somehow through yams they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>develop testosterone.</v>

1524
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.390
<v Speaker 5>Those are manly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>manly Yam.</v>

1525
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:48.930
<v Speaker 5>I've always said again what I am.</v>

1526
01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:52.020
<v Speaker 5>That's why pop pop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew he was ahead of the time.</v>

1527
01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:57.021
<v Speaker 5>They make me feel manly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they've figured out a way through </v>

1528
01:12:57.021 --> 01:13:00.621
<v Speaker 5>these carbon isotope tests to detect </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the testosterone in your body was </v>

1529
01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:04.410
<v Speaker 5>nonindigenous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it was exogenous.</v>

1530
01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.540
<v Speaker 5>It's somehow or another from something </v>
<v Speaker 5>else,</v>

1531
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:10.200
<v Speaker 5>but they won't be able to do this right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

1532
01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:15.201
<v Speaker 5>at least with animal testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is so fucking bizarre.</v>

1533
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:20.820
<v Speaker 5>It will always be a race between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheaters and those who control those.</v>

1534
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:26.350
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the French Tour de France secretly </v>

1535
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:30.470
<v Speaker 5>symbolism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a biking and a back in the early 20th </v>

1536
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:33.090
<v Speaker 5>century there were doing it already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then today,</v>

1537
01:13:33.091 --> 01:13:38.091
<v Speaker 5>every Sunday there is some competition </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere like a local short distance </v>

1538
01:13:38.091 --> 01:13:38.630
<v Speaker 5>drafting and those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1539
01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:41.310
<v Speaker 5>Sunday athletes and they dope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:13:41.311 --> 01:13:46.311
<v Speaker 5>They're saying that like they check </v>
<v Speaker 5>executives that want to like show off </v>

1541
01:13:46.311 --> 01:13:50.270
<v Speaker 5>our taking epo and entering in </v>
<v Speaker 5>triathlons and winning them can put that</v>

1542
01:13:50.401 --> 01:13:53.220
<v Speaker 5>on their resume.</v>
<v Speaker 5>May Jack to the tits on EPO,</v>

1543
01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:55.290
<v Speaker 5>which is really fucking dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently.</v>

1544
01:13:55.550 --> 01:14:00.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand he epo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the way it's been described to me </v>

1545
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:02.760
<v Speaker 5>was that when you have so much extra </v>
<v Speaker 5>blood in your system,</v>

1546
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:08.120
<v Speaker 5>there's a high risk of stroke and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to mitigate the amount of EPO </v>

1547
01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.990
<v Speaker 5>and the amount of blood in your system </v>
<v Speaker 5>by constantly exercising.</v>

1548
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to drink water and exercise.</v>

1549
01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise your blood gets too thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we talk,</v>

1550
01:14:18.101 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 2>millions of people are doing crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in their day to day life that are</v>

1551
01:14:22.481 --> 01:14:26.260
<v Speaker 2>going to mess up with their brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mess up with their whole physiology,</v>

1552
01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 2>hormonal balance and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not getting paid to do it.</v>

1553
01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:33.550
<v Speaker 2>They just do it out of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance or laziness or a.</v>

1554
01:14:33.551 --> 01:14:36.940
<v Speaker 2>So why wouldn't these professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes of some of them,</v>

1555
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.280
<v Speaker 2>especially in combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1556
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:41.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's one thing running.</v>

1557
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Winning a bike race is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not getting kicked in the head or </v>

1558
01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:49.441
<v Speaker 2>being able to kick the guy in the head </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have that extra juice of </v>

1559
01:14:49.441 --> 01:14:50.290
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you're tired and you're in</v>

1560
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:55.291
<v Speaker 2>that fifth round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you come out because you're on epo </v>

1561
01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:58.560
<v Speaker 2>and you're fucking dominick Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>step in and throw in high kicks and the </v>

1562
01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:58.930
<v Speaker 2>other dude is gasping for air.</v>

1563
01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:01.540
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it becomes a huge issue.</v>

1564
01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're talking,</v>

1565
01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:05.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially light.</v>

1566
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1567
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:11.650
<v Speaker 2>the way I describe MMA is it's high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level problem solving with dire physical</v>

1568
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:14.360
<v Speaker 2>consequences and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've seen it,</v>

1569
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:17.320
<v Speaker 2>we've all seen guys get flatlined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all seen people,</v>

1570
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done it to a bunch of guys inside</v>

1571
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:21.570
<v Speaker 2>the octagon and it could have been you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1572
01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:26.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking nutty sport and in this </v>

1573
01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:29.911
<v Speaker 2>sport the doping has just a much higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of consequences or ramifications,</v>

1574
01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.060
<v Speaker 2>ramifications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right word.</v>

1575
01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:37.090
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting to me though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm absolutely anti-doping,</v>

1576
01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:42.150
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pro the science involved in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what we're experiencing right </v>

1577
01:15:43.031 --> 01:15:48.031
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I believe is that we are in a </v>

1578
01:15:48.031 --> 01:15:50.281
<v Speaker 2>period of time in human history where </v>
<v Speaker 2>our understanding of the scientific </v>

1579
01:15:50.281 --> 01:15:55.231
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the body and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms and all of the things that </v>

1580
01:15:55.231 --> 01:15:58.711
<v Speaker 2>they can do to it is being sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>deciphered and tweaked and poked by all </v>

1581
01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:01.060
<v Speaker 2>these various scientists.</v>

1582
01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:04.960
<v Speaker 2>Although I believe that should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of competitive athletics.</v>

1583
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:07.990
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get to a point in who </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows,</v>

1584
01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:08.680
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

1585
01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:12.340
<v Speaker 2>30 years where they're going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to genetically reengineer human beings.</v>

1586
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:14.590
<v Speaker 2>And this is all going to be out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>

1587
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I think we're kind of experiencing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last years of natural competition,</v>

1588
01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:22.300
<v Speaker 2>gene doping stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>

1589
01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this new thing that they've,</v>

1590
01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1591
01:16:26.011 --> 01:16:31.011
<v Speaker 2>they've figured out how to do or they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of this really interesting </v>

1592
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:37.410
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called Crispr is what they've </v>

1593
01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 2>developed and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll butcher it if I try to give you the</v>

1594
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:42.961
<v Speaker 2>scientific definition of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can literally add genes and,</v>

1595
01:16:43.311 --> 01:16:48.010
<v Speaker 2>and manipulate genes and they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>so in small animals and you know,</v>

1596
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.790
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multicellular organisms and they're,</v>

1597
01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:55.900
<v Speaker 2>they're getting it to a point where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>really understand it and they're saying </v>

1598
01:16:55.900 --> 01:17:00.331
<v Speaker 2>that in China they're starting to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this with human beings and they're </v>

1599
01:17:00.331 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 2>starting to fuck with it and test it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1600
01:17:01.721 --> 01:17:06.721
<v Speaker 2>you might see some Chinese Wolverine in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next 20 years and you'll know that </v>

1601
01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.820
<v Speaker 2>that kid is the product of these Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments.</v>

1602
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:11.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1603
01:17:11.811 --> 01:17:15.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what they used to call corella </v>
<v Speaker 2>these to call Corella and the experiment</v>

1604
01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:17.720
<v Speaker 2>because if you've ever seen Carolyn's </v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

1605
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 2>his mother and father like five foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1606
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:25.930
<v Speaker 2>they're like these tiny people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Carolyn was this fucking monster of </v>

1607
01:17:26.961 --> 01:17:28.400
<v Speaker 2>a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1608
01:17:28.401 --> 01:17:29.570
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know who we're talking about?</v>

1609
01:17:29.571 --> 01:17:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Alexander Karelin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undefeated wrestler.</v>

1610
01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lost one time to rule on gardener,</v>

1611
01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:37.280
<v Speaker 2>but the only reason we lost is they </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed a rule.</v>

1612
01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.230
<v Speaker 2>They changed the rule that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greco,</v>

1613
01:17:39.231 --> 01:17:42.110
<v Speaker 2>so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you release your grip,</v>

1614
01:17:42.111 --> 01:17:43.640
<v Speaker 2>if someone gets you to release your </v>
<v Speaker 2>grip,</v>

1615
01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:47.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a point which is insane and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>how gardener beat him.</v>

1616
01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:52.631
<v Speaker 2>Like he couldn't do anything to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got corella and towards the end </v>

1617
01:17:52.631 --> 01:17:52.750
<v Speaker 2>of his career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1618
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.010
<v Speaker 2>He'd been wrestled forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would.</v>

1619
01:17:55.220 --> 01:18:00.220
<v Speaker 2>He was so scary that guys would try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>flatten out to keep from getting thrown </v>

1620
01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:04.691
<v Speaker 2>by him because he was so strong that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would take these men 280 pound man and </v>

1621
01:18:04.691 --> 01:18:07.160
<v Speaker 2>he would just go under them while their </v>
<v Speaker 2>belly down,</v>

1622
01:18:07.161 --> 01:18:09.530
<v Speaker 2>flattened out on the mat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just praying.</v>

1623
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:14.530
<v Speaker 2>They don't get taken for a ride and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would lift them up and throw them </v>

1624
01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:16.940
<v Speaker 2>through the air with all his weight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their way.</v>

1625
01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coming down on them.</v>

1626
01:18:18.411 --> 01:18:23.411
<v Speaker 2>So he's essentially knocking them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck out with the mat where everybody </v>

1627
01:18:23.411 --> 01:18:26.090
<v Speaker 2>else was wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was wrestling as well,</v>

1628
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:28.090
<v Speaker 2>but he was also hitting you with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1629
01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:32.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy and no one knows how he got</v>

1630
01:18:32.121 --> 01:18:35.360
<v Speaker 2>so fucking big in history of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are always these,</v>

1631
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:39.550
<v Speaker 2>these freak of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these complete exceptional athlete in,</v>

1632
01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:44.630
<v Speaker 2>in a given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a given sport with what you say and </v>

1633
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.940
<v Speaker 2>the manipulations that are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do on,</v>

1634
01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:50.420
<v Speaker 2>on physiology may be using </v>
<v Speaker 2>nanotechnologies or indeed a genetic </v>

1635
01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 2>modifications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be able to replicate to clone</v>

1636
01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.300
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those freaks of,</v>

1637
01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.240
<v Speaker 2>of science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1638
01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:03.040
<v Speaker 2>they're going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen in our lifetimes.</v>

1639
01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.750
<v Speaker 2>It will happen in our children's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetimes.</v>

1640
01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:07.430
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Science doesn't stop.</v>

1641
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go just go back 40,</v>

1642
01:19:10.611 --> 01:19:12.650
<v Speaker 2>50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they were able to do,</v>

1643
01:19:12.651 --> 01:19:14.180
<v Speaker 2>if you had a knee surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1644
01:19:14.181 --> 01:19:15.770
<v Speaker 2>like you're talking about your knee </v>
<v Speaker 2>graft,</v>

1645
01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:18.710
<v Speaker 2>they were fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked.</v>

1646
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:20.150
<v Speaker 2>You're crippled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bumpkiny.</v>

1647
01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just 50 years ago.</v>

1648
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.600
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's inside of a living person's </v>

1649
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:26.600
<v Speaker 2>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

1650
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:30.220
<v Speaker 2>25 years ago or less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't able to do this one that I </v>

1651
01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:30.220
<v Speaker 2>had successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1652
01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:34.720
<v Speaker 2>My friend Steve Graham was on the US ski</v>
<v Speaker 2>team and he's had some fucking insane </v>

1653
01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.400
<v Speaker 2>number of surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1654
01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.960
<v Speaker 2>I want to say he's around 18 knee </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeries.</v>

1655
01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:40.860
<v Speaker 2>He said he has his knees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept like,</v>

1656
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you this real.</v>

1657
01:19:41.801 --> 01:19:45.020
<v Speaker 2>You fucking freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has his knees resurfaced.</v>

1658
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.490
<v Speaker 2>The tops of his knees are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1659
01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:50.990
<v Speaker 2>it's all steel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking bizarre,</v>

1660
01:19:50.991 --> 01:19:52.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>

1661
01:19:52.031 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 2>it's so freaky to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he came around,</v>

1662
01:19:56.170 --> 01:20:01.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were doing all these </v>

1663
01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:01.170
<v Speaker 2>experimental surgeries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

1664
01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:02.060
<v Speaker 2>they just couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know how to do it.</v>

1665
01:20:02.061 --> 01:20:05.410
<v Speaker 2>They just were taking all these risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here it is right here.</v>

1666
01:20:05.411 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna show you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking freaky.</v>

1667
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:12.930
<v Speaker 6>That's the surface of the inside of his </v>
<v Speaker 6>knee.</v>

1668
01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:18.230
<v Speaker 6>So he has no more cartilage and all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>meniscus has gone as well.</v>

1669
01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:20.190
<v Speaker 6>So if you see that white thing down </v>
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

1670
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:25.310
<v Speaker 6>that's artificial meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's like a pad that they put in </v>

1671
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:29.931
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they put this artificial paths in </v>

1672
01:20:29.931 --> 01:20:31.080
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then they have the tops of the knee,</v>

1673
01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:36.081
<v Speaker 6>the top of the femur and that glides on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Plastic Lusaka abstract painting.</v>

1674
01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:40.110
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like dinner?</v>

1675
01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:43.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I told him to send me this after you get</v>

1676
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:46.350
<v Speaker 6>your latest operation because he's had </v>
<v Speaker 6>so many operations.</v>

1677
01:20:46.351 --> 01:20:49.200
<v Speaker 6>He was so true down to the wire that </v>
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>

1678
01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:53.790
<v Speaker 6>this is the latest sort of fix.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's wild man.</v>

1679
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:58.820
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she's had multiple acl surgeries on </v>

1680
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:00.740
<v Speaker 6>both legs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>MCL.</v>

1681
01:21:00.850 --> 01:21:04.380
<v Speaker 6>It's just the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Meniscus scopes and this.</v>

1682
01:21:04.381 --> 01:21:09.381
<v Speaker 6>And that is nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They predicted that so many years ago </v>

1683
01:21:09.381 --> 01:21:09.381
<v Speaker 6>when I was a kid.</v>

1684
01:21:09.381 --> 01:21:10.800
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Steve Austin,</v>

1685
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:12.150
<v Speaker 6>whatever the name was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1686
01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:16.050
<v Speaker 6>it was fascinating by them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1687
01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.370
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're close to that.</v>

1688
01:21:17.371 --> 01:21:21.210
<v Speaker 6>I mean they're putting artificial hips </v>
<v Speaker 6>in people and having them being more,</v>

1689
01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:23.710
<v Speaker 6>no more durable than the natural hips.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

1690
01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:26.460
<v Speaker 6>They're so using a exoskeletons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1691
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:31.970
<v Speaker 6>Especially in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're really big on all these </v>

1692
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.970
<v Speaker 6>robotics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got it.</v>

1693
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:35.210
<v Speaker 6>Got An exoskeleton finding beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1694
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:40.250
<v Speaker 6>for people who really need it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had a very serious accident and </v>

1695
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:43.890
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing can do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's now your responsibility or you </v>

1696
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:45.090
<v Speaker 6>come back from war and need that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that kind of assistance.</v>

1697
01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:47.010
<v Speaker 6>In that case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe it's beautiful.</v>

1698
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.870
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But my,</v>

1699
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:53.890
<v Speaker 6>my concern is that these kinds of new </v>
<v Speaker 6>technology is going to be vulnerable to </v>

1700
01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:56.460
<v Speaker 6>millions of people who basically don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>give a crap about their body.</v>

1701
01:21:56.550 --> 01:22:01.550
<v Speaker 6>Their body has become completely alien </v>
<v Speaker 6>to themselves and the neglect it and let</v>

1702
01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.810
<v Speaker 6>it deteriorate.</v>

1703
01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:07.500
<v Speaker 6>You could think about it that way or you</v>
<v Speaker 6>could say,</v>

1704
01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:09.600
<v Speaker 6>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just technology.</v>

1705
01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It can be used or abused.</v>

1706
01:22:12.241 --> 01:22:15.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean like cars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean cars can be used to get places or</v>

1707
01:22:15.151 --> 01:22:17.790
<v Speaker 6>you could be a fat fuck and they just </v>
<v Speaker 6>will you over to your car.</v>

1708
01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:20.640
<v Speaker 6>You lose your way into the car and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>push you in and shut the door.</v>

1709
01:22:20.641 --> 01:22:23.370
<v Speaker 6>Then the car drives you around because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's too fucking lazy.</v>

1710
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:25.440
<v Speaker 6>The balance in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think in our society,</v>

1711
01:22:25.930 --> 01:22:30.930
<v Speaker 6>we always go too far.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That exoskeleton for your body becomes </v>

1712
01:22:31.171 --> 01:22:34.970
<v Speaker 6>what the shoe is to your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that your,</v>

1713
01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:35.680
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1714
01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.290
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

1715
01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:42.000
<v Speaker 6>your foot is going to atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your body's going to atrophy because you</v>

1716
01:22:42.001 --> 01:22:44.520
<v Speaker 6>have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your foot has this artificial art.</v>

1717
01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.500
<v Speaker 6>But from birth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like in wally,</v>

1718
01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:50.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love that move you.</v>

1719
01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.100
<v Speaker 6>And the thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1720
01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:54.750
<v Speaker 6>it's freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's inevitable freedom.</v>

1721
01:22:54.751 --> 01:22:57.030
<v Speaker 6>You do whatever you want to completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>agree with that.</v>

1722
01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:00.480
<v Speaker 6>But ultimately it becomes the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It becomes something that's not shocking</v>

1723
01:23:00.481 --> 01:23:03.790
<v Speaker 6>anymore in the wally world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1724
01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.590
<v Speaker 6>the movie in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not being able to even stand,</v>

1725
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.230
<v Speaker 6>let alone to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that shocking?</v>

1726
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.130
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the norm.</v>

1727
01:23:12.131 --> 01:23:16.320
<v Speaker 6>It's just something normal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My grandma was able to walk a little,</v>

1728
01:23:16.321 --> 01:23:17.600
<v Speaker 6>a few steps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>

1729
01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:21.100
<v Speaker 6>She was extremely fit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Know that we ultimately,</v>

1730
01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:26.130
<v Speaker 6>through generations we change the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so bear all won't be.</v>

1731
01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.170
<v Speaker 6>We won't be there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1732
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:34.560
<v Speaker 6>But somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like to know where we're going in a </v>

1733
01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:34.790
<v Speaker 6>good direction,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how the direction not to.</v>

1734
01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it is,</v>

1735
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:39.880
<v Speaker 6>it's definitely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it is a bad direction,</v>

1736
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:45.090
<v Speaker 6>but if we went back to a single celled </v>
<v Speaker 6>organism and I go look at these posters </v>

1737
01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:45.960
<v Speaker 6>with their multiple cells back when I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was a fucking kid,</v>

1738
01:23:45.961 --> 01:23:47.800
<v Speaker 6>you had to have one cell or happy.</v>

1739
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:50.800
<v Speaker 6>So I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's good or bad.</v>

1740
01:23:50.801 --> 01:23:53.170
<v Speaker 6>I think it's how,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how it's applied.</v>

1741
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.980
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1742
01:23:53.981 --> 01:23:55.600
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and is it beneficial,</v>

1743
01:23:55.601 --> 01:23:59.260
<v Speaker 6>is it right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it detrimental and what,</v>

1744
01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:04.060
<v Speaker 6>what is the implication on a societal </v>
<v Speaker 6>level on like an overall thing?</v>

1745
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:06.740
<v Speaker 6>We can look at tech technology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1746
01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.720
<v Speaker 6>the technology in general in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in that respect.</v>

1747
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.210
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like to see that as a,</v>

1748
01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:14.680
<v Speaker 6>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an,</v>

1749
01:24:15.190 --> 01:24:20.190
<v Speaker 6>as options,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as additional benefits to our current </v>

1750
01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:23.910
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And culture means that let's imagine </v>

1751
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:25.390
<v Speaker 6>topia like a society where every </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual would be,</v>

1752
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:28.840
<v Speaker 6>would consider their own health and </v>
<v Speaker 6>movement ability,</v>

1753
01:24:28.841 --> 01:24:33.130
<v Speaker 6>eyes somewhat personal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>biological duty.</v>

1754
01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:35.860
<v Speaker 6>So there would really make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they stay strong.</v>

1755
01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:37.780
<v Speaker 6>They stay healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can move,</v>

1756
01:24:38.190 --> 01:24:39.820
<v Speaker 6>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're in shape,</v>

1757
01:24:39.821 --> 01:24:42.550
<v Speaker 6>they're sharp physically and mentally </v>
<v Speaker 6>and on top of that,</v>

1758
01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:47.580
<v Speaker 6>whenever needed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would punctually and wisely use </v>

1759
01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:47.580
<v Speaker 6>those technologies.</v>

1760
01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:50.590
<v Speaker 6>Then that will be an enhanced lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 6>and society.</v>

1761
01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.910
<v Speaker 6>But when you have people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1762
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.920
<v Speaker 6>it's just there to support people who </v>
<v Speaker 6>have voluntarily disempowered and </v>

1763
01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.010
<v Speaker 6>themselves degenerate it themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1764
01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:05.100
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like the direction that would </v>

1765
01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:07.181
<v Speaker 6>be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are we basing that on the current </v>

1766
01:25:07.181 --> 01:25:07.210
<v Speaker 6>paradigm though?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we keep moving in the same direction,</v>

1767
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:12.270
<v Speaker 6>it's entirely possible that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to need to be in shape or get in </v>

1768
01:25:12.431 --> 01:25:14.410
<v Speaker 6>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're just gonna be in shape.</v>

1769
01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:17.080
<v Speaker 6>You're going to have something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they've invented,</v>

1770
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:19.900
<v Speaker 6>whether it's some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>biotechnology or what have you,</v>

1771
01:25:19.901 --> 01:25:22.360
<v Speaker 6>where you never get out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're always physically fit.</v>

1772
01:25:22.361 --> 01:25:24.850
<v Speaker 6>Your body regenerates tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you lose an arm,</v>

1773
01:25:24.851 --> 01:25:26.140
<v Speaker 6>it grows back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1774
01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:28.180
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't mean because here's the </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem.</v>

1775
01:25:28.181 --> 01:25:32.440
<v Speaker 6>You won't be the master of a technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody else will the same way.</v>

1776
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:37.570
<v Speaker 6>It's like if you ever stop growing their</v>
<v Speaker 6>food,</v>

1777
01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:43.440
<v Speaker 6>so when you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you need that food to be delivered to </v>

1778
01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:43.870
<v Speaker 6>you to be produced for you.</v>

1779
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:48.340
<v Speaker 6>If at some point the production of food </v>
<v Speaker 6>is in the hands of very little,</v>

1780
01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:51.070
<v Speaker 6>very few people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is no freedom anymore.</v>

1781
01:25:51.071 --> 01:25:52.360
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you said.</v>

1782
01:25:52.361 --> 01:25:54.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it allows you to be always strong,</v>

1783
01:25:54.170 --> 01:25:55.420
<v Speaker 6>always fit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>always held the.</v>

1784
01:25:55.421 --> 01:26:00.421
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the technology is in the hands of </v>

1785
01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:00.421
<v Speaker 6>the few people and when they want a </v>
<v Speaker 6>ticket back.</v>

1786
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:06.510
<v Speaker 6>That sounds like some Illuminati type,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's.</v>

1787
01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:07.810
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1788
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:12.910
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's that you don't have to go into a </v>

1789
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.910
<v Speaker 6>conspiracy theory to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you,</v>

1790
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:17.890
<v Speaker 6>are you in control?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it something that you can fix </v>

1791
01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:17.890
<v Speaker 6>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

1792
01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:20.450
<v Speaker 6>when you have a car or a boat or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

1793
01:26:20.451 --> 01:26:24.380
<v Speaker 6>can you fix the technology yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does it belong to you,</v>

1794
01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.560
<v Speaker 6>do control it or not?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you're talking about things in </v>

1795
01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.270
<v Speaker 6>practical sense in a practical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I agree with you in a practical sort</v>

1796
01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:33.350
<v Speaker 6>of a pragmatic approach.</v>

1797
01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.680
<v Speaker 6>I'm extrapolating a hundred years from </v>
<v Speaker 6>now when it all it's nonsense because </v>

1798
01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.731
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying there's going to be come a </v>
<v Speaker 6>time in the future where there are no </v>

1799
01:26:42.731 --> 01:26:42.731
<v Speaker 6>natural athletes because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 6>natural.</v>

1800
01:26:42.731 --> 01:26:47.471
<v Speaker 6>People were probably just a few years </v>
<v Speaker 6>away from being symbiotically connected </v>

1801
01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:53.420
<v Speaker 6>to electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're pretty close now with phones.</v>

1802
01:26:53.421 --> 01:26:54.990
<v Speaker 6>Will you leave the house without your </v>
<v Speaker 6>phone?</v>

1803
01:26:55.020 --> 01:27:00.020
<v Speaker 6>You freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] met very few people live </v>

1804
01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:00.260
<v Speaker 6>without a car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know you have your navigation system</v>

1805
01:27:00.261 --> 01:27:05.261
<v Speaker 6>to get you around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't really remember like three or </v>

1806
01:27:05.261 --> 01:27:05.261
<v Speaker 6>four phone numbers now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I was a kid,</v>

1807
01:27:05.261 --> 01:27:07.400
<v Speaker 6>I remembered everybody's number.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can be able to call my friends.</v>

1808
01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:12.560
<v Speaker 6>I been able to call my house,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I barely know my own home number now </v>

1809
01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.180
<v Speaker 6>when I give someone my cell phone number</v>
<v Speaker 6>after think,</v>

1810
01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to think about that number.</v>

1811
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:18.410
<v Speaker 6>So you'll get both.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You do give up some of your control.</v>

1812
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:23.470
<v Speaker 6>You didn't Google you get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get all sorts of good shit as well.</v>

1813
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.160
<v Speaker 6>I think drew and the bad shit that comes</v>
<v Speaker 6>with it.</v>

1814
01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:29.340
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you know what,</v>

1815
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:32.210
<v Speaker 6>50 years ago they started or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 6>longer,</v>

1816
01:27:32.211 --> 01:27:37.211
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they started making a fucking process </v>

1817
01:27:37.211 --> 01:27:37.211
<v Speaker 6>foods and that was like the best thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>

1818
01:27:37.211 --> 01:27:38.710
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't have to fuck it,</v>

1819
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.280
<v Speaker 6>cook our food anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>throw it,</v>

1820
01:27:40.281 --> 01:27:45.281
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have it made for us in a factory and we </v>

1821
01:27:45.281 --> 01:27:45.281
<v Speaker 6>just throw it in the oven and it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>

1822
01:27:45.281 --> 01:27:46.910
<v Speaker 6>This is the greatest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1823
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.980
<v Speaker 6>fast forward 30,</v>
<v Speaker 6>40 years and now we're fat and unhealthy</v>

1824
01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:57.460
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in our trans fats are national grop for,</v>

1825
01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:00.380
<v Speaker 6>for our healthcare is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1826
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:05.390
<v Speaker 6>or our healthcare cost exceeds our </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking gross domestic product for the </v>

1827
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:06.770
<v Speaker 6>fucking United States.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it were just,</v>

1828
01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.900
<v Speaker 6>you know there's.</v>

1829
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:10.430
<v Speaker 6>There's good parts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1830
01:28:10.431 --> 01:28:15.431
<v Speaker 6>they made.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They probably made food safer in a </v>

1831
01:28:15.431 --> 01:28:17.801
<v Speaker 6>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Less people are dying from fucking </v>

1832
01:28:17.801 --> 01:28:17.801
<v Speaker 6>listeria outbreaks and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

1833
01:28:17.801 --> 01:28:21.290
<v Speaker 6>but on the flip side of that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now we're really fucking sick and fat.</v>

1834
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.030
<v Speaker 6>One hundred percent agree with you </v>
<v Speaker 6>Carlos,</v>

1835
01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:25.670
<v Speaker 6>because it's not like you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>

1836
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:30.820
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We won't be very one with this will </v>

1837
01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:33.191
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There will be some adverse consequences </v>

1838
01:28:33.191 --> 01:28:33.620
<v Speaker 6>to the whole this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to all of these,</v>

1839
01:28:33.621 --> 01:28:36.620
<v Speaker 6>but we won't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's already here.</v>

1840
01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.920
<v Speaker 6>It's already altering people's life </v>
<v Speaker 6>today as we speak,</v>

1841
01:28:39.921 --> 01:28:44.921
<v Speaker 6>that people are listening to us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you know suffering from this and </v>

1842
01:28:44.921 --> 01:28:48.191
<v Speaker 6>that they don't even the why.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well maybe you're surrounded by </v>

1843
01:28:48.191 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 6>thousands and thousands of chemicals in </v>
<v Speaker 6>older hygiene products that you know,</v>

1844
01:28:51.171 --> 01:28:54.230
<v Speaker 6>that you breathe that go through your </v>
<v Speaker 6>pores that go in your system,</v>

1845
01:28:54.231 --> 01:28:59.060
<v Speaker 6>that after your home,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a homeless sizes and stuff like that.</v>

1846
01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:03.210
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you're eating GMO.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's everything is altered in your</v>

1847
01:29:03.210 --> 01:29:08.210
<v Speaker 6>day to day life and you see it as </v>
<v Speaker 6>something normal means you don't see it </v>

1848
01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:09.390
<v Speaker 6>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and as an it doesn't bother you.</v>

1849
01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:15.260
<v Speaker 6>You're not conscious of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it does bother you and how well you </v>

1850
01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:19.041
<v Speaker 6>live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well and and ultimately somebody is </v>

1851
01:29:19.041 --> 01:29:20.900
<v Speaker 6>profiting right then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing is with,</v>

1852
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:25.930
<v Speaker 6>with any of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it will become the norm if </v>

1853
01:29:25.930 --> 01:29:26.610
<v Speaker 6>somebody is profiting off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure they can sell it to you.</v>

1854
01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:31.850
<v Speaker 6>If they can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they can convince you that this is </v>

1855
01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:31.850
<v Speaker 6>better,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it is or whether it's not,</v>

1856
01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:33.630
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>through whatever,</v>

1857
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:38.690
<v Speaker 6>they're already selling water to us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they'll sell air to us or are they</v>

1858
01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:42.840
<v Speaker 6>in some places provide canned air in </v>
<v Speaker 6>China.</v>

1859
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 6>Let me think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They buy canned air with the little mask</v>

1860
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:46.410
<v Speaker 6>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You suck the candidate.</v>

1861
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:48.480
<v Speaker 6>I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>India and Japan.</v>

1862
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:51.210
<v Speaker 6>Air Made My.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Made my veins.</v>

1863
01:29:51.211 --> 01:29:53.010
<v Speaker 6>Blue was wild.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1864
01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:54.270
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1865
01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:59.420
<v Speaker 6>because you had so much pure oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could get it at like seven slash 11 </v>

1866
01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:01.860
<v Speaker 6>over there next to the weird squid hot </v>
<v Speaker 6>dogs.</v>

1867
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:08.690
<v Speaker 6>I did a an oxygen bar wants in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They remember they used to have those </v>

1868
01:30:08.730 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 6>still around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they do.</v>

1869
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.510
<v Speaker 6>You put like a little pipe up your nose </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm supposed to be like,</v>

1870
01:30:12.511 --> 01:30:13.890
<v Speaker 6>what am I supposed to be getting out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>this?</v>

1871
01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:16.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like one of those oxygen things you</v>

1872
01:30:16.231 --> 01:30:18.640
<v Speaker 6>see old smokers will roll around with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1873
01:30:18.641 --> 01:30:20.400
<v Speaker 6>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the thing goes up your nose.</v>

1874
01:30:20.401 --> 01:30:22.350
<v Speaker 6>These little tubes go up your nose and </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're sitting there going,</v>

1875
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:23.310
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what am I supposed to feel?</v>

1876
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:28.550
<v Speaker 6>A sense of euphoria of extra energy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the cute chick that works there </v>

1877
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:29.310
<v Speaker 6>comes up and rubs your back.</v>

1878
01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:31.950
<v Speaker 6>That's that weird thing on your scalp </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you kind of shit.</v>

1879
01:30:31.951 --> 01:30:36.951
<v Speaker 6>I thought good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it wouldn't come to come to a mind </v>

1880
01:30:36.951 --> 01:30:41.151
<v Speaker 6>to do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you were in the mountain and the air </v>

1881
01:30:41.151 --> 01:30:41.151
<v Speaker 6>is pure surrounded by trees.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

1882
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.180
<v Speaker 6>Why on earth would you try to put some </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever oxygen in your in your brain,</v>

1883
01:30:45.181 --> 01:30:46.020
<v Speaker 6>you don't need it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1884
01:30:46.021 --> 01:30:51.021
<v Speaker 6>that's one of the things that I love </v>
<v Speaker 6>about forests and trees that you can </v>

1885
01:30:51.021 --> 01:30:55.760
<v Speaker 6>physically feel the difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>air because trees literally absorb </v>

1886
01:30:56.370 --> 01:31:00.300
<v Speaker 6>carbon dioxide and express oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They produce oxygen.</v>

1887
01:31:00.301 --> 01:31:01.200
<v Speaker 6>You breathe it in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It feels.</v>

1888
01:31:01.201 --> 01:31:06.201
<v Speaker 6>My point is that you need these </v>
<v Speaker 6>enhancements when you're already living </v>

1889
01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.540
<v Speaker 6>within an environment that is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>tremendously deteriorate,</v>

1890
01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.220
<v Speaker 6>completely altered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you're like,</v>

1891
01:31:11.221 --> 01:31:14.190
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I need their air and more natural food.</v>

1892
01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 6>I need to try to make my even my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

1893
01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.230
<v Speaker 6>my house a bit more complex.</v>

1894
01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.230
<v Speaker 6>It stimulates my movement and things </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

1895
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:26.610
<v Speaker 6>That's because you were already out of a</v>
<v Speaker 6>universally,</v>

1896
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:31.611
<v Speaker 6>I would say universally natural </v>
<v Speaker 6>environment comprising not just where </v>

1897
01:31:31.611 --> 01:31:32.760
<v Speaker 6>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what you eat,</v>

1898
01:31:32.761 --> 01:31:34.140
<v Speaker 6>how you breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the light,</v>

1899
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:36.210
<v Speaker 6>and even your home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You own behaviors,</v>

1900
01:31:36.211 --> 01:31:38.850
<v Speaker 6>how much you sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how you think.</v>

1901
01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:43.880
<v Speaker 6>All of that is behavior and environment </v>
<v Speaker 6>that will impact you positively or not </v>

1902
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.970
<v Speaker 6>in term of how.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How will you look,</v>

1903
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.310
<v Speaker 6>how well you perform,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how you feel.</v>

1904
01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:52.710
<v Speaker 6>It all matters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All these variables matter.</v>

1905
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.430
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When?</v>

1906
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:55.500
<v Speaker 6>What is your diet like when you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>training?</v>

1907
01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.840
<v Speaker 6>Do you have someone who monitors that </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff?</v>

1908
01:31:57.841 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 6>Do you have a dietician that you work </v>
<v Speaker 6>with or anything?</v>

1909
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:02.460
<v Speaker 4>So I worked with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1910
01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:05.710
<v Speaker 4>with my dolce for this last camp,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was doing some seminars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was going and doing these talks at </v>

1915
01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:18.730
<v Speaker 4>some military bases on diet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrition,</v>

1916
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:22.870
<v Speaker 4>holistic living and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they brought me out,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the special guest or whatever.</v>

1923
01:32:32.761 --> 01:32:37.761

<v Speaker 4>We have a little bit different </v>

1924
01:32:37.761 --> 01:32:37.761
<v Speaker 4>approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1925
01:32:37.761 --> 01:32:41.930
<v Speaker 4>I started learning about nutrition from </v>
<v Speaker 4>a strict,</v>

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.170
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the strength and conditioning coach when</v>

1927
01:32:44.171 --> 01:32:45.970

<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

1928
01:32:45.971 --> 01:32:46.690
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1929
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:47.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1930

<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1932
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>During the time you're like fighting the</v>

1933
01:32:56.021 --> 01:32:57.280
<v Speaker 4>WEC or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1934
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:58.400
<v Speaker 4>this was before then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was,</v>

1935
01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:03.460
<v Speaker 4>I was fighting in like little little </v>
<v Speaker 4>casinos out in the middle of the desert </v>

1936
01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:07.170
<v Speaker 4>in New Mexico and like making $200 for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight if you're lucky at a 400 person </v>

1937
01:33:07.301 --> 01:33:08.620
<v Speaker 4>venue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1938
01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:09.760
<v Speaker 4>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was like,</v>

1939
01:33:09.761 --> 01:33:14.761
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I only eat half of this four piece </v>

1940
01:33:14.761 --> 01:33:14.761
<v Speaker 4>nuggets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely gonna make wait tomorrow.</v>

1941
01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1942
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:18.760
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I vividly remember those days.</v>

1943
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got with this guy and he just kind of </v>

1944
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:24.000
<v Speaker 4>taught me the basics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1945
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.960
<v Speaker 4>basically taught me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taught me about macronutrients and he </v>

1946
01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.490
<v Speaker 4>mainly a train bodybuilders but gave me </v>
<v Speaker 4>some basics.</v>

1947
01:33:30.491 --> 01:33:35.491
<v Speaker 4>And then since since that point I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1948
01:33:36.551 --> 01:33:38.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through my own practice,</v>

1949
01:33:38.501 --> 01:33:41.680
<v Speaker 4>through my own practical applications of</v>
<v Speaker 4>running through these training camps,</v>

1950
01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.150
<v Speaker 4>running through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1951
01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.530
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these weight cuts and,</v>

1952
01:33:45.630 --> 01:33:50.630
<v Speaker 4>and absorbing information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going out there and looking at </v>

1953
01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:50.630
<v Speaker 4>information myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1954
01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:53.560
<v Speaker 4>have kind of figured it out on pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>much on my own.</v>

1955
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:55.330
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cook,</v>

1956
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:57.020
<v Speaker 4>I fuckin love to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my,</v>

1957
01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:00.700
<v Speaker 4>my hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that helps out because,</v>

1958
01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:01.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1959
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:04.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm cooking at for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like kind of as a,</v>

1960
01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:07.890
<v Speaker 4>as a Cathartic thing after I'm training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

1961
01:34:07.891 --> 01:34:12.891
<v Speaker 4>it works well because I'm cooking the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrient dense food that I need to </v>

1962
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:18.280
<v Speaker 4>perform and to train and to make weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>and to be a high level athlete.</v>

1963
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I saw that you and Irwin,</v>

01:39:15.570 --> 01:39:17.250
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're dope man.</v>

2082
01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:20.010
<v Speaker 4>So I think initially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2083
01:39:20.011 --> 01:39:20.580
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2084
01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.570
<v Speaker 4>the vibrams fivefingers came into vogue </v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2085
01:39:23.571 --> 01:39:24.530
<v Speaker 4>in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2086
01:39:24.531 --> 01:39:25.580
<v Speaker 4>they loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2087
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:27.660
<v Speaker 4>And everybody was all about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2088
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.290
<v Speaker 4>the minimal footwear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you go to minimal,</v>

2089
01:39:31.291 --> 01:39:36.291
<v Speaker 4>too fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to hurt your feet because </v>

2090
01:39:36.291 --> 01:39:36.291
<v Speaker 4>our feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our bones,</v>

2091
01:39:36.291 --> 01:39:40.461
<v Speaker 4>our tendons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our muscles are atrophied from being in </v>

2092
01:39:40.461 --> 01:39:41.960
<v Speaker 4>basically casts for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

2093
01:39:41.961 --> 01:39:42.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

2094
01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:47.480
<v Speaker 4>our entire life and all of a sudden I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to go run a couple miles like I </v>

2095
01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:47.480
<v Speaker 4>did in these supportive shoes.</v>

2096
01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:48.660
<v Speaker 4>And you're going to get stress </v>
<v Speaker 4>fractures,</v>

2097
01:39:48.661 --> 01:39:49.950
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>injuries.</v>

2098
01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think the military,</v>

2099
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:54.030
<v Speaker 4>a couple of the branches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>band,</v>

2100
01:39:54.031 --> 01:39:56.940
<v Speaker 4>the band,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the five finger shoes or the five.</v>

2101
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:57.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what they're called.</v>

2102
01:39:57.851 --> 01:40:00.420
<v Speaker 4>There's people getting hurt because your</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot injuries,</v>

2103
01:40:00.610 --> 01:40:02.950
<v Speaker 4>what are lots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lots of people,</v>

2104
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:06.580
<v Speaker 4>people's body's physiology are just not </v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to strike.</v>

2105
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:08.800
<v Speaker 4>And you have to work your way up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2106
01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:09.330
<v Speaker 4>And this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2107
01:40:09.690 --> 01:40:12.240
<v Speaker 4>This guy runs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>runs barefoot throughout,</v>

2108
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:13.890
<v Speaker 4>through the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You run barefoot.</v>

2109
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:14.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.160
<v Speaker 4>Don't wear any shoes at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2111
01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:19.410
<v Speaker 4>Well sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it depends on what I do,</v>

2112
01:40:19.411 --> 01:40:24.411
<v Speaker 4>but I do try and also to be barefoot </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it makes me extremely sharp </v>

2113
01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.700
<v Speaker 4>mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be extremely focused,</v>

2114
01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:32.070
<v Speaker 4>just not injure yourself to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely,</v>

2115
01:40:32.071 --> 01:40:32.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adaptable.</v>

2116
01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.250
<v Speaker 4>So he doesn't just drained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people think,</v>

2117
01:40:35.251 --> 01:40:35.670
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2118
01:40:35.671 --> 01:40:37.610
<v Speaker 4>so it's gonna make your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2119
01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:40.220
<v Speaker 4>the sole of your foot tougher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about that?</v>

2120
01:40:40.270 --> 01:40:42.420
<v Speaker 4>What's special about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's not the point.</v>

2121
01:40:42.421 --> 01:40:47.280
<v Speaker 4>That's not much many more benefits </v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond just making your feet tougher.</v>

2122
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.730
<v Speaker 4>It's so fascinating that when in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>invention of the running shoe,</v>

2123
01:40:50.731 --> 01:40:52.650
<v Speaker 4>which what they thought was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>advancement,</v>

2124
01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.830
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going put cushioning.</v>

2125
01:40:53.831 --> 01:40:53.970
<v Speaker 4>It'll</v>

2126
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.920
<v Speaker 3>save people's bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wear and tear,</v>

2127
01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:59.410
<v Speaker 3>and it actually wound up fucking people </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and getting more injured.</v>

2128
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:04.500
<v Speaker 3>The food is a masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to change about about </v>

2129
01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.420
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human food is a masterpiece and a,</v>

2130
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:12.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you try to come up with some science </v>

2131
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:15.640
<v Speaker 3>caring science shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>footwear.</v>

2132
01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:21.620
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also just need minimal minimal </v>

2133
01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.530
<v Speaker 3>protection to avoid abrasion and end </v>
<v Speaker 3>punctures and things like that.</v>

2134
01:41:23.890 --> 01:41:26.390
<v Speaker 3>But otherwise you need to lead the work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2135
01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.940
<v Speaker 3>the work as naturally as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't then you will make your</v>

2136
01:41:30.941 --> 01:41:32.430
<v Speaker 3>feet weaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2137
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.340
<v Speaker 3>It will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will,</v>

2138
01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:35.680
<v Speaker 3>it will shrink it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will numb it.</v>

2139
01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:38.680
<v Speaker 3>But then on the flip side of that coin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

2140
01:41:38.681 --> 01:41:43.681
<v Speaker 3>my feet aren't strong enough to just go </v>
<v Speaker 3>and run as I would normally in </v>

2141
01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:46.300
<v Speaker 3>completely minimal shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to kick back,</v>

2142
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I have to kick back the intensity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the distance.</v>

2143
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:51.250
<v Speaker 3>So if I really want to get a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

2144
01:41:51.251 --> 01:41:52.840
<v Speaker 3>hard run in and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2145
01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:54.700
<v Speaker 3>and get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get fatigued,</v>

2146
01:41:54.701 --> 01:41:56.380
<v Speaker 3>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I throw on some,</v>

2147
01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:59.200
<v Speaker 3>some regular old running shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shorter distances.</v>

2148
01:41:59.201 --> 01:42:04.201
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like specifically training my feet </v>

2149
01:42:04.201 --> 01:42:04.201
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2150
01:42:04.201 --> 01:42:04.201
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2151
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:05.020
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2152
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:10.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning my tissues and everything </v>

2153
01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:10.450
<v Speaker 3>to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2154
01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:11.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of a,</v>

2155
01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:12.970
<v Speaker 3>a distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2156
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:14.860
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and moving to hurt myself,</v>

2157
01:42:15.610 --> 01:42:18.090
<v Speaker 3>moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving barefoot in wall and environments</v>

2158
01:42:18.110 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 3>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2159
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:23.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not men mandatory to people say one</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mandatory,</v>

2160
01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:29.610
<v Speaker 3>forgive my French.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought when I have to do the </v>

2161
01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:30.580
<v Speaker 3>math in my head as to what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I have to clarify for people</v>

2162
01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.740
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

2163
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2164
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:34.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have,</v>

2165
01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:37.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mandatory.</v>

2166
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mandatory correcting.</v>

2167
01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my English is very good.</v>

2168
01:42:41.891 --> 01:42:43.420
<v Speaker 3>English was better than my French.</v>

2169
01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2170
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:50.010
<v Speaker 3>you start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start a resetting your body in a,</v>

2171
01:42:50.011 --> 01:42:55.011
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a more natural way through these </v>

2172
01:42:55.011 --> 01:42:57.990
<v Speaker 3>natural movement patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can do that in indoors </v>

2173
01:42:57.990 --> 01:43:00.421
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even wearing some minimal footwear and </v>

2174
01:43:00.421 --> 01:43:03.931
<v Speaker 3>then you remove a footwear and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>start to expose the body through these </v>

2175
01:43:03.931 --> 01:43:06.100
<v Speaker 3>natural movement on more challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more complex environments.</v>

2176
01:43:06.101 --> 01:43:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can become,</v>

2177
01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:14.160
<v Speaker 3>you can go through these more say bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass trainings where it's like the real </v>

2178
01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:14.170
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the wild.</v>

2179
01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:17.650
<v Speaker 3>They're maybe cactus and sharp stones </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all kinds of things.</v>

2180
01:43:17.651 --> 01:43:18.470
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2181
01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:19.310
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2182
01:43:19.330 --> 01:43:24.330
<v Speaker 3>and still you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that you have to </v>

2183
01:43:24.330 --> 01:43:24.940
<v Speaker 3>do that right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or did you ever have to do that?</v>

2184
01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2185
01:43:26.710 --> 01:43:29.510
<v Speaker 3>the bowhunting practice was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2186
01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.240
<v Speaker 3>these balancing movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point was not just the movement </v>

2187
01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:38.920
<v Speaker 3>itself is when you move in complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments,</v>

2188
01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:40.870
<v Speaker 3>there are also situations.</v>

2189
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:41.410
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

2190
01:43:41.411 --> 01:43:45.520
<v Speaker 3>you're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll goal is to catch the game.</v>

2191
01:43:46.090 --> 01:43:48.040
<v Speaker 3>So you need to be aware of what's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2192
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:53.070
<v Speaker 3>You need to avoid being detected and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to look and scan your surroundings </v>

2193
01:43:53.271 --> 01:43:56.510
<v Speaker 3>and be as light as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a silent as possible.</v>

2194
01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:59.570
<v Speaker 3>If you're already in trouble with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

2195
01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:02.570
<v Speaker 3>If you're already struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a movement.</v>

2196
01:44:02.571 --> 01:44:07.571
<v Speaker 3>How much of your brain activity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>awareness is going to be dedicated to </v>

2197
01:44:07.571 --> 01:44:10.410
<v Speaker 3>the situation itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the hunting part because the,</v>

2198
01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the movement part in the,</v>

2199
01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:15.380
<v Speaker 3>in the environment part is already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not there.</v>

2200
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:17.300
<v Speaker 3>Your struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2201
01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:19.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2202
01:44:19.141 --> 01:44:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I have some cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm good.</v>

2203
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:25.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe you have hard time just </v>

2204
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.510
<v Speaker 3>kneeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting up and getting down,</v>

2205
01:44:25.610 --> 01:44:30.610
<v Speaker 3>let alone in a supple silence move way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not the deck detectable.</v>

2206
01:44:31.791 --> 01:44:32.050
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>

2207
01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning kind of things were trending,</v>

2208
01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:36.600
<v Speaker 2>bow hunting in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of experienced this,</v>

2209
01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:38.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most recently,</v>

2210
01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:44.240
<v Speaker 2>this fitness mo movement where a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are getting in extremely good shape</v>

2211
01:44:45.091 --> 01:44:50.091
<v Speaker 2>to be able to run the mountains so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can hike long distances and not be </v>

2212
01:44:51.061 --> 01:44:54.420
<v Speaker 2>fatigued and so that they can take shots</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in,</v>

2213
01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:59.421
<v Speaker 2>have some mobility where you can be on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your knees and for long periods of time </v>

2214
01:44:59.421 --> 01:45:03.291
<v Speaker 2>you might have to be held at full draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>while animals looking at you after </v>

2215
01:45:03.291 --> 01:45:06.350
<v Speaker 2>having run up a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fatigued.</v>

2216
01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2217
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:09.840
<v Speaker 2>And it's the difference between being </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and not being successful.</v>

2218
01:45:09.841 --> 01:45:11.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean in today's day you could still go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the supermarket,</v>

2219
01:45:11.821 --> 01:45:15.330
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately what it means is whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not you can eat or not eat.</v>

2220
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:19.530
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be in physical shape to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to do that kind of hunting.</v>

2221
01:45:19.710 --> 01:45:23.010
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of it is at high altitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're trudging through the mountains</v>

2222
01:45:23.011 --> 01:45:25.290
<v Speaker 2>of low oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The body and mind I have</v>

2223
01:45:25.290 --> 01:45:29.820
<v Speaker 3>to deal with so many diverse variable </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing in.</v>

2224
01:45:29.821 --> 01:45:30.960
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's again,</v>

2225
01:45:30.961 --> 01:45:35.110
<v Speaker 3>that's adaptability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about adaptability a gut.</v>

2226
01:45:35.190 --> 01:45:36.500
<v Speaker 3>The chance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2227
01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.240
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to train the seals in Coronado,</v>

2228
01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:41.250
<v Speaker 3>and these guys are well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>number one,</v>

2229
01:45:41.251 --> 01:45:43.090
<v Speaker 3>they are gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are real good,</v>

2230
01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:48.170
<v Speaker 3>good people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are extremely fit from the </v>

2231
01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:48.170
<v Speaker 3>stance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2232
01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:51.870
<v Speaker 3>the standpoint of how much they can run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much they can end dirt,</v>

2233
01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:55.800
<v Speaker 3>but I would challenge them with very </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple movements,</v>

2234
01:45:55.801 --> 01:46:00.801
<v Speaker 3>a chai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the movements with Trent </v>

2235
01:46:00.801 --> 01:46:00.801
<v Speaker 3>together with Carlos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2236
01:46:00.801 --> 01:46:03.650
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were in that split squat </v>

2237
01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:03.650
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you pivot,</v>

2238
01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:07.310
<v Speaker 3>reverse your orientation from forward to</v>
<v Speaker 3>backward and while maybe holding a stick</v>

2239
01:46:09.841 --> 01:46:14.841
<v Speaker 3>that represents a rifle or bow or via </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera if you're shooting photos.</v>

2240
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:17.850
<v Speaker 3>So if you're struggling with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>

2241
01:46:17.851 --> 01:46:20.310
<v Speaker 3>you have imbalances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much,</v>

2242
01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:24.600
<v Speaker 3>again of your situational awareness can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be dedicated to the situation at hand,</v>

2243
01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:25.770
<v Speaker 3>at stake.</v>

2244
01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:30.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You surviving the movement will excuse </v>

2245
01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:31.140
<v Speaker 3>me in the close to the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2246
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:33.420
<v Speaker 3>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then for a split second or maybe for</v>

2247
01:46:33.421 --> 01:46:34.710
<v Speaker 3>a little longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2248
01:46:34.711 --> 01:46:35.940
<v Speaker 3>you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2249
01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:36.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2250
01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.640
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the cage situation,</v>

2251
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:42.690
<v Speaker 3>it's very similar because you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>always keep an eye on your it.</v>

2252
01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.770
<v Speaker 3>So you need that situational awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

2253
01:46:45.771 --> 01:46:48.960
<v Speaker 3>So not having to think exclusively at </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you move.</v>

2254
01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:53.280
<v Speaker 3>So the more comfortable in movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more fluid,</v>

2255
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:58.430
<v Speaker 3>the more second nature it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the more attention your brain can </v>

2256
01:46:58.741 --> 01:47:02.430
<v Speaker 3>dedicate to the situation and to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptability,</v>

2257
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:04.050
<v Speaker 3>the range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the timing.</v>

2258
01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:09.320
<v Speaker 3>All of these subtle little adaptations </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your brain is in charge of brain </v>

2259
01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:09.930
<v Speaker 3>commands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the body.</v>

2260
01:47:09.931 --> 01:47:12.730
<v Speaker 3>So the money deans to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2261
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:14.030
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2262
01:47:14.410 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 3>to move a highly reliable way ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is the movement itself or the </v>

2263
01:47:21.190 --> 01:47:24.270
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>situational awareness.</v>

2264
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:27.420
<v Speaker 3>It all boils down to the brain.</v>

2265
01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:31.150
<v Speaker 5>What I was getting at before with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bowhunting is a.</v>

2266
01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:36.170
<v Speaker 5>and with regards to your diet diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you eat wild game or do you get like </v>

2267
01:47:36.170 --> 01:47:36.880
<v Speaker 5>what I do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2268
01:47:36.881 --> 01:47:41.881
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mainly I eat a grass fed free range </v>

2269
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:45.190
<v Speaker 5>meats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get as much wild game as I can.</v>

2270
01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:50.340
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't kill anything in the last two </v>

2271
01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:50.340
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the people that I,</v>

2272
01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:50.340
<v Speaker 5>I did go with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did they,</v>

2273
01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:51.640
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they harvest harvest elk.</v>

2274
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:52.990
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2275
01:47:53.110 --> 01:47:54.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all share that meet.</v>

2276
01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:57.180
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat as,</v>

2277
01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:02.320
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much wild game as possible because I </v>

2278
01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:02.320
<v Speaker 5>feel like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2279
01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.090
<v Speaker 5>that's about as pure as you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really is healthy too.</v>

2280
01:48:04.091 --> 01:48:09.091
<v Speaker 5>When you eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does have a different effect on your </v>

2281
01:48:09.091 --> 01:48:09.091
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can feel it if you're,</v>

2282
01:48:09.091 --> 01:48:12.840
<v Speaker 5>if you're health conscious and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>aware of what you're taking in on a </v>

2283
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:15.220
<v Speaker 5>regular basis are sort of aware of how </v>
<v Speaker 5>your body reacts.</v>

2284
01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:20.520
<v Speaker 5>You'll see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll feel different when you eat wild </v>

2285
01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:20.520
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just more nutrient dense.</v>

2286
01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:20.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2287
01:48:20.781 --> 01:48:21.550
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's,</v>

2288
01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:23.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's other aspects to it,</v>

2289
01:48:23.201 --> 01:48:23.980
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you,</v>

2290
01:48:23.981 --> 01:48:27.580
<v Speaker 5>when you see the animal die or you kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>the animal,</v>

2291
01:48:27.581 --> 01:48:31.960
<v Speaker 5>there's just a sense of gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like for this thing,</v>

2292
01:48:31.961 --> 01:48:36.961
<v Speaker 5>giving its life to nourish your body as </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposed to buying something in a nice </v>

2293
01:48:37.181 --> 01:48:40.120
<v Speaker 5>little neat package with fucking Saran </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrap over it.</v>

2294
01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:42.540
<v Speaker 5>You don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't really think that a life was,</v>

2295
01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:44.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was separated,</v>

2296
01:48:44.410 --> 01:48:47.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to give you two to nourish your body.</v>

2297
01:48:47.081 --> 01:48:50.950
<v Speaker 5>But when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you go out and you see it or it's,</v>

2298
01:48:50.951 --> 01:48:52.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's in front of you.</v>

2299
01:48:52.091 --> 01:48:56.050
<v Speaker 5>You realize that you're a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>more connected to what you're putting in</v>

2300
01:48:56.051 --> 01:49:00.460
<v Speaker 5>your body and I think that disconnect is</v>
<v Speaker 5>a part of the um,</v>

2301
01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem with our,</v>

2302
01:49:03.671 --> 01:49:05.910
<v Speaker 5>with our food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2303
01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.590
<v Speaker 5>I guess sickness or food culture that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2304
01:49:08.591 --> 01:49:09.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were,</v>

2305
01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:11.140
<v Speaker 5>there were experiencing these days.</v>

2306
01:49:11.370 --> 01:49:14.590
<v Speaker 5>The gratitude is certainly an aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and also the connection,</v>

2307
01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:18.070
<v Speaker 5>just to an understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a real understanding of what happened,</v>

2308
01:49:18.071 --> 01:49:19.570
<v Speaker 5>how you got there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2309
01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:22.060
<v Speaker 5>what this meal is and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has,</v>

2310
01:49:22.061 --> 01:49:23.800
<v Speaker 5>it feels better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels better to eat it.</v>

2311
01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.340
<v Speaker 5>It's a mix of things you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you actually feel as opposed to just not</v>

2313
01:49:30.341 --> 01:49:35.341
<v Speaker 5>even thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even just now,</v>

2314
01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:37.780
<v Speaker 5>Mike Dolce you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2315
01:49:37.781 --> 01:49:40.810
<v Speaker 5>works with you for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or worked with you for this last camp.</v>

2316
01:49:41.050 --> 01:49:42.410
<v Speaker 5>What was the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>

2317
01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:45.020
<v Speaker 5>what different things did you eat and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2318
01:49:45.190 --> 01:49:48.250
<v Speaker 5>what approach did you take?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you do any work to examine</v>

2319
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:50.140
<v Speaker 4>your nutrient levels?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not.</v>

2320
01:49:50.141 --> 01:49:51.750
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do any blood work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2321
01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:55.570
<v Speaker 4>the difference was we didn't change what</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was eating.</v>

2322
01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:59.020
<v Speaker 4>We changed the structure and the timing </v>
<v Speaker 4>of when I was eating,</v>

2323
01:49:59.230 --> 01:49:59.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2324
01:50:00.570 --> 01:50:03.120
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

2325
01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.780
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have much of a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2326
01:50:04.781 --> 01:50:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2327
01:50:05.351 --> 01:50:07.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm eating the right things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2328
01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:08.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm good.</v>

2329
01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2330
01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:11.740
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2331
01:50:11.741 --> 01:50:12.340
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2332
01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.220
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is how we're going to do it.</v>

2333
01:50:14.230 --> 01:50:14.740
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2334
01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:19.810
<v Speaker 4>gonna do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna sit down and you're going </v>

2335
01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:21.511
<v Speaker 4>to eat till your full.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every three hours you're going to have </v>

2336
01:50:21.511 --> 01:50:24.121
<v Speaker 4>two feedings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to kind of snack and </v>

2337
01:50:24.121 --> 01:50:24.121
<v Speaker 4>graze here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what I was doing.</v>

2338
01:50:24.121 --> 01:50:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2339
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:30.400
<v Speaker 4>do to increase my energy levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm immensely.</v>

2340
01:50:30.850 --> 01:50:31.990
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so in what way?</v>

2341
01:50:32.050 --> 01:50:33.400
<v Speaker 4>I feel awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

2342
01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:35.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the physiology behind it,</v>

2343
01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:36.400
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2344
01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:39.670
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a hormonal.</v>

2345
01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.100
<v Speaker 4>I think I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So after I would eat these big meals,</v>

2346
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:42.620
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2347
01:50:42.690 --> 01:50:44.470
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would get tired.</v>

2348
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:46.290
<v Speaker 4>I get like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2349
01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:48.250
<v Speaker 4>kind of insulin dove,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2350
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:51.010
<v Speaker 4>be tired for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the next time I went to train,</v>

2351
01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:53.290
<v Speaker 4>like I just felt like I had had more </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuel.</v>

2352
01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2353
01:50:55.150 --> 01:51:00.150
<v Speaker 4>more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more sustenance for these training </v>

2354
01:51:00.150 --> 01:51:00.150
<v Speaker 4>sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2355
01:51:00.150 --> 01:51:03.520
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my weight cut was,</v>

2356
01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.170
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never had a weight cut as,</v>

2357
01:51:05.230 --> 01:51:07.300
<v Speaker 4>as easy as that we were eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2358
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:12.350
<v Speaker 4>f full large meals right up until the </v>
<v Speaker 4>night or even the night night before </v>

2359
01:51:12.821 --> 01:51:14.290
<v Speaker 4>weigh ins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why I was,</v>

2360
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:15.430
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2361
01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:18.700
<v Speaker 4>I came down so quickly and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of have a weird deal,</v>

2362
01:51:18.701 --> 01:51:19.140
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

2363
01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:20.590
<v Speaker 4>I feel like my body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2364
01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:22.600
<v Speaker 4>I've cut weight so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

2365
01:51:22.930 --> 01:51:26.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 plus professional fights,</v>

2366
01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:31.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>between kickboxing and MMA and I think </v>

2367
01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:31.250
<v Speaker 4>my body just kind of knows.</v>

2368
01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:32.590
<v Speaker 4>It just drops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even Mike's like,</v>

2369
01:51:32.591 --> 01:51:37.591
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never worked with an athlete that </v>

2370
01:51:37.591 --> 01:51:37.591
<v Speaker 4>just boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

2371
01:51:37.591 --> 01:51:37.840
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just on a schedule,</v>

2372
01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:39.820
<v Speaker 4>it just might,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my weight drops.</v>

2373
01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:41.860
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2374
01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:43.750
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I felt,</v>

2375
01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 4>I felt amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt good in the fight.</v>

2376
01:51:46.001 --> 01:51:48.430
<v Speaker 4>I think I look good in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I performed well.</v>

2377
01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:49.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2378
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:51.340
<v Speaker 4>the cut was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cut was awesome.</v>

2379
01:51:51.610 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 4>So you're eating big meals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2380
01:51:53.891 --> 01:51:56.590
<v Speaker 4>fairly bi relative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relatively big meals.</v>

2381
01:51:56.591 --> 01:52:01.591
<v Speaker 4>How many calories have encountered out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would say I would have probably a,</v>

2382
01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:05.980
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an eight ounce portion of,</v>

2383
01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:07.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Salmon.</v>

2384
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:12.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably a cup of white rice and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then a good amount of vegetables.</v>

2385
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:13.390
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2386
01:52:13.391 --> 01:52:16.360
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about several times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2387
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:17.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2388
01:52:17.111 --> 01:52:21.550
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting because most people </v>
<v Speaker 4>think of weight cuts being that,</v>

2389
01:52:21.551 --> 01:52:26.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you severely restrict the amount of </v>

2390
01:52:26.551 --> 01:52:29.041
<v Speaker 4>calories you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body starts to go into ketosis or </v>

2391
01:52:29.041 --> 01:52:29.920
<v Speaker 4>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>starts absorbing fat instead of,</v>

2392
01:52:29.921 --> 01:52:32.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of carbohydrates,</v>

2393
01:52:32.171 --> 01:52:34.570
<v Speaker 4>you dehydrate yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then after that.</v>

2394
01:52:34.571 --> 01:52:36.820
<v Speaker 4>And that's how you get to that state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2395
01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:41.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's one way to do it and I've </v>

2396
01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:42.730
<v Speaker 4>definitely done that way before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done it.</v>

2397
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:48.030
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the worst way you've ever done </v>

2398
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.030
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

2399
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:51.840
<v Speaker 6>Just the chicken nuggets way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but hesitant right around that same </v>

2400
01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:52.920
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not,</v>

2401
01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:54.320
<v Speaker 6>not eating.</v>

<v Speaker 6>which was just criminal.</v>

2531
01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.460
<v Speaker 6>They shouldn't let Sakharov a fight </v>

2534
01:58:33.210 --> 01:58:36.330

<v Speaker 6>was down.</v>

2539
01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:52.580

<v Speaker 6>knockouts that he suffered.</v>

2540
01:58:52.990 --> 01:58:57.990

<v Speaker 6>Now that guy is what?</v>

2544
01:59:00.341 --> 01:59:01.450
<v Speaker 6>A legend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

2545
01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:04.840
<v Speaker 6>I remember the first time I saw pride,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw him fighting hoists gracie.</v>

2546
01:59:05.410 --> 01:59:08.520
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was that 90 minute fire.</v>

2547
01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:11.410
<v Speaker 6>Was that 90 minute one and had he had </v>
<v Speaker 6>hoists in that,</v>

2548
01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:16.700
<v Speaker 6>that like dead to rights,</v>
<v Speaker 6>newborn hoists would not tap what ended </v>

2549
01:59:16.901 --> 01:59:18.880
<v Speaker 6>up happening?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was at a decision.</v>

2550
01:59:18.881 --> 01:59:20.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well it was a draw because they want the</v>

2551
01:59:20.771 --> 01:59:22.600
<v Speaker 6>90 minutes and nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:25.810
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that that's how they say no,</v>

2553
01:59:25.811 --> 01:59:26.380
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2554
01:59:26.381 --> 01:59:27.040
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2555
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:29.440
<v Speaker 6>Hoists broke his ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

2556
01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:31.600
<v Speaker 6>Didn't he break his ankle and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>couldn't continue?</v>

2557
01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:34.060
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why do I not remember that,</v>

2558
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.570

2559
01:59:34.570 --> 01:59:35.580
<v Speaker 6>I'll pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'll find out.</v>

2560
01:59:35.610 --> 01:59:36.090
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cool.</v>

2561

2562
01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:42.190

<v Speaker 6>Pig was yoked up.</v>

2564
01:59:45.101 --> 01:59:48.470
<v Speaker 6>Then he tested positive and they find </v>
<v Speaker 6>him a fuck load of money.</v>

2565
01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:50.180
<v Speaker 6>Don't know if favorite ever paid it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he patched,</v>

2566
01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:52.030
<v Speaker 6>but now he's back.</v>

2577
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:17.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was wild,</v>

2578
02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:19.510
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was the early days.</v>

2579
02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:24.520
<v Speaker 6>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The first fight I ever saw was Orlando </v>

2580
02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:27.151
<v Speaker 6>veit versus rem co pardot when Graham </v>
<v Speaker 6>called pardue took him down and elbowed </v>

2581
02:00:28.561 --> 02:00:33.561
<v Speaker 6>the fuck out of him and from side </v>
<v Speaker 6>control or you had them like that and I </v>

2584
02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:39.700
<v Speaker 6>What kind of fucking crazy sport is </v>
<v Speaker 6>this?</v>

2585
02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:42.910
<v Speaker 6>The pardot Guy Kinda hits him a few </v>
<v Speaker 6>times.</v>

2586
02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:47.940
<v Speaker 6>Then it kind of implies that he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>knocked out and you kind of just let </v>

2587
02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.660
<v Speaker 6>them go at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would just let them mainly.</v>

02:00:49.670 --> 02:00:50.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>back then.</v>

2590
02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:55.000
<v Speaker 6>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You remember when?</v>

2591
02:00:55.001 --> 02:00:56.220
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2592
02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:59.230
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is his name?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fought that Ninja dude.</v>

2593
02:00:59.231 --> 02:01:04.231
<v Speaker 6>Pat Pat Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pat Smith's fought some dude who was </v>

2594
02:01:04.231 --> 02:01:05.020
<v Speaker 6>like doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they had his,</v>

2595
02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:10.290
<v Speaker 6>his pre-fight video and it's preflight </v>
<v Speaker 6>videos doing like Ninja techniques and </v>

2596
02:01:10.290 --> 02:01:12.700
<v Speaker 6>like fucking all this crazy shit that </v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't really work.</v>

2597
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:18.030
<v Speaker 6>And then he got in there with Pat Smith </v>
<v Speaker 6>who was a pretty seasoned kickboxer </v>

2598
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.030
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it was dropping.</v>

2599
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:22.720
<v Speaker 6>Just wicked elbows on him from the mount</v>
<v Speaker 6>and knocked him out and then woke him up</v>

2600
02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:25.210
<v Speaker 6>and then knocked him out again before </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ref stopped.</v>

2601
02:01:25.211 --> 02:01:30.211
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well he got up and was just a bath of </v>

2602
02:01:30.211 --> 02:01:32.521
<v Speaker 6>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His whole head was essentially opened </v>

2603
02:01:32.521 --> 02:01:32.530
<v Speaker 6>up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that was the early days.</v>

2604
02:01:32.531 --> 02:01:37.531
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The early days were really fascinating </v>

2605
02:01:37.531 --> 02:01:40.261
<v Speaker 6>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you were around martial arts before the </v>

2606
02:01:40.261 --> 02:01:40.261
<v Speaker 6>USC,</v>

2607
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.850
<v Speaker 5>so you had seen like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2608
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:47.860
<v Speaker 5>you'd seen karate and you'd seen all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these different judo and all this </v>

2609
02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:48.740
<v Speaker 5>different stuff and nobody really knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the best stuff was.</v>

2610
02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:51.500
<v Speaker 5>I always knew that wrestlers could take </v>
<v Speaker 5>it down.</v>

2611
02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:56.560
<v Speaker 5>I always knew that was gonna be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem because I wrestled in high </v>

2612
02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.931
<v Speaker 5>school and I had a good buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my friend Steven Arduino when I was </v>

2613
02:01:58.931 --> 02:02:02.471
<v Speaker 5>doing taekwondo and he was wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the reasons why I got into </v>

2614
02:02:02.471 --> 02:02:05.621
<v Speaker 5>wrestling because I didn't think that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>could take me down out in the grass.</v>

2615
02:02:05.631 --> 02:02:07.010
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can take you down anytime I want.</v>

2616
02:02:07.011 --> 02:02:08.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bull Shit.</v>

2617
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:10.430
<v Speaker 5>He took me down over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2618
02:02:10.431 --> 02:02:12.650
<v Speaker 5>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so humiliating,</v>

2619
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:15.380
<v Speaker 5>like he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just took me down every time you want</v>

2620
02:02:15.381 --> 02:02:15.890
<v Speaker 5>it to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

2621
02:02:15.891 --> 02:02:16.540
<v Speaker 5>this is Matt.</v>

2622
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:18.770
<v Speaker 5>I got to start wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I started wrestling.</v>

2623
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:23.800
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reasons why I started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another one dude got me in a headlock </v>

2624
02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:23.800
<v Speaker 5>and fucking threw me down in the locker </v>
<v Speaker 5>room.</v>

2625
02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:28.740
<v Speaker 5>Could have beat me up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but didn't know it was like God dammit </v>

2626
02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:29.420
<v Speaker 5>Braille.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I had to learn wrestling,</v>

2627
02:02:29.421 --> 02:02:32.720
<v Speaker 5>but I always knew that wrestlers could </v>
<v Speaker 5>take you down if they wanted to,</v>

2628
02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:36.830
<v Speaker 5>but I always felt like a guy who knew a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit of wrestling,</v>

2629
02:02:36.831 --> 02:02:39.830
<v Speaker 5>it was a good kickboxer would probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>be able to keep the fight standing,</v>

2630
02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:42.260
<v Speaker 5>but then when he started choking people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2631
02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.300
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a whole different thing.</v>

2632
02:02:44.301 --> 02:02:49.301
<v Speaker 5>This is a completely different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy beat that guy from his back </v>

2633
02:02:49.301 --> 02:02:51.440
<v Speaker 5>with a fuck winds on their back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was just a whole new element.</v>

2634
02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:57.480
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting because you've been </v>

2635
02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.351
<v Speaker 5>around from the WEC days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which were when you were the wec champ,</v>

2636
02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:01.130
<v Speaker 5>like it was.</v>

2637
02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:06.760
<v Speaker 5>It was so small in comparison to what it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is now for you to go from that to that </v>

2638
02:03:07.611 --> 02:03:12.611
<v Speaker 5>last fight against Robbie in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was just this massive fucking </v>

2639
02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:16.730
<v Speaker 5>media event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're fighting for the world title.</v>

2640
02:03:16.731 --> 02:03:18.920
<v Speaker 5>You get there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the place is sold out.</v>

2641
02:03:18.921 --> 02:03:21.740
<v Speaker 5>It's craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The roar of the crowd,</v>

2642
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:27.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>time and like what a fucking odyssey </v>

2643
02:03:27.010 --> 02:03:29.220
<v Speaker 5>you've been through and your career </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you,</v>

2644
02:03:29.221 --> 02:03:33.230
<v Speaker 5>you were there sort of when it was kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of just starting to take off.</v>

2645
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2646
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:37.150
<v Speaker 5>I really got in on the ground level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2647
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:40.130
<v Speaker 5>Even before Wec,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told you we were fighting.</v>

2648
02:03:40.131 --> 02:03:45.131
<v Speaker 5>It's like 200,</v>
<v Speaker 5>300 person venues in the middle of the </v>

2649
02:03:45.131 --> 02:03:46.190
<v Speaker 5>desert and it's been crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2650
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:51.310
<v Speaker 5>It's been a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been an incredible ride and it has </v>

2651
02:03:51.381 --> 02:03:55.520
<v Speaker 5>been the coolest fucking thing ever I </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to do as a young kid.</v>

2652
02:03:55.820 --> 02:04:00.820
<v Speaker 5>None of this existed and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was into the early nineties </v>

2653
02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:04.410
<v Speaker 5>martial arts movies and Ninja turtles </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I wanted to be,</v>

2654
02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:06.450
<v Speaker 5>wanted to be a Ninja.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2655
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:08.830
<v Speaker 5>that's what I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember my mom,</v>

2656
02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:13.860
<v Speaker 5>that was the second movie that I had </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever seen was the first Ninja turtles </v>

2657
02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:16.631

<v Speaker 5>in a time that this came to be and lived</v>

2662
02:04:29.811 --> 02:04:32.930
<v Speaker 5>in a city where there was this camp that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

2663
02:04:33.310 --> 02:04:34.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by,</v>

2664
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:37.100

<v Speaker 5>kind of inexplicably good,</v>

2665
02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for</v>

2666
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:43.160
<v Speaker 4>a small podunk place like albuquerque,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not just an exclude explicably good </v>

2667
02:04:44.581 --> 02:04:46.110
<v Speaker 4>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it was,</v>

2668
02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:49.410
<v Speaker 4>but also for the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it evolved,</v>

2669
02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:51.990
<v Speaker 4>whereas a lot of those camps that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>big back then,</v>

2670
02:04:51.991 --> 02:04:53.910
<v Speaker 4>like the lion's den,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're gone.</v>

2671
02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:56.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Pat Miletich is Jim.</v>

2672
02:04:56.490 --> 02:05:01.490
<v Speaker 4>It's gone like these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these gyms that were really big at the </v>

2673
02:05:01.490 --> 02:05:05.181
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't evolve or they didn't carry </v>

2674
02:05:05.181 --> 02:05:05.181
<v Speaker 4>on or for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stopped doing it.</v>

2675
02:05:05.181 --> 02:05:05.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2676
02:05:05.911 --> 02:05:10.911
<v Speaker 4>your gym is not just evolved but evolved</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be one of the premier gyms in the </v>

2677
02:05:10.911 --> 02:05:12.960
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really kind of incredible.</v>

2678
02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:15.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's been a lot of change,</v>

2679
02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:15.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like a lot of the original guys have </v>

2681
02:05:20.770 --> 02:05:20.770
<v Speaker 4>branched off and are kind of doing their</v>
<v Speaker 4>own thing.</v>

2682
02:05:20.770 --> 02:05:21.720
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2683
02:05:21.721 --> 02:05:22.920
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2684
02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:28.290
<v Speaker 4>the genesis of MMA in Albuquerque is </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of an interesting story.</v>

2685
02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:29.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2689
02:05:33.590 --> 02:05:35.280
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2690
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:40.310
<v Speaker 4>firsthand hearsay from the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who did develop this thing is that </v>

2691
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:44.840
<v Speaker 4>basically these guys from these </v>
<v Speaker 4>different disciplines got together and </v>

2692
02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:46.260
<v Speaker 4>they had watched the UFC and wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2693
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:49.470
<v Speaker 4>I have a wrestling background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy has a chemical background.</v>

2694
02:05:49.471 --> 02:05:50.820
<v Speaker 4>This guy is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2695
02:05:50.930 --> 02:05:55.930
<v Speaker 4>a Akka karate kinda background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2696
02:05:56.370 --> 02:06:00.330
<v Speaker 4>They all got together and they started </v>
<v Speaker 4>formulating the shit in this one guy was</v>

2697
02:06:00.331 --> 02:06:04.440
<v Speaker 4>a flight attendant and he was flying all</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the country.</v>

2698
02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:06.270
<v Speaker 4>And every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere he'd stop,</v>

2699
02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:11.960
<v Speaker 4>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would go to these different schools </v>

2700
02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:11.960
<v Speaker 4>because there wasn't the internet at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2701
02:06:12.130 --> 02:06:14.550
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't jump on youtube and look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>techniques.</v>

2702
02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:19.960
<v Speaker 4>So he would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy's name's Chris Luttrell and he </v>

2703
02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:21.380
<v Speaker 4>cornered me for my fight against GSP,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2704
02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:24.210
<v Speaker 4>and what is one of the founding members </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Jackson's.</v>

2705
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:29.390
<v Speaker 4>He was going to these different Jiu </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jitsu judo pankration schools and see </v>

2706
02:06:30.210 --> 02:06:35.210
<v Speaker 4>what they were doing that he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing the information back and they </v>

2707
02:06:35.210 --> 02:06:35.210
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they were,</v>

2708
02:06:35.210 --> 02:06:39.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kinda getting into the laboratory and </v>

2709
02:06:39.590 --> 02:06:39.590
<v Speaker 4>see what was working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the same time.</v>

2710
02:06:39.590 --> 02:06:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Some of these guys were bouncers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>police officers and,</v>

2711
02:06:43.330 --> 02:06:48.330
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and literally using this stuff on the </v>

2712
02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:48.330
<v Speaker 4>street in some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2713
02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:51.900
<v Speaker 4>some had roadhouse type fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>

2714
02:06:53.250 --> 02:06:54.290
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Read.</v>

2715
02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:59.660
<v Speaker 4>My original trainer was like a Patrick </v>
<v Speaker 4>swayze from roadhouse type kinda guide.</v>

2716
02:07:00.150 --> 02:07:02.190
<v Speaker 4>Tom Vaughn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know Tom von.</v>

2717
02:07:02.210 --> 02:07:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he means yes.</v>

2718
02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:08.160
<v Speaker 4>And his NHP now in albuquerque as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was,</v>

2719
02:07:08.190 --> 02:07:10.390
<v Speaker 4>him and Greg were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that,</v>

2720
02:07:10.391 --> 02:07:12.540
<v Speaker 4>that he's one of the founding members as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2721
02:07:12.630 --> 02:07:17.630
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of crazy that there's two big </v>
<v Speaker 4>gyms like that in a place as small as </v>

2722
02:07:17.630 --> 02:07:21.060
<v Speaker 4>albuquerque that have UFC fighters while</v>
<v Speaker 4>they split their.</v>

2723
02:07:21.090 --> 02:07:22.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're from the same place.</v>

2724
02:07:22.801 --> 02:07:25.580
<v Speaker 4>They they branched off at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they split up.</v>

2725
02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:30.680
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy that these both guys have </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed really high level talent </v>

2726
02:07:31.460 --> 02:07:34.530
<v Speaker 4>because they all came from the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same original.</v>

2727
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 4>Think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

2728
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.500
<v Speaker 6>a fascinating story about the flight </v>
<v Speaker 6>attendant.</v>

2729
02:07:38.530 --> 02:07:39.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the name again?</v>

2730
02:07:39.610 --> 02:07:44.610
<v Speaker 6>Chris Luttrell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cristal trial [inaudible] him traveling </v>

2731
02:07:44.610 --> 02:07:45.730
<v Speaker 6>and doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's similar to what Halas Gracie did.</v>

2732
02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:49.570
<v Speaker 6>Whole holes did holes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gracie traveled to America and learned a</v>

2733
02:07:49.571 --> 02:07:52.270
<v Speaker 6>lot of wrestling shit and learn catch </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestling stuff.</v>

2734
02:07:52.271 --> 02:07:55.410
<v Speaker 6>That's why the Americana is named the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Americana.</v>

2735
02:07:55.450 --> 02:07:56.180
<v Speaker 6>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's uh,</v>

2736
02:07:56.460 --> 02:08:01.460
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it really came from American catch </v>

2737
02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:03.391
<v Speaker 6>wrestling and they started incorporating</v>
<v Speaker 6>into Brazilian jujitsu along with some </v>

2738
02:08:03.391 --> 02:08:05.680
<v Speaker 6>wrestling techniques and some sambo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he learned a bunch of Shit.</v>

2739
02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:08.590
<v Speaker 6>And he was the guy that really was </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hickson's mentor.</v>

2740
02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:11.920
<v Speaker 6>He was the guy that was the head of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>family before he died.</v>

2741
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:15.730
<v Speaker 6>He was the man and he died in a hang </v>
<v Speaker 6>gliding accident and Rio.</v>

2742
02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:17.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he was the,</v>

2743
02:08:17.561 --> 02:08:20.110
<v Speaker 6>he was the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he was the head of the,</v>

2744
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:21.430
<v Speaker 6>all the others,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2745
02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:24.210
<v Speaker 6>he was the one alpha of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2746
02:08:24.211 --> 02:08:25.270
<v Speaker 6>the grapplers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he,</v>

2747
02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:29.470
<v Speaker 6>he was dedicated to learning and </v>
<v Speaker 6>incorporating different techniques,</v>

2748
02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:34.900
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like in any other context of those were </v>

2749
02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:38.460
<v Speaker 6>the most adaptable and most open to </v>
<v Speaker 6>change and evolution or those who </v>

2750
02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:40.150
<v Speaker 6>survive looked for a remember Eddie </v>
<v Speaker 6>Bravo,</v>

2751
02:08:40.290 --> 02:08:41.830

2752
02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:44.860
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's approach to and Resi Hixon Gracie.</v>

2753
02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:50.020
<v Speaker 6>And why is it so hard?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is it hard on me?</v>

2754
02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:55.990
<v Speaker 6>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>despite his,</v>

2755
02:08:56.020 --> 02:09:00.670
<v Speaker 6>he's amazing knowledge and background </v>
<v Speaker 6>and achievements.</v>

2756
02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:05.700

<v Speaker 6>respectfully with Vienna,</v>

2757
02:09:07.211 --> 02:09:12.211
<v Speaker 6>with humility.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you even asked questions like </v>

2758
02:09:12.211 --> 02:09:14.401
<v Speaker 6>Hickson was asking questions about </v>
<v Speaker 6>different aspects of the positions and </v>

2759

<v Speaker 6>very unusual guy.</v>

<v Speaker 6>like he was the first guy to incorporate</v>

<v Speaker 6>Tenth Planet Jiu Jitsu is a very,</v>

2837
02:12:57.871 --> 02:13:00.570
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>explorative innovative school of,</v>

2838
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:03.410
<v Speaker 6>of Jujitsu and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

2839
02:13:03.411 --> 02:13:05.390
<v Speaker 6>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the game of MMA,</v>

2840
02:13:05.391 --> 02:13:08.690
<v Speaker 6>of those gyms who also are open and </v>
<v Speaker 6>collaborative,</v>

2841
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:11.450
<v Speaker 6>arguing to kid themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2842
02:13:11.451 --> 02:13:14.360
<v Speaker 6>at the upper echelon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2843
02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:18.230
<v Speaker 6>and those who don't evolve will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>will disappear because it isn't till the</v>

2844
02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:19.680
<v Speaker 6>methods,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2845
02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:22.760
<v Speaker 6>the end result is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the fight it's fighting,</v>

2846
02:13:22.761 --> 02:13:26.850
<v Speaker 6>but the methods to get there and to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>proficient at it,</v>

2847
02:13:27.190 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it boils down to the methods that you </v>

2848
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:32.260
<v Speaker 6>use.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2849
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:35.180
<v Speaker 4>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Carlos there was a,</v>

2850
02:13:35.250 --> 02:13:40.250
<v Speaker 4>there was no resistance when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>approached him and start to try and he </v>

2851
02:13:40.250 --> 02:13:43.970
<v Speaker 4>talk to his coaches about it and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they may not understand right away </v>

2852
02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:44.090
<v Speaker 4>exactly what it was about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2853
02:13:44.091 --> 02:13:49.091
<v Speaker 4>what was going to bring to his game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were at least open to it and </v>

2854
02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:53.400
<v Speaker 4>eventually this saw a what together </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been able to,</v>

2855
02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:56.250
<v Speaker 4>to improve and achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if,</v>

2856
02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:59.790
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it didn't have that attitude,</v>

2857
02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:05.270
<v Speaker 4>then Carlos would have not benefited you</v>
<v Speaker 4>contact a Jackson and Gregg and </v>

2858
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:11.220
<v Speaker 4>winkeljohn before you worked with her </v>
<v Speaker 4>one or did you try it out first and go,</v>

2859
02:14:11.221 --> 02:14:11.810
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2860
02:14:11.811 --> 02:14:13.890
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm onto something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2861
02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:16.020
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2862
02:14:16.050 --> 02:14:17.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember how that worked,</v>

2863
02:14:17.641 --> 02:14:20.910
<v Speaker 4>but it was really interesting in Erwin </v>
<v Speaker 4>touched on it earlier,</v>

2864
02:14:20.911 --> 02:14:24.170
<v Speaker 4>was that they saw the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They both watch it.</v>

2865
02:14:24.450 --> 02:14:27.620
<v Speaker 4>So after my widening the stance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2866
02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:28.510
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

2867
02:14:28.511 --> 02:14:31.150
<v Speaker 4>the ability to move forward and back we </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and uh,</v>

2868
02:14:31.710 --> 02:14:36.710
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greg Jackson sat and he wanted to watch </v>

2869
02:14:36.710 --> 02:14:37.170
<v Speaker 4>a couple of my fights and we want to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're doing well and what we needed</v>

2870
02:14:37.171 --> 02:14:42.171
<v Speaker 4>improvement on a few things and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>started work with Erwin completely </v>

2871
02:14:43.831 --> 02:14:46.950
<v Speaker 4>independently and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're walking on logs and this and that.</v>

2872
02:14:46.951 --> 02:14:47.850
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2873
02:14:47.851 --> 02:14:51.140
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of a plan that I have for </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and this is what I see.</v>

2874
02:14:51.141 --> 02:14:54.000
<v Speaker 4>And it was exactly the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Greg Jackson,</v>

2875
02:14:54.001 --> 02:14:58.440
<v Speaker 4>who is considered to be one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant minds in mma saw.</v>

2876
02:14:58.650 --> 02:15:03.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm Erwin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a movement specialist in Irwin had a </v>

2877
02:15:03.650 --> 02:15:04.890
<v Speaker 4>plan and a strategy on how to improve </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2878
02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was Jackson's idea of dealing with </v>

2879
02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:10.280
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did he think?</v>

2880
02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:11.370
<v Speaker 4>He knew what needed to be done.</v>

2881
02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:13.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he necessarily knew how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get there.</v>

2882
02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:17.040
<v Speaker 4>So he knew that you needed to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>move in and out better?</v>

2883
02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:19.270
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't have any strategy.</v>

2884
02:15:19.770 --> 02:15:21.530
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say that he didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 4>strategy.</v>

2885
02:15:21.531 --> 02:15:22.470
<v Speaker 4>It was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2886
02:15:22.471 --> 02:15:23.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll work on that.</v>

2887
02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Let's figure out how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>

2888
02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:27.210
<v Speaker 4>let's work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'd be just drill it.</v>

2889
02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2890
02:15:28.590 --> 02:15:31.740
<v Speaker 4>Drilling a Irwin and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2891
02:15:32.130 --> 02:15:36.060
<v Speaker 4>we videotaped my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we videotaped us moving across the same,</v>

2892
02:15:36.090 --> 02:15:38.850
<v Speaker 4>the same distance and the students fast </v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2893
02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:41.730
<v Speaker 4>he's like a fucking deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He moves really,</v>

2894
02:15:41.731 --> 02:15:42.750
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really quickly.</v>

2895
02:15:42.810 --> 02:15:43.980
<v Speaker 4>He can run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can,</v>

2896
02:15:44.890 --> 02:15:47.700
<v Speaker 4>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got that look into that fund myself</v>

2897
02:15:47.701 --> 02:15:52.701
<v Speaker 4>and the color of the wood with me being </v>
<v Speaker 4>a so called deer and these guy with his </v>

2898
02:15:52.701 --> 02:15:54.430
<v Speaker 4>boat because he shoots like super sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2899
02:15:55.590 --> 02:15:56.490
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2900
02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:00.420
<v Speaker 4>so videos you're going back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we're,</v>

2901
02:16:00.421 --> 02:16:02.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at and we're,</v>

2902
02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:07.480
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at this stuff in slow mo </v>

2903
02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:09.621
<v Speaker 4>frame by frame where his body position </v>
<v Speaker 4>is compared to where mine is and what's </v>

2904
02:16:09.621 --> 02:16:09.621
<v Speaker 4>the difference.</v>

2905
02:16:09.621 --> 02:16:12.330
<v Speaker 4>He's moving faster because boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's more upright.</v>

2906
02:16:12.331 --> 02:16:17.331
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have so much weight on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>front foot that he asked to load and </v>

2907
02:16:17.331 --> 02:16:21.210
<v Speaker 4>take another half second before he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he springs backwards.</v>

2908
02:16:21.211 --> 02:16:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we're like,</v>

2909
02:16:22.591 --> 02:16:23.400
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

2910
02:16:24.450 --> 02:16:26.580
<v Speaker 4>This is what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what we need to improve on,</v>

2911
02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:30.290
<v Speaker 4>this is what we need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we're going drill it and,</v>

2912
02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:33.860
<v Speaker 4>and there's a variety of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>things to kind of in a,</v>

2913
02:16:33.970 --> 02:16:35.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still that,</v>

2914
02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:40.180
<v Speaker 4>that a stance in the posture as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a neuromuscular level.</v>

2915
02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:42.670
<v Speaker 4>Are you having other fighters </v>
<v Speaker 4>approaching now?</v>

2916
02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Not yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but really I saw that video.</v>

2917
02:16:47.921 --> 02:16:50.320
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine the video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you guys trained together?</v>

2918
02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:56.940
<v Speaker 4>There is still some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably some skepticism can have West </v>

2919
02:16:56.940 --> 02:17:00.490
<v Speaker 4>this Moltmann coaching and lucky and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like it doesn't have.</v>

2920
02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:04.960
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't look like Jesus doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>a man bun and Isu have foreign accent.</v>

2921
02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:06.010
<v Speaker 4>It's a ripoff.</v>

2922
02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:10.220
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2923
02:17:10.230 --> 02:17:15.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that they don't know exactly </v>

2924
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:19.411
<v Speaker 4>what it is about the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably believe that it's either </v>

2925
02:17:19.411 --> 02:17:22.810
<v Speaker 4>rent a random or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you listen to what Carla says,</v>

2926
02:17:23.010 --> 02:17:24.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is actually,</v>

2927
02:17:24.671 --> 02:17:28.000
<v Speaker 4>it was highly specific because a can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>be three months,</v>

2928
02:17:28.050 --> 02:17:32.200
<v Speaker 4>we would train once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe sometimes twice a week,</v>

2929
02:17:32.201 --> 02:17:35.860
<v Speaker 4>but that's still a limit on amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time to make those changes happen.</v>

2930
02:17:35.861 --> 02:17:38.820
<v Speaker 4>So I had to choose my battle and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2931
02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:39.940
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2932
02:17:40.330 --> 02:17:41.530
<v Speaker 4>I told Carlos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2933
02:17:41.531 --> 02:17:44.020
<v Speaker 4>this is what I believe we need to work </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and just focus on.</v>

2934
02:17:44.340 --> 02:17:49.340
<v Speaker 4>And we did that for the first camp and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then the second camp for a loader was </v>

2935
02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:50.980
<v Speaker 4>completely different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely different,</v>

2936
02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:52.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2937
02:17:52.350 --> 02:17:54.060
<v Speaker 4>and highly specific to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2938
02:17:54.410 --> 02:17:55.190
<v Speaker 4>improving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2939
02:17:55.270 --> 02:18:00.270
<v Speaker 4>kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were you gonna say you're going to </v>

2940
02:18:00.270 --> 02:18:00.270
<v Speaker 4>say we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do have some guys that are,</v>

2941
02:18:00.550 --> 02:18:02.710
<v Speaker 4>they've been doing this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>independently.</v>

2942
02:18:02.710 --> 02:18:03.820
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the,</v>

2943
02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:04.960
<v Speaker 4>one of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>young guy,</v>

2944
02:18:04.990 --> 02:18:07.720
<v Speaker 4>and they're fighting on like amateur and</v>
<v Speaker 4>regional levels,</v>

2945
02:18:07.721 --> 02:18:11.160
<v Speaker 4>but you have a feeling we're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to know their names here in</v>

2946
02:18:11.170 --> 02:18:13.270
<v Speaker 4>the next couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're up and coming.</v>

2947
02:18:13.271 --> 02:18:13.930
<v Speaker 4>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're young,</v>

2948
02:18:14.580 --> 02:18:16.540
<v Speaker 4>like 21,</v>
<v Speaker 4>22,</v>

<v Speaker 4>23 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2950
02:18:17.831 --> 02:18:19.510
<v Speaker 4>kind of making their way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2951
02:18:20.130 --> 02:18:24.460
<v Speaker 4>one of them has been watching Irwin's </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos since he was 15 years old.</v>

2952
02:18:24.490 --> 02:18:26.770
<v Speaker 4>He met her when he was all star struck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

2953
02:18:26.771 --> 02:18:28.410
<v Speaker 4>this is the core.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did you even,</v>

2954
02:18:28.450 --> 02:18:29.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2955
02:18:29.561 --> 02:18:31.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2956
02:18:31.630 --> 02:18:34.570
<v Speaker 4>they are incorporating movement quite a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

2957
02:18:34.571 --> 02:18:35.450
<v Speaker 4>so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2958
02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:38.320
<v Speaker 4>it's not that they haven't sought him </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there,</v>

2959
02:18:38.321 --> 02:18:42.240
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of very interested in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and doing their own stuff and,</v>

2960
02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:47.500
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and finding this stuff on online and </v>

2961
02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:49.070
<v Speaker 4>watching the door tech portal stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching Irwin's stuff and um,</v>

2962
02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:54.260
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and definitely incorporating a lot of </v>

2963
02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:54.260
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>

2964
02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:55.680
<v Speaker 4>And one of the kids is a gymnast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gymnast before and,</v>

2965
02:18:55.700 --> 02:18:59.650
<v Speaker 4>and so now he can do all kinds of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and they're looking for a niche.</v>

2966
02:18:59.651 --> 02:19:04.510
<v Speaker 4>Definitely they'll looking for an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even Carlos was looking for,</v>

2967
02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:07.570
<v Speaker 4>well George St Pierre was doing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>gymnastics.</v>

2968
02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:11.250
<v Speaker 4>Cummings does a lot of that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing now we're like,</v>

2969
02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:11.520
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2970
02:19:11.521 --> 02:19:13.660
<v Speaker 4>we see with conor mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like this big thing.</v>

2971
02:19:13.661 --> 02:19:15.270
<v Speaker 4>All of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2972
02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>GSP was,</v>

2973
02:19:17.610 --> 02:19:22.610
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was doing gymnastics for the same </v>

2974
02:19:22.610 --> 02:19:23.450
<v Speaker 4>exact reasons to be able to move his </v>
<v Speaker 4>body better through,</v>

2975
02:19:23.451 --> 02:19:28.451
<v Speaker 4>through space and ultimately become a </v>
<v Speaker 4>better able to better beat the shit out </v>

2976
02:19:30.741 --> 02:19:32.420
<v Speaker 4>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the goal,</v>

2977
02:19:32.421 --> 02:19:33.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's a cool way to train and,</v>

2980
02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:37.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the fact,</v>

2981
02:19:37.131 --> 02:19:40.370
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a cool fitness,</v>

2982
02:19:40.371 --> 02:19:42.710
<v Speaker 4>mobile modality that's very different.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely love it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>fucking day I die.</v>

2986

<v Speaker 4>going to be fighting?</v>

2987
02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:54.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you considered that?</v>

02:20:20.930 --> 02:20:23.540
<v Speaker 4>I get dinged up and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still feel great,</v>

3001
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:28.630
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think my concern is the longterm </v>

3002
02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:30.590
<v Speaker 4>neurological stuff that is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming to light with,</v>

3003
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:34.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with all this studies on concussions and</v>

3004
02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:35.240
<v Speaker 4>you've seen me fight.</v>

3005
02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:40.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't go in there and not take damage </v>

3006
02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:40.240
<v Speaker 4>and I fucking take damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3007
02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:42.680
<v Speaker 4>I take take punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I take,</v>

3008
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:45.680
<v Speaker 4>I'll take two to give one and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just Kinda my style.</v>

3009
02:20:45.681 --> 02:20:47.780
<v Speaker 4>And well you didn't fight like that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nick Diaz fight.</v>

3010
02:20:47.781 --> 02:20:49.940
<v Speaker 4>That was like one of the few fights we </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't fight like that.</v>

3011
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3012
02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:57.160
<v Speaker 4>I felt I had seen a lot of guys go in </v>
<v Speaker 4>against Nick Diaz and gas themselves out</v>

3013
02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:00.340
<v Speaker 4>trying to knock that guy out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like he can't,</v>

3014
02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:04.570
<v Speaker 4>you can't knock him out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He took a full on a left hook from,</v>

3015
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:07.460
<v Speaker 4>from Paul Daley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flopped around a little bit,</v>

3016
02:21:07.730 --> 02:21:12.730
<v Speaker 4>pop back up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul Daley Blues was trying to finish </v>

3017
02:21:12.730 --> 02:21:13.280
<v Speaker 4>him and then and then got knocked the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck out himself.</v>

3018
02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:15.770
<v Speaker 4>And I've seen a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3019
02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:19.390
<v Speaker 4>hurt him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's so God damn toughy,</v>

3020
02:21:19.391 --> 02:21:20.960
<v Speaker 4>so hard to put away.</v>

3021
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:23.180
<v Speaker 4>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was more of a,</v>

3022
02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:26.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a calculated approach,</v>

3023
02:21:26.390 --> 02:21:28.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I got flowing later in the fight,</v>

3024
02:21:28.611 --> 02:21:31.130
<v Speaker 4>I started opening up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3025
02:21:31.290 --> 02:21:36.290
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what a lot of new ideas </v>

3026
02:21:36.290 --> 02:21:38.800
<v Speaker 4>or strategies he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wants for what he wants to get in </v>

3027
02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:38.990
<v Speaker 4>your head and he wants you to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotionally.</v>

3028
02:21:38.991 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 4>He wants you to sit there and have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>face punch,</v>

3029
02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:43.520
<v Speaker 4>punch competition with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3030
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:48.670
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to stand here like it's the </v>

3031
02:21:48.670 --> 02:21:48.670
<v Speaker 4>fucking school yard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was he talking about shit to you?</v>

3032
02:21:48.670 --> 02:21:49.370
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>

3033
02:21:49.430 --> 02:21:52.570
<v Speaker 4>I knew I knew what he's gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3034
02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:55.310
<v Speaker 4>I grew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up with tools like that,</v>

3035
02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:58.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole life I was.</v>

3036
02:21:58.470 --> 02:22:03.470
<v Speaker 4>So I was kind of used to that and I knew</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was going to have to be </v>

3037
02:22:03.470 --> 02:22:04.470
<v Speaker 4>emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a prepared.</v>

3038
02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:05.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3039
02:22:05.541 --> 02:22:06.590
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Emotionally,</v>

3040
02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:11.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of shut down and just fight a </v>

3041
02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:11.960
<v Speaker 4>strategic fucking game plan against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

3042
02:22:12.310 --> 02:22:13.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

3043
02:22:13.371 --> 02:22:18.371
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was interesting to watch that fight </v>

3044
02:22:18.371 --> 02:22:20.570
<v Speaker 4>because he was extremely frustrated by </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3045
02:22:20.690 --> 02:22:23.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he couldn't get you to change,</v>

3046
02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whereas he's been able to fuck with guys</v>

3047
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.250
<v Speaker 6>heads like the frank shamrock fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you could see frank shamrock going,</v>

3048
02:22:29.370 --> 02:22:31.290
<v Speaker 6>I can't fucking believe this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>happening to me.</v>

3049
02:22:31.650 --> 02:22:34.260
<v Speaker 6>Like when nick was talking shit to him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what bitch,</v>

3050
02:22:34.261 --> 02:22:35.790
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then popping them with a jab.</v>

3051
02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:41.100
<v Speaker 6>You could see like for some people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit-talking becomes overwhelming with </v>

3052
02:22:41.131 --> 02:22:42.990
<v Speaker 6>nick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3053
02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:44.720
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's funny is a,</v>

3054
02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:50.360
<v Speaker 6>both me and cowboy fought the Diaz </v>
<v Speaker 6>brothers within a few weeks of each </v>

3055
02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:50.360
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3056
02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:55.200
<v Speaker 6>A cowboy lost to nate and I fought nick </v>
<v Speaker 6>just a few weeks later.</v>

3057
02:22:55.560 --> 02:23:00.560
<v Speaker 6>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in preparation for both of our camps we </v>

3058
02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:03.951
<v Speaker 6>would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were switching roles and both </v>

3059
02:23:03.951 --> 02:23:07.041
<v Speaker 6>fighting southpaws and both fighting one</v>
<v Speaker 6>round I would fight southpaws talk a </v>

3060
02:23:07.041 --> 02:23:10.290
<v Speaker 6>bunch of shit and try and try,</v>
<v Speaker 6>try and try to get,</v>

3061
02:23:10.291 --> 02:23:13.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>try to emulate his style.</v>

3062
02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:15.360
<v Speaker 6>And then the next round he would do the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same.</v>

3063
02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:17.140
<v Speaker 6>This is yell out Stockton motherfucker.</v>

3064
02:23:18.930 --> 02:23:19.720
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3065
02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:23.850
<v Speaker 6>I did my best in pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>reminds me of a Buddhist,</v>

3066
02:23:23.851 --> 02:23:28.460
<v Speaker 6>a hmong drill where they're all in their</v>
<v Speaker 6>meditation posture and uh,</v>

3067
02:23:28.461 --> 02:23:33.461
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they partner up and the other guys like </v>

3068
02:23:33.461 --> 02:23:36.140
<v Speaker 6>trying to instigate them and no crap to </v>
<v Speaker 6>them to have them get out of their </v>

3069
02:23:37.681 --> 02:23:40.920
<v Speaker 6>meditation as the drill the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3070
02:23:40.921 --> 02:23:42.930
<v Speaker 6>there's definitely something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3071
02:23:42.931 --> 02:23:46.380
<v Speaker 6>if you're not used to people that talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit when someone talks shit to you,</v>

3072
02:23:46.381 --> 02:23:50.010
<v Speaker 6>it can be emotionally devastating what's</v>
<v Speaker 6>happening here.</v>

3073
02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:51.660
<v Speaker 6>But if you used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck you,</v>

3074
02:23:51.661 --> 02:23:52.860
<v Speaker 6>I've heard this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3075
02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:55.080
<v Speaker 6>it becomes normal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

3076
02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:57.810
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried to explain that to fighters when</v>

3077
02:23:57.811 --> 02:24:02.520
<v Speaker 6>they deal with online criticism as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I've talked to guys who would go on</v>

3078
02:24:02.521 --> 02:24:07.521
<v Speaker 6>like the underground and see like some </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit that people are talking about them </v>

3079
02:24:07.521 --> 02:24:08.040
<v Speaker 6>and just be fucking devastated and get </v>
<v Speaker 6>so upset.</v>

3080
02:24:08.310 --> 02:24:09.060
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look man,</v>

3081
02:24:09.061 --> 02:24:14.061
<v Speaker 6>you got to treat it like snake venom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get a little bit of that shit in </v>

3082
02:24:14.061 --> 02:24:15.710
<v Speaker 6>your system and you're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get a little bit more and eventually</v>

3083
02:24:16.090 --> 02:24:18.600
<v Speaker 6>you build up an immunity to it and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>you go,</v>

3084
02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:19.830
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

3085
02:24:19.831 --> 02:24:22.980
<v Speaker 6>You're just a bunch of little console </v>
<v Speaker 6>who've never accomplished shit.</v>

3086
02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:26.150
<v Speaker 6>So you talking shit about fighters </v>
<v Speaker 6>calling them pussies and like,</v>

3087
02:24:26.170 --> 02:24:29.190
<v Speaker 6>because some fighters you have a loss </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're like,</v>

3088
02:24:29.191 --> 02:24:30.540
<v Speaker 6>good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm glad he got knocked out.</v>

3089
02:24:30.541 --> 02:24:35.541
<v Speaker 6>I fucking hate watching that guy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a pussy like damn stuff.</v>

3090
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:40.070
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's initially it as like,</v>

3091
02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:40.800
<v Speaker 6>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

3092
02:24:40.801 --> 02:24:41.470
<v Speaker 6>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3093
02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:46.520
<v Speaker 6>I'd never experienced that until really </v>
<v Speaker 6>until after the deal is there had been </v>

3094
02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:46.860
<v Speaker 6>some.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But after the Diaz fight,</v>

3095
02:24:46.861 --> 02:24:49.860
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know that big time.</v>

3096
02:24:49.950 --> 02:24:53.090
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I call it the shifts and what I call it,</v>

3097
02:24:53.290 --> 02:24:57.810
<v Speaker 6>the unique snowflakes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A snowflake syndrome.</v>

3098
02:24:57.860 --> 02:24:59.280
<v Speaker 6>Lucky or told,</v>
<v Speaker 6>since you're a kid,</v>

3099
02:24:59.281 --> 02:25:04.281
<v Speaker 6>you're a unique snowflake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the problem is that day they can't </v>

3100
02:25:04.281 --> 02:25:04.950
<v Speaker 6>stand the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does that make sense?</v>

3101
02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:10.950
<v Speaker 6>Who are you talking about them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love who is the unique snowflake,</v>

3102
02:25:10.951 --> 02:25:15.900
<v Speaker 6>the person talking shit or the fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoever is like being told all the time,</v>

3103
02:25:15.901 --> 02:25:20.901
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's okay to be different or it's okay </v>

3104
02:25:20.901 --> 02:25:22.941
<v Speaker 6>to be this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that problem is that sometimes you </v>

3105
02:25:22.941 --> 02:25:22.941
<v Speaker 6>do need to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3106
02:25:22.941 --> 02:25:23.920
<v Speaker 6>hear stuff about</v>

3107
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:28.180
<v Speaker 5>yourself that is challenging and to take</v>
<v Speaker 5>it to not crumble,</v>

3108
02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:30.880
<v Speaker 5>crumble really know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to hear it.</v>

3109
02:25:30.881 --> 02:25:31.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

3110
02:25:31.810 --> 02:25:36.070
<v Speaker 5>I would appreciate it man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard because I like both ways.</v>

3111
02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:41.400
<v Speaker 5>I kind of love like Nate Diaz punching </v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael Johnson the face and then </v>

3112
02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:41.560
<v Speaker 5>pointing at them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

3113
02:25:41.561 --> 02:25:42.700
<v Speaker 5>I just fucked you up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3114
02:25:42.701 --> 02:25:43.930
<v Speaker 5>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3115
02:25:43.931 --> 02:25:47.450
<v Speaker 5>when Anderson fought nick and nick laid </v>
<v Speaker 5>down on his back and pretended to sleep,</v>

3116
02:25:47.460 --> 02:25:49.510
<v Speaker 5>sleeping for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was fucking crying,</v>

3117
02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:54.580
<v Speaker 5>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it when conor mcgregor talks mad </v>

3118
02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:57.250
<v Speaker 5>shit to Joseph all for months until he </v>
<v Speaker 5>just rent space in his head to the point</v>

3119
02:25:57.251 --> 02:26:00.100
<v Speaker 5>where although just he literally can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight his fight.</v>

3120
02:26:00.250 --> 02:26:03.940
<v Speaker 5>He has to run at conor because he's just</v>
<v Speaker 5>so overwhelmed with emotion.</v>

3121
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:06.220
<v Speaker 5>And then connor sleep some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3122
02:26:06.690 --> 02:26:09.640
<v Speaker 5>I like both,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I prefer in a.</v>

3123
02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:12.040
<v Speaker 5>In a perfect world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I prefer martial artists.</v>

3124
02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:15.340
<v Speaker 5>I prefer guys that go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>treat each other with respect,</v>

3125
02:26:15.341 --> 02:26:19.150
<v Speaker 5>shake each other's hands and then just </v>
<v Speaker 5>go out and just let their skill,</v>

3126
02:26:19.450 --> 02:26:23.230
<v Speaker 5>but it's an effective tactic to these </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighters.</v>

3127
02:26:23.231 --> 02:26:25.030
<v Speaker 5>It's part of their weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

3128
02:26:25.031 --> 02:26:27.640
<v Speaker 5>It's not something outside their their </v>
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>

3129
02:26:27.641 --> 02:26:31.080
<v Speaker 5>It's completely embedded in their whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>

3130
02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:31.990
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3131
02:26:31.991 --> 02:26:35.590
<v Speaker 5>it's also a slider is defined themselves</v>
<v Speaker 5>by respect,</v>

3132
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:37.600
<v Speaker 5>by how much someone respects them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>how.</v>

3133
02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:41.500
<v Speaker 5>How much like like to a fighter when </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's not scared with them,</v>

3134
02:26:41.530 --> 02:26:46.530
<v Speaker 5>it becomes a very devastating thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember when Anderson fought </v>

3135
02:26:46.530 --> 02:26:49.951
<v Speaker 5>Chris Weidman when right Weidman and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they understand what the winds and </v>

3136
02:26:49.951 --> 02:26:51.190
<v Speaker 5>Anderson staring at him looking at him </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Weidman goes,</v>

3137
02:26:51.430 --> 02:26:52.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm not scared of you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

3138
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:54.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm not scared of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you could see Anderson was like,</v>

3139
02:26:54.881 --> 02:26:59.881
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy really isn't fucking scared of </v>

3140
02:26:59.881 --> 02:27:01.891
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could see there was a tangible </v>

3141
02:27:01.891 --> 02:27:02.140
<v Speaker 5>moment where this guy wasn't pretending.</v>

3142
02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:04.690
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't scared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just literally wasn't scared.</v>

3143
02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:10.230
<v Speaker 5>Then I could feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That similar situation at the weigh ins </v>

3144
02:27:10.361 --> 02:27:14.320
<v Speaker 5>with Ronda Rousey and Holly Holm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3145
02:27:14.410 --> 02:27:19.410
<v Speaker 5>Same thing and I felt like that was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>precursor to what ended up happening.</v>

3146
02:27:19.481 --> 02:27:24.481
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the big part was when Holly didn't </v>

3147
02:27:24.481 --> 02:27:24.481
<v Speaker 5>flinch exactly when Rhonda was yelling </v>
<v Speaker 5>at you,</v>

3148
02:27:24.481 --> 02:27:24.481
<v Speaker 5>fake bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3149
02:27:24.481 --> 02:27:25.750
<v Speaker 5>preacher's daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this stuff and stuff,</v>

3150
02:27:25.751 --> 02:27:30.751
<v Speaker 5>and she bought all this stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 5>instagram about her and holly just </v>

3151
02:27:30.751 --> 02:27:30.790
<v Speaker 5>standing there and then when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>interviewed holly afterward she goes,</v>

3152
02:27:30.791 --> 02:27:32.710
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just trying to get a sip of water.</v>

3153
02:27:33.010 --> 02:27:34.450
<v Speaker 5>And you realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

3154
02:27:34.451 --> 02:27:38.020
<v Speaker 5>this girl is so fucking composed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like so composed.</v>

3155
02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:41.740
<v Speaker 5>And it also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she had been to so many dances.</v>

3156
02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:46.000
<v Speaker 5>She fought for so many boxing titles and</v>
<v Speaker 5>kickboxing and MMA.</v>

3157
02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:51.120
<v Speaker 5>She'd been in so many dances that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bright lights were in an uncomfortable </v>

3158
02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:51.120
<v Speaker 5>thing to her.</v>

3159
02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:51.940
<v Speaker 5>She had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

3160
02:27:51.941 --> 02:27:53.190
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're here again now.</v>

3161
02:27:53.370 --> 02:27:55.720
<v Speaker 5>Whereas for a lot of people it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

3162
02:27:55.721 --> 02:27:58.090
<v Speaker 5>this is the big show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

3163
02:27:58.091 --> 02:27:59.470
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

3164
02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:05.400
<v Speaker 5>Being overwhelmed by the moment is </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost something that you can't prepare </v>

3165
02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:06.880
<v Speaker 5>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to me that for a lot of people,</v>

3166
02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:12.120
<v Speaker 5>some people just naturally can deal with</v>
<v Speaker 5>moments and some people they have to </v>

3167
02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:13.750
<v Speaker 5>experience it a couple times to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>loose.</v>

3168
02:28:13.810 --> 02:28:18.810
<v Speaker 5>They get got to get comfortable with it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they have to like some people </v>

3169
02:28:18.810 --> 02:28:18.810
<v Speaker 5>like cowboys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A perfect example.</v>

3170
02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:22.910
<v Speaker 5>He fights his best when he fights a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got to fight all the time.</v>

3171
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:28.030
<v Speaker 5>He fights three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four times a year in then you're going </v>

3172
02:28:28.030 --> 02:28:29.981
<v Speaker 5>to get the best cowboy you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you make them take a year off or </v>

3173
02:28:29.981 --> 02:28:32.810
<v Speaker 5>take a long time off and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's much better when he's active.</v>

3174
02:28:32.930 --> 02:28:37.930
<v Speaker 5>He's gotta stay loose and loosened up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and fired up and to fight with Tim </v>

3175
02:28:38.161 --> 02:28:40.400
<v Speaker 5>tiffany means is going to be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

3176
02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:41.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They announced that.</v>

3177
02:28:41.511 --> 02:28:42.320
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

3178
02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.700
<v Speaker 5>Why did cowboy decided to take that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight?</v>

3179
02:28:44.701 --> 02:28:46.970
<v Speaker 5>Because he doesn't like cutting weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea.</v>

3180
02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:48.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't.</v>

3181
02:28:48.471 --> 02:28:50.450
<v Speaker 5>I haven't talked to cowboy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean I said,</v>

3182
02:28:50.451 --> 02:28:51.200
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's up?</v>

3183
02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:52.100
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we didn't,</v>

3184
02:28:52.130 --> 02:28:53.720
<v Speaker 5>but we didn't really talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight at all.</v>

3185
02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:54.650
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's so crazy.</v>

3186
02:28:54.651 --> 02:28:56.150
<v Speaker 5>You could probably offer him brock </v>
<v Speaker 5>lesnar.</v>

3187
02:28:56.151 --> 02:28:56.840
<v Speaker 5>He left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>

3188
02:28:56.900 --> 02:28:57.470
<v Speaker 5>bring it on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3189
02:28:57.471 --> 02:28:58.310
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3190
02:28:58.311 --> 02:28:59.000
<v Speaker 5>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

3191
02:28:59.110 --> 02:29:01.910
<v Speaker 5>That's why he's because he's cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3192
02:29:01.911 --> 02:29:03.020
<v Speaker 5>He's just nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3193
02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:04.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a fun dude,</v>

3194
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:05.630
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3195
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:08.690
<v Speaker 5>absolutely fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fight and fuck.</v>

3196
02:29:08.691 --> 02:29:10.340
<v Speaker 5>He's either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's either on or he's off.</v>

3197
02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:11.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately.</v>

3198
02:29:11.540 --> 02:29:12.470
<v Speaker 5>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3199
02:29:12.471 --> 02:29:15.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't even necessarily know if he </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't that he was not on.</v>

3200
02:29:15.970 --> 02:29:18.150
<v Speaker 5>I said Dos Anjos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a fucking demon.</v>

3201
02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:21.410
<v Speaker 5>He's just jumps all over you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did that to him.</v>

3202
02:29:21.411 --> 02:29:22.750
<v Speaker 5>Did that to pettis?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3203
02:29:22.850 --> 02:29:25.400
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's done that to pedis man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

3204
02:29:25.401 --> 02:29:30.160
<v Speaker 5>but he's just so fucking fat and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a guy who trains with nickerson.</v>

3205
02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:35.200
<v Speaker 5>Nickerson has gotten doing all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>plyometrics and jumps and sprints and </v>

3206
02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:37.570
<v Speaker 5>foot strengthening stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ever seen that stuff with her?</v>

3207
02:29:37.780 --> 02:29:42.780
<v Speaker 5>They're lying on their back and their </v>
<v Speaker 5>feet are pushing up these bars and </v>

3208
02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:46.661
<v Speaker 5>they're kicking up these bars and </v>
<v Speaker 5>catching them with their feet and </v>

3209
02:29:46.661 --> 02:29:46.910
<v Speaker 5>exploding with their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw,</v>

3210
02:29:46.911 --> 02:29:51.911
<v Speaker 5>I saw the video for the cowboy fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all based on Marv Marinovich is </v>

3211
02:29:52.430 --> 02:29:56.720
<v Speaker 5>training stretch strategies as the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of shit that he used with Bj Penn.</v>

3212
02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:02.200
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really interesting that I remember </v>

3213

<v Speaker 5>watching that and bj was standing on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tennis balls and all that sort of,</v>

<v Speaker 5>very similar,</v>

3215
02:30:06.510 --> 02:30:07.160

<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:14.200
<v Speaker 5>it's all veRy similar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of look at different ways to </v>

3218
02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:15.080
<v Speaker 5>different branches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's all kind of,</v>

02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:16.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the same goal.</v>

3221
02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:22.420
<v Speaker 5>So what's next for you now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you hang back for what?</v>

3222
02:30:22.460 --> 02:30:25.940
<v Speaker 5>You had a brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy five round war for the title where</v>

3223
02:30:26.270 --> 02:30:29.420
<v Speaker 5>it was as close as you're ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking get.</v>

3224
02:30:29.421 --> 02:30:31.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people saw it your way.</v>

3225
02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:35.210
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people saw a robbie's way was </v>
<v Speaker 5>just that close split decision.</v>

3226
02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:37.070
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you do now?</v>

3227
02:30:38.010 --> 02:30:40.450
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3228
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:42.590
<v Speaker 5>I'd like another shot at robbie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3229
02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:45.320
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt like I won the fight.</v>

3230
02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:46.940
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like you said,</v>

3231
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:51.950
<v Speaker 5>it's razor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>razor close decision could have gone </v>

3232
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.950
<v Speaker 5>either way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mma,</v>

3233
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:56.351
<v Speaker 5>judgIng a subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the scoring system so fucking crazy to </v>

3234
02:30:56.351 --> 02:30:58.190
<v Speaker 5>it is nuts that we're still using that </v>
<v Speaker 5>10 point must system.</v>

3235
02:30:58.280 --> 02:30:58.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3236
02:30:58.791 --> 02:31:03.791
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't apply very well to animate it </v>

3237
02:31:03.791 --> 02:31:04.280
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's proven over and over again.</v>

3238
02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:05.570
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3239
02:31:05.571 --> 02:31:06.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd,</v>

3240
02:31:06.181 --> 02:31:07.410
<v Speaker 5>I'd like another shot at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3241
02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:09.320
<v Speaker 5>at robby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I should have the belt right</v>

3242
02:31:09.321 --> 02:31:11.690
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it seems like tyron woodley's next,</v>

3243
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:16.750
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean at least he was sort of promised </v>

3244
02:31:16.750 --> 02:31:19.211
<v Speaker 5>that and based on the hendricks we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>hendrix didn't make weight and um,</v>

3245
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:23.250
<v Speaker 5>it seems like that's what's probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>being set up,</v>

3246
02:31:23.251 --> 02:31:28.251
<v Speaker 5>but you never know what the doc mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Misha tate was supposed to fight ronda </v>

3247
02:31:28.251 --> 02:31:31.240
<v Speaker 5>if she Beat jessica.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's who it was.</v>

3248
02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:35.520
<v Speaker 5>And then they decided no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's,</v>

3249
02:31:36.330 --> 02:31:39.240
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting because the ufc kinda </v>
<v Speaker 5>decided to call the shots.</v>

3250
02:31:39.450 --> 02:31:41.910
<v Speaker 5>Has anybody talked to you about whether </v>
<v Speaker 5>or not they would do that again?</v>

3251
02:31:42.020 --> 02:31:43.260
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>

3252
02:31:43.430 --> 02:31:44.990
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3253
02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:50.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the first fight they made that </v>

3254
02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:53.301
<v Speaker 5>fight because that was the fight that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people wanted to see among any of the </v>

3255
02:31:53.301 --> 02:31:53.680
<v Speaker 5>contenders that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3256
02:31:53.710 --> 02:31:58.710
<v Speaker 5>that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was the one that got everybody </v>

3257
02:31:58.710 --> 02:32:01.200
<v Speaker 5>excited that that was the one and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>rematch of that fight.</v>

3258
02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:02.250
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on now.</v>

3259
02:32:02.610 --> 02:32:05.610
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think as far as public interest,</v>

3260
02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:07.230
<v Speaker 5>that would be the biggest fight out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3261
02:32:07.350 --> 02:32:10.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I feel like I just hate when someone</v>

3262
02:32:10.201 --> 02:32:12.050
<v Speaker 5>gets promised something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3263
02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:15.930
<v Speaker 5>and I would feel the same way if it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>you like tyron woodley get promised that</v>

3264
02:32:15.931 --> 02:32:17.850
<v Speaker 5>title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he beat hendrix,</v>

3265
02:32:17.851 --> 02:32:22.851
<v Speaker 5>hendrix fucks up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make weight and the fight </v>

3266
02:32:22.851 --> 02:32:23.780
<v Speaker 5>fights off and then woodley sorta left </v>
<v Speaker 5>out to dry.</v>

3267
02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:25.750
<v Speaker 5>I feel for him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3268
02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:26.970
<v Speaker 5>and I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3269
02:32:26.971 --> 02:32:27.810
<v Speaker 5>and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3270
02:32:27.850 --> 02:32:32.850
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a last woodley and that that's </v>

3271
02:32:32.850 --> 02:32:32.850
<v Speaker 5>definitely on my radar to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

3272
02:32:32.850 --> 02:32:36.870
<v Speaker 5>to avenge that loss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a loss like that and injury loss.</v>

3273
02:32:36.930 --> 02:32:41.440
<v Speaker 5>Fuck with you as much as a loss by </v>
<v Speaker 5>decision or you know,</v>

3274
02:32:41.470 --> 02:32:45.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's a kind of a crazy loss </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you need blew out.</v>

3275
02:32:45.140 --> 02:32:50.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think even more so just because the </v>

3276
02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:53.571
<v Speaker 5>fact that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't get to do as much as I wanted </v>

<v Speaker 5>it to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3278
02:32:53.571 --> 02:32:57.090
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't get to leave everything out </v>

3279
02:32:57.090 --> 02:32:57.090
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3280
02:32:57.090 --> 02:32:57.090
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this last one.</v>

3281
02:32:57.090 --> 02:32:58.110
<v Speaker 5>That's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't take the belt home that night.</v>

3282
02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:01.410
<v Speaker 5>Didn't go my way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I pushed it.</v>

3283
02:33:01.411 --> 02:33:05.550
<v Speaker 5>I was able to fucking empty the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He definitely emptied the tank.</v>

3284
02:33:05.551 --> 02:33:08.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in the woodley fight I didn't.</v>

3285
02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:09.430
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I definitely see where you're coming </v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm not in charge of picking the fight.</v>

3294
02:33:22.471 --> 02:33:23.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm in charge of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3295
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:27.630
<v Speaker 5>carlos condit and trying to get myself </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the best fight.</v>

3296
02:33:28.050 --> 02:33:29.730
<v Speaker 5>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3297
02:33:29.790 --> 02:33:34.790
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's about the only fight that </v>

3298
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.790
<v Speaker 5>interests me at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3299
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:37.701
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't be mad if they decided to </v>

3300
02:33:37.701 --> 02:33:37.701
<v Speaker 5>make a rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel bad for tyron,</v>

3303
02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:45.470

<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3305
02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:49.020

<v Speaker 5>it'd be ready to go and,</v>

3306
02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:50.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>late spring,</v>

<v Speaker 5>early summer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ufc 200.</v>

3310

3313
02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:09.210

<v Speaker 5>I think that it lived up to that.</v>

3314

<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was legend and it was one of the </v>

<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3342
02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:23.760
<v Speaker 5>we're going to talk about that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3343
02:35:23.820 --> 02:35:28.820
<v Speaker 5>the way people talk about leonard and </v>
<v Speaker 5>duran or with the way people talk about </v>

3344
02:35:28.820 --> 02:35:31.650
<v Speaker 5>any great crazy fight that they were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were there for,</v>

3345
02:35:31.710 --> 02:35:34.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in winter lose.</v>

3346
02:35:34.021 --> 02:35:37.620
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I want to be said.</v>

3347
02:35:37.621 --> 02:35:39.570
<v Speaker 5>That's the legacy that I want to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3348
02:35:39.571 --> 02:35:44.571
<v Speaker 5>I think it was martial arts in its best </v>
<v Speaker 5>form and a lot of ways it was a heart </v>

3349
02:35:44.610 --> 02:35:46.980
<v Speaker 5>determination,</v>
<v Speaker 5>willpower technique,</v>

3350
02:35:47.310 --> 02:35:50.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the discipline to go through camp to get</v>

3351
02:35:50.131 --> 02:35:52.770
<v Speaker 5>yourself in the kind of shape that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>need to be in,</v>

3352
02:35:52.771 --> 02:35:57.771
<v Speaker 5>to compete for five rounds like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is just an insane amount of </v>

3353
02:35:57.771 --> 02:36:01.881
<v Speaker 5>physical conditioning immune.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys fucking emptied and your </v>

3354
02:36:01.881 --> 02:36:05.370
<v Speaker 5>workload was extremely high in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight especially kicks.</v>

3355
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:07.350
<v Speaker 5>I remember that was one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we commented on,</v>

3356
02:36:07.351 --> 02:36:09.510
<v Speaker 5>like how many kicks you had thrown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3357
02:36:09.511 --> 02:36:12.840
<v Speaker 5>it was a really a really fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy fight.</v>

3358
02:36:12.890 --> 02:36:14.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3359
02:36:14.230 --> 02:36:15.170
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was fun,</v>

3360
02:36:15.171 --> 02:36:16.490
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had fun.</v>

3361
02:36:16.530 --> 02:36:18.320
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe maybe I'm a little bit twisted,</v>

3362
02:36:18.321 --> 02:36:18.610
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3363
02:36:18.770 --> 02:36:21.260
<v Speaker 6>that was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was definitely say you're a little bit</v>

3364
02:36:21.330 --> 02:36:23.820
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3365
02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:28.270
<v Speaker 6>that was the kicks were a big part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the strategy to,</v>

3366
02:36:28.271 --> 02:36:33.271
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that a lot of people wonder why </v>

3367
02:36:33.271 --> 02:36:33.770
<v Speaker 6>is it that a lower was not as aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 6>as usual.</v>

3368
02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:39.100
<v Speaker 6>I believe there is a reason because it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>not like he was less hungry or listened </v>

3369
02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:39.920
<v Speaker 6>in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's because the strategy worked,</v>

3370
02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:44.350
<v Speaker 6>have a higher volume and a courtesy and </v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3371
02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:46.440
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with those cakes to,</v>

3372
02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:52.040
<v Speaker 6>to lower his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his aggressiveness and worked with kicks</v>

3373
02:36:52.891 --> 02:36:56.750
<v Speaker 6>her always so dangerous too because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>just takes one slip up,</v>

3374
02:36:57.050 --> 02:36:57.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's there,</v>

3375
02:36:57.690 --> 02:37:01.550
<v Speaker 6>there is so much harder than punches and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're taking them on your arms and they</v>

3376
02:37:01.551 --> 02:37:05.080
<v Speaker 6>fuck your arms up the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can't throw punches anymore.</v>

3377
02:37:05.090 --> 02:37:07.560
<v Speaker 6>So you gotta be careful what you absorb,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3378
02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:12.600
<v Speaker 6>It's part,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the volume is statistically the </v>

3379
02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:15.431
<v Speaker 6>volume is getting to create damage to </v>
<v Speaker 6>two different diverse part the body.</v>

3380
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:16.950
<v Speaker 4>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3381
02:37:16.970 --> 02:37:17.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

3382
02:37:17.421 --> 02:37:19.310
<v Speaker 4>I've heard the debate about the fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>metrics,</v>

3383
02:37:19.311 --> 02:37:23.510
<v Speaker 4>how I threw a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't necessarily land a lot.</v>

3384
02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:28.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I feel like the kick and the kicks </v>

3385
02:37:29.001 --> 02:37:29.980
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the volume of,</v>

3386
02:37:29.981 --> 02:37:34.981
<v Speaker 4>of punches that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was throwing out was the </v>

3387
02:37:34.981 --> 02:37:37.460
<v Speaker 4>equivalent of a say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting down cover fire.</v>

3388
02:37:37.461 --> 02:37:39.830
<v Speaker 4>If you were in a firefight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3389
02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:41.860
<v Speaker 4>you're not necessarily a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3390
02:37:41.970 --> 02:37:43.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pop and people's nuggets,</v>

3391
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:46.070
<v Speaker 4>but you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3392
02:37:46.071 --> 02:37:48.320
<v Speaker 4>that it's part of an overall strategy </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3393
02:37:48.350 --> 02:37:49.580
<v Speaker 4>to come out with victory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

3394
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:53.060
<v Speaker 4>you're your throwing him off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're making him keep his hands up,</v>

3395
02:37:53.061 --> 02:37:56.240
<v Speaker 4>you're keeping that distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are making the enemy.</v>

3396
02:37:56.241 --> 02:38:00.470
<v Speaker 4>Keep their head down in this analogy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you weren't also loading up either.</v>

3397
02:38:00.471 --> 02:38:05.471
<v Speaker 4>You were touching them with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>theSe things and keep him on his toes </v>

3398
02:38:05.471 --> 02:38:08.710
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was something that dwayne was </v>

3399
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.840
<v Speaker 4>calling tj dillashaw to do in his fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>with dominick cruz.</v>

3400
02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:13.840
<v Speaker 4>He was to just go out and touch them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just keep touching them and then the </v>

3401
02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:17.051
<v Speaker 4>shots will come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he got so emotional and tied up and </v>

3402
02:38:17.051 --> 02:38:20.951
<v Speaker 4>trying to knock dominic out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could see him standing flatfooted </v>

3403
02:38:20.951 --> 02:38:21.900
<v Speaker 4>swinging more single shots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>single kicks,</v>

3404
02:38:21.901 --> 02:38:23.400
<v Speaker 4>single punches this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3405
02:38:23.401 --> 02:38:27.950
<v Speaker 4>This guy that had looked just incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>dynamic with his footwork and his.</v>

3406
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:32.030
<v Speaker 4>He kind of looked like dominick cruz </v>
<v Speaker 4>against other guys and look really well.</v>

3407
02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:37.180
<v Speaker 4>Dominick cruz goes out there and makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>him look like a very orthodox,</v>

3408
02:38:37.490 --> 02:38:39.260
<v Speaker 4>a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not,</v>

3409
02:38:39.261 --> 02:38:41.060
<v Speaker 4>he's not moving like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at times,</v>

3410
02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:46.120
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at times initially they came out and </v>

3411
02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:46.120
<v Speaker 4>they were both moving like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3412
02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:46.120
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is.</v>

3413
02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:50.590
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These guys are going to open up a worm </v>

3414
02:38:50.590 --> 02:38:52.780
<v Speaker 4>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be wild.</v>

3415
02:38:53.050 --> 02:38:58.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what a lot of us </v>

3416
02:38:58.050 --> 02:38:58.050
<v Speaker 4>expected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

3417
02:38:58.050 --> 02:38:58.580
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting that would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what uriah said about tj,</v>

3418
02:38:58.790 --> 02:39:03.790
<v Speaker 4>that he had a feeling that tj was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get emotional because tj is a super </v>

3419
02:39:03.790 --> 02:39:05.360
<v Speaker 4>competitive guy and he'd get really </v>
<v Speaker 4>geared up and you know,</v>

3420
02:39:06.050 --> 02:39:08.000
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was an interesting fight.</v>

3421
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Really interesting fight to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy that dominick cruz able to </v>

3422
02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:14.480
<v Speaker 4>come back having essentially only fought</v>
<v Speaker 4>once in four years.</v>

3423
02:39:14.481 --> 02:39:15.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3424
02:39:15.580 --> 02:39:17.150
<v Speaker 4>and when the title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like that.</v>

3425
02:39:17.151 --> 02:39:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3426
02:39:17.631 --> 02:39:20.480
<v Speaker 4>He's a different kind of animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a smart motherfucker to.</v>

3427
02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:21.960
<v Speaker 4>You talked to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3428
02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:23.960
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've known him since wec.</v>

3429
02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:29.260
<v Speaker 4>I listened to his analysis of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when he talks about like what </v>

3430
02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:33.580
<v Speaker 4>mistakes guys make and things guys are </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing right and correctly and what they </v>

3431
02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:36.581
<v Speaker 4>need to do and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize like he's operating on a </v>

3432
02:39:36.581 --> 02:39:36.581
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very high level,</v>

3433
02:39:36.581 --> 02:39:37.580
<v Speaker 4>very high level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

3434
02:39:37.850 --> 02:39:42.850
<v Speaker 4>And that's probably part of why he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to come back and compete at the </v>

3435
02:39:42.850 --> 02:39:44.090
<v Speaker 4>level that he did because he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3436
02:39:44.091 --> 02:39:46.850
<v Speaker 4>he was sitting there analyzing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3437
02:39:47.090 --> 02:39:48.260
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they talk about,</v>

3438
02:39:48.350 --> 02:39:51.440
<v Speaker 4>you can sit there and do repetitions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a kick or a technique,</v>

3439
02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:52.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 times,</v>

3440
02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:55.640
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost the same,</v>

3441
02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:00.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing neurologically to visualize </v>

3442
02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:04.601
<v Speaker 4>yourself doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say that that visual visual </v>

3443
02:40:04.601 --> 02:40:08.261
<v Speaker 4>training is a similar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very similar and almost as effective as </v>

3444
02:40:08.261 --> 02:40:08.430
<v Speaker 4>actually doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3445
02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:09.640
<v Speaker 4>So I wonder if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3446
02:40:09.970 --> 02:40:12.710
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if there's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a correlation there.</v>

3447
02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:14.060
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3448
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:19.100
<v Speaker 6>he's interesting in a way also because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he says that there's no such thing as </v>

3449
02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:20.820
<v Speaker 6>octagon rust like I asked him about and </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>

3450
02:40:20.821 --> 02:40:25.110
<v Speaker 6>it's not real octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's mental weakness if he believes that</v>

3451
02:40:25.111 --> 02:40:27.270
<v Speaker 6>it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when you watch the fight,</v>

3452
02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:28.530
<v Speaker 6>it certainly looked true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3453
02:40:28.531 --> 02:40:31.590
<v Speaker 6>he didn't look rusty at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just fucking kind of nuts.</v>

3454
02:40:32.390 --> 02:40:34.530
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's the thing.</v>

3455
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:37.890
<v Speaker 6>It's a belief thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not going to let that.</v>

3456
02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:40.170
<v Speaker 6>Not for one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One second.</v>

3457
02:40:40.171 --> 02:40:42.060
<v Speaker 6>Hinder him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>agree with carlos,</v>

3458
02:40:42.061 --> 02:40:45.000
<v Speaker 6>because in the absence of of actual </v>
<v Speaker 6>movement training,</v>

3459
02:40:45.001 --> 02:40:50.001
<v Speaker 6>due to his injury,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's very likely that it was tilled </v>

3460
02:40:50.001 --> 02:40:53.180
<v Speaker 6>visualizing everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's movements in therefore using his </v>

3461
02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:55.940
<v Speaker 6>brain to keep practicing the movements,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even though a body could not,</v>

3462
02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:57.940
<v Speaker 6>the body could not follow out that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3463
02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:03.120
<v Speaker 6>during that time you examine dominic's </v>
<v Speaker 6>footwork to examine guys that are </v>

3464
02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:03.150
<v Speaker 6>fighting.</v>

3465
02:41:03.170 --> 02:41:08.170
<v Speaker 6>Do you watch like different guys </v>
<v Speaker 6>movements and it's close to perfection </v>

3466
02:41:08.170 --> 02:41:11.550
<v Speaker 6>in easy using a particular technique.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3467
02:41:11.551 --> 02:41:16.551
<v Speaker 6>but also most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all about he's alertness and </v>

3468
02:41:16.591 --> 02:41:19.440
<v Speaker 6>responsiveness and timing that again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3469
02:41:19.441 --> 02:41:20.010
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3470
02:41:20.060 --> 02:41:20.580
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3471
02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:24.420
<v Speaker 6>it's not how much your body can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can do it,</v>

3472
02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:29.720
<v Speaker 6>how much your mind is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's able to operate your body to </v>

3473
02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:30.400
<v Speaker 6>achieve that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3474
02:41:30.450 --> 02:41:32.850
