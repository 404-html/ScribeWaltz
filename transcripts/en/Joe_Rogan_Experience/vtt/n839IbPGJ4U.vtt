<v Speaker 1>How odd.</v>

14
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are in jail for murder</v>

16
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very big.</v>

17
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do a your entire life</v>

18
00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that every time you</v>

19
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>murdered someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

20
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>You go to jail for life and people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of jail for murder.</v>

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems a little fucked up.</v>

22
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.070
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem a little far down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little fucked up to have to,</v>

23
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:58.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always imagine like,</v>

24
00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they go back to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hometown,</v>

25
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:02.920
<v Speaker 1>like where they murdered somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's always the fucked up part.</v>

26
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like going back to the place where</v>

27
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.420
<v Speaker 1>you're the town murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The in moment of just a freak out.</v>

29
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>You could change your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have just fucked and the other</v>

30
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>end of the person's life just isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>around anymore.</v>

31
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Just stops done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

32
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>the finality of it all.</v>

33
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.540
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little uncomfortable.</v>

35
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you a snapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you get snap.</v>

36
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as an opera Aria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super calm.</v>

37
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.211
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in like physical altercation</v>

39
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>time stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very aware of consequences.</v>

40
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>What if you were on like your 10th lift</v>
<v Speaker 1>of something,</v>

41
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>like an aggressive workout and you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>

42
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>You have all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>all your energy is just moving forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're lifting your kettle thing and</v>

44
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.370
<v Speaker 1>it's number 10 and someone just comes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like tells you your mom's stupid.</v>

45
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>I would be even less likely to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything because I'm already exerted.</v>

46
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of the body.</v>

47
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>This is a shitty theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no biology attached to it at all.</v>

48
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.710
<v Speaker 1>But I think the body is like a battery</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think almost like maybe a battery</v>

49
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>of a battery was a bucket and this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>can overflow.</v>

50
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what you get when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get road rage.</v>

51
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get people at snap for no reason.</v>

52
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I think they're already coming at you at</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eight.</v>

53
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.640
<v Speaker 1>They're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

54
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:20.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm Morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

55
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we meet each other at zero.</v>

56
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some people are meeting,</v>

57
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're already at six and they're just</v>

58
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 1>ready to snap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

59
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.810
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have let a little out of the</v>

60
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 1>starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little out in the car,</v>

61
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>a little out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 1>at home with the kids and then a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they wouldn't murder anybody at</v>

63
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people will say,</v>

64
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:38.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.440
<v Speaker 1>you just need to work on your breathing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well you need to work on your,</v>

66
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 1>your being present and you need to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindful.</v>

67
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think all those things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

68
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 1>But I really think that your body has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of requirements and I</v>

69
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:55.580
<v Speaker 1>think depending upon your stress level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those physical requirements might be</v>

70
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:02:56.481 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a job and your job is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some high accountant at some big</v>

72
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>firm and you're crunching numbers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking stressful as shit,</v>

73
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I feel like your body thinks that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is some physical danger involved.</v>

74
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think your body amps up for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when the physical danger</v>

75
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>doesn't come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's just fucking primed and</v>

76
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's nothing,</v>

77
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>there's no action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking action.</v>

78
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>This fucking duck got me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they start doing that shit.</v>

79
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you that get in their car and</v>

80
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:28.571
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

81
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in your car you're ramped up</v>

82
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>even more because in your car you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware that you have to be,</v>

83
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you have to be really acutely aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's around you.</v>

84
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to make sure that no one's</v>
<v Speaker 1>making any mistakes because you're all</v>

85
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>going 65 miles an hour and a little eric</v>
<v Speaker 1>and happened really quickly.</v>

86
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>So you're on edge already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're in your car,</v>

87
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.460
<v Speaker 1>even if you're calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

88
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>even if you're calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your car,</v>

89
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>your sensors are tuned in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're fucking paying attention,</v>

90
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're a healthy human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking left and looking in the</v>

91
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:57.011
<v Speaker 1>mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look in,</v>

92
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're checking and make sure that</v>

93
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You making sure that no one's doing</v>

94
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>anything stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you compound that with the</v>

95
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>stress of your daily life with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical release.</v>

96
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have animals.</v>

97
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 3>Casey now send anymore invading tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be fun though to have a</v>

98
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 3>buffalo chase you all day and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have,</v>

99
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 3>you would release the proper amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy given the threat.</v>

100
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 3>It would be a realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have a more realistic population.</v>

101
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

102
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 3>That would be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't like that though.</v>

103
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 3>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever anything like gets like too</v>

104
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:28.330

105
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Just kill them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

106

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

109
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's consequences.</v>

110
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotta go to work.</v>

111
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill it.</v>

112
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 3>That's a bigger problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went round in America.</v>

113
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they reintroduced wolves into America in</v>

114
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 3>the 1990s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's this giant debate whether or</v>

115
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 3>not wolves should be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

116
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where'd they do that?</v>

117
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

118
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I think they're bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to keep an eye on the</v>

119
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 3>fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

120
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 3>I get a lot of coyotes in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

121
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 3>in my neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of,</v>

122
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 3>kind of a lot of coyote neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super common all the time.</v>

123
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I had a biologist on who tracks coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what he does.</v>

124
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does track Iot is around Los Angeles</v>

125
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.011
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

126
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

127
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 3>So they were living in middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>downtown La and the most crowded area,</v>

128
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 3>they had a debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

129
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:20.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call my neighbor is my,</v>

130
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 3>not when there's a coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I see a coyote going up their</v>

131
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 3>driveway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

132
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.850
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a kid.</v>

133
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 3>And I had called them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody knocks on the door and</v>

134
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 3>asking for money for some organization</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everyone gives each other and alert,</v>

135
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't the coyotes or a proper</v>

136
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.280
<v Speaker 3>environmental la or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

137
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Those people just knocking on your door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

138
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave him money for bees one time they</v>

139
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 3>got me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got me all nervous about bees and</v>

140
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 3>saving the bees and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

141
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I gotta say I really went from like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

142
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm having coffee and a cigarette to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

143
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to save the bees now it's my</v>

144
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to solely do it</v>

145
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>does not also depend on like where your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head's right?</v>

146
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Like if</v>

147
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 4>your head is it a really good place and</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone knocks on the door and you don't</v>

148
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 4>know who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool.</v>

149
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.013
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hi.</v>

150
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.591
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hi,</v>

151
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 4>we're here to save chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

152
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

153
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you guys do?</v>

154
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 4>And then you start talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

155
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 4>if they can like within a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make you understand something you didn't</v>

156
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 4>understand before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

157
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I got to pay attention.</v>

158
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sucked me in because I wasn't aware</v>

159
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 4>of our bee situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

160
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 4>so they immediately hit you with some</v>
<v Speaker 4>facts and facts.</v>

161
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh boy.</v>

162
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are they going to save these bees?</v>

163
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me get with my,</v>

164
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:29.640
<v Speaker 4>with my $40.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think just here,</v>

165
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.200
<v Speaker 4>take this paper when just go handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

166
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.760
<v Speaker 4>go handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

167
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 4>If the bees die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're dead.</v>

168
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 4>We're all dead apparently except in</v>
<v Speaker 4>China.</v>

169
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:39.490
<v Speaker 4>They figured out a way to pollinate</v>
<v Speaker 4>things with uh,</v>

170
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 4>just a brush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an issue where they were</v>

171
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 4>really low on bees and they tried</v>
<v Speaker 4>reintroducing bees and it didn't take.</v>

172
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 4>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>last ditch effort was they took people</v>

173
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:54.011
<v Speaker 4>with a paintbrush and they dusted the</v>
<v Speaker 4>pollen on all these different plants.</v>

174
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 4>Like one at a time they pollen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they literally pollinated all these</v>

175
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 4>plants and apparently worked way better</v>
<v Speaker 4>because bees are sort of nonspecific.</v>

176
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 4>Like bees are just going over there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing their thing and they just</v>

177
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 4>get shit on their body and it transfers</v>
<v Speaker 4>over to the plants.</v>

178
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 4>It's really kind of fascinating how it</v>
<v Speaker 4>works,</v>

179
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 4>but these people did it very</v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically with a paintbrush.</v>

180
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 4>It was really interesting to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>b,</v>

181
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 4>it's job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The person who can find the video of it.</v>

182
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of fucking weird because like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could make the argument like we</v>

183
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 4>don't really need to beach once you want</v>
<v Speaker 4>honey,</v>

184
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 4>honey is not even really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

185
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 4>That was going through my head and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>they explained to me why we need bees,</v>

186
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 4>which I forgot but</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was enough.</v>

187
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 4>I had a guy come to me at whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is my most intrusive,</v>

188
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 4>I think the most intrusive is when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the parking lot at whole foods</v>

189
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 4>cause that's when they usually get ya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're walking out they try to get</v>

190
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:48.140
<v Speaker 4>you right as you're walking around it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking hot outside and you have like</v>

191
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.120

<v Speaker 4>creams.</v>

193
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 4>They know you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know you have a few bucks cause</v>

194
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 4>right now because of Amazon we want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that anymore.</v>

195
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 4>Amazon just bought whole foods so we'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>just just be able to one click your</v>

<v Speaker 4>they're allowed to have people.</v>

213
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:45.470
<v Speaker 4>This was a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>

214
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 4>I just still complain about it because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of a whiny bitch.</v>

215
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.240
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the deal is.</v>

216
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 4>Like are you allowed to just set up shop</v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere and put like one of those</v>

217
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 4>picnic stands and you know they</v>

218
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 3>have like one of those little plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>tables.</v>

219
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:01.710

<v Speaker 3>picture of a baby with a bloated belly</v>

<v Speaker 3>Pending apocalypse.</v>

223
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.140

<v Speaker 3>like some kids selling lemonade or</v>

224
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

226
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:19.380

<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are doing like an old time.</v>

229
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is not sustainable.</v>

230
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 3>This is not a real thing anybody does</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

231
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 3>You get a lemonade stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.800
<v Speaker 3>The hot dog place doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the biggest weird fucking event in</v>

<v Speaker 3>Better not by a lot of hot dogs.</v>

326
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have a rescue regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant and you have hot dogs as one</v>

327
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 3>of the offerings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how often do people,</v>

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 3>is it even won a 10 hot dog?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's like one of two options,</v>

329
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:39.310
<v Speaker 3>like at Burbank airport you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get a hot dog or like a packet</v>

330
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 3>pre packaged salad and occasionally I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

331
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want something fresh like a hot dog or</v>

332
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 3>a Turkey sandwich that's sort of moist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some weird way.</v>

333
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.680
<v Speaker 3>The bread's kind of what like fuck is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this right?</v>

334
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Wet bread in lieu of a Mayo or</v>
<v Speaker 3>condiments and of course it's sporting</v>

335
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:56.470
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The UFC,</v>

336
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 3>there was a hot dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hot dog at a sporting.</v>

337
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good food for a sporting event for,</v>

338
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:03.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's recreational food,</v>

339
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Picnics and barbecues.</v>

340
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

341
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.330
<v Speaker 3>Always hot dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

342
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.420
<v Speaker 3>It's a good move for a barbecue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's simple.</v>

343
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 3>You can't really fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it looks brown on the outside,</v>

344
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:15.600
<v Speaker 3>it's done right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could eat it raw.</v>

345
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need to be cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can eat it right out of the package.</v>

346
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.530
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good move for that.</v>

347
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 3>But somehow another pink's is convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just by cooking outside,</v>

348
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.270
<v Speaker 3>they just have a big open area where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooking right in front of you and</v>

349
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:28.951
<v Speaker 3>everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

350
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:33.490
<v Speaker 3>I wore lows and there's a fucking line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the line is why people go,</v>

351
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have to go for a line and the</v>

352
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:38.530
<v Speaker 3>line is outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see the line.</v>

353
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.340
<v Speaker 3>It's not like Astro Burger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 2:00 AM where you can't see the</v>

354
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The line is exciting.</v>

355
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:48.280
<v Speaker 3>It's what draws tourists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's Jamie Masada strategy.</v>

356
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.010
<v Speaker 3>See the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's always got that crazy line outside</v>

357
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.883
<v Speaker 3>the laugh factory</v>

358
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.080
<v Speaker 4>and he makes a comics wait in line too.</v>

359
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.410
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you don't know the hill a little</v>

360
00:14:58.411 --> 00:14:59.191
<v Speaker 5>while but no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

361
00:14:59.191 --> 00:15:00.210
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that</v>

362
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 4>they're open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike deals kind of nuts.</v>

363
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.150
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to get there at like nine</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning and you wait outside and</v>

364
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 4>if you leave you lose your spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to like have some sort of a</v>

365
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:09.674
<v Speaker 4>friendship with the other.</v>

366
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

367
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.820
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say the comedy store had it</v>

368
00:15:12.821 --> 00:15:14.370
<v Speaker 5>situated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the open mic when,</v>

369
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.450
<v Speaker 5>when I was started with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like 15 years ago,</v>

370
00:15:16.451 --> 00:15:17.284
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

371
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.480
<v Speaker 5>Bobby Lee was the host of the open mic</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he knew I had to,</v>

372
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.130
<v Speaker 5>I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in school and I was in class so I</v>

373
00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:28.150
<v Speaker 5>couldn't go all day and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he would slide my name into the open</v>

374
00:15:28.151 --> 00:15:29.980
<v Speaker 5>mic and I didn't get to come after</v>
<v Speaker 5>class.</v>

375
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.330
<v Speaker 4>That's sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was real cute.</v>

376
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.450
<v Speaker 4>Real cute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

377
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.830
<v Speaker 4>the open mics were always weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

378
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.370
<v Speaker 4>There are always weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in La they're extra weird cause</v>

379
00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 4>there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like if you can make it to be a</v>

380
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:45.220
<v Speaker 4>professional comedian and you started</v>
<v Speaker 4>out in La,</v>

381
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.020
<v Speaker 4>you're a rare person.</v>

382
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.871
<v Speaker 5>Well it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

383
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:49.940
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's 50,</v>

384
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 5>50 comedians and then just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

385
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 5>mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>transient also comedians,</v>

386
00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 5>but we're also committed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

387
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all,</v>

388
00:15:58.701 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just wait and you go,</v>

389
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be my friend.</v>

390
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 5>And then it's going to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy who has all of his belongings</v>

391
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:08.870
<v Speaker 5>with him and then it's going to be my</v>
<v Speaker 5>other friend and then it's going to be</v>

392
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:10.370
<v Speaker 5>that crazy lady and then will be me.</v>

393
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Can you just wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait and wait and wait and you just</v>

394
00:16:14.471 --> 00:16:19.471
<v Speaker 4>wonder what kind of fucking diseases are</v>
<v Speaker 4>just festering on that microphone and</v>

395
00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:22.360
<v Speaker 4>also just what's the point of this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I doing right,</v>

396
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.000
<v Speaker 4>especially in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

397
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.000
<v Speaker 4>To have vision and hope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what was your initial goal when he</v>

398
00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:29.050
<v Speaker 4>first started doing stand up?</v>

399
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.450
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the really simply like a,</v>

400
00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:34.240
<v Speaker 5>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew I liked writing a lot.</v>

401
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.890
<v Speaker 5>Like even before I started doing standup</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think stand up,</v>

402
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've tried to figure it out.</v>

403
00:16:39.821 --> 00:16:40.060
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

404
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.601
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

405
00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:43.750
<v Speaker 5>the easiest way to explain it I'd think</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that I just wanted to see if what I</v>

406
00:16:43.751 --> 00:16:48.130
<v Speaker 5>was writing was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's sort of why even when I</v>

407
00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:50.530
<v Speaker 5>started at me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm still dead pan obviously,</v>

408
00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:55.360
<v Speaker 5>but when I started I was so dry because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was essentially just reading out loud.</v>

409
00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.280
<v Speaker 5>These thoughts I have with no real</v>
<v Speaker 5>performance background and I wasn't,</v>

410
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily a performer at heart.</v>

411
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.320
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's just like reading one liners and</v>

412
00:17:05.321 --> 00:17:06.190
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this funny?</v>

413
00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 5>Is this funny?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this funny?</v>

414
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.860
<v Speaker 5>Get a laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keep it.</v>

415
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:09.970
<v Speaker 5>Don't get a laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>throw it away.</v>

416
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.320
<v Speaker 4>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you throw it away like you never know</v>

417
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:16.690
<v Speaker 4>sometimes is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it me?</v>

418
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.940
<v Speaker 4>Is it the way I'm delivering it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this joke?</v>

419
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Is it a good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's kind of,</v>

420
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 5>it's done wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

421
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.100
<v Speaker 5>And then at that time too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have the,</v>

422
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have the,</v>

423
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.740
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ability to perform at a hundred</v>

424
00:17:27.741 --> 00:17:29.170
<v Speaker 5>different places so you're not going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

425
00:17:29.171 --> 00:17:33.070
<v Speaker 5>It works in the alternative room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't work at the club or it's just</v>

426
00:17:33.071 --> 00:17:33.461
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

427
00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:36.430
<v Speaker 5>well it didn't work at the laundry mat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it worked at the coffee house.</v>

428
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.310
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what that means about this</v>
<v Speaker 5>joke.</v>

429
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.440
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like jokes,</v>

430
00:17:40.441 --> 00:17:43.350
<v Speaker 4>it'll work at the UCB,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they bomb on the store.</v>

431
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why,</v>

432
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.240
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why did that get an applause break</v>

433
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.760
<v Speaker 4>at the UCB?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just fuck it.</v>

434
00:17:49.761 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Stared</v>

435
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 3>at me in the main room</v>
<v Speaker 3>following rick and Grub,</v>

436
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:57.310
<v Speaker 3>they just stared at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes at UCB is hot.</v>

437
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's just anywhere that comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of your mouth.</v>

438
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then sometimes,</v>

439
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird place.</v>

440
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't pay too.</v>

441
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.200
<v Speaker 3>That's also super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

442
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I think if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

443
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.250
<v Speaker 3>I'd be a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

444
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.700
<v Speaker 3>less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might even that upset,</v>

445
00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 3>not upset about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I'd be less upset if I</v>

446
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:15.510
<v Speaker 3>was like involved in the school and</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that it's,</v>

447
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so kids can take classes at like a</v>

448
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.020
<v Speaker 3>decent rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

449
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what it's for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that kids can take really cheap</v>

450
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 3>classes there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what it sustains?</v>

451
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shows,</v>

452
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 3>what kind of classes do they have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like comedy classes,</v>

453
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Improv and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

454
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.700
<v Speaker 3>can you teach?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe you can teach improv.</v>

455
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe you can teach stand up?</v>

456
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe you can teach somebody.</v>

457
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can help somebody,</v>

458
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:43.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>encourage them to get on stage.</v>

459
00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think you can teach the the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to be funny.</v>

460
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what,</v>

461
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stand up in what capacity?</v>

462
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Like I guess you could teach somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

463
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 3>you can mold their thoughts into jokes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and help them and shove them on stage,</v>

464
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of comedian that makes.</v>

465
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like boy,</v>

466
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.070
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things where I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned a lot about it.</v>

467
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.820
<v Speaker 3>So I always wonder like maybe you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>teach something.</v>

468
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Cause I've definitely learned some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

469
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:14.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah mean people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

470
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I think there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you find out your favorite comedian,</v>

471
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sits down and writes an hour a day at a</v>

472
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.250
<v Speaker 3>starbucks or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

473
00:19:22.251 --> 00:19:23.160
<v Speaker 3>oh maybe I'll try that.</v>

474
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Like little tricks and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know.</v>

475
00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:29.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anyone who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

476
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.010
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I deeply,</v>

477
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:35.760
<v Speaker 3>deeply admire who had credit all their</v>
<v Speaker 3>success to their comedy classes?</v>

478
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.890
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's not enough classes.</v>

479
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 3>There'd be like a real poor focus group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know Ari did an interesting thing</v>

480
00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:47.811
<v Speaker 3>while back where he used to go to a town</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when he was doing stand up and like</v>

481
00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 3>he was headlining for the weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would go to a town and you would do</v>

482
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:53.640
<v Speaker 3>like a free seminar for the local</v>
<v Speaker 3>comics.</v>

483
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Tell them like desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a manager,</v>

484
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.670
<v Speaker 3>stop asking people to take you with them</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the road.</v>

485
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:03.150
<v Speaker 3>When you're two months into comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop asking you know,</v>

486
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.160
<v Speaker 3>managers to handle you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you just got to get good first and</v>

487
00:20:06.161 --> 00:20:10.200
<v Speaker 3>then give them all this advice about</v>
<v Speaker 3>like getting an agent and you know,</v>

488
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

489
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.071
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

490
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I went to Penn U Penn recently and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to uh,</v>

491
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:18.600
<v Speaker 3>some students and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't flake fancy myself,</v>

492
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:21.120
<v Speaker 3>like an instructor of any kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were asking me,</v>

493
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about comedy writing,</v>

494
00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 3>this is specifically in stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the advice I gave was very,</v>

495
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:29.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>practical and had nothing to do with the</v>

496
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:30.900
<v Speaker 3>craft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was just like,</v>

497
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.370
<v Speaker 3>don't be annoying in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

498
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

499
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 3>like in a TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it did it like in the writing for</v>

500
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:39.060
<v Speaker 3>like a TV show and like jokes don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

501
00:20:39.061 --> 00:20:40.110
<v Speaker 3>don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't work.</v>

502
00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:43.110
<v Speaker 3>That's not your job to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that kind of shit of just like how</v>

503
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 3>to get through the first year without</v>
<v Speaker 3>annoying everybody dies.</v>

504
00:20:46.171 --> 00:20:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Think that's not taught right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one ever does that.</v>

505
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 3>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like shut up is a great rule.</v>

506
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.340
<v Speaker 3>You can make big mistakes.</v>

507
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can be a person that nobody</v>

508
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 3>wants to work with you then it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter how talented you are.</v>

509
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole brighters oftentimes a</v>

510
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:03.250
<v Speaker 3>very awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

511
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 3>They can be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends.</v>

512
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Like the rooms are very split into when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got into like Sitcom stuff,</v>

513
00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 3>like it's just very split into um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very just internal,</v>

514
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of what you would typically think</v>

515
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 3>of as like a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a couple of comedians</v>

516
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:20.890
<v Speaker 3>sprinkled in there who kind of bounce</v>
<v Speaker 3>more jokes around.</v>

517
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:23.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just a win and people who are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at structure.</v>

518
00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

519
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are good at structure cause</v>

520
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they try to be funny sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

521
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:34.684
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you fight,</v>

522
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.130
<v Speaker 3>the thing I like about like those rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's so much fun to be in a</v>

523
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 3>room with Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you realize how that person can</v>

524
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 3>do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't and I can do a thing,</v>

525
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 3>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start to realize like,</v>

526
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 3>oh we could go into a room and get a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of work done together.</v>

527
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.460
<v Speaker 3>That is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

528
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:52.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like lining up the pieces and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter how much you want a square and a</v>

529
00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 3>circle the line up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

530
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.400
<v Speaker 3>they just don't seem to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you have like a writer's room</v>

531
00:21:57.401 --> 00:22:00.660
<v Speaker 3>or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a big part of it depends on just</v>

532
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 3>the fortunate chemistry of all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people coming to there.</v>

533
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that first day where you show up if</v>

534
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:09.430
<v Speaker 3>it's not your room and you haven't hired</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody and you don't know who's there</v>

535
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.870
<v Speaker 3>is a terrifying because you show up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

536
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within five minutes if this is going to</v>

537
00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 3>be a fun x number of months or if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>just going to be trudging through,</v>

538
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 3>what's the biggest shit show you ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to work on?</v>

539
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

540
00:22:23.941 --> 00:22:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had really like tremendously good</v>

541
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:30.220
<v Speaker 3>luck as far as like just working with</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and stuff on so many things.</v>

542
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:35.220
<v Speaker 3>But I worked on a award show once and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boss basically didn't let me write</v>

543
00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 3>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like didn't they needed to hire a woman?</v>

544
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:42.040
<v Speaker 3>And I guess I was recommended and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he just,</v>

545
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.851
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

546
00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I'll take a stab at these jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

547
00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:44.681
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

548
00:22:44.681 --> 00:22:45.514
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just write the,</v>

549
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.510
<v Speaker 3>the banter where it says like coming up</v>
<v Speaker 3>next is this person.</v>

550
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:51.130
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like anyone can do that.</v>

551
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Literally wouldn't allow me to write</v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes.</v>

552
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.300
<v Speaker 3>So he got hired as a joke writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once you got there,</v>

553
00:22:58.301 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 3>he just wanted you to write narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just banter.</v>

554
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:01.264
<v Speaker 3>It just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

555
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.140
<v Speaker 3>like is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

556
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.690
<v Speaker 3>from the hangover and please welcome</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

557
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 3>Deserves specific and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what they call it?</v>

558
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 3>They call it banter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're riding things?</v>

559
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

560
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like that in my 20s or run on a</v>

561
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 3>lot of award shows.</v>

562
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.950
<v Speaker 3>So there's like the jokes that</v>
<v Speaker 3>monologue,</v>

563
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:20.590
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's just the going out to</v>

564
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:22.870
<v Speaker 3>commercial and come back and all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff has to be written.</v>

565
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.600
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes they try to make it funny</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes they don't.</v>

566
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.120
<v Speaker 3>But you can take it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>break it up in terms of like,</v>

567
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:30.310
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the jokes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is the narrative.</v>

569
00:23:32.381 --> 00:23:34.060
<v Speaker 3>This is the structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a combination of like,</v>

580
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:53.810
<v Speaker 5>I read a lot of monologue jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's other guys who are better at</v>

581
00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 5>sketches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like light film sketches,</v>

582
00:23:55.911 --> 00:24:00.170
<v Speaker 5>tape pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's live comedy stuff on stage.</v>

583
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.490
<v Speaker 5>Then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

584
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.160
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the kind of a little more boring,</v>

585
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 5>like this next person a is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

586
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 5>two time mvp.</v>

587
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.260
<v Speaker 1>So why this guy hire you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really think he hard to just cause</v>

588
00:24:11.261 --> 00:24:12.250
<v Speaker 1>you needed a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

589
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

590
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he did.</v>

591
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.830
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

592
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.210
<v Speaker 5>I knew it all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew it all when it was happening.</v>

593
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

594
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.360
<v Speaker 5>that was willing to let you try.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

595
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.040
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's foolish.</v>

596
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:25.911
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

597
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 5>it was bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>

598
00:24:27.261 --> 00:24:29.420
<v Speaker 5>it was the only case of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

599
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

600
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 5>sexism that I think I've been confronted</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

601
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:33.891
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

602
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:36.050
<v Speaker 5>I guess lucky in 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel like I've,</v>

603
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had that and I was on,</v>

604
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:42.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean for years and years and years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd never worked with another woman.</v>

605
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:44.900
<v Speaker 5>I was the only girl and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everyone treated me great.</v>

606
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:48.680
<v Speaker 5>So it's a tougher road for comics to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>a woman.</v>

607
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

608
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so funny now.</v>

609
00:24:51.921 --> 00:24:55.010
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so hard to the landscape right now.</v>

610
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:59.210
<v Speaker 5>I think so many women are being given</v>
<v Speaker 5>chances that didn't even exist 10 years</v>

611
00:24:59.211 --> 00:24:59.940
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

612
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting to,</v>

613
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:03.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to see,</v>

614
00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 5>but I never had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

615
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:08.590
<v Speaker 5>I never had like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

616
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.090
<v Speaker 5>those kind of sexist roadblocks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that makes sense.</v>

617
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that like starting and</v>

618
00:25:14.141 --> 00:25:17.950
<v Speaker 1>developing as a female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more difficult just from my</v>

619
00:25:17.951 --> 00:25:21.370
<v Speaker 1>personal observations because men a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times don't want to laugh at women.</v>

620
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.940
<v Speaker 1>They definitely don't want to laugh at</v>
<v Speaker 1>women telling them things about like</v>

621
00:25:24.941 --> 00:25:26.990
<v Speaker 1>politics or world events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

622
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Like a woman that seems informed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for whatever reason they'll</v>

623
00:25:29.831 --> 00:25:32.320
<v Speaker 1>tolerate a guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a guy like Ron White,</v>

624
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Distinguished looking gentleman with</v>

625
00:25:33.971 --> 00:25:35.140
<v Speaker 1>silver hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

626
00:25:35.141 --> 00:25:38.350
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Ron's up there and he tells people</v>

627
00:25:38.351 --> 00:25:43.180
<v Speaker 1>something about some sort of a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people will sit back and listen.</v>

628
00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

629
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:49.230
<v Speaker 1>If a woman gets onstage and tells a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a group of men about a fact that it's</v>

630
00:25:50.411 --> 00:25:52.000
<v Speaker 1>very rare that they're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

631
00:25:52.001 --> 00:25:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing that what the fuck does</v>

632
00:25:53.921 --> 00:25:55.780
<v Speaker 1>this bitch now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

633
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that,</v>

634
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a roadblock.</v>

635
00:25:58.781 --> 00:26:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And then the other roadblock is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

636
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.410
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot like you can do sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes now.</v>

637
00:26:05.411 --> 00:26:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Sarah Silverman kind of broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that downward.</v>

638
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.890
<v Speaker 1>So much of her was just straight dirty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hilarious.</v>

639
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And then Amy Schumer of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the people,</v>

640
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're developing,</v>

641
00:26:16.781 --> 00:26:18.790
<v Speaker 1>when you're coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me starting out.</v>

642
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's more of a difficult</v>

643
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:26.170
<v Speaker 1>world to navigate then a guy telling sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

644
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:26.711
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

645
00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:27.780
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a difficult world.</v>

646
00:26:27.781 --> 00:26:29.370
<v Speaker 5>And it's also like socially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

647
00:26:29.371 --> 00:26:30.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

648
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.390
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the precarious,</v>

649
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.980
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting because what I realized</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was,</v>

650
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1920 was,</v>

651
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you like that,</v>

652
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 5>that aspect</v>

653
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.770
<v Speaker 3>of people like dating in the scene and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that kind of stuff.</v>

654
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:51.771
<v Speaker 3>All that happened too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've found that if a woman who was</v>

655
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:56.070
<v Speaker 3>new ish around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my level of time was dating</v>

656
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:59.070
<v Speaker 3>somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were automatically looked at as</v>

657
00:26:59.071 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 3>like a comedy groupie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the thing that didn't apply</v>

658
00:27:02.251 --> 00:27:04.230
<v Speaker 3>to men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the one part where I was like,</v>

659
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:06.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't quite get that guy.</v>

660
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Not totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I've seen some guys that are</v>

661
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 3>dating like famous women and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like underlying sort of men</v>

662
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.220
<v Speaker 3>shored up comics and everybody treats</v>
<v Speaker 3>them like they're a comedy group.</v>

663
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I found her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw that a lot when I was,</v>

664
00:27:19.891 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 3>when I was younger that the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it just,</v>

665
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see men getting tagged with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

666
00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that label and that,</v>

667
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 3>but that I was so scared and paranoid of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

668
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so scared of being considered</v>

669
00:27:32.581 --> 00:27:36.330
<v Speaker 3>anything other than a comedian that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for years and years.</v>

670
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Didn't date anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

671
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in comedy at all because I was worried</v>

672
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 3>that if I showed up to a show with a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

673
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially it was more successful than</v>

674
00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the first thought would be she's</v>

675
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:52.980
<v Speaker 3>the girl who's with that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not she's the girl who's going up next,</v>

676
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.340
<v Speaker 3>not just dod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's with that God because of this.</v>

677
00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.090
<v Speaker 3>She thinks always going to be the path</v>
<v Speaker 3>when in fact there's a lot of people who</v>

678
00:28:00.091 --> 00:28:02.830
<v Speaker 3>have legitimate relationships that where</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the path that just you need</v>

679
00:28:02.831 --> 00:28:04.740
<v Speaker 3>to treat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're attracted to somebody and you</v>

680
00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:05.574
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually I,</v>

681
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made my way through a few people.</v>

682
00:28:07.741 --> 00:28:10.410
<v Speaker 3>It's just another prejudiced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of those things.</v>

683
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Another prejudice that you have to sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of overcome.</v>

684
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you'll actually liked someone and</v>

685
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:18.000
<v Speaker 3>they happen to be comic though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do you do?</v>

686
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 3>Like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like someone and they happen to</v>

687
00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:22.590
<v Speaker 3>be some big time comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what are you supposed to do?</v>

688
00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Not like them now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

689
00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 3>you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like them.</v>

690
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.510
<v Speaker 3>That's stupid too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is stupid.</v>

691
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:28.740
<v Speaker 3>But I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a,</v>

692
00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 3>I was terrified of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

693
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.663
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

694
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it was very eager to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

695
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.360
<v Speaker 3>to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Impress.</v>

696
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very eager to prove myself.</v>

697
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:43.200
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that is partly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

698
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.140
<v Speaker 3>being a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

699
00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:50.141
<v Speaker 3>as much as I didn't find it harder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did find myself wanting to prove any</v>

700
00:28:51.301 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 3>stereotype that anyone might have about</v>
<v Speaker 3>me wrong.</v>

701
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel as much of that as like a</v>

702
00:28:56.851 --> 00:28:59.100
<v Speaker 3>mission anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just who I am.</v>

703
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 3>But I think you have a lot wrapped into</v>
<v Speaker 3>your head when you're young end.</v>

704
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really aren't stable as far as like</v>

705
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:06.811
<v Speaker 3>financial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not,</v>

706
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:09.440
<v Speaker 3>you're really not a real professional</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore or yet.</v>

707
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once you become one lins,</v>

708
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:12.980
<v Speaker 3>once you're established in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>

709
00:29:12.981 --> 00:29:14.490
<v Speaker 3>knew after a while it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I,</v>

710
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.890
<v Speaker 3>what am I wasting my time and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about this shit for.</v>

711
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.400
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's harder for chicks to</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop,</v>

712
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.760
<v Speaker 3>but I think once they become good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they get out there,</v>

713
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a lower bar.</v>

714
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

715
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:36.770
<v Speaker 3>I think the bar is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the bar is the same height,</v>

716
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for most good people.</v>

717
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 3>And then there's like another bar that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher for the great,</v>

718
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.930
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think like,</v>

719
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the bar is lower for</v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

720
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:52.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it's lower for people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as famous,</v>

721
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 3>not as successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as established,</v>

722
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:58.260
<v Speaker 3>not as good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if that,</v>

723
00:29:58.261 --> 00:29:59.130
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

724
00:29:59.131 --> 00:29:59.941
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

725
00:29:59.941 --> 00:30:01.710
<v Speaker 3>I think the bar is the same for men and</v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

726
00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a code.</v>

727
00:30:03.661 --> 00:30:04.770
<v Speaker 3>There's a few different bars.</v>

728
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.850
<v Speaker 4>What I mean by that is that I think that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

729
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.390
<v Speaker 4>it's easier to get a lot of attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

730
00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.700
<v Speaker 4>early on if you're good and you're a</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman because there's not that many of</v>

731
00:30:16.701 --> 00:30:17.360
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

732
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:17.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

733
00:30:17.781 --> 00:30:18.531
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

734
00:30:18.531 --> 00:30:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would apply that to any person whose</v>

735
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.810
<v Speaker 3>something that is rare in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a specific little finality.</v>

736
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.100
<v Speaker 3>But then you have to prove yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You always have to prove yourself.</v>

737
00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:33.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I dunno,</v>

738
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.150
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see comedy too in these,</v>

739
00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.820
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different factions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mean there's people who are so great at</v>

740
00:30:37.821 --> 00:30:41.900
<v Speaker 3>standup and then as a writer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who tries to make like,</v>

741
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>projects and wrap them around people.</v>

742
00:30:44.391 --> 00:30:47.510
<v Speaker 3>I also see so many people who I though</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not my favorite stand up.</v>

743
00:30:47.511 --> 00:30:49.730
<v Speaker 3>That's not a great standup in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

744
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.010
<v Speaker 3>But that's somebody I would love to</v>
<v Speaker 3>write for that.</v>

745
00:30:52.011 --> 00:30:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Somebody I'd love to put in a show like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I see all these like columns of</v>

746
00:30:55.821 --> 00:30:58.280
<v Speaker 3>comedians and I judged people</v>
<v Speaker 3>accordingly.</v>

747
00:30:58.281 --> 00:31:01.280
<v Speaker 3>And I think there are legitimately</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians who are not like,</v>

748
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.950
<v Speaker 3>they're never going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

749
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:05.960
<v Speaker 3>prior a Carlin or Louie or anybody like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

750
00:31:05.961 --> 00:31:06.920
<v Speaker 3>But you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

751
00:31:06.921 --> 00:31:09.200
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would put them in a hundred tv shows</v>

752
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.900
<v Speaker 3>as a funny person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

753
00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.210
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tend to like look at it from that</v>

754
00:31:14.211 --> 00:31:15.680
<v Speaker 3>perspective too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I see,</v>

755
00:31:15.681 --> 00:31:20.360
<v Speaker 3>I see the potential almost in spite of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the materials sometimes.</v>

756
00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely that,</v>

757
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's also like the difference</v>

758
00:31:24.121 --> 00:31:28.020
<v Speaker 4>between those guys and the guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>in like funny movies like Adam Sandler</v>

759
00:31:28.021 --> 00:31:29.160
<v Speaker 4>type movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sure.</v>

760
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.550
<v Speaker 4>It's got a gang of those guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>always in those movies and they might</v>

761
00:31:32.551 --> 00:31:35.670
<v Speaker 4>not necessarily be the best standups are</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kind of guys you want to see.</v>

762
00:31:35.671 --> 00:31:37.440
<v Speaker 4>But they're great in those movies.</v>

763
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:38.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

764
00:31:38.341 --> 00:31:39.570
<v Speaker 3>and then it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

765
00:31:39.571 --> 00:31:40.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

766
00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:41.670
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know in that,</v>

767
00:31:41.671 --> 00:31:43.890
<v Speaker 3>in that group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my favorite standup is probably</v>

768
00:31:43.891 --> 00:31:46.590
<v Speaker 3>norm who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I went to go see the,</v>

769
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.460
<v Speaker 3>they did a netflix movie and then I like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tour with all the actor,</v>

770
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the comedians from it and it couldn't</v>

771
00:31:51.811 --> 00:31:54.210
<v Speaker 3>have been a bit different group of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedians and you go,</v>

772
00:31:54.211 --> 00:31:55.020
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well norms.</v>

773
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.240
<v Speaker 3>My favorite stand up there and I go is</v>
<v Speaker 3>norm,</v>

774
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be the lead of like,</v>

775
00:32:00.691 --> 00:32:01.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

776
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam Sandler movie?</v>

777
00:32:02.101 --> 00:32:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's the person I would go to.</v>

778
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Any theater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any room,</v>

779
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.110
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

780
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.430
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

781
00:32:08.431 --> 00:32:10.350
<v Speaker 3>a coffee house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is to go see.</v>

782
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

783
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.650
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things I guess</v>

784
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.100
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

785
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.430
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at,</v>

786
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.430
<v Speaker 4>you look at things in categories like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that Kevin Hart does his own</v>

787
00:32:19.431 --> 00:32:21.170
<v Speaker 4>standup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also know that he does movies</v>

788
00:32:21.171 --> 00:32:22.070
<v Speaker 4>where the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

789
00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 4>the lines and I'm sure you helps make</v>
<v Speaker 4>them funnier and all that stuff.</v>

790
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:27.920
<v Speaker 4>And he's reading a script essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

791
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 4>And then there's people that go on stage</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing stand up and you,</v>

792
00:32:34.371 --> 00:32:35.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you could be like,</v>

793
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could be like a really</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing performer and just have some</v>

794
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.160
<v Speaker 1>wizards behind the scenes that right for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you could make a fucking</v>

795
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.150
<v Speaker 1>incredible standup act.</v>

796
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:47.701
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

797
00:32:47.701 --> 00:32:49.370
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that stuff's so interesting.</v>

798
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a very specific,</v>

799
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:53.000
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

800
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:54.800
<v Speaker 5>if I was the boil down the standup that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

801
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:55.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

802
00:32:55.321 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 5>the standup comedy that I love and</v>
<v Speaker 5>respect the most,</v>

803
00:32:58.131 --> 00:33:01.400
<v Speaker 5>it has nothing to do with TV and has</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing to do with</v>

804
00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.700
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just comedians,</v>

805
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.750
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who they are on stage.</v>

806
00:33:04.751 --> 00:33:06.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

807
00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.670
<v Speaker 1>that's how I judge who I love and don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

808
00:33:09.671 --> 00:33:10.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

809
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.360
<v Speaker 1>as a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's</v>

810
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.600
<v Speaker 5>so many other factors in show business</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you have to sort of take into</v>

811
00:33:15.601 --> 00:33:16.740
<v Speaker 5>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

812
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.110
<v Speaker 5>we like a lot of people who are very</v>
<v Speaker 5>famous,</v>

813
00:33:19.111 --> 00:33:19.944
<v Speaker 5>who might not be</v>

814
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.860
<v Speaker 1>the very best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know them the most.</v>

815
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:24.761
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

816
00:33:24.761 --> 00:33:26.380
<v Speaker 1>what I was going to say is that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

817
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.500
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing standup though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever weird reason,</v>

818
00:33:29.501 --> 00:33:34.480
<v Speaker 1>the people that we all love the most are</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost always people that like right for</v>

819
00:33:34.481 --> 00:33:35.320
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

820
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's very difficult to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say you're not going to get bill</v>

821
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:43.810
<v Speaker 1>burr to write for some ca creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say FCA,</v>

822
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:45.670
<v Speaker 1>how's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking comic.</v>

823
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:50.170
<v Speaker 1>He's got perfect cheek bones and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a great way of delivering jokes,</v>

824
00:33:50.171 --> 00:33:52.330
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not capable of writing.</v>

825
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.170
<v Speaker 1>They're the right level of material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the problems is a guy like</v>

826
00:33:56.171 --> 00:33:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Bert rights for his own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

827
00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Rights for his own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure he could write for that</v>

828
00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:02.500
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not going to get the best</v>

829
00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:03.221
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

830
00:34:03.221 --> 00:34:04.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to be the same.</v>

831
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.291
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

832
00:34:05.291 --> 00:34:06.124
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

833
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:07.480
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never,</v>

834
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.320
<v Speaker 5>I think we've all taken like a tag or a</v>
<v Speaker 5>segway or something where a friend goes,</v>

835
00:34:11.321 --> 00:34:12.940
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>add this to your joke and you feel like</v>

836
00:34:12.941 --> 00:34:15.130
<v Speaker 5>you already wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I look at three year fight with</v>

837
00:34:15.131 --> 00:34:18.130
<v Speaker 5>somebody in my twenties of her who wrote</v>
<v Speaker 5>a joke and I thought he did and he said</v>

838
00:34:18.131 --> 00:34:22.090
<v Speaker 5>I did in the car and I refuse to do it</v>
<v Speaker 5>until he convinced me that I came up</v>

839
00:34:22.091 --> 00:34:24.580
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause I was so paranoid about doing a</v>

840
00:34:24.581 --> 00:34:27.490
<v Speaker 5>joke that I thought somebody else wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

841
00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:28.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the thing too is that</v>

842
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 1>there's some material that's so funny.</v>

843
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:33.980
<v Speaker 5>Fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I watch it and I go,</v>

844
00:34:33.981 --> 00:34:37.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to make that a show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And maybe it doesn't even,</v>

845
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.930
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's not even supposed to be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>

846
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.450
<v Speaker 5>but like someone like Louie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

847
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean a repeat it and he says he's my</v>
<v Speaker 5>favorite.</v>

848
00:34:44.271 --> 00:34:45.104
<v Speaker 5>But like</v>

849
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I could have never written Louis show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis had to write Louis show.</v>

850
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of comedians where I</v>

851
00:34:50.711 --> 00:34:52.120
<v Speaker 1>watched some and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I know,</v>

852
00:34:52.121 --> 00:34:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I know what I know what they're showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you how to figure that out though.</v>

853
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll absolutely like you Louie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that show on Hbo.</v>

854
00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with them after it</v>

855
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.320
<v Speaker 1>was canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the Improv and the first thing he</v>

856
00:35:02.321 --> 00:35:03.101
<v Speaker 1>said is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

857
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I should have written it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have fired everybody.</v>

858
00:35:04.931 --> 00:35:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just written it.</v>

859
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.810
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the problem,</v>

860
00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:10.480
<v Speaker 1>a big part of it is just you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all these people's visions and</v>

861
00:35:10.481 --> 00:35:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to get yours through and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like yours might not necessarily be</v>

862
00:35:14.231 --> 00:35:17.230
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is it's yours.</v>

863
00:35:17.231 --> 00:35:19.630
<v Speaker 1>And in order for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the thing to be the thing that</v>

864
00:35:19.631 --> 00:35:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you're happy with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just like your act,</v>

865
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.250
<v Speaker 1>it kind of has to come through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like Save,</v>

866
00:35:24.251 --> 00:35:25.780
<v Speaker 1>you were going to do a Netflix special</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they said,</v>

867
00:35:25.781 --> 00:35:27.100
<v Speaker 1>look Morgan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think you're hilarious.</v>

868
00:35:27.101 --> 00:35:28.810
<v Speaker 1>We love to do a Netflix special with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

869
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:33.990
<v Speaker 1>But what we'd like to do is assign a</v>
<v Speaker 1>team of executive producers and writers</v>

870
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.340
<v Speaker 1>and with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do is they're going to</v>

871
00:35:36.341 --> 00:35:37.260
<v Speaker 1>change your look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

872
00:35:37.261 --> 00:35:38.470
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go with a goth</v>

873
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.440
<v Speaker 3>theme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to put black lipstick on you</v>

874
00:35:41.441 --> 00:35:43.190
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're gonna just w yeah.</v>

875
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come up with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nutty thing that they decided to</v>

876
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:48.690
<v Speaker 3>do and then change the way you deliver</v>
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

877
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:49.930
<v Speaker 3>It would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

878
00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.220
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

879
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.090
<v Speaker 3>I think that's kind of how Louis felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was doing a show.</v>

880
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these other voices,</v>

881
00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.700
<v Speaker 3>maybe not as retarded as a golf vampire</v>
<v Speaker 3>black lipstick I get.</v>

882
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.820
<v Speaker 3>So like I get so passionate about about</v>
<v Speaker 3>making things like other people's</v>

883
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:11.010
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just get excited.</v>

884
00:36:11.011 --> 00:36:12.270
<v Speaker 3>I see somebody on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

885
00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

886
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 3>like my job right now is just to develop</v>
<v Speaker 3>tv stuff and does it ever fucking</v>

887
00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number two stand up to still stan hope.</v>

888
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going on tour for two weeks on a</v>

889
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.873
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday.</v>

890
00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he continues and I have to come</v>

891
00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 3>back for some writing shit and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I get,</v>

892
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as passionate as I get about standup,</v>

893
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 3>I get so fucking into the idea of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing somebody go up,</v>

894
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:41.270
<v Speaker 3>seen the show that they could have and</v>
<v Speaker 3>also wanting them to love it because I'm</v>

895
00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:43.591
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

896
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:43.831
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

897
00:36:43.831 --> 00:36:47.460
<v Speaker 3>I get you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to write anything that you</v>

898
00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 3>would say that you wouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you want to be as the writer.</v>

899
00:36:50.731 --> 00:36:54.330
<v Speaker 3>On the other side of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the person who is sometimes hired to</v>

900
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.390
<v Speaker 3>take a comedian and like get a show out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

901
00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Like I liked to hope and think that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a perspective that someone who's</v>

902
00:37:03.091 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 3>not in standup maybe wouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm like,</v>

903
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched this person so long,</v>

904
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:11.340
<v Speaker 3>I know their voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what they're commenting on,</v>

905
00:37:11.341 --> 00:37:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I know the way they're commenting on it.</v>

906
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.930
<v Speaker 3>And I hope that if I write a script for</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they read it,</v>

907
00:37:15.931 --> 00:37:16.711
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

908
00:37:16.711 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 3>this isn't me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

909
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'd,</v>

910
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.080
<v Speaker 3>maybe it goes back to like wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>and press or wanting,</v>

911
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be seen as legitimate,</v>

912
00:37:24.271 --> 00:37:27.300
<v Speaker 3>but I would never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never hand somebody something if</v>

913
00:37:27.301 --> 00:37:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I thought that it was remotely</v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassing her against their,</v>

914
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people will.</v>

915
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.811
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

916
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:35.880
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it to be an interesting sort of</v>

917
00:37:35.881 --> 00:37:37.440
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

918
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 3>and like when you're hired to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop shows is all this shit they</v>

919
00:37:41.101 --> 00:37:42.450

<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

946
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.460
<v Speaker 4>It actually is like mildly embarrassing</v>
<v Speaker 4>to passionately talk about,</v>

947

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people are gonna think of stupid</v>

1095
00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 5>That's when I started smoking during the</v>

<v Speaker 3>A very important point I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make,</v>

1161
00:46:50.931 --> 00:46:51.764
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.480
<v Speaker 3>You also know you're not getting that</v>
<v Speaker 3>joint till the end of the point.</v>

1163
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:57.620
<v Speaker 3>And you have to sit there like fixated</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dog waiting for a treat,</v>

1164
00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.710
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1165
00:47:00.711 --> 00:47:01.430
<v Speaker 3>I moved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1166
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:05.900
<v Speaker 3>I lived with my mom until I was like pho</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 1415.</v>

1167
00:47:05.901 --> 00:47:08.720
<v Speaker 3>And then I lived with her sister and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived with my dad's sister and I live</v>

1168
00:47:08.721 --> 00:47:11.900
<v Speaker 3>with some family friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live with my dad for the first time</v>

1169
00:47:11.901 --> 00:47:14.480
<v Speaker 3>when I was like 17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just bounced around La,</v>

1170
00:47:14.481 --> 00:47:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oregon to use us and a,</v>

1171
00:47:17.121 --> 00:47:18.140
<v Speaker 3>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1172
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:21.230
<v Speaker 3>just brutally depressed and couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1173
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously there were big</v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental factors,</v>

1174
00:47:23.991 --> 00:47:25.960
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

1175
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.390
<v Speaker 3>it was a more than more than therapy</v>
<v Speaker 3>institute.</v>

1176
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Your life was</v>

1177
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.950
<v Speaker 1>the plot of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twilight never saw it.</v>

1178
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Should I see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1179
00:47:34.841 --> 00:47:36.490
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's classic.</v>

1180
00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.080
<v Speaker 1>It is a classic now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1181
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Twilight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twilight is a movie that was fucking</v>

1182
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:43.960
<v Speaker 1>massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1183
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now never discussed.</v>

1184
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Never discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not discussed at all.</v>

1185
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Like people will talk about star wars to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of fucking time.</v>

1186
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to talk about twilight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a couple of years.</v>

1187
00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not going to,</v>

1188
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.500

<v Speaker 1>where all the girls who watch it when</v>

1193
00:48:11.171 --> 00:48:12.850

<v Speaker 1>it's about a Gar and his daughter</v>

1211
00:48:52.251 --> 00:48:54.210
<v Speaker 1>becomes a Zombie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves his daughter,</v>

1212
00:48:54.211 --> 00:48:55.920
<v Speaker 1>but chooses homepage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

1213
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.460
<v Speaker 1>There's an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>

1214
00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:00.170
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was always a sad,</v>

1215
00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:03.930
<v Speaker 5>it's the saddest part of a walking dead</v>
<v Speaker 5>was when you realize like someone had</v>

1216
00:49:03.931 --> 00:49:07.710
<v Speaker 5>like their daughter chained up in a room</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he couldn't bring himself to,</v>

1217
00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:09.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put a spike through her head.</v>

1218
00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:12.120
<v Speaker 5>So they just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just kept the Zombie daughter.</v>

1219
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Oof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's fucked up?</v>

1220
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:22.420
<v Speaker 1>That is not entirely impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely impossible that the bodies</v>

1221
00:49:22.421 --> 00:49:25.850
<v Speaker 1>would stay active like long after</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're deteriorating minutes.</v>

1222
00:49:25.851 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 1>She has been going on for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These zombies have been alive,</v>

1223
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:30.010
<v Speaker 1>eating nothing for your no digestive</v>
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>

1224
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another flush stays on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bones.</v>

1225
00:49:32.411 --> 00:49:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Their tissue allows the body to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>

1226
00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:35.410
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1227
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.650
<v Speaker 1>That they even have anything in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain at all that allows them to keep</v>

1228
00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:41.950
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like a disease that</v>

1229
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 1>changes the host and makes the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>supervise,</v>

1230
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.290
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking rabies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rabies on steroids.</v>

1231
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Very possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very possible with you all the horrible</v>

1232
00:49:50.831 --> 00:49:54.120
<v Speaker 1>things that happened double like all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different animals in terms of like</v>

1233
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:57.170
<v Speaker 1>parasites getting their system and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced them to commit suicide and all</v>

1234
00:49:57.171 --> 00:49:59.030
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen that aquatic worms one,</v>

1235
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.490
<v Speaker 1>it gets it to a grasshopper and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk the grasshopper and a jumping into</v>

1236
00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:05.920
<v Speaker 1>water and drowning so it could pop out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its body.</v>

1237
00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:10.840
<v Speaker 1>No develops in its body and then like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alien and the movie alien,</v>

1238
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:15.220
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] side of the chest literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>rips out of the things body in the water</v>

1239
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:19.600
<v Speaker 1>and then that's how it gets born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it gets into the grasshoppers body</v>

1240
00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:24.650
<v Speaker 1>and then rewires the grasshoppers brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's time to hatch and convinces</v>

1241
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 1>this fuck to jump into the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the beauty of childbirth.</v>

1242
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.710
<v Speaker 1>It's walnut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can live,</v>

1243
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 1>you can make a bunch of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the Duggar's,</v>

1244
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:36.170
<v Speaker 1>well they have like 20 they're not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single time they'd been drowned,</v>

1245
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:39.290
<v Speaker 1>but if you stop and think about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>being real,</v>

1246
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:44.291
<v Speaker 1>like how weird is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of a person becoming a Zombie,</v>

1247
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's not weird at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1248
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Are you becoming some super hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive thing like a rabid dog that's</v>

1249
00:50:50.301 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not looking at this thing come out</v>

1250
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:55.690
<v Speaker 1>of its body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it grabs a out of money.</v>

1251
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.440

<v Speaker 1>this is horrific.</v>

1252
00:50:57.470 --> 00:51:01.940
<v Speaker 1>It's shooting and the grasshoppers just</v>
<v Speaker 1>gutted and this thing now is swimming</v>

1253
00:51:01.941 --> 00:51:04.490
<v Speaker 1>around in the water and there's a ton of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't recommend it enough.</v>

1274
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I always kind of knew there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of rats in New York.</v>

1275
00:52:11.121 --> 00:52:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was here the numbers.</v>

1276
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:15.710
<v Speaker 1>But when you see like guys who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>exterminators are people who work with</v>

1277
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:20.090
<v Speaker 1>rats and they go down in the basement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there is an underbelly to New</v>

1278
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:25.090
<v Speaker 1>York City and a lot of other cities to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles for sure where swarms of</v>

1279
00:52:25.501 --> 00:52:30.501
<v Speaker 1>rodents are underneath the city swarms</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than there are people probably that</v>

1280
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.780
<v Speaker 1>there's no way for them to count.</v>

1281
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:35.900
<v Speaker 1>They do rough estimates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really have no idea.</v>

1282
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.500
<v Speaker 1>But you see them everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got cameras that are dipped into</v>

1283
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:42.920
<v Speaker 1>probes and they're smart as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of them are this Bot fly and</v>

1284
00:52:42.921 --> 00:52:44.720
<v Speaker 1>they pulled this bot fly out of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

1285
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:47.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you were carrying a</v>
<v Speaker 1>football and one of your tits,</v>

1286
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:50.270
<v Speaker 1>like literally just the pull this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of its body.</v>

1287
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:51.770
<v Speaker 1>It pulled it out of its neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

1288
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:55.190
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like as big as its neck almost.</v>

1289
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

1290
00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.131
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

1291
00:52:58.131 --> 00:53:01.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm a real a morel pussy when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bugs and you should be,</v>

1292
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:02.960
<v Speaker 3>they're terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the worst.</v>

1293
00:53:02.961 --> 00:53:06.230
<v Speaker 3>I saw a spider a in Arizona last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1294
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was half my fist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1295
00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I had a exos shell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a skit.</v>

1296
00:53:11.061 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Like it didn't look like it was wearing</v>
<v Speaker 3>armor.</v>

1297
00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind was it?</v>

1298
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dead stupid now.</v>

1299
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Just swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kill it.</v>

1300
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.300
<v Speaker 3>If you strongly you can't hang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>

1301
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:22.080
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm not going to go to bed with a</v>

1302
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.560
<v Speaker 3>without their living with a bug</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in house.</v>

1303
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

1304
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of weird shit and Doug's</v>
<v Speaker 4>area and die</v>

1305
00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 4>over a busy area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just right next to Mexico.</v>

1306
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 4>It's like knocking on Mexico's door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can run to Mexico.</v>

1307
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Like literally trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those spiders had papers,</v>

1308
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 4>Bill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Bill.</v>

1309
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:52.500
<v Speaker 4>Well just let the Mexicans then just</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody relax.</v>

1310
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.080
<v Speaker 4>That's a terrifying when you'd leave his</v>
<v Speaker 4>area and they uh,</v>

1311
00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.610
<v Speaker 4>you got to pull over and stop and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>ask you if you're a Mac,</v>

1312
00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.640
<v Speaker 4>if you're an American citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1313
00:53:59.641 --> 00:54:00.990
<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you go,</v>

1314
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:04.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a dude who has a ranch and it's</v>

1315
00:54:04.891 --> 00:54:09.891
<v Speaker 4>in south Texas and they find dead people</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the ranch sometimes where people</v>

1316
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:13.350
<v Speaker 4>tried to cross paths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just die of dehydration.</v>

1317
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Out in the desert.</v>

1318
00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.390
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>

1319
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:21.470
<v Speaker 4>that's a hard way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then these ranchers just find them,</v>

1320
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:23.103
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1321
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:26.010
<v Speaker 4>scary shit and you don't know who did</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1322
00:54:26.011 --> 00:54:28.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean the other thing is like if for</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and his,</v>

1323
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.730
<v Speaker 4>his place like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1324
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.660
<v Speaker 4>you don't know if this guy's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>a nice guy just trying to come over here</v>

1325
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:36.120
<v Speaker 4>and get a job or if this guy's a drug</v>
<v Speaker 4>runner and a murderer,</v>

1326
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:40.200
<v Speaker 4>like you really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just know there's a person in your</v>

1327
00:54:40.201 --> 00:54:43.080
<v Speaker 4>ranch that's not supposed to be there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they might not even speak English</v>

1328
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:43.973
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

1329
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.160
<v Speaker 4>Trying to think of something I would die</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to.</v>

1330
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.810
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people get mad at me when I say</v>

1331
00:54:51.811 --> 00:54:52.740
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm gonna say it anyway.</v>

1332
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.350
<v Speaker 4>I think it's something that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go away.</v>

1333
00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:57.420
<v Speaker 4>The idea of countries and you can only</v>
<v Speaker 4>go one place,</v>

1334
00:54:57.421 --> 00:54:59.040
<v Speaker 4>like if you're born on this patch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>dirt,</v>

1335
00:54:59.041 --> 00:55:00.360
<v Speaker 4>you can only stay in this patch of dirt.</v>

1336
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:04.170
<v Speaker 4>It's an impediment to progress and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>an impediment to quality.</v>

1337
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.170
<v Speaker 4>And I think that we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna come a day where people</v>

1338
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:10.200
<v Speaker 4>are just gonna be able to travel</v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere they want and we're not going</v>

1339
00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:13.470
<v Speaker 4>to look at it like cities and we're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to look at it like in terms of</v>

1340
00:55:13.471 --> 00:55:13.861
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1341
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:16.710
<v Speaker 4>you're lucky if you live in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can move to Cleveland.</v>

1342
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:18.540
<v Speaker 4>If you live in Cleveland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can move to Miami,</v>

1343
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.310
<v Speaker 4>but you can move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can move wherever you want,</v>

1344
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.590
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as you have a country you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't move.</v>

1345
00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:24.900
<v Speaker 4>You have to paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to get it approved.</v>

1346
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:26.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of job do you have,</v>

1347
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:27.001
<v Speaker 4>Morgan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you,</v>

1348
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:27.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1349
00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:31.590
<v Speaker 4>you have a specific skill that would</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit America and extent of the rest</v>

1350
00:55:31.591 --> 00:55:34.500
<v Speaker 4>of our sloppy fucks and half of them</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you jack.</v>

1351
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.130
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you better than the average person</v>

1352
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:39.780
<v Speaker 4>washable that jam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We only want to like quality people in.</v>

1353
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.630
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never be able to prove myself in</v>

1354
00:55:42.631 --> 00:55:46.290
<v Speaker 4>that moment as being worthy of getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>into any country.</v>

1355
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.530
<v Speaker 4>They have a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like exceptional skill,</v>

1356
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:53.010
<v Speaker 4>person of exceptional skill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just seems,</v>

1357
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.520
<v Speaker 4>it seems fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I dunno,</v>

1358
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:59.430
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems barbaric.</v>

1359
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:02.620
<v Speaker 4>Like it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know people are Google man,</v>

1360
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:05.270
<v Speaker 4>just fucking go to understand American</v>
<v Speaker 4>sovereignty.</v>

1361
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.490
<v Speaker 4>It's very important that we keep the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of the world's fucked up.</v>

1362
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.310
<v Speaker 4>We've managed to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got lucky,</v>

1363
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.860
<v Speaker 4>we got lucky and we got shit out on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>right patch of dirt.</v>

1364
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.521
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1365
00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:15.600
<v Speaker 4>And we got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1366
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:16.463
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1367
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:18.870
<v Speaker 4>resources that a lot of other countries</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have.</v>

1368
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:20.100
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1369
00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:20.880
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try,</v>

1370
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.160
<v Speaker 4>I love to travel internationally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>

1371
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1372
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 3>putting myself in places that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1373
00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1374
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:29.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1375
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.190
<v Speaker 3>that don't have what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that makes sense.</v>

1376
00:56:33.191 --> 00:56:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Like I am just for perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy the present and enjoy making a</v>

1377
00:56:37.151 --> 00:56:39.640
<v Speaker 3>vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of a combination of a of,</v>

1378
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.040
<v Speaker 3>of pleasure and perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1379
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:45.880
<v Speaker 3>as much as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And going places that you know,</v>

1380
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.030
<v Speaker 3>make you realize what you have at home.</v>

1381
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that it holds back both</v>
<v Speaker 1>sides?</v>

1382
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it holds back Mexico that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States is so difficult to get</v>

1383
00:56:56.651 --> 00:57:00.580
<v Speaker 1>into and then it's always like just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spare of certain people trying to get</v>

1384
00:57:00.581 --> 00:57:02.560
<v Speaker 1>into Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get an American can't.</v>

1385
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.620
<v Speaker 1>What I was going to get at is that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it's kind of similar in some</v>

1386
00:57:05.621 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 1>way and I might be off what's similar in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some way to make drugs illegal</v>

1387
00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that like you make drugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>

1388
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:15.880
<v Speaker 1>then you create this artificial there</v>
<v Speaker 1>this demand is increased demand and then</v>

1389
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.400
<v Speaker 1>it's outlawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So only people that are willing to break</v>

1390
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:21.310
<v Speaker 1>the law sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you that you had this criminal</v>

1391
00:57:21.311 --> 00:57:23.970
<v Speaker 1>criminal enterprise attached to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that should be</v>

1392
00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:26.570
<v Speaker 3>perfectly legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right coming.</v>

1393
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.910
<v Speaker 3>You're already breaking the law by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by bike,</v>

1394
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.200
<v Speaker 3>by coming here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1395
00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:32.720
<v Speaker 3>So are you a person is going to break</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law,</v>

1396
00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be a person who takes</v>

1397
00:57:34.401 --> 00:57:35.091
<v Speaker 3>that shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1398
00:57:35.091 --> 00:57:38.420
<v Speaker 3>and also profit off of it by brand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of those carriers,</v>

1399
00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.141
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1400
00:57:39.141 --> 00:57:41.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in La and I think I had a,</v>

1401
00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1402
00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize that it was illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1403
00:57:45.381 --> 00:57:47.270
<v Speaker 3>as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know laws or rules or</v>

1404
00:57:47.271 --> 00:57:52.250
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just assumed that Mexico and</v>

1405
00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:53.660
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I would,</v>

1406
00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most almost the kids who went to school</v>

1407
00:57:55.341 --> 00:57:57.530
<v Speaker 3>with were Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just assumed that it was like a</v>

1408
00:57:57.531 --> 00:58:01.310
<v Speaker 3>place where people live in both places</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you go back and forth a lot and you</v>

1409
00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:05.930
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mexican culture was so sort of the,</v>

1410
00:58:05.931 --> 00:58:08.030
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my whole backdrop of my childhood was</v>

1411
00:58:08.031 --> 00:58:08.810
<v Speaker 3>painted with that.</v>

1412
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.060
<v Speaker 3>So I just kind of assume that you went</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you wanted to.</v>

1413
00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like that La was mostly Mexican and</v>

1414
00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:16.970
<v Speaker 3>that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1415
00:58:16.971 --> 00:58:17.960
<v Speaker 3>It should be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1416
00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.360
<v Speaker 3>And people will want to look at her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come over here and take our jobs.</v>

1417
00:58:20.361 --> 00:58:23.810
<v Speaker 3>We're going to come over and Bruno</v>
<v Speaker 3>Erchonia working or is it all gonna even</v>

1418
00:58:23.811 --> 00:58:25.820
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe it just evens out.</v>

1419
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:28.260
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1420
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:29.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also,</v>

1421
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:31.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1422
00:58:31.101 --> 00:58:34.100
<v Speaker 3>it's beyond cliched to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but are they,</v>

1423
00:58:34.101 --> 00:58:37.010
<v Speaker 3>are people taking jobs that Americans</v>
<v Speaker 3>are dying to do now?</v>

1424
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well see,</v>

1425
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.410
<v Speaker 1>so if they come over here and they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>just come over here,</v>

1426
00:58:42.411 --> 00:58:45.740
<v Speaker 1>then you have to pay them the same rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to pay them the same</v>

1427
00:58:45.741 --> 00:58:46.810
<v Speaker 1>rate that everybody gets paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1428
00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.320
<v Speaker 1>There's wage limits</v>

1429
00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:50.280
<v Speaker 3>as a minimum wage.</v>

1430
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:52.990
<v Speaker 1>If you have them illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could pay them whenever the fuck you</v>

1431
00:58:52.991 --> 00:58:54.430
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they do.</v>

1432
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:57.100
<v Speaker 1>That's like the big housekeeper dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can that,</v>

1433
00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:58.810
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck fucker housekeepers asking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a raise?</v>

1434
00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:01.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't ask her for a raise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say shit.</v>

1435
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Every time the word housekeeper comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of my mouth,</v>

1436
00:59:03.551 --> 00:59:04.360
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.020
<v Speaker 3>little embarrassed because I have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>housekeeper now.</v>

1439
00:59:08.021 --> 00:59:08.890
<v Speaker 3>I never had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1440
00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:09.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel bad.</v>

1441
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.380
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make me feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1442
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't love her more and she's very</v>

1443
00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:20.590
<v Speaker 3>much become kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pseudo mother figure of mine in La.</v>

1444
00:59:20.591 --> 00:59:21.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't have family here really.</v>

1445
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I also feel like that makes me sound</v>

1446
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:29.840
<v Speaker 5>like a pretentious white person who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking care of a person of color.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and really,</v>

1453
00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:50.291
<v Speaker 5>she helps me function in life and yet</v>

<v Speaker 1>nicer,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1460
01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:04.520
<v Speaker 1>as long as she enjoys doing the job and</v>

1476
01:00:36.401 --> 01:00:38.110
<v Speaker 5>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She wants me to have a kid.</v>

1480
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:44.980
<v Speaker 5>this housekeeper who was like,</v>

1483
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.050

<v Speaker 1>it sounds like you've got some sort of a</v>

1484
01:00:50.051 --> 01:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life partner.</v>

1485
01:00:52.241 --> 01:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a life partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shivaas Teresa life partner.</v>

1486
01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:57.451
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1487
01:00:57.451 --> 01:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1488
01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:02.290
<v Speaker 1>it's always a touchy subject because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's historically been people that</v>

1489
01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>have come from other places and they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrated into places and then,</v>

1490
01:01:06.611 --> 01:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they create neighborhoods.</v>

1491
01:01:08.051 --> 01:01:10.180
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain class of people</v>

1492
01:01:10.181 --> 01:01:15.181
<v Speaker 1>initially and then they move through</v>
<v Speaker 1>society and I mean my people have</v>

1493
01:01:15.281 --> 01:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>experienced at the Italians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when my grandfather came over here,</v>

1494
01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>there was all these like negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes for Italians and there's all</v>

1495
01:01:23.561 --> 01:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>these slurs like these to call them my</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guinea wop and all these different,</v>

1496
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>they were like hurtful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like today if you call someone a Guinea</v>

1497
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.620
<v Speaker 1>knowing like I would say I'm a Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nobody gives a shit.</v>

1498
01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Call Sebastian again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

1499
01:01:34.631 --> 01:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't bother anybody.</v>

1500
01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it became,</v>

1501
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:41.500
<v Speaker 1>they became a class of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>normalized.</v>

<v Speaker 1>be normal,</v>

1517
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>like moving to a better spot so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't move to a better spot.</v>

1528
01:02:48.221 --> 01:02:50.890

<v Speaker 5>stay,</v>

1529
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:53.800
<v Speaker 5>you have to leave and you have to go</v>
<v Speaker 5>populate this other area.</v>

1532
01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.240
<v Speaker 5>we're choosing where people</v>

1533
01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.210
<v Speaker 1>can live and we don't know what would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best place for them.</v>

1534
01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:04.760
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if the best place for them</v>
<v Speaker 1>is right next door to you,</v>

1535
01:03:04.761 --> 01:03:06.800
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a guy,</v>

1536

<v Speaker 1>when I'm like,</v>

1617
01:06:25.071 --> 01:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll deal with the consequences of</v>

1618
01:06:26.781 --> 01:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump being president later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now we're here to make people</v>

1619
01:06:29.691 --> 01:06:34.691
<v Speaker 1>laugh and have fun and burn is on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on fire.</v>

1620
01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

1621
01:06:36.021 --> 01:06:39.070
<v Speaker 1>he shines and those things like no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1622
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:42.820
<v Speaker 1>he was just like one after the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashing it.</v>

1623
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a video online you can get on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube that's like the best of Bill</v>

1624
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Burr at the end of the world podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1625
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.300
<v Speaker 1>he's just slaying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1626
01:06:50.301 --> 01:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>and I came in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I like threw a cup of gasoline on</v>

1627
01:06:53.481 --> 01:06:54.770
<v Speaker 1>the fire with my opinions.</v>

1628
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1629
01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really in a pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like you have to understand</v>

1630
01:06:58.821 --> 01:07:02.630
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of a Zine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not saying you have to understand,</v>

1631
01:07:02.631 --> 01:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>but the people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1632
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Like when would do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of comics and there's an</v>

1633
01:07:06.741 --> 01:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>audience like we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not always going to deal with</v>

1634
01:07:10.281 --> 01:07:11.940
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to be somber.</v>

1635
01:07:11.941 --> 01:07:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Surely be considering the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1636
01:07:13.971 --> 01:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>well now we don't have a president</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1637
01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:20.000
<v Speaker 1>We've just elected a buffoon to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest popularity contest in the world</v>

1638
01:07:20.001 --> 01:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>is what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a popular person one now and now</v>

1639
01:07:22.911 --> 01:07:26.480
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked and he's an egomaniac and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's in charge of the nukes.</v>

1640
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Congratulate Hell you could fire the FBI</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1641
01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just let a reality star just start</v>

1642
01:07:30.741 --> 01:07:33.440
<v Speaker 1>firing the people that you need for</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical intelligence,</v>

1643
01:07:33.441 --> 01:07:36.400
<v Speaker 1>people that have been involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intelligence industry and the</v>

1644
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>intelligence community for decade after</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade after decade,</v>

1645
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:42.380
<v Speaker 1>you let this reality star just start</v>
<v Speaker 1>firing people.</v>

1646
01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.730
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also the best place I could</v>

1647
01:07:44.731 --> 01:07:48.050
<v Speaker 1>have ended up that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't imagine having spent a,</v>

1648
01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I I think I went to bed at like she got</v>

1649
01:07:51.531 --> 01:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>together with Jen Kirkman 7:00 AM your</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1650
01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I looked at her twitter and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got to stay away.</v>

1651
01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>You guys are freaking me the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jesus,</v>

1652
01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a bad system.</v>

1653
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>It's been a bad system since people</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to make phone calls.</v>

1654
01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as people figured out how to</v>

1655
01:08:09.891 --> 01:08:11.960
<v Speaker 1>make phone calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have to get a guy on a</v>

1656
01:08:11.961 --> 01:08:16.961
<v Speaker 1>fucking horse that carries your vote and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your request for sovereignty and your</v>

1657
01:08:17.481 --> 01:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>personal state by a messenger that us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it to some fucking representative</v>

1658
01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:24.590
<v Speaker 1>as take it to Congress on this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>

1659
01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to do that anymore.</v>

1660
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.490
<v Speaker 1>So since we don't have to do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

1661
01:08:28.491 --> 01:08:33.110
<v Speaker 1>this idea of one person running the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole Shebang through a representative</v>

1662
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>of each individual state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's archaic.</v>

1663
01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.440
<v Speaker 1>It's communication is too good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the bottleneck is the system.</v>

1664
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>The system needs to be redesigned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be redesigned.</v>

1665
01:08:42.141 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's saying we shouldn't have</v>

1666
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an antigovernment purple,</v>

1667
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:49.250
<v Speaker 1>purple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purple person looks like I'm not an anti</v>

1668
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.470
<v Speaker 1>military person or an anti police</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1669
01:08:51.471 --> 01:08:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I just think it all has to be managed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and engineered the right way.</v>

1670
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't have just complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>anarchy in this country,</v>

1671
01:08:59.331 --> 01:09:01.340
<v Speaker 1>but we have to have the will of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1672
01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:03.440
<v Speaker 1>And right now it's definitely not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>will of the people.</v>

1673
01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.160
<v Speaker 1>This is just some weird system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's figured out a way to win.</v>

1674
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.010
<v Speaker 1>And then once they're in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're realizing all the flaws of the</v>

1675
01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:10.370
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1676
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:11.930
<v Speaker 1>People are quitting and getting fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1677
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:13.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the most efficient way to</v>

1678
01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>run this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1679
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:15.800
<v Speaker 1>But there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1680
01:09:15.801 --> 01:09:16.850
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1681
01:09:16.851 --> 01:09:19.220
<v Speaker 1>it within the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no,</v>

1682
01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.630
<v Speaker 1>here's how you change the system like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has been established.</v>

1683
01:09:21.631 --> 01:09:23.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to do that in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't,</v>

1684
01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:25.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1685
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:27.170
<v Speaker 1>make everybody implode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the system,</v>

1686
01:09:27.171 --> 01:09:29.720
<v Speaker 1>the design of the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a more than I've,</v>

1687
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:33.740
<v Speaker 1>I've paid attention more to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>political system in the last two years</v>

1688
01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:36.800
<v Speaker 1>and I think I have in my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's all these checks and</v>

1689
01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:41.801
<v Speaker 1>balances that are in place to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent someone who's an irreputable</v>

1690
01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:46.850
<v Speaker 1>person getting into a position of power</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then changing everything.</v>

1691
01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 1>There's enough checks and balances to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that in place.</v>

1692
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.550
<v Speaker 1>And that I think that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a beautiful thing.</v>

1693
01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:57.200
<v Speaker 1>And having all these representatives</v>
<v Speaker 1>that represent both conservative and</v>

1694
01:09:57.201 --> 01:10:00.470
<v Speaker 1>liberal attitudes kind of keep things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance to a certain extent,</v>

1695
01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the best way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1696
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:07.250
<v Speaker 1>the best way to do it would be to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like Elon musk and say,</v>

1697
01:10:07.251 --> 01:10:08.400
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you,</v>

1698
01:10:08.401 --> 01:10:11.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to put fucking tunnels</v>

1699
01:10:11.331 --> 01:10:15.230
<v Speaker 1>under the earth where the cars go on</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleds and that eliminates all the</v>

1700
01:10:15.231 --> 01:10:18.410
<v Speaker 1>traffic in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way they figured out how to make</v>

1701
01:10:18.411 --> 01:10:22.850
<v Speaker 1>like a solar box that sits in a garage</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the wall and it powers your whole</v>

1702
01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:26.720
<v Speaker 1>house from the roof and the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to make roof shingles</v>

1703
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.120
<v Speaker 1>that are actually solar patent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rate of the figured out how to make</v>

1704
01:10:29.121 --> 01:10:33.110
<v Speaker 1>an electric car then go 350 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about tell us how to fund this</v>

1705
01:10:33.111 --> 01:10:33.740
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1706
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you're definitely smarter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1707
01:10:36.141 --> 01:10:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean most people does he make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions?</v>

1708
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I just think about like when they</v>

1709
01:10:40.851 --> 01:10:43.610
<v Speaker 1>change rules and major league it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always find it like interesting like</v>

1710
01:10:43.611 --> 01:10:45.830
<v Speaker 1>that a group of people got together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like now what is it?</v>

1711
01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Overtime football over time says shorten</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and they like,</v>

1712
01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:50.600
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh now it's a timid as now it's five</v>

1713
01:10:50.601 --> 01:10:52.310
<v Speaker 1>minutes and we all just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1714
01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.630
<v Speaker 1>like who's who's the board?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the person who gets to say,</v>

1715
01:10:56.631 --> 01:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now this is the way that the government</v>

1716
01:10:58.641 --> 01:11:00.800
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it's ellen process.</v>

1717
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>football is very different obviously</v>

1718
01:11:02.421 --> 01:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>because it's a game and you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the game better and more exciting.</v>

1719
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:08.690
<v Speaker 1>If they were just trying to fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and make politics more exciting,</v>

1720
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe that would be more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that would work.</v>

1721
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I just make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do make this better?</v>

1722
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.530
<v Speaker 5>How do we make this better?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do we make people like this more?</v>

1723
01:11:16.531 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 5>How do we make people feel like they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>involved?</v>

1724
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:20.040
<v Speaker 5>How do we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

1725
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.480
<v Speaker 5>I usually like changing the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like the,</v>

1726
01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.970
<v Speaker 5>I just don't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how long.</v>

1727
01:11:26.971 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 5>Something like that takes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it,</v>

1728
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 5>is it over generations?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it tomorrow?</v>

1729
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:34.230
<v Speaker 5>The rules are this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean how do you do that?</v>

1730
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I think you make people park at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of a hill and you put the voting</v>

1731
01:11:41.111 --> 01:11:46.111
<v Speaker 1>booth at the very top of the hill and</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the people that can actually like,</v>

1732
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:50.710
<v Speaker 1>unless you're physically handicap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get a pass.</v>

1733
01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll figure out another task for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1734
01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:56.320
<v Speaker 1>but only the people that figure out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get their fucking lazy ass to the top of</v>

1735
01:11:56.321 --> 01:11:58.240
<v Speaker 1>that hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the only ones who get to vote.</v>

1736
01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:02.490
<v Speaker 5>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fine by me.</v>

1737
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:04.800
<v Speaker 5>But that's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to tell somebody</v>

1738
01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:06.960
<v Speaker 5>whether it was I hope and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

1739
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.000
<v Speaker 5>I'll probably say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

1740
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:09.830
<v Speaker 1>mountain hikers are just going to run</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1741
01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Alex honnold is going to be our</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

1742
01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:14.730
<v Speaker 1>that rock climber dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be number one.</v>

1743
01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:17.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that if we just come up</v>

1744
01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:21.660
<v Speaker 1>with an alternative system that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>designs and we slowly implement it like</v>

1745
01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:23.580
<v Speaker 1>in stages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1746
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.740
<v Speaker 5>but every time someone doesn't like</v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

1747
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:31.350
<v Speaker 5>everyone is so aggressively angry now</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everyone is kind of a,</v>

1748
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:32.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

1749
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.770
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the precipice of snapping.</v>

1750
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.140
<v Speaker 5>And I feel like any kind of suggested</v>
<v Speaker 5>change to a lot of people is,</v>

1751
01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.003
<v Speaker 5>is terrifying.</v>

1752
01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.020
<v Speaker 1>It is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it should be because if somebody</v>

1753
01:12:43.021 --> 01:12:44.880
<v Speaker 1>fucks it up and Putin's this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1754
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:47.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be a big goddamn disaster</v>

1755
01:12:47.131 --> 01:12:48.390
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always possible.</v>

1756
01:12:48.391 --> 01:12:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Like this is his closest that's come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1757
01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:54.390
<v Speaker 1>this is as close as it's coming to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something where he's kind of 33%</v>

1758
01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:57.690
<v Speaker 1>approval rate or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the pole that he found.</v>

1759
01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's 50% yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that hilarious that you can</v>

1760
01:13:00.691 --> 01:13:04.860
<v Speaker 1>put up a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says 50% of the people like me and</v>

1761
01:13:04.861 --> 01:13:05.311
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

1762
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:07.380
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really doing a great job.</v>

1763
01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Like you're never going to see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>president with a hundred percent</v>

1764
01:13:11.431 --> 01:13:12.540
<v Speaker 1>approval rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not.</v>

1765
01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1766
01:13:12.690 --> 01:13:14.720
<v Speaker 5>It's so tragic that mean he is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he is.</v>

1767
01:13:14.721 --> 01:13:17.960
<v Speaker 5>I can't think of a time my brain has</v>
<v Speaker 5>been this consumed by,</v>

1768
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:19.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by a president.</v>

1769
01:13:19.670 --> 01:13:20.290
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1770
01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:21.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>positive or negative.</v>

1771
01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:22.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1772
01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:22.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1773
01:13:22.581 --> 01:13:25.370
<v Speaker 5>I liked Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I never thought about him as much as</v>

1774
01:13:25.371 --> 01:13:26.270
<v Speaker 5>I think about trump.</v>

1775
01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Even if you have like things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamins,</v>

1776
01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.690
<v Speaker 1>vitamins would not have a 100% approval</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>

1777
01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that will like flip</v>

1778
01:13:34.941 --> 01:13:36.770
<v Speaker 1>vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even need them.</v>

1779
01:13:36.771 --> 01:13:39.310
<v Speaker 1>They saw and they would give it a,</v>

1780
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:41.970
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like actual western medicine doesn't</v>

1781
01:13:41.971 --> 01:13:44.190
<v Speaker 5>have a hundred percent approve of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are people who go like,</v>

1782
01:13:44.191 --> 01:13:45.870
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want any treatment for my</v>

1783
01:13:45.871 --> 01:13:46.704
<v Speaker 5>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>

1784
01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:47.840
<v Speaker 5>well that's because</v>

1785
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.040
<v Speaker 1>there alternatives and there are there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there some people that believe that</v>

1786
01:13:52.041 --> 01:13:57.041
<v Speaker 1>you can do more work like to cure or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a halt cancer in its tracks by altering</v>

1787
01:13:59.061 --> 01:14:00.500
<v Speaker 1>your diet and proving your immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>

1788
01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:03.830
<v Speaker 5>I believe that more than like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1789
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:04.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1790
01:14:04.581 --> 01:14:09.581
<v Speaker 5>the Lord will provide my medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think more and more doctors are</v>

1791
01:14:09.681 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 5>acutely aware of the factor that</v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition</v>

1792
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.450
<v Speaker 1>plays down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they changed,</v>

1793
01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.710
<v Speaker 1>they make changes to people not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like give them drugs and give them,</v>

1794
01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti cancer medication.</v>

1795
01:14:20.201 --> 01:14:23.770
<v Speaker 1>But there's doctors now more</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly more and more that want you</v>

1796
01:14:23.771 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 1>to hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You drink too much,</v>

1797
01:14:24.911 --> 01:14:26.830
<v Speaker 1>stopped drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you smoking cigarettes?</v>

1798
01:14:26.831 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 1>We definitely got to get you to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking cigarettes.</v>

1799
01:14:28.691 --> 01:14:29.880
<v Speaker 1>We got to get you to eat healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1800
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:32.030
<v Speaker 1>or here's what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you're directly talking.</v>

1801
01:14:32.031 --> 01:14:32.864
<v Speaker 1>No right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1802
01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 7>Uh Huh.</v>

1803
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>I just think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay attention at doctors</v>

1804
01:14:39.491 --> 01:14:41.410
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these motherfuckers might have</v>

1805
01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:43.570
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to cure your cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to listen.</v>

1806
01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:47.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't listen to the holistic healer</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady that has incense burning in her</v>

1807
01:14:47.051 --> 01:14:49.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She smells a bit Julie.</v>

1808
01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little from column a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be careful though.</v>

1809
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Truly smell and motherfuckers,</v>

1810
01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.970
<v Speaker 5>I just did some weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1811
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.960
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1812
01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.550
<v Speaker 5>Kalanick at some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1813
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.160
<v Speaker 5>hippie ranch type place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

1814
01:15:01.161 --> 01:15:03.170
<v Speaker 5>you gotta pipe up your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Had a pipe up my ass.</v>

1815
01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:04.550
<v Speaker 5>What was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1816
01:15:04.551 --> 01:15:09.551
<v Speaker 5>it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was oddly a oddly positive experience</v>

1817
01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:15.700
<v Speaker 5>and I didn't think it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it was a guy I was in Bisbee,</v>

1818
01:15:16.101 --> 01:15:17.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>around,</v>

<v Speaker 5>took off for the day and got to</v>

1821

<v Speaker 1>Kalanick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1822
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Have you done that before or was it on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whim?</v>

1823
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:27.200
<v Speaker 5>A semi on a witness?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

1824
01:15:27.201 --> 01:15:27.561
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:15:27.561 --> 01:15:30.560
<v Speaker 5>I called the play loud,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was looking for healthy things to do in</v>

1826
01:15:30.561 --> 01:15:31.130
<v Speaker 5>the desert</v>

1827
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:34.310
<v Speaker 1>and that was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of people take colonics</v>

1828
01:15:34.311 --> 01:15:35.720
<v Speaker 1>on a whim?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1829
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:38.510
<v Speaker 1>what percentage does it even 10 where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would just walk down the street.</v>

1830
01:15:38.511 --> 01:15:39.231
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1831
01:15:39.231 --> 01:15:40.064
<v Speaker 1>it'd be fun.</v>

1832
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:41.440
<v Speaker 5>We should really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1833
01:15:41.441 --> 01:15:43.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's a lot of colonics</v>
<v Speaker 5>ways where like advertise for foot</v>

1834
01:15:43.781 --> 01:15:45.790
<v Speaker 5>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1835
01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1836
01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.330
<v Speaker 5>come on in and we'll stick a pipe up</v>
<v Speaker 5>your ass.</v>

1837
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:50.710
<v Speaker 5>But I try,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1838
01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.320
<v Speaker 5>it's that thing where I'm not like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a,</v>

1839
01:15:53.321 --> 01:15:55.840
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a healthy lifestyle.</v>

1840
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:58.360
<v Speaker 5>So I find myself hitting walls and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>reaching,</v>

1841
01:15:58.361 --> 01:16:00.680
<v Speaker 5>kind of grasping for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1842
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:03.880
<v Speaker 5>activities that seem healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>enjoyable,</v>

1843
01:16:03.881 --> 01:16:05.770
<v Speaker 5>which is why I've like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But I do it.</v>

1893
01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I write down things I need to work on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things I'm going to do.</v>

1894
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wrote down my schedule for the</v>

1895
01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:15.450
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote down like this week I'm going to</v>

1896
01:18:15.451 --> 01:18:18.300
<v Speaker 1>lift weights three days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to run two days a week and I'm</v>

1897
01:18:18.301 --> 01:18:20.280
<v Speaker 1>gonna do yoga two days a week and</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

1898
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no negotiation.</v>

1899
01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.440
<v Speaker 1>So it has to do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that will,</v>

1900
01:18:25.441 --> 01:18:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that for the week and then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure I make those checks off cause</v>

1901
01:18:29.101 --> 01:18:30.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of times where I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off,</v>

1902
01:18:30.991 --> 01:18:33.780
<v Speaker 1>but I know I have to make my schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to get it in.</v>

1903
01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.180
<v Speaker 1>If I don't get it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I fucked up.</v>

1904
01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I gave myself like a schedule and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I get things done and it</v>

1905
01:18:41.191 --> 01:18:43.500
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem any more stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1906
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:47.970
<v Speaker 1>it seems less stressful because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to like him and hall of whether I'm</v>

1907
01:18:47.971 --> 01:18:50.100
<v Speaker 1>going to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have it written down,</v>

1908
01:18:50.101 --> 01:18:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I have to do it and then I just go do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1909
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:53.743
<v Speaker 1>Sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1910
01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's got to just write it down and</v>

1911
01:18:56.341 --> 01:18:57.990
<v Speaker 1>stick to the script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as a comic,</v>

1912
01:18:57.991 --> 01:19:02.991
<v Speaker 1>one of the best things about us is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're impulsive and that we like to blow</v>

1913
01:19:03.661 --> 01:19:07.650
<v Speaker 1>things off shore and we like to question</v>
<v Speaker 1>the validity of certain actions.</v>

1914
01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I doing that?</v>

1915
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1916
01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:13.230
<v Speaker 1>how about I just jerk off and take a nap</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever you do.</v>

1917
01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:15.120
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what we do.</v>

1918
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Will people were impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why you're</v>

1919
01:19:18.901 --> 01:19:21.960
<v Speaker 1>funny cause you come up with a thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe other people wouldn't</v>

1920
01:19:21.961 --> 01:19:22.794
<v Speaker 1>entertain.</v>

1921
01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:24.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:34.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't even remember who they find</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kovalev Andre Ward this weekend.</v>

1960
01:20:34.961 --> 01:20:36.520
<v Speaker 5>I watched a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1961
01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:39.100
<v Speaker 5>I listened to a lot about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I missed it.</v>

1962
01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.290
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is I've watched,</v>

1963
01:20:41.291 --> 01:20:44.410
<v Speaker 5>I stay home and watch so much shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1964
01:20:44.411 --> 01:20:45.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love sports.</v>

1965
01:20:45.731 --> 01:20:48.970
<v Speaker 5>I find it to be the most soothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>

1966
01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.650
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I'm,</v>

1967
01:20:50.651 --> 01:20:51.970
<v Speaker 5>if I'm in a job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1968
01:20:51.971 --> 01:20:54.030
<v Speaker 5>writing something all day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look at my,</v>

1969
01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:56.410
<v Speaker 5>the sports schedule that night and I get</v>
<v Speaker 5>excited that,</v>

1970
01:20:56.411 --> 01:20:57.730
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a thing to do at eight.</v>

1971
01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.680
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after my work is done,</v>

1972
01:20:59.681 --> 01:21:01.480
<v Speaker 5>like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrapped my days around it so I'm</v>

1973
01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:06.481
<v Speaker 5>trying to go out and do more shit as</v>
<v Speaker 5>opposed to being locked in a locked into</v>

1974
01:21:06.821 --> 01:21:11.680
<v Speaker 5>a schedule that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>determined by what slap boxing matches</v>

1975
01:21:11.681 --> 01:21:13.090
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I used to stay home to watch</v>

1976
01:21:13.091 --> 01:21:15.310
<v Speaker 5>everything and I didn't for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1977
01:21:15.311 --> 01:21:16.144
<v Speaker 5>I hear Ya.</v>

1978
01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1979
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:18.760
<v Speaker 5>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1980
01:21:18.761 --> 01:21:19.960
<v Speaker 5>it comes in waves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1981
01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:21.490
<v Speaker 5>But I listened to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>

1982
01:21:21.491 --> 01:21:22.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

1983
01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:24.220
<v Speaker 5>I have opinions about it having not seen</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1984
01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.290
<v Speaker 5>which is</v>

1985
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:29.520
<v Speaker 4>you still have opinions like uneducated</v>
<v Speaker 4>ones from whatnot just from watching</v>

1986
01:21:29.521 --> 01:21:31.640
<v Speaker 4>what I eat from seeing what I did see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it was like,</v>

1987
01:21:31.641 --> 01:21:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I like I get mad about certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>stoppages.</v>

1988
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:35.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what did you see?</v>

1989
01:21:35.941 --> 01:21:37.250
<v Speaker 4>The Kovalev Ward?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1990
01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.070
<v Speaker 4>And I taught it was an early stoppage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely narrowly stoppage.</v>

1991
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:41.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he felt that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't,</v>

1992
01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.230
<v Speaker 4>someone's on his way down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question though.</v>

1993
01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.770
<v Speaker 4>Did he have a standing eight count rule?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know if there's a standing</v>

1994
01:21:46.771 --> 01:21:50.400
<v Speaker 4>eight count rule in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see if there was find out if</v>

1995
01:21:50.401 --> 01:21:51.640
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

1996
01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:54.300
<v Speaker 4>cause I feel like that's what should</v>
<v Speaker 4>have happened if it happened.</v>

1997
01:21:54.301 --> 01:21:56.460
<v Speaker 4>But in some fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe they don't have to have a</v>

1998
01:21:56.461 --> 01:21:58.530
<v Speaker 4>standing eight count that correct me if</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm wrong.</v>

1999
01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:00.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's the case in all</v>
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>

2000
01:22:00.901 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 4>And I think in some championship fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a standing eight count.</v>

2001
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:07.070
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's a speculator or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>specification,</v>

2002
01:22:07.071 --> 01:22:07.904
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put,</v>

2003
01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:08.611
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2004
01:22:08.611 --> 01:22:10.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just seems like an obvious</v>

2005
01:22:10.261 --> 01:22:11.094
<v Speaker 4>stipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

2006
01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:11.410
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2007
01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:14.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last fight,</v>

2008
01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to think of a Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll find out.</v>

2009
01:22:16.781 --> 01:22:19.900
<v Speaker 5>Jane Doe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made a,</v>

2010
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:21.310
<v Speaker 5>I made,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2011
01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.530
<v Speaker 5>I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2012
01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:24.580
<v Speaker 5>Arizona during the Canelo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2013
01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:28.690
<v Speaker 5>the Chavez fight and I made everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch it and then that wasn't a good</v>

2014
01:22:28.691 --> 01:22:29.800
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a bad one.</v>

2015
01:22:29.801 --> 01:22:34.120
<v Speaker 5>And it was the worst part about it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>that everyone knew I was the reason the</v>

2016
01:22:34.121 --> 01:22:35.770
<v Speaker 5>fight was on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>

2017
01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.270
<v Speaker 5>So everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a,</v>

2018
01:22:37.271 --> 01:22:40.420
<v Speaker 5>it was like I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every round I wanted to be exciting</v>

2019
01:22:40.421 --> 01:22:43.990
<v Speaker 5>because I wanted people to not get mad</v>
<v Speaker 5>at me for ruining their night,</v>

2020
01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.530
<v Speaker 5>but instead I was responsible for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>boring night.</v>

2021
01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.290
<v Speaker 5>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I enjoyed it.</v>

2022
01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:53.270
<v Speaker 5>Even though it was boring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just wanted to see who was going to</v>

2023
01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:56.080
<v Speaker 5>fight Golovkin and that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was my sort of,</v>

2024
01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:00.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my horse in the race was whoever was</v>

2025
01:23:00.341 --> 01:23:01.020
<v Speaker 5>going to win.</v>

2026
01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My favorite fighter.</v>

2027
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:05.070
<v Speaker 4>But most people thought Canelo was gonna</v>
<v Speaker 4>win.</v>

2028
01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.360
<v Speaker 4>Handly but that was the problem was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2029
01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Chavez didn't really want to put himself</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there,</v>

2030
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:12.970
<v Speaker 4>risking a great [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's never been,</v>

2031
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:13.833
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2032
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's trainings ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2033
01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:21.760
<v Speaker 4>as disciplined as some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Canelo is about that life.</v>

2034
01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:22.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2035
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to be the best ever and just</v>

2036
01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.720
<v Speaker 4>trying to be the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to be.</v>

2037
01:23:25.721 --> 01:23:28.120
<v Speaker 4>I tend to mean her being a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a rich kid.</v>

2038
01:23:28.121 --> 01:23:31.180
<v Speaker 4>Boxer just feels like a born rich kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2039
01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:32.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chavez Jr,</v>

2040
01:23:32.321 --> 01:23:32.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2041
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

2042
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:34.710
<v Speaker 4>my canal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2043
01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:34.991
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2044
01:23:34.991 --> 01:23:36.010
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just saying that,</v>

2045
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:37.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2046
01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:40.540
<v Speaker 4>just that just seems like a hard place</v>
<v Speaker 4>to come from.</v>

2047
01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:41.640
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

2048
01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his dad is the fucking greatest of all</v>

2049
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:46.990
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Julio Cesar Chavez is arguably the</v>

2050
01:23:46.991 --> 01:23:48.670
<v Speaker 4>greatest Mexican fighter of all time.</v>

2051
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:49.181
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2052
01:23:49.181 --> 01:23:50.460
<v Speaker 4>he's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw it,</v>

2053
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.620
<v Speaker 4>I saw Chavez Jr fight and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the staples center and they brought</v>

2054
01:23:53.621 --> 01:23:55.180
<v Speaker 4>his dad out first and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2055
01:23:55.181 --> 01:23:55.601
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2056
01:23:55.601 --> 01:23:58.810
<v Speaker 4>just the poor shadow you got to be and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that your dad gets honored before your</v>

2057
01:23:58.811 --> 01:23:59.740
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rough.</v>

2058
01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:03.910
<v Speaker 4>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this Guy Kron Gracie and his dad</v>

2059
01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:07.210
<v Speaker 4>is Hixon Gracie who's like the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu guy of all time.</v>

2060
01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.020
<v Speaker 4>And the sun is a world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2061
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.680
<v Speaker 4>Fucking beast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's one of the best guys on the</v>

2062
01:24:11.681 --> 01:24:16.150
<v Speaker 4>planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like legitimately 100% self motivated,</v>

2063
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:17.500
<v Speaker 4>not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2064
01:24:17.501 --> 01:24:20.230
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't need to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like the same sort of Chavez</v>

2065
01:24:20.231 --> 01:24:21.130
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2066
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:25.320
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't always happen that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seems like fighting in general,</v>

2067
01:24:25.321 --> 01:24:28.000
<v Speaker 4>younger for fighting tends to come from</v>
<v Speaker 4>a place of poverty.</v>

2068
01:24:28.001 --> 01:24:28.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tends to,</v>

2069
01:24:28.841 --> 01:24:29.674
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

2070
01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:30.420
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have to.</v>

2071
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:30.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2072
01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:31.301
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

2073
01:24:31.301 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 4>even like even it and Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2074
01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2075

2090
01:25:04.421 --> 01:25:08.740
<v Speaker 4>performance by Hopkins Hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was actually coming home from a UFC</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think wide just started even watching</v>

2100
01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:31.030
<v Speaker 4>hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I played so many sports as a</v>

2101
01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:32.800
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I can get into the sports I know</v>

2102
01:25:32.801 --> 01:25:35.260

2105
01:25:39.101 --> 01:25:42.490
<v Speaker 4>that I come from such a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have such a huge blind spot about.</v>

01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:02.170
<v Speaker 4>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun being next to Ian because he</v>

2114
01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:05.240
<v Speaker 4>knows everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows as much about soccer's.</v>

2125
01:26:25.701 --> 01:26:27.740
<v Speaker 4>writer's room at two broke girls and my</v>
<v Speaker 4>boss was like,</v>

2126
01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 4>his joke is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like Ian Edwards and he hired</v>

2127
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:32.030
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great move.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2130
01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 4>but it was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fucking dying.</v>

2132
01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:40.130
<v Speaker 4>I selfishly don't want anybody to ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>hire him as a writer again.</v>

2133
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.710
<v Speaker 4>I want them to just do standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what he's doing.</v>

2134
01:26:42.711 --> 01:26:45.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he just was a little short Gig,</v>

2135
01:26:45.141 --> 01:26:45.741
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

01:26:45.741 --> 01:26:48.980

01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:50.840
<v Speaker 4>how fucking good he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so good.</v>

2138
01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.450
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's such a good guy.</v>

2139
01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:56.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just one of the best guys ever.</v>

2140
01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:59.250
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about this conor</v>

2141
01:26:59.251 --> 01:27:00.570
<v Speaker 4>mcgregor?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Floyd mayweather fight.</v>

2142
01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:02.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a spectacle.</v>

2143
01:27:02.731 --> 01:27:04.280
<v Speaker 4>I guess I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2144
01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:06.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm excited about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like it's going to be another</v>

2145
01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:09.360
<v Speaker 4>big notch and I may,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether spelt and I don't think he needs</v>

2146
01:27:09.361 --> 01:27:11.220
<v Speaker 4>another one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I just,</v>

2147
01:27:11.221 --> 01:27:12.790
<v Speaker 4>I get a little bit,</v>

2150
01:27:15.921 --> 01:27:18.540
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not the kind of boxing I get</v>

2151
01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:21.930
<v Speaker 4>excited about watching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though I know it's technically,</v>

2152
01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going amazing.</v>

2153
01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.210
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2154
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.780
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be an actual 12 round</v>

2155
01:27:27.781 --> 01:27:29.610
<v Speaker 4>boxing match,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're going to get to see some sort</v>

2156
01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:32.040
<v Speaker 4>of an athletic competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2157
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:34.110
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

2158
01:27:34.111 --> 01:27:36.120
<v Speaker 4>I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see how mcgregor can</v>

2159
01:27:36.930 --> 01:27:41.190
<v Speaker 4>be better than the best boxers in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world who have tried.</v>

2160
01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:42.413
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He won't be,</v>

2161
01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.790
<v Speaker 4>he won't be better than the best boxers</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world,</v>

2162
01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:47.310
<v Speaker 4>but what he might do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2163
01:27:47.311 --> 01:27:49.230
<v Speaker 4>he's definitely gonna make it exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to,</v>

2164
01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.810
<v Speaker 4>the trash talk is going to be fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

2165
01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.320
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be epic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a fun Spec to go and he</v>

2166
01:27:55.321 --> 01:28:00.030
<v Speaker 4>has legitimate scary one punch power and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's way bigger.</v>

2167
01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:02.640
<v Speaker 4>So it's all about whether or not he</v>
<v Speaker 4>could hit me.</v>

2168
01:28:02.641 --> 01:28:05.610
<v Speaker 4>Whether she has a at one 50 something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2169
01:28:05.611 --> 01:28:08.850
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much weight does he have to lose?</v>

2170
01:28:08.851 --> 01:28:11.700
<v Speaker 4>How much is in and make them dehydrate</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself even give a fuck.</v>

2171
01:28:11.701 --> 01:28:15.840
<v Speaker 4>Does he ever even when respect is skills</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to make them dehydrate himself</v>

2172
01:28:15.841 --> 01:28:19.140
<v Speaker 4>like he did with Canelo cause he made</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canelo cut a shitload of weight.</v>

2173
01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he made a fight at one 50.</v>

2174
01:28:21.121 --> 01:28:22.920
<v Speaker 4>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 4>File what?</v>

2175
01:28:22.921 --> 01:28:26.340
<v Speaker 4>Floyd mayweather made Canelo Alvarez</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight because Canelo Canelo's a big</v>

2176
01:28:26.341 --> 01:28:28.030
<v Speaker 4>fella.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him in person.</v>

2177
01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.940
<v Speaker 4>Him getting down into one fifty's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>rough,</v>

2178
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.820
<v Speaker 4>rough suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

2179
01:28:32.821 --> 01:28:34.920
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always scary when you look at these</v>

2180
01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:37.470
<v Speaker 4>days and they just look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Macy ate it before the tariff.</v>

2181
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:39.090
<v Speaker 4>Like Chavez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2182
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:40.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a tall guy.</v>

2183
01:28:40.111 --> 01:28:44.610
<v Speaker 4>So he's one of the worst I ever saw was</v>
<v Speaker 4>when connor made it to one 45 we fought</v>

2184
01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like Jesus Christ.</v>

2185
01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:51.270
<v Speaker 4>Like he looks so gone and dried up at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Wayans and then the next day it</v>

2186
01:28:51.271 --> 01:28:52.460
<v Speaker 4>looks like a go real</v>

2187
01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:59.710
<v Speaker 4>canelo came in at one 52 it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this fight is at one 54 it is at one</v>

2188
01:28:59.781 --> 01:29:01.590
<v Speaker 4>54 that's what they're making it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

2189
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well connor's not going to have a hard</v>

2190
01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:08.400
<v Speaker 4>time making the one 54 now this says</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canelo weighed in at one 68 no,</v>

2191
01:29:08.401 --> 01:29:11.040
<v Speaker 4>that was his last fight with Chavez jr</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Chavez Jr.</v>

2192
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 4>He fought above his weight class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually Chavez Jr I think it was</v>

2193
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:17.370
<v Speaker 4>fighting once 75 wasn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he came down,</v>

2194
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:20.130
<v Speaker 4>maybe they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was a normal weight for Chavez</v>

2195
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Jr just for the 30 day weigh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when he fought me with her,</v>

2196
01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:28.160
<v Speaker 4>oh it was 30 30 days out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One 66.8 yeah.</v>

2197
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.720
<v Speaker 4>Well they had stipulations in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>contract,</v>

2198
01:29:30.721 --> 01:29:32.640
<v Speaker 4>like how big he could be at certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>points,</v>

2199
01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:34.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sturdy.</v>

2200
01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 4>They just wanted to dry them out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the,</v>

2201
01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:40.670
<v Speaker 4>what's the whole a cargill?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean is it,</v>

2202
01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.480
<v Speaker 4>are they going to have all boxing?</v>

2203
01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:47.630
<v Speaker 4>Because it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the only way to fight is going</v>

2204
01:29:48.121 --> 01:29:52.560
<v Speaker 4>to be interesting skill wise is if</v>
<v Speaker 4>connor figures out a way to a mall him,</v>

2205
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:55.500
<v Speaker 4>he's almost got to like close the</v>
<v Speaker 4>distance quick,</v>

2206
01:29:55.530 --> 01:29:59.850
<v Speaker 4>get him up against the ropes and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit him with like shots while he's</v>

2207
01:29:59.851 --> 01:30:04.440
<v Speaker 4>holding them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's almost got to clip him in some sort</v>

2208
01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:08.550
<v Speaker 4>of weird awkward like my Donna like</v>
<v Speaker 4>exchange ever seen a fight with my</v>

2209
01:30:08.551 --> 01:30:09.480
<v Speaker 4>donald,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a floyd hat.</v>

2210
01:30:09.481 --> 01:30:13.260
<v Speaker 4>But Floyd got clipped by a big overhand</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2211
01:30:13.261 --> 01:30:15.300
<v Speaker 4>I think it was at the end of one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rounds,</v>

2212
01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.510
<v Speaker 4>like very end of the round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his legs dip like Whoa.</v>

2213
01:30:18.511 --> 01:30:19.530
<v Speaker 4>A little Jig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little,</v>

2214
01:30:19.531 --> 01:30:23.610
<v Speaker 4>a little wobbly and it's just because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>got mauled.</v>

2215
01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:27.390
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't because skill wise he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>commensurate and then when floyd came</v>

2216
01:30:27.391 --> 01:30:29.700
<v Speaker 4>back in the rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just boxed his face off.</v>

2217
01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:33.090
<v Speaker 4>Just fucked him up because he just</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to let them know like,</v>

2218
01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.520
<v Speaker 4>look dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I barely took you serious in that first</v>

2219
01:30:35.521 --> 01:30:37.320
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It got close.</v>

2220
01:30:37.321 --> 01:30:40.680
<v Speaker 4>But it only got close cause like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sloppy bra and then you just put a skill</v>

2221
01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:43.020
<v Speaker 4>clinic on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the second fight sacrifice wasn't</v>

2222
01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:46.320
<v Speaker 4>even close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's the only con,</v>

2223
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:49.770
<v Speaker 4>but that's not how connor normally fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>sound like a swarming face.</v>

2224
01:30:49.771 --> 01:30:51.850
<v Speaker 4>First brawler type dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a guy,</v>

2225
01:30:51.851 --> 01:30:54.940
<v Speaker 4>he's like cautious about getting hit and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2226
01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm thrilled about it but I'm also a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2227
01:30:57.171 --> 01:30:58.290
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish,</v>

2228
01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:01.800
<v Speaker 4>I wish I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I knew more about your side of</v>

2229
01:31:01.801 --> 01:31:04.410
<v Speaker 4>the tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we don't know enough about connor</v>

2230
01:31:04.411 --> 01:31:07.020
<v Speaker 4>because connor has never had a</v>
<v Speaker 4>professional boxing match.</v>

2231
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the thing is you see a striking,</v>

2232
01:31:09.781 --> 01:31:13.260
<v Speaker 4>but you only see striking when he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>working on kicks and wrestling and all</v>

2233
01:31:13.261 --> 01:31:14.094
<v Speaker 4>that other shit too.</v>

2234
01:31:14.110 --> 01:31:15.870
<v Speaker 4>Just kicked him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like would that,</v>

2235
01:31:15.871 --> 01:31:19.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just didn't do it just to let them</v>

2236
01:31:19.081 --> 01:31:22.650
<v Speaker 4>know to do it would be fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fucked up.</v>

2237
01:31:22.651 --> 01:31:24.600
<v Speaker 4>But it would be hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well after you'd probably,</v>

2238
01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:26.620
<v Speaker 4>there's probably some stipulations in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the contract and say,</v>

2239
01:31:26.650 --> 01:31:30.260
<v Speaker 4>can't get them in an arm bar or choke</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2240
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:32.990
<v Speaker 4>Just kicking him in the head and knocked</v>
<v Speaker 4>him out.</v>

2241
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.660
<v Speaker 4>Would be worth losing all the money and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then getting more money out.</v>

2242
01:31:35.661 --> 01:31:39.120
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would be a god damn folk hero if they</v>

2243
01:31:39.121 --> 01:31:42.090
<v Speaker 4>got in close,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they got any clothes and floyd was</v>

2244
01:31:42.091 --> 01:31:46.260
<v Speaker 4>like sucking and Juke on the outside and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he threw a jab to cover up our left high</v>

2245
01:31:46.261 --> 01:31:48.720
<v Speaker 4>kick and that left high kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next I'm just,</v>

2246
01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:52.620
<v Speaker 4>and you see floyd go limp and he would</v>
<v Speaker 4>go limp.</v>

2247
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:58.070
<v Speaker 4>He'd never been high kicked like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus taught it'd be crazy cause if he</v>

2248
01:31:58.531 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 4>didn't know it was yeah</v>

2249
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.530
<v Speaker 1>he could clip them with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if he had no idea.</v>

2250
01:32:02.531 --> 01:32:06.370
<v Speaker 1>If you hid a kick behind a punch like</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter is a lot of fighters do to like</v>

2251
01:32:06.371 --> 01:32:09.100
<v Speaker 1>throw a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally a cover your face so the kick</v>

2252
01:32:09.101 --> 01:32:13.540
<v Speaker 1>is behind it already and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kit comes like while your vision is</v>

2253
01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:15.340
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about the next punch and</v>

2254
01:32:15.341 --> 01:32:18.220
<v Speaker 1>bang the kick lands and you get chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens all the time.</v>

2255
01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.350
<v Speaker 1>If he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be insane.</v>

2256
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:24.760
<v Speaker 1>What have you are worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be with fuck everything up</v>

2257
01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:29.290
<v Speaker 1>because no one would ever trust another</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter from mma to ever fight a boxer</v>

2258
01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:31.680
<v Speaker 1>in a boxing match again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we've only had the up.</v>

2259
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:33.250
<v Speaker 1>The opposite happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2260
01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:38.500
<v Speaker 5>We could they after this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could they do an MMA fight?</v>

2261
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:40.470
<v Speaker 5>But the two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2262
01:32:40.890 --> 01:32:41.730
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2263
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With last 30 seconds,</v>

2264
01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:47.340
<v Speaker 1>maximum relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Connor wanted to give them an ear</v>

2265
01:32:47.341 --> 01:32:49.020
<v Speaker 1>beating for 28 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

2266
01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connors so much better as a wrestler,</v>

2267
01:32:52.681 --> 01:32:55.320
<v Speaker 1>as a submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Artists as a kicker.</v>

2268
01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:59.040
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll hit him with spinning elbows and</v>

2269
01:32:59.041 --> 01:33:01.500
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's things you can't do in a</v>

2270
01:33:01.501 --> 01:33:06.000
<v Speaker 1>boxing match that you're not expecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if someone's just kicks your legs</v>

2271
01:33:06.001 --> 01:33:07.290
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like,</v>

2272
01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.910
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

2273
01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

2274
01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:12.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to think of a way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make money out of a,</v>

2275
01:33:12.541 --> 01:33:13.590
<v Speaker 5>out of what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2276
01:33:13.591 --> 01:33:16.680
<v Speaker 5>you know what's going to come at</v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds and hundreds and millions of</v>

2277
01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:16.991
<v Speaker 5>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2278
01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:17.910
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said only way.</v>

2279
01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:18.680
<v Speaker 5>This is the only way,</v>

2280
01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:21.240
<v Speaker 1>but this is a giant big difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2281
01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Floyd would have to learn how to fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA style.</v>

2282
01:33:24.570 --> 01:33:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Who would have to learn how the Stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>takedowns cause I have to learn how to</v>

2283
01:33:28.081 --> 01:33:31.410
<v Speaker 1>check leg kicks and you'd have to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to defend submissions and that will</v>

2284
01:33:31.411 --> 01:33:33.270
<v Speaker 1>take years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's not going to do that at 40</v>

2285
01:33:33.271 --> 01:33:35.160
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he knows now as far as</v>

2286
01:33:35.161 --> 01:33:38.940
<v Speaker 1>wrestling defense and what he knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>about kickboxing or Jujitsu or anything</v>

2287
01:33:38.941 --> 01:33:39.990
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he knows,</v>

2288
01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:45.240
<v Speaker 1>but if he knows nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's 100% fucked 100% bet.</v>

2289
01:33:45.241 --> 01:33:49.830
<v Speaker 1>The House on it fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like connor might win a boxing match.</v>

2290
01:33:49.831 --> 01:33:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small percentage chance that he just</v>

2291
01:33:54.721 --> 01:33:58.740
<v Speaker 1>runs in there and clips floyd with a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot and rock some and then takes him</v>

2292
01:33:58.741 --> 01:34:00.450
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that percentage is,</v>

2293
01:34:00.451 --> 01:34:04.920
<v Speaker 1>but if you ask a boxing expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like 4% 5% right.</v>

2294
01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what a boxing expert would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm not.</v>

2295
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:09.990
<v Speaker 1>But I'm an MMA expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they fought in an MMA fight,</v>

2296
01:34:09.991 --> 01:34:14.991
<v Speaker 1>it's 100% the connor would fuck him up</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% no ifs,</v>

2297
01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:17.160
<v Speaker 1>no ands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no buts,</v>

2298
01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:18.870
<v Speaker 1>no chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no chance.</v>

2299
01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:22.080
<v Speaker 1>It's connor is going to be farther away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from me with him than anyone has ever</v>

2300
01:34:22.081 --> 01:34:23.940
<v Speaker 1>hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's going to be kicking him in the</v>

2301
01:34:23.941 --> 01:34:25.500
<v Speaker 1>stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the legs,</v>

2302
01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.110
<v Speaker 1>and it'll soften him up in the rounds or</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes long.</v>

2303
01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:31.950
<v Speaker 1>And eventually he gets a clinch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he gets a clinch may whether is</v>

2304
01:34:31.951 --> 01:34:34.230
<v Speaker 1>fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to the ground,</v>

2305
01:34:34.231 --> 01:34:36.390
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to be able to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to get mounted.</v>

2306
01:34:36.391 --> 01:34:39.840
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna get elbows force fed into his</v>
<v Speaker 1>eye socket,</v>

2307
01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:42.060
<v Speaker 1>his nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mouth,</v>

2308
01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:44.640
<v Speaker 1>his jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sides of his head,</v>

2309
01:34:44.641 --> 01:34:47.430
<v Speaker 1>his ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get elbowed in the ear.</v>

2310
01:34:47.610 --> 01:34:51.510
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get punches dropped down</v>
<v Speaker 1>on him when he's totally pinned down and</v>

2311
01:34:51.511 --> 01:34:54.300
<v Speaker 1>defenseless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to have a knee on one of his</v>

2312
01:34:54.301 --> 01:34:57.170
<v Speaker 1>biceps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While those guys literally on top of him</v>

2313
01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:59.750
<v Speaker 1>pounding him in the face and he won't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to get up do,</v>

2314
01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.270
<v Speaker 1>you won't be able to stop the crucifix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to stop anything.</v>

2315
01:35:02.271 --> 01:35:06.620
<v Speaker 1>He'll be tied up and smashed on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground until he decides to choke him,</v>

2316
01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.020
<v Speaker 1>so he's big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be completely defenseless.</v>

2317
01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.510
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odds would be insane if mayweather</v>

2318
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.040
<v Speaker 1>decided in the next two months because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight is going to take place in</v>

2319
01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:17.990
<v Speaker 1>August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he decided in the next two months,</v>

2320
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:19.770
<v Speaker 5>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like as soon am I wrong,</v>

2321
01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:20.820
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's too right.</v>

2322
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:21.890
<v Speaker 1>It's very quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2323
01:35:21.891 --> 01:35:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's on too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'd been negotiating for a long</v>

2324
01:35:24.321 --> 01:35:27.440
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least connor knows something</v>

2325
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:32.210
<v Speaker 1>about boxing or this could be a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they just took it from now and</v>

2326
01:35:32.211 --> 01:35:32.990
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>

2327
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:34.490
<v Speaker 1>two months from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have an MMA fight.</v>

2328
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The odds would be 100,000 to one like if</v>

2329
01:35:39.021 --> 01:35:41.720
<v Speaker 1>you ask like any real MMA expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

2330
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:42.890
<v Speaker 1>how fucked is he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2331
01:35:42.891 --> 01:35:45.570
<v Speaker 1>he's 100% fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent fucked.</v>

2332
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:49.190
<v Speaker 1>And boxing experts think that mayweather</v>
<v Speaker 1>is 100% fucked,</v>

2333
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:51.890
<v Speaker 1>but they'll give him a forced smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slight chance.</v>

2334
01:35:51.891 --> 01:35:53.230
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy people.</v>

2335
01:35:53.231 --> 01:35:54.290
<v Speaker 1>It's throwing punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

2336
01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Cause may mayweather can throw a punch</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2337
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And Connor Control Punch for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2338
01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2339
01:36:00.501 --> 01:36:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Most likely though me whether outboxes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2340
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:05.110
<v Speaker 1>but you could see con and landing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something could be crazy.</v>

2341
01:36:05.370 --> 01:36:07.440
<v Speaker 5>It's [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just the hardest person to light.</v>

2342
01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:08.550
<v Speaker 5>It's not just that he's the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

2343
01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.380
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's the hardest person to land a punch</v>

2344
01:36:10.381 --> 01:36:11.460
<v Speaker 5>against.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why it sounds it.</v>

2345
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:12.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

2346
01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:15.060
<v Speaker 5>he's the best defensive boxer ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2347
01:36:15.090 --> 01:36:17.250
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not too,</v>

2348
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:18.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>

2349
01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:21.510
<v Speaker 5>but I don't find it boring on a</v>
<v Speaker 5>technical level.</v>

2350
01:36:21.511 --> 01:36:25.860
<v Speaker 5>I find it boring unlike a social,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I liked the social element around a</v>

2351
01:36:25.861 --> 01:36:28.950
<v Speaker 5>fight and the excitement and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very good way to put it.</v>

2352
01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:30.450
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a good,</v>

2353
01:36:30.690 --> 01:36:32.610
<v Speaker 5>he's not like the best,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2354
01:36:32.611 --> 01:36:35.070
<v Speaker 5>you can't look at your pizza while</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're eating it cause you've got to</v>

2355
01:36:35.071 --> 01:36:37.050
<v Speaker 5>keep your eye on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like a Tyson fight.</v>

2356
01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:37.913
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2357
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyson was the best example of in a lot</v>

2358
01:36:40.881 --> 01:36:45.290
<v Speaker 1>of ways what was wrong with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>liking boxing?</v>

2359
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Cause I just want to see someone get</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughtered.</v>

2360
01:36:47.230 --> 01:36:48.063
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2361
01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:52.490
<v Speaker 1>and then Arturo Gotti and micky ward is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the other side of it.</v>

2362
01:36:52.491 --> 01:36:55.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like neither guy can slaughter the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other guy and they keep slaughtering</v>

2363
01:36:55.821 --> 01:37:00.230
<v Speaker 1>each other and coming back like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me is always been my favorite</v>

2364
01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:04.640
<v Speaker 1>kind of fight in torn personally because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how dangerous it is for them</v>

2365
01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:07.890
<v Speaker 1>cause it's such a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible experience for their body.</v>

2366
01:37:07.891 --> 01:37:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Just exchanging punch after punch after</v>
<v Speaker 1>punch.</v>

2367
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:15.610
<v Speaker 1>A guy named Tim Hague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just died this past weekend and he was a</v>

2368
01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.730
<v Speaker 1>former UFC fighter who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2369
01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:22.670
<v Speaker 1>lost in the UFC and then went over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fighting a bunch of other</v>

2370
01:37:22.671 --> 01:37:27.020
<v Speaker 1>organizations and he sustained a series</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pretty brutal knockouts,</v>

2371
01:37:27.021 --> 01:37:30.230
<v Speaker 1>like boxing thing that wasn't at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing acts like a he,</v>

2372
01:37:30.231 --> 01:37:34.880
<v Speaker 1>so he fought a bunch of mma fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had gotten knocked out many times and</v>

2373
01:37:34.881 --> 01:37:37.880
<v Speaker 1>then went in just two months after a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

2374
01:37:37.930 --> 01:37:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big knockout that he just had an April</v>

2375
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.000
<v Speaker 1>fought a boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had been knocked out in April,</v>

2376
01:37:44.170 --> 01:37:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was April.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry if I'm wrong.</v>

2377
01:37:46.670 --> 01:37:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I read.</v>

2378
01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And then he's fighting again in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing match and he's outmatch it takes</v>

2379
01:37:52.161 --> 01:37:54.650
<v Speaker 1>his fight on short notice against her</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good boxer.</v>

2380
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I think he has like a one and three</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing record someplace that's not a</v>

2381
01:37:58.621 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 1>good boxing record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy just fucked him up and bad</v>

2382
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:05.400
<v Speaker 1>and the Kao was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He apparently got knocked down several</v>

2383
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:10.401
<v Speaker 1>times in the first round and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got hit with some big bombs and</v>

2384
01:38:11.071 --> 01:38:14.400
<v Speaker 1>dropped in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bounced off the ground and he died.</v>

2385
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.210
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a very rare thing for someone to</v>

2386
01:38:18.211 --> 01:38:20.190
<v Speaker 1>die in boxing in the heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>

2387
01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:25.200
<v Speaker 1>It's usually the guys who dehydrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and then come into a fight</v>

2388
01:38:25.201 --> 01:38:26.250
<v Speaker 1>like really light.</v>

2389
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones that usually die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is pretty rare.</v>

2390
01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:34.230
<v Speaker 1>There was like a serious beating in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight between um,</v>

2391
01:38:34.710 --> 01:38:38.630
<v Speaker 1>that really bad ass Cuban guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a southpaw,</v>

2392
01:38:38.650 --> 01:38:39.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

2393
01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:41.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2394
01:38:41.821 --> 01:38:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Louise see if you could fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a top contender right now,</v>

2395
01:38:45.571 --> 01:38:49.290
<v Speaker 1>boxing in the heavyweight division,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he beat up this Russian cat and</v>

2396
01:38:49.291 --> 01:38:52.510
<v Speaker 1>fucked him up and the guy wound up being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hospital for quite a long time</v>

2397
01:38:52.511 --> 01:38:54.540
<v Speaker 1>and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe his career's over at some</v>

2398
01:38:54.541 --> 01:38:56.700
<v Speaker 1>swelling and bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bleeding on the brain,</v>

2399
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.600
<v Speaker 1>but he survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Tim is a unfortunately passed away.</v>

2400
01:39:01.110 --> 01:39:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Scary Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2401
01:39:02.641 --> 01:39:04.350
<v Speaker 1>so those fights they'd come with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2402
01:39:04.351 --> 01:39:07.950
<v Speaker 1>this is a great consequence that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't feel as spectators,</v>

2403
01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.600
<v Speaker 3>although I think people feel it now more</v>
<v Speaker 3>than ever.</v>

2404
01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.820
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Football too.</v>

2405
01:39:12.821 --> 01:39:13.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2406
01:39:13.271 --> 01:39:13.811
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2407
01:39:13.811 --> 01:39:16.090
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get over like when you hear it,</v>

2408
01:39:16.091 --> 01:39:18.790
<v Speaker 3>like just a crack of a helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

2409
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was it brain damage fighter allowed</v>

2410
01:39:21.991 --> 01:39:23.850
<v Speaker 1>to leave Madison Square Garden on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own?</v>

2411
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a homeboy's name there?</v>

2412

<v Speaker 1>Like that was the right fight,</v>

2436
01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:23.670

<v Speaker 3>Like say,</v>

2456
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:58.180
<v Speaker 3>say if like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like this is going to be the</v>

2457
01:40:58.181 --> 01:41:01.000
<v Speaker 3>future of interactive television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to have just one</v>

2458
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:02.910
<v Speaker 3>commentator till you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>

2459
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be the one who would be like</v>

2460
01:41:05.801 --> 01:41:07.480
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fine.</v>

2461
01:41:07.481 --> 01:41:08.261
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2462
01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:09.080
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it.</v>

2463
01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2464
01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:12.190
<v Speaker 3>it'd be the one who'd be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2465
01:41:12.191 --> 01:41:15.310
<v Speaker 3>I think he's cuter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the other guy is better.</v>

2466
01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:16.840
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about this?</v>

2467
01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.050
<v Speaker 3>How about maybe a guy sitting down with</v>
<v Speaker 3>his girlfriend and she's like,</v>

2468
01:41:20.051 --> 01:41:22.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to watch this fight unless</v>
<v Speaker 3>we watched Morgan's commentary and the</v>

2469
01:41:22.781 --> 01:41:23.590
<v Speaker 3>guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal,</v>

2470
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:25.000
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got it perfect.</v>

2471
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I get to watch the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to listen to Morgan.</v>

2472
01:41:27.490 --> 01:41:30.100
<v Speaker 3>Like that'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking good idea.</v>

2473
01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:33.730
<v Speaker 3>And that's not a hard setup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I talked a lot about the cut man.</v>

2474
01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love a cut man.</v>

2475
01:41:35.831 --> 01:41:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I love a closeup of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

2476
01:41:38.231 --> 01:41:41.110
<v Speaker 3>of a wound over the eye of an end swell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2477
01:41:41.410 --> 01:41:43.310
<v Speaker 3>softening down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>

2478
01:41:43.311 --> 01:41:45.460
<v Speaker 3>There's tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something soothing about it.</v>

2479
01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Now when you were boxing where you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>sparring there like a couple times a</v>

2480
01:41:49.631 --> 01:41:51.190
<v Speaker 3>little bit with like a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like not,</v>

2481
01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:55.150
<v Speaker 3>but let's just tap each other or just</v>
<v Speaker 3>really as I go with my friend amy and we</v>

2482
01:41:55.151 --> 01:41:55.900
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would,</v>

2483
01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:57.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would work out.</v>

2484
01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.260
<v Speaker 3>It was my workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used it as like a workout.</v>

2485
01:41:59.261 --> 01:42:00.710
<v Speaker 3>And then I became buddies with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2486
01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.430
<v Speaker 3>with Freddie Roach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was like at a time,</v>

2487
01:42:03.431 --> 01:42:05.110
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working at Kimmel at the time and</v>

2488
01:42:05.111 --> 01:42:06.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2489
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:07.510
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2490
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 3>12 years ago or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah.</v>

2491
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.360
<v Speaker 3>And I would just work out and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally do a little,</v>

2492
01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:15.250
<v Speaker 3>like Freddy would have to a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>sparring,</v>

2493
01:42:15.251 --> 01:42:16.900
<v Speaker 3>but it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2494
01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:19.990
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple couple of points here and then</v>

2495
01:42:20.050 --> 01:42:21.160
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2496
01:42:21.161 --> 01:42:22.420
<v Speaker 3>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was nervous.</v>

2497
01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:24.520
<v Speaker 3>I was nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spy when I was a kid.</v>

2498
01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of karate as I sparred as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

2499
01:42:26.861 --> 01:42:30.160
<v Speaker 3>I kicked some kid in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a testing and I remember the,</v>

2500
01:42:30.161 --> 01:42:31.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the coolest thing about the loud card</v>

2507

01:43:29.051 --> 01:43:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2531
01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.920
<v Speaker 3>She like could get her belts taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And stuff.</v>

2532
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:34.840
<v Speaker 3>But I brought this dude from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2533
01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:36.610
<v Speaker 3>from the wildcard is like my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2534
01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:39.610
<v Speaker 3>my corner man and we both wore a prom</v>
<v Speaker 3>dresses.</v>

2535
01:43:39.611 --> 01:43:41.260
<v Speaker 3>So she was a real fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real fighter,</v>

2536
01:43:41.261 --> 01:43:43.240
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then at one point I think I just</v>

2537
01:43:43.241 --> 01:43:44.980
<v Speaker 3>jumped on her back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

2538
01:43:44.981 --> 01:43:47.680
<v Speaker 3>And tried to like knock her down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she didn't try to hit she,</v>

2539
01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:51.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the plan was for her to try and I was,</v>

2540
01:43:51.321 --> 01:43:56.321
<v Speaker 3>my plan was for me to allow her to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then her a manager was like,</v>

2541
01:43:56.661 --> 01:43:57.740
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not allowed to.</v>

2542
01:43:58.730 --> 01:44:01.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like you legally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't allowed to hurt me.</v>

2543
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:03.410
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it'd be,</v>

2544
01:44:03.411 --> 01:44:05.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good to see you get knocked out.</v>

2545
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be my fun little,</v>

2546
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:09.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was at,</v>

2547
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:14.120
<v Speaker 3>don't you want like I get embarrassed</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I haven't done something that</v>

2548
01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:17.360
<v Speaker 3>sounds like I would like to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say I got knocked out once.</v>

2549
01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2550
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:21.110
<v Speaker 3>Don't say that someone would come and</v>
<v Speaker 3>knock you out.</v>

2551
01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here you are.</v>

2552
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:24.583
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's me.</v>

2553
01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.030
<v Speaker 3>She's picking you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2554
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Well she seems friendly.</v>

2555
01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how come you stop doing it?</v>

2556
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we stop boxing?</v>

2557
01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Good technique there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how you're a thank you.</v>

2558
01:44:39.601 --> 01:44:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Shut off the back foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Freddie Roach used to call my right,</v>

2559
01:44:43.221 --> 01:44:47.660
<v Speaker 3>the cannon and a real honor to now that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and Brian you get together narrate</v>

2560
01:44:47.690 --> 01:44:49.720
<v Speaker 3>your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2561
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't is the Canon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2562
01:44:53.031 --> 01:44:55.010
<v Speaker 3>I think I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

2563
01:44:55.210 --> 01:44:59.060
<v Speaker 3>I got like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got like depressed and stopped boxing</v>

2564
01:44:59.061 --> 01:45:02.150
<v Speaker 3>and started going to this coffee place</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>

2565
01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:02.871
<v Speaker 3>Like it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2566
01:45:02.871 --> 01:45:03.770
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit's boring.</v>

2567
01:45:03.771 --> 01:45:06.200
<v Speaker 3>I got look up the depressed stop going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the gym.</v>

2568
01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:09.170
<v Speaker 3>So the gym didn't help you with</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression?</v>

2569
01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Like no one was like a big dip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a few months away from that</v>

2570
01:45:13.761 --> 01:45:16.640
<v Speaker 3>kind of stuff and I just stopped going</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I didn't go back because it was</v>

2571
01:45:16.641 --> 01:45:20.060
<v Speaker 3>so by that time I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to,</v>

2572
01:45:20.061 --> 01:45:22.400
<v Speaker 3>but it was also that Jim became,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

2573
01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:23.930
<v Speaker 3>it's like Jeremy Pins there everyday.</v>

2574
01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:28.960
<v Speaker 3>It just became such a scene that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>became not what I had started going</v>

2575
01:45:30.111 --> 01:45:31.690
<v Speaker 3>there for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>

2576
01:45:31.691 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2577
01:45:32.871 --> 01:45:35.810
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I love it and I should absolutely go</v>

2578
01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:37.100
<v Speaker 3>back and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2579
01:45:37.101 --> 01:45:40.910
<v Speaker 3>and frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Freddie Roach been as nice to me</v>

2580
01:45:40.911 --> 01:45:43.790
<v Speaker 3>as he has been in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is one of the stranger,</v>

2581
01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

2582
01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:46.513
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2583
01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:50.270
<v Speaker 3>He had no reason to sort of take me at</v>
<v Speaker 3>any did.</v>

2584
01:45:50.271 --> 01:45:52.430
<v Speaker 3>I almost moved in next door to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildcard with Frat.</v>

2585
01:45:52.431 --> 01:45:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2586
01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.090
<v Speaker 3>he's a dear friend for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I got to go back to them,</v>

2587
01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.880
<v Speaker 3>we were going to live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to live next to the gym</v>

2588
01:45:58.881 --> 01:46:01.370
<v Speaker 3>almost for a second and the apartment</v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to the gym.</v>

2589
01:46:01.371 --> 01:46:04.670
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just in the middle of that would</v>

2590
01:46:04.671 --> 01:46:07.370
<v Speaker 3>be a crush shit at bells going off to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2591
01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:07.741
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2592
01:46:07.741 --> 01:46:09.070
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2593
01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:11.270
<v Speaker 3>But he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took me to like boxing writers,</v>

2594
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:12.650
<v Speaker 3>awards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dinners and stuff.</v>

2595
01:46:12.651 --> 01:46:14.320
<v Speaker 3>I got to meet a lot of like great pete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me.</v>

2596
01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:14.961
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2597
01:46:14.961 --> 01:46:17.960
<v Speaker 3>it was a cool time of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just sort of,</v>

2598
01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:20.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I moved to New York and I think</v>

2599
01:46:20.031 --> 01:46:23.390
<v Speaker 3>that was a big part of it too is did you</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out if Coleville of ward,</v>

2600
01:46:23.391 --> 01:46:28.110
<v Speaker 3>if they had a standing eight count,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found someone trying to describe it</v>

2601
01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:30.650
<v Speaker 3>analysis and facts and said that it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a unified rules.</v>

2602
01:46:30.690 --> 01:46:35.690
<v Speaker 3>No standing account was in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh well if a guy quits and there's no</v>

2603
01:46:35.751 --> 01:46:38.060
<v Speaker 3>standing eight count,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to think of it as a knockout.</v>

2604
01:46:38.061 --> 01:46:40.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if there's a standing eight count</v>

2605
01:46:40.801 --> 01:46:43.700
<v Speaker 3>that would have given it to them there</v>
<v Speaker 3>or what he should've done is probably</v>

2606
01:46:43.701 --> 01:46:47.540
<v Speaker 3>take a knee Kovalev probably should have</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken a knee and if you took a knee then</v>

2607
01:46:47.541 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 3>he would get a 10 count that that'll be</v>
<v Speaker 3>considered</v>

2608
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.730
<v Speaker 1>a knockdown low blows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Low blows.</v>

2609
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:53.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely,</v>

2610
01:46:54.010 --> 01:46:55.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely got hit low.</v>

2611
01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:58.700
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a couple of them that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are questionable like on the beltline</v>

2612
01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:01.050
<v Speaker 1>apparently they were saying Kovalev was</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt was pretty high.</v>

2613
01:47:01.670 --> 01:47:02.503
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2614
01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:07.600
<v Speaker 5>it's funny cause there tends to somehow</v>
<v Speaker 5>unboxing something happens be it,</v>

2615
01:47:07.911 --> 01:47:08.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2616
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:12.320
<v Speaker 5>horrific judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think happens a lot.</v>

2617
01:47:12.321 --> 01:47:17.321
<v Speaker 5>Like to allow there to be another fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it just seems to be like something</v>

2618
01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:22.790
<v Speaker 5>always fucking hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why when I have a lot of people</v>

2619
01:47:22.791 --> 01:47:27.791
<v Speaker 5>over to watch boxing and like I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate the parts of the sport that</v>

2620
01:47:28.911 --> 01:47:33.911
<v Speaker 5>seemed like it's fixed because I can</v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciate the fight as a whole.</v>

2621
01:47:33.951 --> 01:47:36.500
<v Speaker 5>Even without an outcome I think is</v>
<v Speaker 5>fixed.</v>

2622
01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:36.891
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2623
01:47:36.891 --> 01:47:38.360
<v Speaker 5>not this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just seen inboxing.</v>

2624
01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:43.480
<v Speaker 5>There always seems to be something</v>
<v Speaker 5>something happens that would make a</v>

2625
01:47:43.491 --> 01:47:45.380
<v Speaker 5>rematch more attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2626
01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.460
<v Speaker 1>But that's just the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition on a big scale like that</v>

2627
01:47:49.461 --> 01:47:54.050
<v Speaker 1>with crazy consequences like the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Klitschko Anthony Joshua fight.</v>

2628
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the consequences of f I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking chaos.</v>

2629
01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Just guys getting knocked down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get back up and knocking the other guy</v>

2630
01:48:01.011 --> 01:48:03.680
<v Speaker 1>down or holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then a kind of a controversial ending.</v>

2631
01:48:03.681 --> 01:48:04.720
<v Speaker 1>They stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2632
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:06.860
<v Speaker 1>it looked like he was defending himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think there's more</v>

2633
01:48:06.861 --> 01:48:09.560
<v Speaker 1>controversial endings and boxing than</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are in a mma?</v>

2634
01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I think people make split second</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions on the referees in the heat of</v>

2635
01:48:13.821 --> 01:48:15.590
<v Speaker 1>the moment and when you're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2636
01:48:15.591 --> 01:48:17.960
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time and it's,</v>

2637
01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:19.820
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with like there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of,</v>

2638
01:48:19.890 --> 01:48:22.370
<v Speaker 1>a lot of mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not think it's fixed.</v>

2639
01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Not by any stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think especially like with respected</v>

2640
01:48:25.911 --> 01:48:28.400
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people do have biases for</v>

2641
01:48:28.401 --> 01:48:31.940
<v Speaker 1>certain styles and there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain referees that we'll let</v>

2642
01:48:31.941 --> 01:48:35.210
<v Speaker 1>a fire defend himself further than some</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

2643
01:48:35.211 --> 01:48:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Some will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in mma,</v>

2644
01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:38.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>judges are,</v>

2645
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:40.670
<v Speaker 5>he's sitting in a similar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not,</v>

2646
01:48:40.671 --> 01:48:43.160
<v Speaker 5>but I always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always find it hard to explain to</v>

2647
01:48:43.161 --> 01:48:45.620
<v Speaker 5>friends who come over who never watched</v>
<v Speaker 5>that stuff.</v>

2648
01:48:45.621 --> 01:48:47.900
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love having people over and having</v>

2649
01:48:47.901 --> 01:48:48.681
<v Speaker 5>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

2650
01:48:48.681 --> 01:48:51.140
<v Speaker 5>the social aspect of like sports to me</v>
<v Speaker 5>is really fun.</v>

2651
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:54.680
<v Speaker 5>But when friends come over and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly see results that they don't</v>

2652
01:48:54.681 --> 01:48:57.290
<v Speaker 5>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're done with the sport,</v>

2653
01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.120
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you like it more or you can</v>

2654
01:48:59.121 --> 01:48:59.841
<v Speaker 5>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2655
01:48:59.841 --> 01:49:01.540
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that it happens.</v>

2656
01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Problem is you're a people pleaser and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get these people to like</v>

2657
01:49:04.391 --> 01:49:05.590
<v Speaker 1>something that you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2658
01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:07.540
<v Speaker 1>You should just let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them think it's fixed.</v>

2659
01:49:07.630 --> 01:49:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so many conversations with guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mmas fixed man,</v>

2660
01:49:10.481 --> 01:49:12.760
<v Speaker 1>just admitted for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I don't want to talk to you.</v>

2661
01:49:13.090 --> 01:49:15.250
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] this is a silly way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching this issue.</v>

2662
01:49:15.251 --> 01:49:16.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2663
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And you're trying to pretend like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know something so that we're right</v>

2664
01:49:19.601 --> 01:49:21.190
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fucked like this.</v>

2665
01:49:21.191 --> 01:49:24.340
<v Speaker 1>We can't have this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pretending that you've seen</v>

2666
01:49:24.341 --> 01:49:25.780
<v Speaker 1>enough eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand fighting enough.</v>

2667
01:49:25.781 --> 01:49:27.520
<v Speaker 1>You've competed in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've been hit enough,</v>

2668
01:49:27.521 --> 01:49:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you've seen people get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know enough to know when something</v>

2669
01:49:29.961 --> 01:49:32.020
<v Speaker 1>that's real and something's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2670
01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else can't figure it out.</v>

2671
01:49:33.611 --> 01:49:35.650
<v Speaker 1>But you figured out that a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights are fixed.</v>

2672
01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:37.150
<v Speaker 1>There's some fixed fights.</v>

2673
01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:38.480
<v Speaker 5>That's why like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2674
01:49:38.481 --> 01:49:39.051
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I right.</v>

2675
01:49:39.051 --> 01:49:41.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously like last five years</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been obsessed with the Golovkin</v>

2676
01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:44.240
<v Speaker 5>cause yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just a knockout artist and you</v>

2677
01:49:44.241 --> 01:49:45.200
<v Speaker 5>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2678
01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:47.830
<v Speaker 5>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's proof to it.</v>

2679
01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:48.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe with MMA too,</v>

2680
01:49:48.911 --> 01:49:53.911
<v Speaker 5>it's like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that early stoppages and</v>

2681
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:55.600
<v Speaker 5>boxing and probably more,</v>

2682
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:57.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very common.</v>

2683
01:49:57.950 --> 01:50:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Or are they calling in both sports?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just people making mistakes.</v>

2684
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:03.470
<v Speaker 1>But my point is there are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed fights.</v>

2685
01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:07.940
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] just going to be people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>do things just like there's referees and</v>

2686
01:50:07.941 --> 01:50:11.960
<v Speaker 1>NBA apparently they get busted trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch games out and trying to call</v>

2687
01:50:11.961 --> 01:50:15.920
<v Speaker 1>fouls on certain teams and they work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that bet money and they try to</v>

2688
01:50:15.921 --> 01:50:17.840
<v Speaker 1>shave points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's always gonna exist.</v>

2689
01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:20.480
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to talk to a referee and says,</v>

2690
01:50:20.481 --> 01:50:21.500
<v Speaker 1>listen buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2691
01:50:21.710 --> 01:50:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that you should fix the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2692
01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying if you see somebody get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop that motherfucker.</v>

2693
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Stop that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull that trigger a little quick and I</v>

2694
01:50:29.291 --> 01:50:32.000
<v Speaker 1>was going to be mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's that,</v>

2695
01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely that.</v>

2696
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:36.140
<v Speaker 1>But how often does it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it happens.</v>

2697
01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Pretty rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's much more people making</v>

2698
01:50:38.871 --> 01:50:40.640
<v Speaker 1>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more people in the heat of the</v>

2699
01:50:40.641 --> 01:50:43.430
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much more just the nature of the chaos</v>

2700
01:50:43.431 --> 01:50:48.140
<v Speaker 1>of combat sport competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wacky shit happens and people make</v>

2701
01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.170
<v Speaker 1>big mistakes as referees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

2702
01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:53.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like you and I make big mistakes</v>

2703
01:50:53.421 --> 01:50:55.760
<v Speaker 1>talking on a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just talking off the top of your</v>

2704
01:50:55.761 --> 01:50:56.211
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2705
01:50:56.211 --> 01:50:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make mistakes then.</v>

2706
01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:00.920
<v Speaker 1>But with a referee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making a mistake like this other</v>

2707
01:51:00.921 --> 01:51:04.490
<v Speaker 1>guy's career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for Kovalev to not recognize the</v>

2708
01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:06.470
<v Speaker 1>low blows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop the fight,</v>

2709
01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:09.470
<v Speaker 1>like the way he did Kovalev fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have taken a neat,</v>

2710
01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:09.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2711
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:10.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2712
01:51:10.491 --> 01:51:12.620
<v Speaker 5>but that's the thing is that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of these,</v>

2713
01:51:12.710 --> 01:51:15.950
<v Speaker 5>a lot of these things can lead to</v>
<v Speaker 5>another fight like that.</v>

2714
01:51:15.951 --> 01:51:19.070
<v Speaker 5>So saying it says that without the</v>
<v Speaker 5>controversy there's less attraction.</v>

2715
01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:19.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2716
01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:21.110
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to agree to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2717
01:51:21.111 --> 01:51:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Andre Ward is not going to agree to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a predetermined outcome is not</v>

2718
01:51:25.011 --> 01:51:26.330
<v Speaker 1>going to agree to a predetermined</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

2719
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:29.180
<v Speaker 1>So those two principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important parts of this</v>

2720
01:51:29.181 --> 01:51:31.760
<v Speaker 1>equation would never fucking ever agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2721
01:51:31.761 --> 01:51:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Let the other person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's not a chance in hell</v>

2722
01:51:33.921 --> 01:51:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Kovalev is just going down from</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2723
01:51:36.330 --> 01:51:36.921
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2724
01:51:36.921 --> 01:51:38.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think that,</v>

2725
01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:39.271
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2726
01:51:39.271 --> 01:51:42.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think the controversy itself</v>

2727
01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.960
<v Speaker 5>makes a rematch more attractive to our</v>
<v Speaker 5>shores.</v>

2728
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:48.620
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that somehow because it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>finished,</v>

2729
01:51:48.621 --> 01:51:49.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2730
01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:50.370
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of people do.</v>

2731
01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:50.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

2732
01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:52.920
<v Speaker 5>Boxing that guy at the party.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody.</v>

2733
01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:54.810
<v Speaker 5>Everybody at my house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like ever.</v>

2734
01:51:54.930 --> 01:51:57.300
<v Speaker 5>I also seem to invite people over for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wrong fights.</v>

2735
01:51:57.301 --> 01:51:58.110
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where you're like,</v>

2736
01:51:58.110 --> 01:51:59.550
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last one was fucking great,</v>

2737
01:51:59.551 --> 01:52:01.230
<v Speaker 5>and then you've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you have people over and it's</v>

2738
01:52:01.231 --> 01:52:02.064
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eh.</v>

2739
01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:03.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

2740
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:06.670
<v Speaker 1>That's always how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people that just,</v>

2741
01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:10.540
<v Speaker 1>they just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never competed and so like they</v>

2742
01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:12.220
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also people that want to</v>

2743
01:52:12.221 --> 01:52:14.240
<v Speaker 1>call bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to be the first person to call</v>

2744
01:52:14.250 --> 01:52:15.700
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they like,</v>

2745
01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:19.120
<v Speaker 1>they're a little itchy on the trigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling bullshit on things.</v>

2746
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:20.470
<v Speaker 1>He's always given me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2747
01:52:21.730 --> 01:52:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Contrarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of contrarians,</v>

2748
01:52:24.221 --> 01:52:26.120
<v Speaker 1>none of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of smart people are contrary.</v>

2749
01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:29.050
<v Speaker 5>Some of my smartest friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just disappointing.</v>

2750
01:52:29.051 --> 01:52:32.020
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes some of my smartest friends</v>
<v Speaker 5>were always wrong.</v>

2751
01:52:34.190 --> 01:52:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what led them to be smart and</v>

2752
01:52:35.931 --> 01:52:37.910
<v Speaker 1>curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this distrust of things,</v>

2753
01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:41.150
<v Speaker 1>but contrarians also fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2754
01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:44.360
<v Speaker 1>You see the tide going one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fuck that Thai sparring,</v>

2755
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 1>sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal sparring,</v>

2756
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:49.790
<v Speaker 3>keep it flowing a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2757
01:52:50.690 --> 01:52:51.441

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentally stimulated.</v>

2776
01:53:22.191 --> 01:53:23.840
<v Speaker 3>So it's just then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm,</v>

2777
01:53:23.841 --> 01:53:26.990

<v Speaker 3>comics,</v>

<v Speaker 3>wasn't funny.</v>

2785
01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:45.540

01:53:48.071 --> 01:53:49.850
<v Speaker 3>it's funny that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2790
01:53:49.851 --> 01:53:53.330
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things I talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most with a lot of my female comedian</v>

2791
01:53:53.331 --> 01:53:54.164
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

2792
01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:56.660
<v Speaker 3>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no part of me that would be</v>

<v Speaker 3>sexually interested in somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't a,</v>

2795
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:05.480

2796
01:54:05.481 --> 01:54:06.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2797
01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:09.860

<v Speaker 3>what night Stephen hawkings shit.</v>

2798
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'd have to just,</v>

2799
01:54:11.241 --> 01:54:12.350
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2800
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:13.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to,</v>

2801
01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:16.940
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to sound wrong,</v>

2802
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:17.960
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2803
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:21.440
<v Speaker 3>there's something fun and attractive</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2804
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:22.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2805
01:54:22.670 --> 01:54:24.650
<v Speaker 3>intellectually being put in your place.</v>

2806
01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

2807
01:54:26.170 --> 01:54:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Like you would like to be intellectually</v>
<v Speaker 3>choked.</v>

2808
01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2809
01:54:30.381 --> 01:54:32.390
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>

2810
01:54:32.391 --> 01:54:33.021
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2811
01:54:33.021 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2812
01:54:33.921 --> 01:54:34.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2813
01:54:34.890 --> 01:54:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2814
01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:39.680
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's not the popular opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because a fuck,</v>

2815
01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:43.340
<v Speaker 3>it's your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be popular if you</v>

2816
01:54:43.341 --> 01:54:46.070
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also like if somebody is,</v>

2817
01:54:47.150 --> 01:54:50.870
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to be my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if someone's great at their thing.</v>

2818
01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have no understanding of it,</v>

2819
01:54:53.691 --> 01:54:56.360
<v Speaker 3>I find that to be a track like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't necessarily always have to</v>

2820
01:54:56.361 --> 01:54:58.970
<v Speaker 3>be a comedian and someone who is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2821
01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:02.570
<v Speaker 3>brilliantly hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've been attracted to guys who are</v>

2822
01:55:02.571 --> 01:55:07.571
<v Speaker 3>just brilliant at a thing that I have</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero comprehension I how you even get</v>

2823
01:55:07.701 --> 01:55:10.880
<v Speaker 3>good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let along graded it and something fun</v>

2824
01:55:10.881 --> 01:55:12.230
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2825
01:55:12.231 --> 01:55:14.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm always fascinated by those people</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2826
01:55:14.091 --> 01:55:17.610
<v Speaker 3>But I don't find them attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2827
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Like a fur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will believe me.</v>

2828
01:55:20.061 --> 01:55:22.310
<v Speaker 3>There are things I wish I wish I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>more attracted to.</v>

2829
01:55:22.311 --> 01:55:25.310
<v Speaker 3>Like I wish I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was attracted to,</v>

2830
01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:28.340
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to money and looks and all the things</v>

2831
01:55:28.341 --> 01:55:29.120
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2832
01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I really though this is the same</v>

2833
01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:32.600
<v Speaker 3>on original.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2834
01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:38.260
<v Speaker 3>it seems like there'd be more options</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it would be easier as opposed</v>

2835
01:55:39.111 --> 01:55:43.140
<v Speaker 3>to waiting three years to find someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who just like hits the right button and</v>

2836
01:55:43.141 --> 01:55:43.930
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh God.</v>

2837

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2840
01:55:49.050 --> 01:55:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Be like tuned into someone in a mental</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

2841
01:55:53.490 --> 01:55:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Like your minds are tuned into each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other where you can speak on the same</v>

2842
01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:02.400
<v Speaker 4>terms where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can both recognize the humor in</v>

2843
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:05.310
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You both have opinions on things you,</v>

2844
01:56:05.370 --> 01:56:09.270
<v Speaker 4>you both enhance the conversations that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have.</v>

2845
01:56:09.271 --> 01:56:11.790
<v Speaker 4>Like you throw in something that makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>me laugh and I throw in something makes</v>

2846
01:56:11.791 --> 01:56:13.920
<v Speaker 4>you laugh and then boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always so much more fun.</v>

2847
01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:15.600
<v Speaker 4>It just is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2848
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:18.300
<v Speaker 4>that's how it is with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how it is with everybody.</v>

2849
01:56:18.301 --> 01:56:20.070
<v Speaker 4>That'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like what I said about bar,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like that.</v>

2853
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Like to have a friend like that as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cherished thing,</v>

2854
01:56:32.290 --> 01:56:35.730
<v Speaker 4>like to have someone that you could sit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then if you could fuck them to oh</v>

<v Speaker 4>Very rarely happens.</v>

2858
01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Christina Palicki in Thompson Jura is</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the rare ones were one of the</v>

2859
01:56:45.011 --> 01:56:49.690
<v Speaker 4>rare too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too funny comedians that get together</v>

2860
01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:51.460

<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Bonnie Mcfarlane and rich vos and other</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

2862
01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:58.180

<v Speaker 4>the throne.</v>

2863
01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Those are the two contenders for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>throne though.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's number three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do I not remember them?</v>

2874
01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:32.020
<v Speaker 4>If that's dust number three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those those three people other than that</v>

2875
01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:34.270
<v Speaker 4>who I don't know.</v>

2876
01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:35.261
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>

2877
01:57:35.261 --> 01:57:37.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's three out of 300 million</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2878
01:57:37.271 --> 01:57:41.320
<v Speaker 4>One out of 100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of this smart funny guys I know</v>

2879
01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:44.260
<v Speaker 4>don't need that in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a woman and,</v>

2880
01:57:44.261 --> 01:57:45.100
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2881
01:57:45.101 --> 01:57:48.520
<v Speaker 4>it's not my place to judge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I wish there's part of me that</v>

2882
01:57:48.521 --> 01:57:50.200
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like Ah,</v>

2883
01:57:50.201 --> 01:57:51.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how could you date her?</v>

2884
01:57:51.281 --> 01:57:55.090
<v Speaker 4>She's a fucking idiot or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not my job to judge who,</v>

2885
01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:56.710
<v Speaker 4>who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stimulates you.</v>

2886
01:57:56.711 --> 01:57:58.780
<v Speaker 4>But you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2887
01:57:59.110 --> 01:58:03.790
<v Speaker 4>it would be easier if I had more options</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2888
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:08.270
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it would be cheesy if</v>
<v Speaker 4>motion Tasha went on t and went on stage</v>

2889
01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:12.680
<v Speaker 4>with tee shirts that say one out of 100</v>
<v Speaker 4>million</v>

2890
01:58:14.490 --> 01:58:17.570
<v Speaker 4>cause that maybe that could be like</v>
<v Speaker 4>their tour name cause they really are</v>

2891
01:58:17.571 --> 01:58:21.260
<v Speaker 4>like if they're a really legitimately</v>
<v Speaker 4>hilarious couple,</v>

2892
01:58:21.261 --> 01:58:26.060
<v Speaker 4>they're both hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's maybe one out of 100 million is</v>

2893
01:58:26.061 --> 01:58:27.410
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty legit,</v>

2894
01:58:27.411 --> 01:58:28.244
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2895
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:30.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to,</v>

2896
01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:35.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe there's somebody else and I forgot</v>
<v Speaker 4>you comedians when I was like 21 and I</v>

2897
01:58:35.811 --> 01:58:36.291
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2898
01:58:36.291 --> 01:58:40.190
<v Speaker 4>they're crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't have this kind of crazy people</v>

2899
01:58:40.191 --> 01:58:43.120
<v Speaker 4>feeding off each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just doesn't seem like a wise move.</v>

2900
01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:47.440
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also it's too complicated.</v>

2901
01:58:47.441 --> 01:58:50.890
<v Speaker 4>I've seen what happens when guys data</v>
<v Speaker 4>comic and then they break up with each</v>

2902
01:58:50.891 --> 01:58:54.040
<v Speaker 4>other and then she comes around with</v>
<v Speaker 4>some new dude and the guys all bombed</v>

2903
01:58:54.041 --> 01:58:57.370
<v Speaker 4>out and like that happened with Ari and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Natasha.</v>

2904
01:58:57.740 --> 01:58:58.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2905
01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:00.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's disastrous.</v>

2906
01:59:00.590 --> 01:59:01.190
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2907
01:59:01.190 --> 01:59:02.320
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do that.</v>

2908
01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:03.970
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2909
01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:06.580
<v Speaker 4>Just be friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless,</v>

2910
01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:11.000
<v Speaker 4>unless you gotta do what you gotta do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it could work at,</v>

2911
01:59:11.001 --> 01:59:12.760
<v Speaker 4>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you're in the same scene to</v>

2912
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:13.201
<v Speaker 4>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2913
01:59:13.201 --> 01:59:18.100
<v Speaker 4>you got to work through all of your shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>around the person that hurt you and</v>

2914
01:59:18.101 --> 01:59:19.150
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2915
01:59:19.210 --> 01:59:21.280
<v Speaker 4>that's the hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you might come out of it.</v>

2916
01:59:21.281 --> 01:59:24.850
<v Speaker 4>A better person might come out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More Open minded,</v>

2917
01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.970
<v Speaker 4>more easy going more forgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just deal.</v>

2918
01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:30.890
<v Speaker 4>Just overcome positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to be,</v>

2919
01:59:30.970 --> 01:59:33.220
<v Speaker 4>I tried to be marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do my best.</v>

2920
01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't always succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do my best.</v>

2921
01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:38.790
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll,</v>

2922
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:40.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll work out.</v>

2923
01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:43.780
<v Speaker 4>It's all gonna work out except for this</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking yellow stone.</v>

2924
01:59:43.781 --> 01:59:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Think God dammit or done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of earthquakes.</v>

2925
01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:51.150

2939
02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.080
<v Speaker 4>Every time he called me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was jazz on in the background.</v>

2940
02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2941
02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:27.690
<v Speaker 4>but he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2942
02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:31.550
<v Speaker 4>very serious actor</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted,</v>

2943
02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:34.780
<v Speaker 4>he just wanted it on in the background</v>
<v Speaker 4>and put it on in the background.</v>

2944
02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.680
<v Speaker 4>Right before you called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I called someone,</v>

2945
02:00:36.681 --> 02:00:40.860
<v Speaker 4>someone's calling me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me see more sophisticated.</v>

2946
02:00:40.890 --> 02:00:43.950
<v Speaker 4>Brian callen used to leave books out on</v>
<v Speaker 4>his table that he wasn't really reading.</v>

2947
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:47.490
<v Speaker 4>I called him out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came over to his house one time and he</v>

2948
02:00:47.491 --> 02:00:49.230
<v Speaker 4>had the catcher in the rye or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

2949
02:00:49.650 --> 02:00:51.060
<v Speaker 4>sitting right on his coffee table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2950
02:00:51.061 --> 02:00:52.160
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are not reading that.</v>

2951
02:00:52.170 --> 02:00:52.981
<v Speaker 4>He started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2952
02:00:52.981 --> 02:00:56.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck do you have that here for</v>

2953
02:00:56.041 --> 02:00:57.370
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes to impress girls like,</v>

2954
02:00:57.390 --> 02:00:58.223
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew it.</v>

2955
02:00:58.620 --> 02:00:59.371
<v Speaker 4>I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

2956
02:00:59.371 --> 02:01:02.910
<v Speaker 4>it's so obvious to impress girls who</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't ask any questions.</v>

2957
02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:04.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>

2958
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:08.010
<v Speaker 4>Know like he'd ever have to defend it or</v>
<v Speaker 4>get into it or it go at,</v>

2959
02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:10.440
<v Speaker 4>what's your opinion of it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you say to grow?</v>

2960
02:01:10.441 --> 02:01:13.650
<v Speaker 4>Ask questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just Jesus Christ.</v>

2961
02:01:13.651 --> 02:01:15.450
<v Speaker 4>It seems like a disaster waiting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

2962
02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:18.330
<v Speaker 4>If you date a girl and right away they</v>
<v Speaker 4>come with the questions.</v>

2963
02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:20.360
<v Speaker 4>So what books have you read recently and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2964
02:01:20.370 --> 02:01:21.900
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus was not going to work.</v>

2965
02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:24.553
<v Speaker 8>Aye.</v>

2966
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:29.560
<v Speaker 4>Morgan Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2967
02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:32.030
<v Speaker 4>we just hit a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop talking.</v>

2968
02:01:32.410 --> 02:01:34.750
<v Speaker 4>What do we do now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just kind of rebuild momentum.</v>

2969
02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:36.810
<v Speaker 4>Talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I wish I was like a,</v>

2970
02:01:36.811 --> 02:01:39.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big exciting lady.</v>

2971
02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:40.050
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

2972
02:01:40.050 --> 02:01:43.490
<v Speaker 5>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a lot of movement.</v>

2973
02:01:43.770 --> 02:01:47.070
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the best things you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever done is that Carlos see a thing</v>

2974
02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:48.610
<v Speaker 4>where he did his material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2975
02:01:49.170 --> 02:01:51.340
<v Speaker 4>You said that you did it in 1920 would</v>
<v Speaker 4>you say 19</v>

2976
02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:55.480
<v Speaker 5>like 1912 I've tried to make it obvious</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I was fucking with people,</v>

2977
02:01:55.481 --> 02:01:58.110
<v Speaker 5>but it's not every like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2978
02:01:58.180 --> 02:02:00.960
<v Speaker 5>every few months I check,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see what's going on over there and</v>

2979
02:02:00.970 --> 02:02:03.390
<v Speaker 5>every comment is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2980
02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:07.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He does a better like it was fucking</v>

2981
02:02:07.061 --> 02:02:07.390
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>

2982
02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:08.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You dummy.</v>

2983
02:02:08.261 --> 02:02:12.610
<v Speaker 4>It says 1912 what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty obvious to the way you're</v>

2984
02:02:12.611 --> 02:02:15.760
<v Speaker 4>doing it that it's a parody that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading off a cue card.</v>

2985
02:02:15.761 --> 02:02:18.010
<v Speaker 4>I made him five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there are certain people that</v>

2986
02:02:18.011 --> 02:02:20.020
<v Speaker 4>are doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just doomed.</v>

2987
02:02:20.021 --> 02:02:21.940
<v Speaker 4>You're never going to get to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2988
02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:25.930
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's certain fish that can breathe</v>

2989
02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:28.480
<v Speaker 4>with their gills and they also can</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathe air.</v>

2990
02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.090
<v Speaker 4>They can suck air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2991
02:02:32.050 --> 02:02:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Not everybody has that ability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Everybody has the ability to</v>

2992
02:02:34.691 --> 02:02:39.691
<v Speaker 4>recognize humor or satire or just to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in certain people that are there.</v>

2993
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:43.630
<v Speaker 4>I just think they have a dull battery</v>
<v Speaker 4>for our brain.</v>

2994
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:45.260
<v Speaker 5>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2995
02:02:45.261 --> 02:02:47.360
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's more a obvious</v>

2996
02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:48.420
<v Speaker 4>pronounced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2997
02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:50.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now more than ever because of,</v>

2998
02:02:50.571 --> 02:02:51.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2999
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:53.690
<v Speaker 4>everyone's got a little bit of a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit of a voice,</v>

3000
02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:57.740
<v Speaker 4>Julia old computer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well more of a voice we get to now we</v>

3001
02:02:57.741 --> 02:03:01.910
<v Speaker 4>get to see not only how they make their</v>
<v Speaker 4>own jokes,</v>

3002
02:03:01.911 --> 02:03:06.320
<v Speaker 4>but how they respond to yours and every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the combination of both is startling.</v>

3003
02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Frightening that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also like these people are</v>

3004
02:03:09.921 --> 02:03:13.070
<v Speaker 4>illuminated now where they might've been</v>
<v Speaker 4>just in the shadows before,</v>

3005
02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.770
<v Speaker 4>some weird neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the good thing about it is it people</v>

3006
02:03:15.771 --> 02:03:17.480
<v Speaker 4>that live in those weird neighborhoods</v>
<v Speaker 4>like kids,</v>

3007
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:22.870
<v Speaker 4>they get exposed to way more shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there is such a difference between</v>

3008
02:03:23.871 --> 02:03:28.520
<v Speaker 4>when you travel and you go on the road</v>
<v Speaker 4>now and you go to a town like in the</v>

3009
02:03:28.521 --> 02:03:31.700
<v Speaker 4>middle of nowhere versus going to a town</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of nowhere in the 90s.</v>

3010
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.900
<v Speaker 4>You go to town in the middle of nowhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the 90s you were in an outlier post</v>

3011
02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:38.630
<v Speaker 4>like you were in like some mad max type</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

3012
02:03:38.631 --> 02:03:41.660
<v Speaker 4>You're doing some Minnesota Gig in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of nowhere.</v>

3013
02:03:41.690 --> 02:03:46.190
<v Speaker 4>Like these people aren't going to know</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit about the real world.</v>

3014
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:48.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're going to be trapped out</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

3015
02:03:48.021 --> 02:03:50.240
<v Speaker 4>The town's only got 5,000 people in or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

3016
02:03:50.241 --> 02:03:51.600
<v Speaker 4>You're doing like your college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3017
02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

3018
02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:57.050
<v Speaker 4>But now they might as well be living in</v>
<v Speaker 4>San Francisco.</v>

02:04:21.081 --> 02:04:26.081
<v Speaker 5>Like I am admittedly not that person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the places that I think are sort of</v>

3033
02:04:27.501 --> 02:04:28.340
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>What's the darkest place you been lucky</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of like exposure to</v>

3038
02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.440
<v Speaker 3>the light of enlightenment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3039
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:44.900
<v Speaker 3>one day I did with Henry Phillips once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3040
02:04:44.970 --> 02:04:46.890
<v Speaker 3>was in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my twenties,</v>

3041
02:04:46.891 --> 02:04:49.650

<v Speaker 3>Henry Phillips and I went like,</v>

3042
02:04:49.690 --> 02:04:51.210
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any crazy.</v>

3043
02:04:51.211 --> 02:04:53.370
<v Speaker 3>So like I don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3044
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:56.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't do the drugs that would lead to</v>
<v Speaker 3>better stories and the ones I have,</v>

3045
02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:59.370
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3046
02:04:59.371 --> 02:05:04.020
<v Speaker 3>just like where you're just sleeping on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a twin bed with another comedian in a</v>

3047
02:05:04.021 --> 02:05:08.250
<v Speaker 3>kid's room because his parents on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pizza place that you drove up to perform</v>

3048
02:05:08.251 --> 02:05:11.940
<v Speaker 3>at and there was like a 14 year old</v>
<v Speaker 3>vomiting drunk outside the went like</v>

3049
02:05:11.941 --> 02:05:13.860
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just that kind of shit where you're</v>

3050
02:05:13.861 --> 02:05:15.920
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're a grownup technically you're</v>

3051
02:05:15.921 --> 02:05:17.430
<v Speaker 3>in the 20s and just going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I,</v>

3052
02:05:18.270 --> 02:05:22.230
<v Speaker 3>what am I here for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for $50 and a six hour car ride and free</v>

3053
02:05:22.231 --> 02:05:25.410
<v Speaker 3>pizza and the kids twin bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

3054
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:29.400
<v Speaker 3>people are having a contest to see who</v>
<v Speaker 3>can piss the highest outside.</v>

3055
02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:30.990
<v Speaker 3>Like just that kind of shit where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

3056
02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:33.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I and I,</v>

3057
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:34.980
<v Speaker 3>and at one point I sort of hate it now I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

3058
02:05:34.981 --> 02:05:35.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3059
02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:40.500
<v Speaker 3>I think the friends that I have who go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and occasionally,</v>

3060
02:05:40.501 --> 02:05:41.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take me out to go with them.</v>

3061
02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Like I have so much fun now doing stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I used to,</v>

3062
02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:47.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they got tired of I think in my 20.</v>

3063
02:05:47.491 --> 02:05:48.500
<v Speaker 3>So it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

3064
02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:49.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit reading,</v>

3065
02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:53.910
<v Speaker 3>big aerated while you realize that those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things can be fun once you become a real</v>

3066
02:05:53.911 --> 02:05:55.050
<v Speaker 3>professional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

3067
02:05:55.051 --> 02:05:58.110
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so looking forward to working at</v>

3068
02:05:58.111 --> 02:06:03.111
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store or the Improv or</v>
<v Speaker 3>headlining senior name on the low,</v>

3069
02:06:03.670 --> 02:06:04.610
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the billboard look.</v>

3070
02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:07.720
<v Speaker 3>But once you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you realize like there's actually</v>

3071
02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:11.790
<v Speaker 3>fun and these places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is me freaking out about</v>

3072
02:06:11.791 --> 02:06:14.790
<v Speaker 3>this two hours I have to spend in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>shithole bar.</v>

3073
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:17.880
<v Speaker 3>I should be enjoying the fuck out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should be coming in here with a</v>

3074
02:06:17.881 --> 02:06:21.270
<v Speaker 3>relaxed attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a good time and experiencing this</v>

3075
02:06:21.271 --> 02:06:22.560
<v Speaker 3>for what it is instead of experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3076
02:06:22.590 --> 02:06:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so frustrated because I really want</v>

3077
02:06:24.871 --> 02:06:27.850
<v Speaker 3>to climb my way as being a professional</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian,</v>

3078
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:31.140
<v Speaker 3>but I'm stuck in this shit bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then once you kinda are,</v>

3079
02:06:31.290 --> 02:06:31.971
<v Speaker 3>then you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3080
02:06:31.971 --> 02:06:32.151
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3081
02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:33.570
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are actually fun.</v>

3082
02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I have my only thing with the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that bus.</v>

3107
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:33.090
<v Speaker 3>It's a bus when he has his kids out on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the road for him</v>

3108
02:07:35.370 --> 02:07:36.203
<v Speaker 3>also.</v>

3109
02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:38.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like doing too much other shit.</v>

3110
02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:40.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like being,</v>

3111
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:43.090
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm just on the road for a month,</v>

3112
02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:44.790
<v Speaker 4>that's not a healthy mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3113
02:07:45.130 --> 02:07:49.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want any weird fucking momentum</v>

3114
02:07:49.751 --> 02:07:50.710
<v Speaker 4>taking over my life.</v>

3115
02:07:50.850 --> 02:07:51.270
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3116
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:54.090
<v Speaker 5>I feel that way pr like I can't do it</v>
<v Speaker 5>alone.</v>

3117
02:07:54.150 --> 02:07:56.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I have no interest in</v>

3118
02:07:56.791 --> 02:07:59.240
<v Speaker 5>doing it alone and frankly like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3119
02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:01.033
<v Speaker 4>I can't</v>

3120
02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:04.250
<v Speaker 5>afford to headline and bring people with</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

3121
02:08:04.251 --> 02:08:06.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not that kind of a draw.</v>

3122
02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:10.310
<v Speaker 5>So I would much rather go out with</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends who can bring me do a little</v>

3123
02:08:10.311 --> 02:08:12.920
<v Speaker 5>less time and have a good time with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of friends.</v>

3124
02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:14.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's fucking,</v>

3125
02:08:14.210 --> 02:08:15.080
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not the,</v>

3126
02:08:15.081 --> 02:08:17.060
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not the,</v>

3127
02:08:17.061 --> 02:08:18.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>front lines,</v>

3128
02:08:18.051 --> 02:08:20.600
<v Speaker 5>brave way to go about standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just like,</v>

3129
02:08:20.601 --> 02:08:22.040
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've no,</v>

3130
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.590
<v Speaker 5>no interest in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3131
02:08:24.620 --> 02:08:25.940
<v Speaker 5>in suffering</v>

3132
02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:27.570
<v Speaker 4>no road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why should you,</v>

3133
02:08:28.710 --> 02:08:30.610
<v Speaker 4>why do you have to have that interest</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3134
02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:31.401
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3135
02:08:31.401 --> 02:08:32.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that there are certain people</v>

3136
02:08:32.691 --> 02:08:33.620
<v Speaker 5>who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3137
02:08:33.621 --> 02:08:34.251
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3138
02:08:34.251 --> 02:08:36.800
<v Speaker 5>you're taking the easy way out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not headlining this week.</v>

3139
02:08:36.801 --> 02:08:38.150
<v Speaker 5>You're going out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing a,</v>

3140
02:08:38.151 --> 02:08:39.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a nice,</v>

3141
02:08:39.591 --> 02:08:40.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>30,</v>

3142
02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:42.680
<v Speaker 5>30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>35 Max.</v>

3143
02:08:42.681 --> 02:08:43.580
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3144
02:08:43.581 --> 02:08:44.840
<v Speaker 5>well that's what I'm doing this week.</v>

3145
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:47.900
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who gives a fuck?</v>

3146
02:08:48.530 --> 02:08:50.690
<v Speaker 4>Why is that a bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of guys do that.</v>

3147
02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:52.070
<v Speaker 4>They do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll headline,</v>

3148
02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:53.600
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they'd go on the road and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle.</v>

3149
02:08:53.710 --> 02:08:54.221
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it,</v>

3150
02:08:54.221 --> 02:08:56.390
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that people worry about pick</v>

3151
02:08:56.391 --> 02:08:58.790
<v Speaker 4>apart just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so goddamn pointless.</v>

3152
02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:01.990
<v Speaker 4>Plus you can get the opportunity to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>out with standup.</v>

3153
02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.250
<v Speaker 4>Like why would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would you not want to do that?</v>

3154
02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:07.570
<v Speaker 4>And I figured out a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

3155
02:09:07.571 --> 02:09:09.650
<v Speaker 4>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two types of roads this road by</v>

3156
02:09:09.651 --> 02:09:11.910
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can get real loan.</v>

3157
02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:14.810
<v Speaker 4>It's depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can get very lonely or there's a road</v>

3158
02:09:14.811 --> 02:09:15.800
<v Speaker 4>with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3159
02:09:16.770 --> 02:09:18.390
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking great.</v>

3160
02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:21.210
<v Speaker 5>I remember looking at a window at like</v>
<v Speaker 5>Springfield,</v>

3161
02:09:21.211 --> 02:09:24.450
<v Speaker 5>Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like 19 or 20.</v>

3162
02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:27.890
<v Speaker 5>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just looked out the parking lot window</v>

3163
02:09:27.891 --> 02:09:29.010
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this time,</v>

3164
02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:31.890
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love stand up and I love comedy,</v>

3165
02:09:31.891 --> 02:09:32.970
<v Speaker 5>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not</v>

3166
02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:34.330
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

3167
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:38.010
<v Speaker 4>this will destroy me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did all of my gigs on the road by</v>

3168
02:09:38.011 --> 02:09:40.590
<v Speaker 4>myself until I could afford to not do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

3169
02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:42.220
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3170
02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:46.470
<v Speaker 4>right around the end of the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started taking Chris Mcguire on the</v>

3171
02:09:46.471 --> 02:09:47.400
<v Speaker 4>road with me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3172
02:09:47.410 --> 02:09:48.243
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3173
02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:50.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once I could afford,</v>

3174
02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:53.220
<v Speaker 4>and it costs money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you'd have to pay for the flight</v>

3175
02:09:53.221 --> 02:09:54.750
<v Speaker 4>and pay for the hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm like,</v>

3176
02:09:55.050 --> 02:09:58.710
<v Speaker 4>I would rather be out a few hundred</v>
<v Speaker 4>bucks here and there and have a good</v>

3177
02:09:58.711 --> 02:10:01.170
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It made the in the experience infinitely</v>

3178
02:10:01.171 --> 02:10:01.600
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

3179
02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.080
<v Speaker 5>I went to do Phoenix recently just for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>night and uh,</v>

3180
02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:08.860
<v Speaker 5>to get like some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some time in that I couldn't get an La</v>

3181
02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:11.170
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I went out there for the night to do</v>

3182
02:10:11.171 --> 02:10:13.150
<v Speaker 5>a long set and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3183
02:10:13.151 --> 02:10:15.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm bringing my friend and I realize I</v>
<v Speaker 5>either who you're trying to get,</v>

3184
02:10:15.281 --> 02:10:17.830
<v Speaker 5>her name's Chris and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>

3185
02:10:17.831 --> 02:10:18.491
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

3187
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:21.160
<v Speaker 5>where's she performed whenever I go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's my best friend from college.</v>

3188
02:10:21.161 --> 02:10:23.020
<v Speaker 5>He's really funny and she does some</v>
<v Speaker 5>standup and I was like,</v>

3189
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:24.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm bringing her with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I like,</v>

3190
02:10:25.170 --> 02:10:25.811

<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>

3191
02:10:25.811 --> 02:10:29.650
<v Speaker 5>Like it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she's more of a comedic actress who</v>

3192
02:10:29.651 --> 02:10:32.380
<v Speaker 5>does some live performance stuff and she</v>
<v Speaker 5>did fucking grade.</v>

3193
02:10:32.381 --> 02:10:33.440
<v Speaker 5>She had to do 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 minutes.</v>

3194
02:10:33.441 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 5>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was</v>

3195
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:34.933
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3196
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:38.240
<v Speaker 3>I could have brought someone who's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing comedy 12 years.</v>

3197
02:10:38.241 --> 02:10:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3198
02:10:38.610 --> 02:10:40.720
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to go with my best friend.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It makes it way better.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're in Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your home,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's the best.</v>

3206
02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:56.450
<v Speaker 3>And the camaraderie between comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like such an unusual camaraderie.</v>

3207
02:10:56.570 --> 02:10:58.760
<v Speaker 3>It's very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean he'll tell you firsthand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it just take a different airlines.</v>

3217
02:11:12.621 --> 02:11:16.760
<v Speaker 3>We had to get on like a shuttle to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere like a shuttle after the plane</v>

3218
02:11:16.761 --> 02:11:17.780
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3219
02:11:17.781 --> 02:11:21.380
<v Speaker 3>when someone doesn't like surprises like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sits on the shuttle.</v>

3220
02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:24.140
<v Speaker 3>But it's just like constant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like jokes about like,</v>

3221
02:11:24.650 --> 02:11:28.880
<v Speaker 3>like we're going to Auschwitz but like</v>
<v Speaker 3>loud Auschwitz jokes on like the,</v>

3222
02:11:28.881 --> 02:11:31.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American Airlines shuttle with like</v>

3223
02:11:31.311 --> 02:11:34.430
<v Speaker 3>people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little more sensitive to like,</v>

3224
02:11:34.431 --> 02:11:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I'll look around and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3225
02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:38.300
<v Speaker 3>we're not like tier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

3226
02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:39.140
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3227
02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:41.450
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing better than being around</v>

3228
02:11:41.451 --> 02:11:45.500
<v Speaker 3>other people who like speak your</v>
<v Speaker 3>language and you don't have to explain</v>

3229
02:11:45.501 --> 02:11:47.660
<v Speaker 3>anything ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3230
02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:49.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3231
02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:52.490
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that Doug said</v>

3232
02:11:52.491 --> 02:11:53.870
<v Speaker 3>to me once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was hilarious.</v>

3233
02:11:53.871 --> 02:11:54.890
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

3234
02:11:54.891 --> 02:11:58.940
<v Speaker 3>I think I could quit comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could never quit comedians.</v>

3235
02:11:59.070 --> 02:12:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a sensitive shit is deep.</v>

3236
02:12:05.210 --> 02:12:07.130
<v Speaker 3>I was telling him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everything goes wrong,</v>

3237
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:10.760
<v Speaker 3>he could clearly organize some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>village in Bisbee and all the comics</v>

3238
02:12:10.761 --> 02:12:12.430
<v Speaker 3>moved to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3239
02:12:12.431 --> 02:12:13.101
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3240
02:12:13.101 --> 02:12:14.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm considering,</v>

3241
02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:15.771
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

3242
02:12:15.771 --> 02:12:16.720
<v Speaker 3>I gotta have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

3243
02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:18.140
<v Speaker 3>a busy realtor.</v>

3244
02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:19.333
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

3245
02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about buying not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>

3246
02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:22.201
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to,</v>

3247
02:12:22.201 --> 02:12:23.470
<v Speaker 3>I have to be in la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

3248
02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:25.530
<v Speaker 3>my work is in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't have to be in ally,</v>

3249
02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:29.270
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't found a place that offers me</v>

3250
02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:32.390
<v Speaker 3>the way that place does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't found a place that offers me</v>

3251
02:12:32.391 --> 02:12:37.130
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't realize I miss when I'm in La,</v>

3252
02:12:37.150 --> 02:12:39.150
<v Speaker 3>like what are the second I get there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3253
02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:43.760
<v Speaker 3>it's a sense of calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a sense of reprioritizing your day</v>

3254
02:12:43.761 --> 02:12:44.960
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3255
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:48.500
<v Speaker 3>things that have nothing to do with show</v>
<v Speaker 3>business and you know,</v>

3256
02:12:48.501 --> 02:12:50.990
<v Speaker 3>being around people who aren't in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

3257
02:12:50.991 --> 02:12:52.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of my friends weirdly,</v>

3258
02:12:52.131 --> 02:12:53.960
<v Speaker 3>are not comedians like that I hang out</v>
<v Speaker 3>with everyday,</v>

3259
02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:56.090
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the other day,</v>

3260
02:12:56.091 --> 02:13:00.800
<v Speaker 3>like I was there and we had a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>like pickup basketball game plan for</v>

3261
02:13:00.801 --> 02:13:03.800
<v Speaker 3>like 9:00 AM and like eight people</v>
<v Speaker 3>showed up to watch me play this dude</v>

3262
02:13:03.810 --> 02:13:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Kenny.</v>

3263
02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:09.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just small town kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with people who seem to have figured</v>

3264
02:13:09.591 --> 02:13:12.260
<v Speaker 3>out why they're there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3265
02:13:12.290 --> 02:13:14.630
<v Speaker 3>I just really dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dig the whole vibe.</v>

3266
02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:16.940
<v Speaker 3>I dig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dig the city,</v>

3267
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:20.150
<v Speaker 3>the town or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the drive there even.</v>

3268
02:13:20.151 --> 02:13:22.670
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's a drive from La and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3269
02:13:22.671 --> 02:13:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I haven't driven from La and flying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tucson,</v>

3270
02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:26.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive like an hour and a half.</v>

3271
02:13:26.841 --> 02:13:29.840
<v Speaker 3>But I always was obsessed with like</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting a place and like Costa Rica and</v>

3272
02:13:29.841 --> 02:13:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Nicaragua or like anytime I go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>another country and I'm like,</v>

3273
02:13:32.490 --> 02:13:33.181
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>

3274
02:13:33.181 --> 02:13:34.760
<v Speaker 3>This is my spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

3275
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:35.930
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3276
02:13:37.290 --> 02:13:39.600
<v Speaker 3>You travel a lot when you were a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

3277
02:13:39.601 --> 02:13:43.290
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a part of me that is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of a problem staying still</v>

3278
02:13:43.291 --> 02:13:45.700
<v Speaker 3>because I had never knew a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3279
02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:47.280
<v Speaker 3>that kind of consistency.</v>

3280
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:50.700
<v Speaker 3>But the thing I realized about Bisbee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

3281
02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:53.520
<v Speaker 3>which again is so like Doug's thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost funny,</v>

3282
02:13:53.521 --> 02:13:56.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aye.</v>

3283
02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Aye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aye.</v>

3284
02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:01.470
<v Speaker 3>It's all those feelings that I had in</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in other countries where it was</v>

3285
02:14:01.471 --> 02:14:02.460
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's getting away,</v>

3286
02:14:02.461 --> 02:14:04.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3287
02:14:04.890 --> 02:14:06.810
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still feel like you're on the</v>

3288
02:14:06.811 --> 02:14:10.980
<v Speaker 3>outskirts and you feel like you go back</v>
<v Speaker 3>in time a little bit there,</v>

3289
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:13.650
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's something refreshing about</v>

3290
02:14:13.651 --> 02:14:15.960
<v Speaker 3>waking up and going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go get my coffee at the one</v>

3291
02:14:15.961 --> 02:14:17.730
<v Speaker 3>coffee place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go get my,</v>

3292
02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:20.310
<v Speaker 3>this kind of food at the one place has</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of food,</v>

3293
02:14:20.311 --> 02:14:22.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go get my fresh eggs from</v>

3294
02:14:22.531 --> 02:14:24.760
<v Speaker 3>the lady who has fresh eggs and come</v>
<v Speaker 3>from her chicken.</v>

3295
02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just shit that I don't do here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't even think I wanted to do</v>

3296
02:14:28.561 --> 02:14:32.230
<v Speaker 3>until I got there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3297
02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:35.470
<v Speaker 3>I like those places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Love Boulder,</v>

3298
02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:38.920
<v Speaker 3>which is much bigger than Bisbee but</v>
<v Speaker 3>still for the same reasons.</v>

3299
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:40.263
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3300
02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:44.260
<v Speaker 3>what we do specifically also like you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of crowds all the time.</v>

3301
02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:48.340
<v Speaker 3>I think there's like a real benefit to</v>
<v Speaker 3>being away from crowds and just smaller</v>

3302
02:14:48.341 --> 02:14:48.911
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

3303
02:14:48.911 --> 02:14:52.420
<v Speaker 3>it's more relaxed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also,</v>

3304
02:14:52.450 --> 02:14:54.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you go somewhere at a certain</v>

3305
02:14:54.131 --> 02:14:56.620
<v Speaker 3>number of times you meet kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are there.</v>

3306
02:14:56.621 --> 02:14:59.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously I've met a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug's friends and stuff and</v>

3307
02:15:00.970 --> 02:15:02.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you're not bothered,</v>

3308
02:15:02.801 --> 02:15:04.090
<v Speaker 3>you go from a place of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

3309
02:15:04.091 --> 02:15:06.070
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if anyone's going to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it annoys you think you're like,</v>

3310
02:15:06.071 --> 02:15:07.030
<v Speaker 3>I really like it here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're like,</v>

3311
02:15:07.031 --> 02:15:07.930
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really love it here.</v>

3312
02:15:07.931 --> 02:15:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I could have a place here.</v>

3313
02:15:10.991 --> 02:15:15.991
<v Speaker 3>So you're thinking about legitimately</v>
<v Speaker 3>picking up shop and moving to Bisbee and</v>

3314
02:15:16.091 --> 02:15:18.670
<v Speaker 3>then keeping an apartment here and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're not working like in</v>

3315
02:15:18.671 --> 02:15:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live in Brisbane and you go on the</v>

3316
02:15:21.401 --> 02:15:22.330
<v Speaker 3>road from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3317
02:15:22.331 --> 02:15:23.680
<v Speaker 3>not quite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm Ben.</v>

3318
02:15:23.681 --> 02:15:28.681
<v Speaker 3>I am thinking about having something</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent that like I will probably</v>

3319
02:15:29.921 --> 02:15:34.720
<v Speaker 3>have to be here the majority of the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the foreseeable future,</v>

3320
02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:39.220
<v Speaker 3>but I'm curious about what it'd be like</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have my own little spot that I could</v>

3321
02:15:39.221 --> 02:15:41.950
<v Speaker 3>go to when I want to and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3322
02:15:41.951 --> 02:15:43.150
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in doing it and if not,</v>

3323
02:15:43.151 --> 02:15:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I realize I can go for a weekend and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>feels like a good it,</v>

3324
02:15:45.550 --> 02:15:46.570
<v Speaker 3>you decompress.</v>

3325
02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know there's a cave for sale.</v>

3326
02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's trying to get,</v>

3327
02:15:50.890 --> 02:15:53.740
<v Speaker 3>did he see his trying to get so far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

3328
02:15:53.741 --> 02:15:56.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you are interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know me Kreischer,</v>

3329
02:15:56.291 --> 02:15:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>norm and Doug,</v>

3330

<v Speaker 3>you can't tell that seems happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then also there is a part of,</v>

3475
02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:47.190
<v Speaker 3>when a place is somebody thing you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to intrude intrude.</v>

3476
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.911

02:21:49.501 --> 02:21:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I also don't think I'll let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just love a little,</v>

3479
02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:56.990
<v Speaker 3>a little second little rustic place</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I do nothing.</v>

3480
02:21:58.020 --> 02:21:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Do I do all my nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch it.</v>

3481
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:03.750
<v Speaker 3>I'll live in your cave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you want to watch the game?</v>

3482
02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:05.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch the cave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you?</v>

3483
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No weird stuff though right now.</v>

3484
02:22:09.810 --> 02:22:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you let a comic wall watch your</v>
<v Speaker 3>house and then like are,</v>

3485
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:17.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean I might have some processed sugar</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the cave if that's like I going to be</v>

3486
02:22:17.401 --> 02:22:19.170
<v Speaker 3>a big problem for you is going to be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

3487
02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super bad for you Morgan.</v>

3488
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Keep it out of your body and keep it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my cave.</v>

3489
02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 3>I just take a picture of like Doritos in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front</v>

3490
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.690
<v Speaker 5>of your favorite places in a cave.</v>

<v Speaker 4>cave,</v>

3493
02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:34.110
<v Speaker 4>I would feel like that would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that people be trying to buy</v>

3494
02:22:34.111 --> 02:22:37.410
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is try selling it,</v>

3495
02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:42.900
<v Speaker 4>trying to sell a cave to someone who</v>
<v Speaker 4>could afford a $3 million cave like</v>
