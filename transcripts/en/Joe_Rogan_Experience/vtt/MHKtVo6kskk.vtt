<v Speaker 1>whenever I think of Europe,</v>

96
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean even though I've been to Europe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love it,</v>

97
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

98
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 3>World War II movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:08.211
<v Speaker 3>Them having to like the buckers freezing</v>
<v Speaker 3>food out of cans,</v>

100
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.700
<v Speaker 3>hearing bombs go off in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just coming down from the ceiling.</v>

101
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.513
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

102
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking the other day when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at all this crazy shit that's</v>

103
00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:23.940
<v Speaker 3>been going on in England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these terrorist attacks and uh,</v>

104
00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:28.941
<v Speaker 3>what happened in France and I was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking how long that section of the</v>

105
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:34.260
<v Speaker 3>world has been in turmoil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should always fighting.</v>

106
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 3>Always fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

107
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 3>And then I was thinking that like</v>
<v Speaker 3>America is one of the only places where</v>

108
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:44.360
<v Speaker 3>very little shit has gone down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like little things have gone down there.</v>

109
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.270
<v Speaker 3>There were obviously big at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Pearl Harbor is huge at the time,</v>

110
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.400
<v Speaker 3>but very few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then nine 11.</v>

111
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 3>And other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

112
00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>

113
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you look at Europe,</v>

114
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:56.191
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

115
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:58.470
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a part of France that's the size</v>

116
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:02.310
<v Speaker 3>of Paris that you can't go into because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many bombs.</v>

117
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.730
<v Speaker 3>There were so much munitions from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world wars.</v>

118
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh really so bad that they have like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

119
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 3>the size of parents' minds and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just musicians.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I forget where it is,</v>

128
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.080
<v Speaker 3>but there's a section of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of France that is literally the size of</v>

129
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:38.490
<v Speaker 3>Paris that people can't go into for like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred thousand years.</v>

130
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just cause it's all this like chemical</v>

131
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 3>waste just because of all the waste from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bombs and all the different fucking</v>

132
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:48.390
<v Speaker 3>missiles and rockets out guns and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>front of me until Jamie it up and I'm my</v>

136
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:59.150

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 3>But I know that this is a real place and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that there's leftover like wings</v>

138
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 3>of plans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's mostly like things they</v>

139
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:10.230
<v Speaker 3>shot at each other and unexploded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them on unexploded,</v>

140
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 3>some of them exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the waste from them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>All these fucking bombed.</v>

143
00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 3>That didn't go out on the cobblestone</v>
<v Speaker 3>streets.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That guy's there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They pulled that one.</v>

148
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Ask God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if it went off right next to the</v>

149
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:38.951
<v Speaker 3>water or water area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says founding contains certain toxic</v>

150
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 3>levels of arsenic that were 300 times</v>
<v Speaker 3>above.</v>

<v Speaker 3>abnormally high lead levels were</v>

273
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.350

<v Speaker 3>that is the opposite of inclusiveness.</v>

274
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not what we're supposed to be</v>

279
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 3>They didn't really kick them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they did is they protested,</v>

280
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:25.570
<v Speaker 3>they yelled and screamed and he felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsafe and he left the college and then</v>

281
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 3>the college got shut down due to shut</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

284
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:32.140
<v Speaker 3>People would call it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They even played the threats on the air.</v>

285
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 3>What did we threats with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was already gone.</v>

286
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.920

<v Speaker 3>the college.</v>

287
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like right wing people called,</v>

288
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.720
<v Speaker 3>they called them a bunch of commies.</v>

289
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.330
<v Speaker 3>The left like a voicemail saying I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to come,</v>

290
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:46.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to come down with my 45 magnum</v>
<v Speaker 3>you that's know too far.</v>

292
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 3>maybe 44.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He specified the round,</v>

293
00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the exact type of gun.</v>

294
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:58.951
<v Speaker 3>I have to come with a shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's just a game like,</v>

295
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

296
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the college professor got in trouble</v>

297
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.470
<v Speaker 3>like talking to these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They told him to put his hands away</v>

298
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 3>cause he was gesturing with their hands</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was,</v>

299
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 3>there were yelling out that it's a micro</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression and they got him,</v>

300
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.020
<v Speaker 3>they got him to put his hands down and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they started laughing at him.</v>

301
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like put your hands up,</v>

302
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.880
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if he could find it.</v>

303
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.960
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his bladder aggression.</v>

304
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure maybe Bret</v>

305
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.180
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein had it queued up on his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

306
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.980
<v Speaker 3>his twitter page.</v>

307
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 3>He's the professor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That word by the way,</v>

308
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 3>it was dead on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the connotative meaning now</v>

309
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:43.120
<v Speaker 3>it's become something super negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Microaggressions,</v>

310
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 3>micro aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even a small aggression.</v>

311
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Well it's like the smallest possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing you can think of in terms of</v>

312
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 3>aggression and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

313
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.333
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

314
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.950
<v Speaker 3>But if you watch the video of this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just moving his hands,</v>

315
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 3>he's just talking like this and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

316
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 3>put your hands down at your hands are</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>

317
00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they laugh at him when he</v>

318
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:02.630
<v Speaker 3>complies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They openly mocked him and laugh.</v>

319
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.550
<v Speaker 3>We're fooling with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't really believe that we turned</v>

320
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:11.060
<v Speaker 3>it into a cook there little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are little kids that you're,</v>

321
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to people who understand</v>

322
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 3>how brains develop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the big things that they always</v>

323
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:19.930
<v Speaker 3>say is the frontal lobe.</v>

324
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:24.820
<v Speaker 3>The frontal cortex doesn't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop until you're like 25 it's not</v>

325
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:26.770
<v Speaker 3>fully developed there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>

326
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 3>I was in college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>

327
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to power.</v>

328
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 3>We're learned a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how to put it into play</v>

329
00:14:33.551 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 3>yet until you just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's by the,</v>

330
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my theory and why people send</v>

331
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 3>their kids away to college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because they're fucking</v>

332
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 3>embarrassing and they don't want them</v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere near them while they're trying</v>

333
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:46.030
<v Speaker 3>to grow into real people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

334
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.610
<v Speaker 3>They're learning stuff and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

335
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.790
<v Speaker 3>we don't have anything grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think does that.</v>

336
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.733
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>

337
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Also they say for the experience of</v>
<v Speaker 3>going away,</v>

338
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:53.161
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

339
00:14:53.161 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey fucking be an awful developing thing</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean are 18 years old and you have</v>

353
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 3>very intelligent conversation with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

354
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:28.334
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

355
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.280
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of medicine and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people who are 18 who are</v>

356
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 3>basically 12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're basically like a grownup baby.</v>

357
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 3>It's not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no one's fault,</v>

358
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.790
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

359
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take some people longer to kind of get</v>

360
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 3>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

361
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 3>sort of factor all the aspects of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and make it some sort of a</v>

362
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:50.390
<v Speaker 3>manageable plan for yourself.</v>

363
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Live your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea of those kids being able to</v>

364
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.690
<v Speaker 3>run that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that principle and run that,</v>

365
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 3>the president of that school like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just tell you,</v>

366
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.280
<v Speaker 3>put your hands down and laugh at him.</v>

00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:09.860
<v Speaker 3>trump and people like small hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

369
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.220

<v Speaker 3>and the left we'll,</v>

370
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.710
<v Speaker 3>we'll attack that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

373
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.920
<v Speaker 3>I forget who comedian I used to open</v>
<v Speaker 3>mikes with any show writer.</v>

00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Now I forget who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't say that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's that we believe in.</v>

379
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.290
<v Speaker 3>So stop saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that you're going to shame the</v>

387
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:47.510
<v Speaker 3>group of humans to find the thing that</v>

<v Speaker 3>about Jim Comey that um,</v>

396
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.200
<v Speaker 3>James Comey that trump didn't like him</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget this one because the</v>

499
00:21:50.451 --> 00:21:54.260
<v Speaker 3>guy's child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was his child I think,</v>

500
00:21:54.261 --> 00:21:57.200
<v Speaker 3>or his girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who it was.</v>

501
00:21:57.201 --> 00:22:01.130
<v Speaker 3>I think it was his kid was screaming at</v>
<v Speaker 3>him to stop,</v>

502
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.230
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop.</v>

503
00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.240
<v Speaker 3>And he was beating the shit out of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>cop.</v>

504
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:06.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

505
00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:10.550
<v Speaker 3>He got out of the car with her and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a woman and she was really little</v>

506
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.030
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was pulling him over and he got out</v>

507
00:22:14.031 --> 00:22:17.750
<v Speaker 3>of the car and I don't remember the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exact chain of events,</v>

508
00:22:17.751 --> 00:22:22.550
<v Speaker 3>but I remember he was punching the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He Kod already on the ground and he</v>

509
00:22:22.551 --> 00:22:25.250
<v Speaker 3>smashed in the face a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

510
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.280
<v Speaker 3>And His kid was screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it's his kid</v>

511

513
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.620
<v Speaker 3>this is the reality of being a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let,</v>

514
00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:41.621
<v Speaker 3>this is why it's not sexist that think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's a scary thing to have a 130</v>

515
00:22:43.791 --> 00:22:48.791
<v Speaker 3>pound woman on her own out there driving</v>
<v Speaker 3>around in a cop car with a gun trying to</v>

533
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.740
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to watch.</v>

534
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Get back in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

535
00:23:43.521 --> 00:23:45.470
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of a man.</v>

536
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:51.230
<v Speaker 3>It's such a dangerous job 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a dangerous job.</v>

537
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.590
<v Speaker 3>It's such a dangerous job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to say that it's too dangerous for</v>

538
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose to say that's,</v>

539
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to quit after that,</v>

540
00:23:59.411 --> 00:24:02.150
<v Speaker 3>if she kept working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she kept working.</v>

541
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she might have brain damage</v>

542
00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:07.490
<v Speaker 3>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's horrific.</v>

543
00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a big dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I bet she was twiggy full.</v>

544
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's really,</v>

545
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 3>and I bet she was totally defenseless</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the first punch.</v>

546
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.950
<v Speaker 3>So it was just colleen clean punches</v>
<v Speaker 3>right to the face,</v>

547
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.360
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

548
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put me the damage that a big guy like</v>

549
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:28.130
<v Speaker 3>that can do to just a regular female</v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

550
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.420
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't with that because daughter too,</v>

551
00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

552
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying to be around that kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of violence when you're that little.</v>

553
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.250
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was.</v>

554
00:24:37.251 --> 00:24:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Why I think that the video showed the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid in the car out of the car.</v>

555
00:24:41.451 --> 00:24:42.284
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

556
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 3>it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean that's probably one of a</v>

557
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 3>hundred of those things that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened by the way,</v>

558
00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 3>in terms of if I felt unsafe when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>traveling,</v>

559
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.560
<v Speaker 3>that shuts here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

560
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.280
<v Speaker 3>You right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

561
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:52.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

562
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:55.910
<v Speaker 3>I was known as unsafe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Chicago.</v>

563
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I say about Mexico.</v>

564
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Like people will like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you ever go to Mexico?</v>

565
00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:03.890
<v Speaker 3>And Mexico is like mostly Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice people.</v>

566
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.230
<v Speaker 3>They're really nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Mexico is not the problem.</v>

567
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.270
<v Speaker 3>The problem is parts of Mexico border</v>
<v Speaker 3>towns,</v>

568
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.190
<v Speaker 3>some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

569
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.960
<v Speaker 3>But it's also like that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said with the Detroit,</v>

570
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.110
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem with Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's problem with a lot of places.</v>

571
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.240
<v Speaker 3>There's spots where it's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

572
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.040
<v Speaker 3>Even most of Chicago's good.</v>

573
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Chicago's great.</v>

574
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.540
<v Speaker 3>550 murders last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sick pick how many people weren't</v>

575
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 3>murdered to marine outlook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a glass half full kind of</v>

576
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:28.810
<v Speaker 3>guidelines of not murdered people</v>
<v Speaker 3>running,</v>

577
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.750
<v Speaker 3>running,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you love,</v>

580

581
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

720
00:31:29.231 --> 00:31:31.510
<v Speaker 3>South America is cause I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be more camping,</v>

721
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.300
<v Speaker 3>it seems like up and down the coast and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

722
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I can camp alone for</v>

724
00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:39.400
<v Speaker 3>that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might freak out.</v>

725
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.263
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

726
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.950
<v Speaker 3>Be Hard to get a good night's sleep</v>
<v Speaker 3>around a bunch of Weirdos.</v>

727
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.560
<v Speaker 3>Speak their language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what they look like.</v>

728
00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neat.</v>

<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

730
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.310
<v Speaker 3>they wrap it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it on their back.</v>

731
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.160
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carrie,</v>

732
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 3>that was the fucking rain off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

733
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically like just this tiny ass</v>

734
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:02.530
<v Speaker 3>little tent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like if you were a minimalist hiker,</v>

735
00:32:02.531 --> 00:32:05.410
<v Speaker 3>like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guy was trying to walk 50 miles or</v>

736
00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:06.640
<v Speaker 3>something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these guys,</v>

737
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.970
<v Speaker 3>they try to carry as a light of stuff as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can.</v>

738
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.840
<v Speaker 3>They try to go as minimal as they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's one way that they do that.</v>

739
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a lot of times I'll use like a</v>

740
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.770
<v Speaker 3>little air mattress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that dude has a little law.</v>

741
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blow it up.</v>

742
00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Don't take up any space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

743
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Just got to hope it doesn't pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you're sleeping on rocks.</v>

744
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

745
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.880
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was what everybody did to</v>

746
00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:34.000
<v Speaker 3>traveling for this backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just got to make it work.</v>

747
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Space was like a a,</v>

748
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing you learn too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I need much stuff.</v>

749
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd go down to like,</v>

750
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the backpack full of hats,</v>

751

<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

753
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a real movement right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards minimalism or where people are</v>

754
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:57.560
<v Speaker 3>trying to pair the life down as much as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

755
00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:32:59.001 --> 00:33:03.380
<v Speaker 3>involved with like banks and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>having to like mortgage themselves and</v>

757
00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:04.940
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lifestyle just for the sake of</v>

758

<v Speaker 3>camping and hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also,</v>

761
00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:12.650

<v Speaker 3>He goes and does stuff and see stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just also is lik outlook,</v>

791
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.220
<v Speaker 3>how he simplifies all the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are wrong with him and all the things</v>

792
00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 3>that are wrong with the way he interacts</v>
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>

793
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:41.790
<v Speaker 3>And so this is an I'm going to do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is good.</v>

794
00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:42.551
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

795
00:34:42.551 --> 00:34:45.680
<v Speaker 3>like he's like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his um,</v>

796
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:50.950
<v Speaker 3>story about being given lose a Ritalin</v>
<v Speaker 3>was Ritalin right from the time he was</v>

797
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:54.320
<v Speaker 3>like five fruit as a young boy.</v>

798
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.290
<v Speaker 3>They gave him Ritalin till senior year</v>
<v Speaker 3>of high school.</v>

799
00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.290
<v Speaker 3>So he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just be on these pills.</v>

800
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like all day at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

801
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.030
<v Speaker 3>like boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like crash.</v>

802
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.820
<v Speaker 3>And then they do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were dead juicing them up</v>

803
00:35:07.821 --> 00:35:12.770
<v Speaker 3>with this crazy stuff from like he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>an experimental case he grew up in,</v>

804
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 3>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's from Potomac,</v>

805
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:17.270
<v Speaker 3>Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was same county is where I grew up</v>

806
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:19.670
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was the richer part of town.</v>

807
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing was a rich kid,</v>

808
00:35:22.311 --> 00:35:25.580
<v Speaker 3>but like Montgomery County is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>richest counties in America.</v>

809
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.960
<v Speaker 3>And like that was just a standard thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your kid's not performing.</v>

810
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Ideally he's learning disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me some pills.</v>

811
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:37.330
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy that people thought for that was</v>

812
00:35:37.591 --> 00:35:40.710
<v Speaker 3>the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just uh,</v>

813
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.920
<v Speaker 3>it just fascinating that he so like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Henry so intense and he so like his,</v>

814
00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:52.221
<v Speaker 3>he's got like these rock solid test fix</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this view of the world.</v>

815

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.790
<v Speaker 3>And so the infrastructure is totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck cause everyone is testing out their</v>

932
00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.420
<v Speaker 3>weapons all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

933
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 3>we need that building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

934
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:51.550
<v Speaker 3>that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

935
00:40:51.551 --> 00:40:52.191
<v Speaker 3>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk.</v>

936
00:40:52.191 --> 00:40:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Take him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe it'll eventually like calm</v>

937
00:40:56.411 --> 00:40:58.510
<v Speaker 3>down and be like Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

938
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Because Australia was a place where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to get rid of prisoners,</v>

939
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.480
<v Speaker 3>shipped him off to Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the best people ever.</v>

940
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's exactly what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen in Liberia and they just need a</v>

941
00:41:07.721 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 3>couple of generations to knock the dust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Rid of Taylor.</v>

942
00:41:10.211 --> 00:41:10.961
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be.</v>

943
00:41:10.961 --> 00:41:11.561
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

944
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:13.960
<v Speaker 3>maybe that'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just takes a while to rebound from</v>

945
00:41:13.961 --> 00:41:15.850
<v Speaker 3>some shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

946
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:18.190
<v Speaker 3>But Henry Rollins has that of like going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a place and like,</v>

947
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.050
<v Speaker 3>let me see what this was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

948
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inspiring.</v>

949
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 3>There's not a whole lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

950
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:24.270
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

951
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Any works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like his work ethics,</v>

952
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.890
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm talking about his writing and</v>

953
00:41:29.891 --> 00:41:31.810
<v Speaker 3>what he's doing and he's always doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

954
00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 3>He was writing columns and you know,</v>

955
00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:37.550
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes and does stuff and then he comes</v>

956
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:39.770
<v Speaker 1>home and takes care of business and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

957
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:40.700
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took care of it.</v>

958
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I would do this again after my</v>

959
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:44.090
<v Speaker 1>next special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

960
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just going to just every,</v>

961
00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like once you're finished with</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

962
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I start building up again,</v>

963
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.960
<v Speaker 1>do a walkabout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

964
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you didn't see some of the world.</v>

965
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do a walk about,</v>

966
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I met a bunch of people doing gap years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a gap here?</v>

967
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's the gap year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all over every other country.</v>

969
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Just not ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that mean?</v>

970
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 1>In between high school and college?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're leaving your friends,</v>

971
00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:06.920
<v Speaker 1>you're about to make new friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

972
00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:09.680
<v Speaker 1>take it out of here for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In between college and Grad school or</v>

973
00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 1>college and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

974
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.100
<v Speaker 1>and your first year of work now is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

975
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European countries have a point in this</v>

976
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.800
<v Speaker 1>more relaxed approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this conqueror's mentality.</v>

979
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many heart attacks we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>in comparison to European people.</v>

980
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the world.</v>

1018
00:43:53.511 --> 00:43:56.030
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to keep revenue flowing,</v>

1019
00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it must keep you in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1020
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.900
<v Speaker 1>You have a certain amount of days you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to be sick.</v>

1021
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.650
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like hopefully there'll be zero.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you could set up sick</v>

1029
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:25.540
<v Speaker 1>days should be able to</v>

1034
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:41.670

<v Speaker 1>thumb of an oppressive dictator offsite.</v>

1069
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:12.290
<v Speaker 1>weird decision to make the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant thing be the productivity.</v>

1070

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Is it in the back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give it a little double check.</v>

1073
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Go through with a baseball bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell him to shut the fuck up,</v>

1074
00:46:24.061 --> 00:46:27.990
<v Speaker 1>but like walk towards them and walk out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there with your Dick in your hand.</v>

1075
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.320
<v Speaker 1>That way you startle anyone you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you always have the first mover.</v>

1076
00:46:32.321 --> 00:46:33.154
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1077
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.870
<v Speaker 1>They had to react like this guy's crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out with his dick out.</v>

1078
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

1079
00:46:38.281 --> 00:46:41.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting ready to fight and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just come out holding onto your Dick,</v>

1080
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:43.051
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1081
00:46:43.051 --> 00:46:44.970
<v Speaker 1>what's he planning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people would back down from</v>

1082
00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:47.250
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people wouldn't,</v>

1083
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:50.940
<v Speaker 1>people would be worried that Dick would</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch you,</v>

1084
00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:52.890
<v Speaker 1>but once it did touch you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we realize it really doesn't do</v>

1085
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:53.610
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1086
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:57.810
<v Speaker 1>But to be the chief people would have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lean back with their hands forward</v>

1087
00:46:57.811 --> 00:47:00.270
<v Speaker 1>and try to get as if your punches don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

1088
00:47:00.271 --> 00:47:01.610
<v Speaker 1>But the dick touching your toes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going to touch you and give</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cooties.</v>

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I could tell you all about standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know more than most people in the</v>

1162
00:49:52.961 --> 00:49:55.000
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know about hunting more than most</v>

1163
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:55.930
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1164
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1165
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 1>But you've done it more than like words</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the average person,</v>

1166
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.750
<v Speaker 1>but people who actually know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very novice.</v>

1167
00:50:02.751 --> 00:50:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always aware of it enough to be</v>

1168
00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:06.001
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1169
00:50:06.001 --> 00:50:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I know about that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1170
00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:08.770
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me some stuff about that world.</v>

1171
00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1172
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I liked doing it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then like,</v>

1173
00:50:11.981 --> 00:50:15.980
<v Speaker 1>imagine if a five year comics started</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about what standup is shut up.</v>

1174
00:50:15.981 --> 00:50:16.660
<v Speaker 1>But knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1175
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.540
<v Speaker 1>it does take a lot longer with stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like with hunting.</v>

1176
00:50:19.541 --> 00:50:20.171
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1177
00:50:20.171 --> 00:50:22.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a five year a hunter,</v>

1178
00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:24.040
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just shut the fuck up and listen to</v>

1179
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:25.720
<v Speaker 1>the people that actually know what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1180
00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Or Parrot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say it's too complicated.</v>

1181
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.350
<v Speaker 1>A hunt hunting is a super complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot involved in that.</v>

1182
00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But generally it's like Theo Vaughn</v>

1183

<v Speaker 1>climbed Kilimanjaro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He stayed at my apartment one month,</v>

1209
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it was an Edinburgh last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he stayed at my place and uh,</v>

1216
00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

1217
00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.550
<v Speaker 1>They kept me out a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that I was like talking,</v>

1218
00:51:55.551 --> 00:51:56.990
<v Speaker 1>you can stand by it because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving to New York.</v>

1219
00:51:56.991 --> 00:51:57.824
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he was like,</v>

1220
00:51:58.170 --> 00:51:59.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get an airbnb.</v>

1221
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Just stay at my place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was like two days in when I got</v>

1222
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:04.790
<v Speaker 1>out there and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made a huge mistake.</v>

1223
00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:08.660
<v Speaker 1>I should go back home two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Priya right away.</v>

1224
00:52:08.661 --> 00:52:10.220
<v Speaker 1>It's so different than him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what am I doing?</v>

1225
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.630
<v Speaker 1>This is definitely a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1226
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:16.550
<v Speaker 1>what was the initial thought behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what did you think?</v>

1227
00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this is what I need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recharge?</v>

1228
00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been wanting to see the world for a</v>

1229
00:52:20.291 --> 00:52:21.280
<v Speaker 1>while and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

1230
00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one good,</v>

1231
00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.550
<v Speaker 1>this Guy Turner brought me out to a tour</v>
<v Speaker 1>of China.</v>

1232
00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just sort of saw some of that</v>

1233
00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:32.840
<v Speaker 1>place and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so like the really the meaning of</v>

1234
00:52:32.841 --> 00:52:34.160
<v Speaker 1>the word foreign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1235
00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just way different.</v>

1236
00:52:35.931 --> 00:52:38.110
<v Speaker 1>And they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to see more of that world.</v>

1237
00:52:38.111 --> 00:52:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And I went with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with PDC to Thailand a couple of years</v>

1238
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:44.000
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went one of those full moon parties and</v>

1239
00:52:44.001 --> 00:52:45.710
<v Speaker 1>it just got more like I want to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1240
00:52:45.711 --> 00:52:48.710
<v Speaker 1>I did a Scandinavian tour last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made sure to leave days off in between</v>

1241
00:52:48.711 --> 00:52:51.170
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a really see some of the cities,</v>

1242
00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just get off and like seeing new</v>

1243
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:58.490
<v Speaker 1>new versions of the world and new</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of what people care about.</v>

1244
00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Well I think we love to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to compartmentalize and to like look at</v>

1245
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:09.341
<v Speaker 1>our specific area because I think it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of being a human until recently.</v>

1246
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Like until you could travel like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what people liked was knowing the</v>

1247
00:53:14.421 --> 00:53:17.630
<v Speaker 1>sort of security of their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know the environment well.</v>

1248
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:19.760
<v Speaker 1>They're around it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no surprises.</v>

1249
00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I got this place a lockdown down on</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe,</v>

1250
00:53:21.771 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's not adventurous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not adventurous.</v>

1251
00:53:24.021 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 1>So this new thing that people are able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do only really within the last</v>

1252
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.560
<v Speaker 1>hundred years while you could just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and travel and just,</v>

1253
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:33.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's probably world travelers</v>

1254
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:34.801
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Before for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean how many of them did it</v>

1256
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:38.330
<v Speaker 1>recreationally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1257
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.990
<v Speaker 1>so easy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1258
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:42.840
<v Speaker 1>you can stay at hostels for cheapest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

1259
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet people and have them tell you what</v>

1260
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:47.850
<v Speaker 1>there is to do where you are or where to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go or not go.</v>

1261
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.240
<v Speaker 1>When do you think that that was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>an acceptable thing?</v>

1262
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.091
<v Speaker 1>As far as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1263
00:53:52.091 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1264
00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean world travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1265
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when were you an invader?</v>

1266
00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:57.871
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1267
00:53:57.871 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And when did it become okay to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tourist?</v>

1268
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it was always sort of okay to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some guy in foreign lands if as</v>

1269
00:54:05.881 --> 00:54:09.630
<v Speaker 1>long as there by herself and not like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>invading force,</v>

1270
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.900
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to just visit somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1271
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just wonder how many people did</v>
<v Speaker 1>it no steak.</v>

1272
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Like here's what I noticed in Hong Kong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Shanghai,</v>

1273
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.980
<v Speaker 1>which our banking centers and the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would come to the shows,</v>

1274
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:24.290
<v Speaker 1>ex pats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong,</v>

1275
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you had more locals because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak English there.</v>

1276
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:27.780
<v Speaker 1>But in Shanghai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1277
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:31.410
<v Speaker 1>and it's like if you're an English</v>
<v Speaker 1>banker from London,</v>

1278
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:35.070

<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

1281
00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Instead of staying in New York or</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying in London,</v>

1282
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.340

<v Speaker 1>It's like you guys got to design them so</v>

1312
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:50.010
<v Speaker 1>he's going to make it more comfortable</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what it</v>

1316
00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.780
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sunshine,</v>

1317
00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:01.290
<v Speaker 1>the wall situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy thing when someone escaped</v>

1318
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:02.580
<v Speaker 1>from prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wham,</v>

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Wham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wham,</v>

1320
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:06.500
<v Speaker 1>and let the dogs who's wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever I wrote.</v>

1321
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine getting out of prison?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1322
00:56:09.001 --> 00:56:12.240
<v Speaker 1>That must be so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tunnel every night or finding you have</v>

1323
00:56:12.241 --> 00:56:13.920
<v Speaker 1>to find the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know the way out?</v>

1324
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:19.280
<v Speaker 1>How do you escape?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about El Chapo walks down to the</v>

1325
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:24.291
<v Speaker 1>whole that's under his toilet that goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mile plus in the ground and then pops</v>

1326
00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:27.790
<v Speaker 1>up at some goofy ass house and gets in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car and drives off.</v>

1327
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See US suckers.</v>

1328
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Is he still free as he know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1329
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:33.700
<v Speaker 1>he's back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They caught him of Chapo.</v>

1330
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:37.750
<v Speaker 1>They did something and he got injured to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened to him.</v>

1331
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:39.970
<v Speaker 1>He like hurt his leg or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that through the tunnels.</v>

1332
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've like broken his leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling and they're trying to escape.</v>

1333
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:48.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't look like he was the most fit</v>

1334
00:56:48.011 --> 00:56:51.130
<v Speaker 1>fella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's too busy running shit.</v>

1335
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To actually be running.</v>

1336
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll it if you can hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1337
00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.500
<v Speaker 1>July 18th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my netflix special comes out.</v>

1338
00:56:59.501 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 1>That's so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to El Chapo.</v>

1339
00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I checked that out with Chapo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He speaks English and when he would the</v>

1340
00:57:04.841 --> 00:57:09.841
<v Speaker 1>comedy translate to him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some of it would if it would fit</v>

1341
00:57:10.091 --> 00:57:11.830
<v Speaker 1>after they've subtitles on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1342
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.390
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I always wonder,</v>

1343
00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:16.780
<v Speaker 1>like that's one of the unique things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like learning a language.</v>

1344
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:19.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the way they structure their</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences is very different.</v>

1345
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1346
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not just this word means that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>word means this.</v>

1347
00:57:23.801 --> 00:57:24.700
<v Speaker 1>So just replaced them.</v>

1348
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting when you talked to</v>

1349
00:57:25.961 --> 00:57:27.610
<v Speaker 1>people from other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're out there and you start to</v>

1350
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:28.960
<v Speaker 1>the event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to translate their</v>

1351
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:31.780
<v Speaker 1>mistranslations easy things like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>time it is,</v>

1352
00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.100
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't realize that that's a</v>

1353
00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a question.</v>

1354
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like you just get to like,</v>

1355
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.720
<v Speaker 1>when they say five years more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means like,</v>

1356
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I've already been here five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not really,</v>

1357
00:57:43.001 --> 00:57:44.830
<v Speaker 1>so you have to understand what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>really mean.</v>

1358
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like that 72 virgins expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means.</v>

1359
00:57:48.311 --> 00:57:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Like it must glowed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>

1361
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 1>72 is like a shit load,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1362
00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a specific number.</v>

1363
00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we see a few,</v>

1364
00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:59.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like technically it means three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really it just means,</v>

1365
00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Som mungus amount,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

1368
00:58:04.441 --> 00:58:06.790

1371
00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do a whole bit about that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Seven suicide bombers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What page is this whole 72 of our</v>

1376
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:35.280
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy world to think that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people that will go into crowded</v>

1377
00:58:35.951 --> 00:58:38.040
<v Speaker 1>areas like in Manchester?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bunch of people around them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh belief for sure.</v>

1380
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:51.340

<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1381
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abuse,</v>

1382
00:58:54.101 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's physical abuse.</v>

1383
00:58:56.050 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're like have no idea what</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an extreme desire to show their</v>

1384
00:59:00.521 --> 00:59:02.260
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just think you were at war,</v>

1385
00:59:02.261 --> 00:59:04.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1387
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to break down the psychology of,</v>

1388
00:59:11.621 --> 00:59:15.580
<v Speaker 1>so when there's a suicide bomber would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be very like you would,</v>

1389
00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you would have to do a tremendous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of research before you started drawing.</v>

1390
00:59:20.651 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Any are hard to find</v>

1391
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.970
<v Speaker 3>them to talk to them too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what already done a problem.</v>

1392
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 3>The theoretical suicide bombers do not</v>
<v Speaker 3>apply.</v>

1393
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about you have to get guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1394
00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:31.630
<v Speaker 3>whose best don't go off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1395
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 3>we got to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even then,</v>

1396
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 3>like what are you going to get here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a recovered person.</v>

1397
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:38.540
<v Speaker 3>They got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got through that moment where</v>

1398
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:40.460
<v Speaker 3>they're going to blow themselves up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't happen.</v>

1399
00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Now they've sort of had a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it.</v>

1400
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:43.910
<v Speaker 3>How do you charge that guy?</v>

1401
00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1402
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do it again.</v>

1403
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I realized I was about today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you notice a different in,</v>

1404
00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:48.870
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1405
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:49.780
<v Speaker 1>in um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1406
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:52.720
<v Speaker 1>deviant sociology does a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>category for,</v>

1407
00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:54.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who attempt suicide and people</v>

1408
00:59:54.431 --> 00:59:56.950
<v Speaker 1>who commit suicide really in the psyche</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1409
00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1410
00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Because their thing is if you attempted</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1411
01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.550
<v Speaker 1>he weren't really trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ain't that hard to do.</v>

1412
01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:08.110
<v Speaker 1>You were probably trying to cry out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people who do it generally shut</v>

1413
01:00:08.111 --> 01:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>up about it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just do it without telling people</v>

1414
01:00:10.241 --> 01:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kill myself.</v>

1415
01:00:11.171 --> 01:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I want to kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody said it.</v>

1416
01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:16.360
<v Speaker 1>People say they want to kill themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good sign that they need help,</v>

1417
01:00:16.361 --> 01:00:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but that they're not going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1418
01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1419
01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.130
<v Speaker 3>is there a different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a different mentality between</v>

1420
01:00:24.131 --> 01:00:27.340
<v Speaker 3>also someone who wants to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and someone who wants to</v>

1421
01:00:27.341 --> 01:00:28.290
<v Speaker 3>literally be the</v>

1422
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>bomb that kills a bunch of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1423
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:34.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really believe in heaven and</v>

1424
01:00:34.491 --> 01:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>you're going there though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking great.</v>

1425
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wait?</v>

1426
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1427
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>you're for sure going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1428
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the Catholic confession on your</v>

1429
01:00:44.601 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>death bed and then you go straight to</v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven,</v>

1430
01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to time it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1431
01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You confess all your sins right before</v>

1432
01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:51.021
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going,</v>

1433
01:00:51.021 --> 01:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no sense left.</v>

1434
01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>You're going to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1435
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>But you don't time it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1436
01:00:54.581 --> 01:00:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really hard.</v>

1437
01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>These guys figured out the way to time</v>
<v Speaker 1>it perfectly.</v>

1438
01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>My Act of blowing myself up gets me into</v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven by the way.</v>

1439
01:01:01.581 --> 01:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>All my sets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1440
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.140
<v Speaker 1>One shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless as he blew it up,</v>

1441
01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>part of it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1442
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Right before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes to hell for eternity</v>

1443
01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>to Callis Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1444
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody from Manchester.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1445
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:19.423
<v Speaker 5>Just</v>

1446
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 3>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you do it?</v>

1447
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:26.690
<v Speaker 3>What if you do it and you think you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be in heaven and you press the</v>

1448
01:01:26.691 --> 01:01:27.740
<v Speaker 3>button,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1449
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:33.100
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden it's just you</v>
<v Speaker 3>disembodied and an infinite black room.</v>

1450
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:40.330
<v Speaker 3>It just you forever in the blackness of</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite space with no stars,</v>

1451
01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:45.790
<v Speaker 3>just you alone with nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's floating through eternity.</v>

1452
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:48.380
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1453
01:01:48.381 --> 01:01:51.890
<v Speaker 3>you can experience the blackness of</v>
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>

1454
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:55.250
<v Speaker 3>but with no stars and nothing to look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>women forever.</v>

1455
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Just you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just use your conscious</v>

1456
01:01:57.471 --> 01:02:01.760
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and realizing how huge you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

1457
01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

1458
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be pretty bad.</v>

1459
01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:05.290
<v Speaker 1>He'd go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1460
01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll come back and crazy.</v>

1461
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.220
<v Speaker 3>What would even be crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you have your consciousness</v>

1462
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:13.910
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing drove by it too.</v>

1463
01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Nothing to apply to and you're floating</v>
<v Speaker 3>through infinity and you don't have a</v>

1464
01:02:18.311 --> 01:02:19.830
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're not to bad man.</v>

1465
01:02:19.831 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

1466
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>a pretty bad punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty bad.</v>

1467
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1468
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>That would be real tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still not good enough.</v>

1469
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:32.420
<v Speaker 1>That's you should float.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unable to turn to d while you're feeling</v>

1470
01:02:33.361 --> 01:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>like you're choking on Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1471
01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>for eternity because if you can exist</v>

1472
01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>for a second way choking on a deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could exist for eternity while he</v>

1473
01:02:48.511 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>choked it out on deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1474
01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>So that should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be the punishment for</v>

1475
01:02:51.841 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>suicide bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the simpsons where</v>

<v Speaker 1>Napoleon dynamite.</v>

1578
01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this.</v>

1579
01:06:53.651 --> 01:06:56.830
<v Speaker 1>We didn't think a Bill Maher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never been a bill Marfan,</v>

1580
01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.520
<v Speaker 1>but do you think of this whole recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy of him just casually drop on</v>

1581
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:01.570
<v Speaker 1>an Bob?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1582
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to make a joke.</v>

1583
01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean it didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's trying to be naughty.</v>

1585
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:09.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

1586
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:13.520
<v Speaker 1>But they're making it seem like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something more that it's words that,</v>

1587
01:07:13.521 --> 01:07:14.950
<v Speaker 1>like you said this and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1588
01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:16.720
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said not did,</v>

1589
01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.870
<v Speaker 1>did is worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's totally not hire black people</v>

1590
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.680
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a major issue if he's never hired</v>

1591
01:07:23.681 --> 01:07:26.290
<v Speaker 1>a black person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think I've heard of that.</v>

1592
01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's like his actions aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about before the</v>

1593
01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing where the,</v>

1594
01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.900
<v Speaker 1>where they were talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clintons in Arkansas,</v>

1595
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:36.960
<v Speaker 1>in the governor's mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1602
01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:53.260

<v Speaker 3>I was told that using prison labor at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the governor's mansion was a</v>

1621
01:08:41.371 --> 01:08:44.160
<v Speaker 3>longstanding tradition which kept down</v>
<v Speaker 3>cost.</v>

1622
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.960
<v Speaker 3>Clinton rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has it.</v>

1623
01:08:45.961 --> 01:08:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Most of the workers were convicted</v>
<v Speaker 3>murderers and she became friendly with,</v>

1624
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.100
<v Speaker 3>in quotes a few of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>African American men in their thirties</v>

1625
01:08:53.101 --> 01:08:56.250
<v Speaker 3>who had already served 12 to 18 years of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their sentences.</v>

1626
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Despite their alleged friendships with</v>

1627
01:08:59.101 --> 01:09:02.130
<v Speaker 3>these men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton tells her readers we enforced</v>

1628
01:09:02.131 --> 01:09:06.930
<v Speaker 3>rules strictly and sent back to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any inmate who broke a rule despite</v>

1629
01:09:06.931 --> 01:09:10.920
<v Speaker 3>having no psychological qualification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she later asserts that these men did not</v>

1630
01:09:10.921 --> 01:09:15.030
<v Speaker 3>have inferior iqs or an ability to apply</v>
<v Speaker 3>moral reasoning,</v>

1631
01:09:15.570 --> 01:09:19.500
<v Speaker 3>but instead they may have been emotional</v>
<v Speaker 3>illiterates</v>

1632
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.760
<v Speaker 3>emotional illiterates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1633
01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:25.640
<v Speaker 3>That's what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I like how it says,</v>

1634
01:09:25.641 --> 01:09:29.630
<v Speaker 3>despite having no psychological</v>
<v Speaker 3>qualifications later asserts,</v>

1635
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.200
<v Speaker 3>despite having no ability to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

1636
01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of weird though,</v>

1637
01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 3>that slave labor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1638
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.450
<v Speaker 3>that is exactly what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1639
01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.250
<v Speaker 3>let's know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just tradition.</v>

1640
01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:40.701
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1641
01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:42.440
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean he should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's be honest.</v>

1642
01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:44.450
<v Speaker 3>Like how much are they getting paid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>

1643
01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking one pack of cigarettes a</v>

1644
01:09:46.221 --> 01:09:46.821
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:09:46.821 --> 01:09:50.360
<v Speaker 3>What did they get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did not pay inmates at all.</v>

1646
01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1647
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Clinton makes no mention of whether or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not these men received any money for</v>

1648
01:09:55.491 --> 01:10:00.491
<v Speaker 3>working for her and her husband at 2016</v>
<v Speaker 3>article for Mother Jones notes that when</v>

1649
01:10:01.311 --> 01:10:03.560
<v Speaker 3>it came to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to prison labor,</v>

1650
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:08.570
<v Speaker 3>some state states include Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas and Georgia.</v>

1651
01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:13.571
<v Speaker 3>Do not pay inmates at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Fuck on twitter.</v>

1652
01:10:14.481 --> 01:10:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Djing wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton was a direct participant</v>

1653
01:10:18.141 --> 01:10:21.290
<v Speaker 3>in what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam Sue Sway Samsung.</v>

1654

1655
01:10:23.871 --> 01:10:26.930

<v Speaker 3>slavery.</v>

<v Speaker 3>100% well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>

1658
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:34.250
<v Speaker 3>And you make them work because they did</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crime.</v>

1659
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:39.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy thing like boat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're making them work.</v>

1660
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:40.880
<v Speaker 3>That's what's crazy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1661
01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:43.700
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1662
01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:47.120
<v Speaker 3>you were your freedoms taken away and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they lock you in a box,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but they also make you work.</v>

1664
01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Send your lives aren't worth anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can make it do whatever we want.</v>

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that dude from a Phoenix makes you</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's an interesting case.</v>

1670
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:05.330
<v Speaker 3>It makes you put pink on to embarrass</v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

1671
01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do,</v>

1672
01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.850
<v Speaker 3>do you get embarrassed when you were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>pink?</v>

1673
01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:09.830
<v Speaker 3>Epic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I don't give a fuck.</v>

1674
01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:13.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big pink where I will</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally wear pink.</v>

1675
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.260
<v Speaker 3>I'll admit I'm not a big pink where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1676
01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.740

<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1677
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not scared of a color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a rational person.</v>

1678
01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:23.090
<v Speaker 3>I remember in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 1314 wearing pink ties and stuff.</v>

1679
01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:26.130
<v Speaker 3>Like she'll bring a little embarrassed</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also been like,</v>

1680
01:11:26.131 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 3>this looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then learning the word salmon makes</v>

1681
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:29.790
<v Speaker 3>it way more easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>with pink shirts.</v>

1686
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:39.630

<v Speaker 3>were drug offenders.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for one set somewhere.</v>

1853
01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:27.070
<v Speaker 1>It would be cool to perform in Cambodia</v>
<v Speaker 1>to mark that off of list.</v>

1854
01:18:27.071 --> 01:18:28.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like doing that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>next two months with the fucking bomb on</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1862
01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't need the fucking walk around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that as like my last set.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know anymore.</v>

1869
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:59.050
<v Speaker 1>What was it like the first time on stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that long break?</v>

1870
01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:01.780
<v Speaker 1>A little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell the story.</v>

1871
01:19:01.781 --> 01:19:04.720
<v Speaker 1>So I at least base myself in like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1872
01:19:04.721 --> 01:19:06.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a narrative,</v>

1874
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:10.060
<v Speaker 1>a narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less as expected.</v>

1875
01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:13.690
<v Speaker 1>But then the next day I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our gatsy was there and so Nashville,</v>

1890
01:19:40.261 --> 01:19:41.760
<v Speaker 1>or 13 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do anything from the</v>

1891
01:19:41.761 --> 01:19:43.800
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was just like,</v>

1892
01:19:43.801 --> 01:19:45.810
<v Speaker 1>what do I have new?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tried something that I thought</v>

1893
01:19:45.811 --> 01:19:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I've been on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't much.</v>

1894
01:19:47.821 --> 01:19:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I kind of shut my brain off to that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1895
01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Like instead of like writing jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>

1896
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of topics.</v>

1897
01:19:53.611 --> 01:19:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's it.</v>

1898
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:56.520
<v Speaker 1>What if you had an awesome idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just came to you?</v>

1899
01:19:56.521 --> 01:19:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know where it should bother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1900
01:19:57.511 --> 01:19:58.111
<v Speaker 1>And toss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1901
01:19:58.111 --> 01:19:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I wrote that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an idea.</v>

1902
01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

1903
01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I saw two d this hasn't worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to say it.</v>

1904
01:20:02.611 --> 01:20:05.520
<v Speaker 1>And I saw two dogs at the end of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many stray dogs out there.</v>

1905
01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:07.860
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere.</v>

1906
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And eventually it ends up on menus to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

1907
01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Just cause it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like fish man.</v>

1908
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:13.740
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1909
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you kill one to survive?</v>

1910
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Did you eat any dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not.</v>

1911
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only because I,</v>

1912
01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:22.890
<v Speaker 1>when I saw it on a menu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called [inaudible] in East Timor.</v>

1913
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a,</v>

1914
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:28.530
<v Speaker 1>they have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indonesian style of food,</v>

1915
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:31.320
<v Speaker 1>which is while ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just like windows with like food left</v>

1916
01:20:31.321 --> 01:20:33.690
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how like pizza places in New</v>

1917
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:35.490
<v Speaker 1>York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he points to a slice and they'll take it</v>

1918
01:20:35.491 --> 01:20:37.200
<v Speaker 1>and warm it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like that,</v>

1919
01:20:37.201 --> 01:20:41.550
<v Speaker 1>but they don't warm it up and it's meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like bits of fish or chicken or</v>

1920
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:43.440
<v Speaker 1>beef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that was like dog.</v>

1921
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.950
<v Speaker 1>So if it was hot out of the oven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've gone for it,</v>

1922
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but not leftover cold.</v>

1923
01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Cold Dog over rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look good though.</v>

1924
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.830
<v Speaker 1>It looked good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had ask her four times what she said.</v>

1925
01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I had to keep checking my like</v>
<v Speaker 1>translator and I was like,</v>

1926
01:20:59.131 --> 01:21:00.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're saying it wrong.</v>

1927
01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:01.411
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1928
01:21:01.411 --> 01:21:02.880
<v Speaker 1>she had an act out like walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk,</v>

1929
01:21:02.881 --> 01:21:04.470
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not a dog.</v>

1930
01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.173
<v Speaker 1>Ruff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruff.</v>

1931
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I just do chicken trying to do dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Steven Rinella was telling me</v>

1932
01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:16.041
<v Speaker 1>that they regarded as a hot food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily even just meaning spicy.</v>

1933
01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dog is like a hot food.</v>

1934
01:21:20.521 --> 01:21:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Meaning like there's like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to it.</v>

1935
01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a special energy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get from eating dog.</v>

1936
01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dark.</v>

1937
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I could say that because they seem more</v>
<v Speaker 1>like intelligent,</v>

1938
01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have seem to have feelings.</v>

1939
01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Jesus hot food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like human meat.</v>

1940
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 1>You came their souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a show with the sky where they,</v>

1941
01:21:46.111 --> 01:21:48.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shot in eight a coyote,</v>

1942
01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cook the coyote like they would</v>

1943
01:21:50.371 --> 01:21:54.330
<v Speaker 1>cook like wild game and they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened it up,</v>

1944
01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:59.520
<v Speaker 1>they burned off all the hair and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they split it and threw it over like a</v>

1945
01:21:59.521 --> 01:22:03.900
<v Speaker 1>great and cooked it on over coals just</v>
<v Speaker 1>through some seasoning on it and it's</v>

1946
01:22:03.901 --> 01:22:07.470
<v Speaker 1>crackling and cooking and then they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut pieces of this coyote off and it's</v>

1947
01:22:07.471 --> 01:22:09.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this going to,</v>

1948
01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:13.110
<v Speaker 1>why is it so disturbing when we choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>one animal?</v>

1949
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that so disturbing?</v>

1950
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that coyote any different than a</v>

1951
01:22:17.491 --> 01:22:19.530
<v Speaker 1>pig?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is totally normal.</v>

1952
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:20.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just pet wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1953
01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all boils down to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1954
01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have it.</v>

1955
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:25.920
<v Speaker 1>It's even weirder than that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's got a pet.</v>

1956
01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Coyote did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw something.</v>

1957
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's close enough to your dog.</v>

1958
01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Fuck your dog and get it pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1959
01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh we don't like that.</v>

1960
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reminds me of it's,</v>

1961
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:43.140
<v Speaker 1>it's so close to a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so close to a dog that if it fucks</v>

1962
01:22:43.141 --> 01:22:45.660
<v Speaker 1>your dog it'll make puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I went to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooster fights that seem so crazy.</v>

1964
01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Does that seem so crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fighting and rooster.</v>

2080
01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people think there is because dogs</v>

2081
01:27:35.241 --> 01:27:36.510
<v Speaker 1>are smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

2082
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.930
<v Speaker 1>but it was also bloodier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2083
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:42.260
<v Speaker 1>It was just like more like them ripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's fucking everything out.</v>

2084
01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Th Th th th the father fights of 30</v>

2085
01:27:45.921 --> 01:27:48.470
<v Speaker 1>seconds and you don't even see blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time it's just,</v>

2086
01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:50.030
<v Speaker 1>it's just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2087
01:27:52.670 --> 01:27:53.690
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2088
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.120
<v Speaker 1>in terms of animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I saw a dead animal on the side of</v>

2089
01:27:56.121 --> 01:27:57.950
<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would probably be more of a dog or</v>

2090
01:27:57.951 --> 01:27:59.240
<v Speaker 1>a rooster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on youtube.</v>

2091
01:27:59.241 --> 01:28:02.290
<v Speaker 1>They have cockfighting on Youtube Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2092
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 1>the world's Slasher Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2093
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I dvr this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's gonna hit the other one in</v>

2094
01:28:06.921 --> 01:28:09.290
<v Speaker 1>the back to move him or he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick him up and throw him towards the</v>

2095
01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:11.060
<v Speaker 1>other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they did that they're not</v>

2096
01:28:11.061 --> 01:28:12.610
<v Speaker 1>going at each other yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have to really throw them</v>

2097
01:28:12.611 --> 01:28:14.600
<v Speaker 1>towards each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So most of the time if they put a</v>

2098
01:28:14.601 --> 01:28:15.970
<v Speaker 1>rooster near rooster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>

2099
01:28:16.210 --> 01:28:17.450
<v Speaker 1>he's got a tight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2100
01:28:17.451 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 1>they'll come out to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably like,</v>

2101
01:28:18.921 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in their back foot,</v>

2102
01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:21.890
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2103
01:28:21.891 --> 01:28:26.891
<v Speaker 1>Then they go at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2104
01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:28.710
<v Speaker 1>What will start pecking the other ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

2105
01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:33.740
<v Speaker 1>So they're catching each other with</v>
<v Speaker 1>these feet and that happens a normal way</v>

2106
01:28:34.271 --> 01:28:36.930
<v Speaker 1>of fighting to say the other ones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocked that one.</v>

2107
01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.010
<v Speaker 1>That's fuck God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2108
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:39.090
<v Speaker 1>he's down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dad.</v>

2109
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.240
<v Speaker 1>They stopped that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2110
01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:44.640
<v Speaker 1>they must be both mangled though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:28:44.641 --> 01:28:46.770
<v Speaker 1>He gets tasteless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little blood pack had them.</v>

2112
01:28:48.090 --> 01:28:50.600
<v Speaker 1>The Ref has to choose when it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's called,</v>

2113
01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:51.930
<v Speaker 1>that's called it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2114
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:55.560
<v Speaker 1>That rooster got fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll fast.</v>

2115
01:28:55.561 --> 01:28:56.394
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2116
01:28:56.710 --> 01:28:58.920
<v Speaker 1>So you don't even see really how it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like barbaric.</v>

2117
01:28:58.950 --> 01:29:00.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just quick and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that well,</v>

2118
01:29:00.661 --> 01:29:02.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because covering a little strap</v>

2119
01:29:02.290 --> 01:29:03.390
<v Speaker 3>one tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Today.</v>

2120
01:29:03.450 --> 01:29:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I saw the winner or the owner of</v>

2121
01:29:05.971 --> 01:29:07.170
<v Speaker 3>the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets to eat the loser.</v>

2122
01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.410
<v Speaker 3>They take it home with them on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>bike and they're eating chicken tonight.</v>

2123
01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I went weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you think that rooster fights</v>

2124
01:29:12.811 --> 01:29:15.510
<v Speaker 3>again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw them selling a rooster up.</v>

2125
01:29:15.710 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

2126
01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:20.910
<v Speaker 3>they said he gets two months off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets to live a fun life for a while and</v>

2127
01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:22.230
<v Speaker 3>then I'll be back and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he didn't.</v>

2128
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:24.120
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes the winners get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing happened to them.</v>

2129
01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they get a little fuck to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

2130
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they both die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2131
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 3>These are the rooster houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2132
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:32.760
<v Speaker 3>That's in Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2133
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But wait a minute.</v>

2134
01:29:34.981 --> 01:29:38.370
<v Speaker 3>That looks like a dog house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks like what they do with pets</v>

2135
01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:40.260
<v Speaker 3>because they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that really roosters?</v>

2136
01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.280
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a on top of it then place under</v>

2137
01:29:43.290 --> 01:29:44.040
<v Speaker 3>for the rains.</v>

2138
01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>

2139
01:29:45.090 --> 01:29:46.540
<v Speaker 3>The places where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2140
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:50.070
<v Speaker 3>they fight dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll have like a giant yard and</v>

2141
01:29:50.071 --> 01:29:55.040
<v Speaker 3>they'll have like 10 dogs plus out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>on chains and they're all connected.</v>

2142
01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:58.860
<v Speaker 3>These little tiny houses just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really creepy because they're,</v>

2143
01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:03.000
<v Speaker 3>they're not really dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean their dogs in the sense of</v>

2144
01:30:03.001 --> 01:30:05.250
<v Speaker 3>they're at the actual animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are his dogs.</v>

2145
01:30:05.251 --> 01:30:07.740
<v Speaker 3>But there are these things like at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2146
01:30:07.741 --> 01:30:11.020
<v Speaker 3>there's no pet to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're these things that had been there</v>

2147
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:14.880
<v Speaker 3>just bred to fight and I'm sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can handle them.</v>

2148
01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:17.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's like a few commands</v>

2149
01:30:17.191 --> 01:30:19.890
<v Speaker 3>they understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their life is not about being pat</v>

2150
01:30:19.891 --> 01:30:22.830
<v Speaker 3>and love climbing on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's army.</v>

2151
01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:23.693
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's their name?</v>

2152
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:26.700
<v Speaker 3>What do they call?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie was one with the tickets cut off.</v>

2153
01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just call play is trying to fight</v>

2154
01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.300
<v Speaker 3>their Unix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what they call</v>

2155
01:30:33.301 --> 01:30:34.970
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2156
01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know.</v>

2157
01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:38.670
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2158
01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She needs to come back.</v>

2159
01:30:41.250 --> 01:30:44.720
<v Speaker 3>It takes a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This ansel and sally the unsullied.</v>

2160
01:30:44.721 --> 01:30:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2161
01:30:45.810 --> 01:30:46.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what those dogs are there.</v>

2162
01:30:46.801 --> 01:30:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Like ansel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2163
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2164
01:30:49.381 --> 01:30:51.420
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have their dicks and balls though</v>

2165
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.820
<v Speaker 3>the unsolid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with those guys is they've</v>

2166
01:30:53.821 --> 01:30:55.860
<v Speaker 3>been neutered so they can't fight that</v>
<v Speaker 3>good cause they don't have any</v>

2167
01:30:55.861 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These dogs have everything there ready</v>

2168
01:30:59.071 --> 01:31:01.580
<v Speaker 3>to rock and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just live to fight and that,</v>

2169
01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:04.740
<v Speaker 3>that moment that they get to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the only thing they're looking</v>

2170
01:31:04.741 --> 01:31:07.860
<v Speaker 3>forward to and they were brief and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>really miserable existence.</v>

2171
01:31:07.861 --> 01:31:12.120
<v Speaker 3>So the more they exercise them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more they just train them and get</v>

2172
01:31:12.121 --> 01:31:14.220
<v Speaker 3>them ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just prepping them for this one</v>

2173
01:31:14.221 --> 01:31:16.620
<v Speaker 3>moment where he gets to do what he</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually wants to do,</v>

2174
01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.990
<v Speaker 3>what he's made to do in the side of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>fault.</v>

2175
01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like that dog is bred that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've encouraged that behavior like</v>

2176
01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.650
<v Speaker 3>generation after generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like careful selection calling dogs that</v>

2177
01:31:28.651 --> 01:31:32.070
<v Speaker 3>don't fit the criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's one of the reasons why people</v>

2178
01:31:32.071 --> 01:31:34.710
<v Speaker 3>love pit bulls so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like once you have a pit bull,</v>

2179
01:31:34.711 --> 01:31:37.650
<v Speaker 3>other dogs seem so dumb because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>so smart.</v>

2180
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.260
<v Speaker 3>They're so tuned into you and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2181
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:44.250
<v Speaker 3>like I remember squeaky fromme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like a little demon.</v>

2182
01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:46.830
<v Speaker 3>She was like tuned in to me and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>would lock onto me,</v>

2183
01:31:46.831 --> 01:31:51.831
<v Speaker 3>but if any other dog got anywhere near</v>
<v Speaker 3>her and tried to take my attention,</v>

2184
01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:53.390
<v Speaker 3>she would kill it in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2185
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:56.430
<v Speaker 3>She would just want it dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like get the fuck away from him.</v>

2186
01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Like Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2187
01:31:57.450 --> 01:31:59.560
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very intense and tuned into you</v>

2188
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.620
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she,</v>

2189
01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I got her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was already,</v>

2190
01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.450
<v Speaker 3>she was a pound dog.</v>

2191
01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.270
<v Speaker 3>I got her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like 11 months old and she was</v>

2192
01:32:07.271 --> 01:32:08.560
<v Speaker 3>cut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had,</v>

2193
01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.690
<v Speaker 3>she had definitely been in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fight,</v>

2194
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.520
<v Speaker 3>whether it's an organized one or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2195
01:32:12.521 --> 01:32:14.500
<v Speaker 3>but she was a mess from the moment I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

2196
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:18.160
<v Speaker 3>She was just such a cute little dog and</v>
<v Speaker 3>loved you to death.</v>

2197
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Just couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't leave you alone.</v>

2198
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Want to sit right next to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put her head in your lab.</v>

2199
01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:25.480
<v Speaker 3>Just a big sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the sweetest dog ever.</v>

2200
01:32:25.481 --> 01:32:27.850
<v Speaker 3>But like these eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm ready to die for you eyes so that</v>

2202
01:32:31.811 --> 01:32:33.250
<v Speaker 3>the one you had to put down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2203
01:32:34.050 --> 01:32:35.410
<v Speaker 3>the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Killing my other dog.</v>

2204
01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2205
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:40.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

2206
01:32:40.571 --> 01:32:41.440
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2207
01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:44.610
<v Speaker 3>the nature is not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>

2208
01:32:44.611 --> 01:32:47.410
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've essentially been selected over</v>

2209
01:32:47.411 --> 01:32:47.951
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

2210
01:32:47.951 --> 01:32:50.350
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many generations to be incredibly dog</v>

2211
01:32:50.351 --> 01:32:55.351
<v Speaker 3>aggressive and incredibly prey driven</v>
<v Speaker 3>and almost impervious to reacting to</v>

2212
01:32:56.081 --> 01:32:56.914
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>

2213
01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so terrifying about them</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they don't care.</v>

2214
01:33:00.370 --> 01:33:00.941
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

2215
01:33:00.941 --> 01:33:03.460
<v Speaker 3>they like to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not worried about getting hurt.</v>

2216
01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:05.710
<v Speaker 3>They looking forward to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to do it.</v>

2217
01:33:05.711 --> 01:33:07.420
<v Speaker 3>They're wagging their tail and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>biting each other.</v>

2218
01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:10.240
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wag their tails,</v>

2219
01:33:10.570 --> 01:33:14.500
<v Speaker 3>they're locked faces on each other and</v>
<v Speaker 3>their tails are wagging back and forth.</v>

2220
01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Like they're having the greatest time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a thing for some like,</v>

2221
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.780
<v Speaker 3>oh see county fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They train their dogs new tricks and</v>

2222
01:33:22.781 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 3>shit and they said they've gotten to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>point where this reminds me of this,</v>

2223
01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:31.540
<v Speaker 3>where the treat they get for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for crashing the frisbee eventually</v>

2224
01:33:31.541 --> 01:33:34.840
<v Speaker 3>becomes the Frisbee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like they're trying to catch like,</v>

2225
01:33:34.841 --> 01:33:36.040
<v Speaker 3>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to grab that Frisbee.</v>

2226
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:37.600
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that I could throw it again.</v>

2227
01:33:37.601 --> 01:33:39.070
<v Speaker 3>So like I got through about the Frisbee</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2228
01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of like I get the Frisbee so I</v>

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.500
<v Speaker 3>The dead one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one of the top middle.</v>

2291
01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:04.910
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting,</v>

2292
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:07.760
<v Speaker 3>these wolves that you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although they're all just wolves,</v>

2293
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:11.960
<v Speaker 3>these wolves are wolves from Canada and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the reasons why they're so</v>

2294
01:36:11.961 --> 01:36:14.570
<v Speaker 3>big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why they've been so</v>

2295
01:36:14.571 --> 01:36:19.040
<v Speaker 3>devastating to elk populations and deer</v>
<v Speaker 3>populations that was got deer in his</v>

2296
01:36:19.041 --> 01:36:22.750
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half a second leg is the leg with the,</v>

2297
01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:25.250
<v Speaker 3>ah dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks thin too.</v>

2298
01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:29.150
<v Speaker 3>They're so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just incredibly powerful,</v>

2299
01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:32.360
<v Speaker 3>incredibly cutting killers that act in</v>
<v Speaker 3>packs.</v>

2300
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:34.490
<v Speaker 3>I love the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love it.</v>

2301
01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.270
<v Speaker 3>They can do shit in the snow where other</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals are fucked.</v>

2302
01:36:38.271 --> 01:36:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Like they can run through the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thrive and ridiculous cold</v>

2303
01:36:42.531 --> 01:36:46.220
<v Speaker 3>environments because that's when the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other animals are vulnerable and they</v>

2304
01:36:46.221 --> 01:36:50.910
<v Speaker 3>can wreck havoc on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are crazy animal man if,</v>

2305
01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:51.890
<v Speaker 3>but they look like a dog.</v>

2306
01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:56.030
<v Speaker 3>So we have this weird connection with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them where we think of them as dogs like</v>

2307
01:36:56.031 --> 01:36:58.880
<v Speaker 3>fits our friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mister [inaudible] the same way.</v>

2308
01:36:58.881 --> 01:37:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they do look nice.</v>

2309
01:37:00.650 --> 01:37:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you'd see him alone and you're</v>

2310
01:37:02.361 --> 01:37:02.661
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2311
01:37:02.661 --> 01:37:03.560
<v Speaker 3>if that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2312
01:37:03.561 --> 01:37:05.990
<v Speaker 3>with no scale off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can remember,</v>

2313
01:37:05.991 --> 01:37:07.490
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you this bit I'm doing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2314
01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:11.600
<v Speaker 3>about wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause a real encounter I had with a dog</v>

2315
01:37:11.601 --> 01:37:14.150
<v Speaker 3>and a wolf or a dog met a wolf for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first time.</v>

2316
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2317
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:16.670
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

2318
01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:20.200
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that animal is not the same animal.</v>

2319
01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:22.490
<v Speaker 3>It used to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed a bunch of wolves.</v>

2320
01:37:22.491 --> 01:37:25.340
<v Speaker 3>So they had to reintroduce wolves to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring the population back.</v>

2321
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:26.031
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2322
01:37:26.031 --> 01:37:28.520
<v Speaker 3>when they reintroduced wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they brought him in from Canada.</v>

2323
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Canadian moves her bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're Canadian.</v>

2324
01:37:32.721 --> 01:37:36.530
<v Speaker 3>People are bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a polar bears.</v>

2325
01:37:36.531 --> 01:37:38.000
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking hardier climbing up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2326
01:37:38.001 --> 01:37:38.900
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a different,</v>

2327
01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:40.780
<v Speaker 3>different sort of an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2328
01:37:40.781 --> 01:37:42.620
<v Speaker 3>you got the wrong one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got a big ass wolf.</v>

2329
01:37:42.621 --> 01:37:45.290
<v Speaker 3>It was way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't ever just like go off</v>

2330
01:37:45.291 --> 01:37:47.900
<v Speaker 3>because they'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll wait for you to be alone while</v>

2331
01:37:47.901 --> 01:37:51.170
<v Speaker 3>they definitely could if they chose to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time they avoid the fuck out</v>

2332
01:37:51.171 --> 01:37:53.390
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They seem to know that if they fuck up</v>

2333
01:37:53.391 --> 01:37:56.460
<v Speaker 3>and do something to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then will it start coming and then</v>

2334
01:37:56.461 --> 01:37:58.620
<v Speaker 3>everybody dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're smart enough to kind of</v>

2335
01:37:58.621 --> 01:38:02.310
<v Speaker 3>understand that they are not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they wouldn't,</v>

2336
01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:05.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't do anything that you would</v>

2337
01:38:05.581 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 3>think would be extraordinary from an</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

2338
01:38:07.861 --> 01:38:09.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they have like superhuman</v>
<v Speaker 3>powers,</v>

2339
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:14.990
<v Speaker 3>but they have an unusual ability to plan</v>
<v Speaker 3>and coordinate and they talk to each</v>

2340
01:38:15.211 --> 01:38:17.460
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They yell out and talk to each other and</v>

2341
01:38:17.461 --> 01:38:19.770
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give locations and they all kind of</v>

2342
01:38:19.771 --> 01:38:23.970
<v Speaker 3>intuitively understand what the task is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when they're operating together,</v>

2343
01:38:23.971 --> 01:38:26.010
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty stunning to watch,</v>

2344
01:38:26.011 --> 01:38:27.420
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched a bunch of videos.</v>

2345
01:38:27.421 --> 01:38:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never in real life obviously,</v>

2346
01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:32.460
<v Speaker 3>but a bunch of videos of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>coordinating like an attack on,</v>

2347
01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.680
<v Speaker 3>on animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2348
01:38:34.681 --> 01:38:35.400
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

2349
01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.710
<v Speaker 1>we heard were I had a um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which campsite?</v>

2350
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Malleable Creek State Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard coyotes or wolves.</v>

2351
01:38:41.410 --> 01:38:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2352
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:45.530
<v Speaker 1>but I just liked the way they were like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of talking to each other too.</v>

2353
01:38:46.090 --> 01:38:51.090
<v Speaker 1>We saw a skunk or first we s we sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>smelled one and we heard to coyote is</v>

2354
01:38:51.501 --> 01:38:54.970
<v Speaker 1>kinda like yelping and we're like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got sprayed by a skunk.</v>

2355
01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

2356
01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:57.880
<v Speaker 1>We're just filling this and we have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

2357
01:38:57.910 --> 01:39:01.330
<v Speaker 1>But it's really seemed like that hearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them or like just a couple of them.</v>

2358
01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.930
<v Speaker 1>And then later we saw skunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2359
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:07.720
<v Speaker 1>tried to spray us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have much and we think that's the</v>

2360
01:39:07.721 --> 01:39:11.350
<v Speaker 1>same skunk that like sprayed out and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got nothing left in the tank.</v>

2361
01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Does that work like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2362
01:39:14.050 --> 01:39:16.810
<v Speaker 1>This is what we all think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like a little bit later,</v>

2363
01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just kind of kind of like came with</v>

01:39:19.301 --> 01:39:20.550
<v Speaker 1>us but didn't like he tried to spray.</v>

2365

<v Speaker 1>Not enough where it's like terrible.</v>

2370
01:39:32.890 --> 01:39:36.480
<v Speaker 1>It was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we heard like 10 or 15 coyotes</v>

2371
01:39:36.490 --> 01:39:38.690
<v Speaker 1>all howling.</v>

2421
01:41:25.541 --> 01:41:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Scott movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alien.</v>

2422
01:41:26.730 --> 01:41:28.960
<v Speaker 3>It would open its mouth and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>slime and everything.</v>

2423
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:30.230
<v Speaker 3>They have all this bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their mouths.</v>

2424
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:32.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a bit,</v>

2425
01:41:32.171 --> 01:41:33.340
<v Speaker 3>you're going to still going to lose your</v>
<v Speaker 3>leg.</v>

2426
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:37.570
<v Speaker 3>We've gone over this at least twice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always forget which it is that they</v>

2427
01:41:37.571 --> 01:41:41.320
<v Speaker 3>used to think that it was a toxin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they think it's bacteria or they</v>

2428
01:41:41.321 --> 01:41:43.840
<v Speaker 3>used to think it was bacteria and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think it's a toxin.</v>

2429
01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted the bacteria.</v>

2430
01:41:45.730 --> 01:41:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a botulism,</v>

2431
01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:52.060
<v Speaker 3>lots of different types of bacteria in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their saliva and it's toxic and they</v>

2432
01:41:52.061 --> 01:41:54.430
<v Speaker 3>know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they'll bite an animal and fuck</v>

2433
01:41:54.431 --> 01:41:57.550
<v Speaker 3>it up and then they'll follow it around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was reading this thing about a</v>

2434
01:41:57.551 --> 01:42:00.040
<v Speaker 3>water buffalo that this Komodo dragon</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacked.</v>

2435
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:01.090
<v Speaker 3>They saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bite it,</v>

2436
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:03.190
<v Speaker 3>and then it followed it for like two</v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

2437
01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Really just waiting for it to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this button,</v>

2438
01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 3>this guy I met and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's somewhere deep in.</v>

2439
01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Flora's yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this little hobbit people that they</v>

2445
01:42:22.121 --> 01:42:23.290
<v Speaker 3>discovered.</v>

2446
01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they discovered that within the last</v>

2447
01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:29.470
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say 14,000 years ago.</v>

2448
01:42:29.471 --> 01:42:32.800
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in the last 14,000 years</v>

2449
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:33.940
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's somewhere in that range.</v>

2450
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Humans shared time on earth with another</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of human being.</v>

2451
01:42:38.741 --> 01:42:41.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a little tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three foot tall human being that had</v>

2452
01:42:41.621 --> 01:42:43.990
<v Speaker 3>completely different features than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2453
01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Really Contract Homo Floresiensis or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida.</v>

2454
01:42:47.490 --> 01:42:49.690
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>12,000 years ago?</v>

2455
01:42:49.691 --> 01:42:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2456
01:42:50.561 --> 01:42:52.740
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing 12,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm,</v>

2457
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm trying to imagine plus as</v>
<v Speaker 3>long did they were,</v>

2458
01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:59.920
<v Speaker 3>those people were just like us 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and they were a tiny little</v>

2459
01:42:59.921 --> 01:43:01.240
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost like a,</v>

2460
01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:04.570
<v Speaker 3>like a cross between a human and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chimp.</v>

2461
01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:07.150
<v Speaker 3>They don't really know exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 3>their skin color was.</v>

2462
01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:09.310
<v Speaker 3>What did it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put it next to a drawing of a full</v>

2463
01:43:09.311 --> 01:43:10.121
<v Speaker 3>grown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now,</v>

2464
01:43:10.121 --> 01:43:12.760
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's shredded and he's jacked.</v>

2465
01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:14.880
<v Speaker 3>He's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fuck this whole perfect</v>

2466
01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:16.480
<v Speaker 3>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't it ever eat fast food?</v>

2467
01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Troll some Dick and this little critter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2468
01:43:19.210 --> 01:43:21.490
<v Speaker 3>There's even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was even speculation that they had</v>

2469
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:25.480
<v Speaker 3>eaten humans or attacked humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they bred with us and</v>

2470
01:43:25.481 --> 01:43:28.750
<v Speaker 3>that's why they're shorter out in Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you know?</v>

2471
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:30.090
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that one,</v>

2472
01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:32.800
<v Speaker 3>the drawing and the far left Jamie with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy holding a spear.</v>

2473
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:36.500
<v Speaker 3>That's what they think you live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's a full size version of that</v>

2474
01:43:36.501 --> 01:43:38.890
<v Speaker 3>and see if he could find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

2475
01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:43.420
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these were like all most like what we</v>

2476
01:43:43.421 --> 01:43:46.390
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess when we were on our way up the</v>

2477
01:43:46.391 --> 01:43:48.020
<v Speaker 3>food and they just developed a chain.</v>

2478
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well all three Australia kiss or</v>

2479
01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:54.290
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of our earliest ancestors.</v>

2480
01:43:55.450 --> 01:43:56.600
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2481
01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Well Australopithecus is like a modern</v>
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

2482
01:43:59.751 --> 01:44:03.050
<v Speaker 3>but like the one of the first versions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2483
01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it a million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm probably just making that number</v>

2484
01:44:06.351 --> 01:44:08.090
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2485
01:44:08.091 --> 01:44:10.220
<v Speaker 3>human beings in this form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

2486
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:11.930
<v Speaker 3>they don't know the exact number</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

2487
01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:15.890
<v Speaker 3>but they think we've been around in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>forum for only about a quarter million</v>

2488
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:18.920
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give or take a few little dragons have</v>

2489
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:20.520
<v Speaker 3>venom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do have.</v>

2490
01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.513
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

2491
01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the use of thing,</v>

2492
01:44:22.611 --> 01:44:23.990
<v Speaker 3>it was bacteria and now they think it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was van.</v>

2493
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you his picture.</v>

2494
01:44:24.841 --> 01:44:25.700
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw it one way.</v>

2495
01:44:25.701 --> 01:44:28.990
<v Speaker 3>So I went on a rock and you'd go like</v>
<v Speaker 3>right behind like some bro,</v>

2496
01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.980
<v Speaker 3>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some leaves and like some,</v>

2497
01:44:30.981 --> 01:44:33.150
<v Speaker 3>some branches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get an up close to him and it</v>

2498
01:44:33.151 --> 01:44:35.360
<v Speaker 3>still sort of scary cause you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably get through the branches but</v>

2499
01:44:35.361 --> 01:44:36.590
<v Speaker 3>probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2500
01:44:37.190 --> 01:44:39.530
<v Speaker 3>and you could just take a picture from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mick that close all this Hawaiian was</v>

2501
01:44:39.531 --> 01:44:40.364
<v Speaker 3>coming out.</v>

2502
01:44:41.690 --> 01:44:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I show you this at the store one night.</v>

2503
01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine the horror that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would feel if a Kimono Jag and was</v>

2504
01:44:49.251 --> 01:44:51.690
<v Speaker 3>clamped down on your calf?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2505
01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:55.940
<v Speaker 3>You felt all that hot poison going into</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body and you were trying to get</v>

2506
01:44:55.941 --> 01:44:56.774
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2507
01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:59.450
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you broke free with a big chunk taken</v>

2508
01:44:59.451 --> 01:45:03.080
<v Speaker 3>out of your calf and it's a bad about to</v>
<v Speaker 3>leap on you and you're trying to run</v>

2509
01:45:03.081 --> 01:45:06.770
<v Speaker 3>away with a limp hobbling duane</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming no and no.</v>

2510
01:45:06.771 --> 01:45:10.070
<v Speaker 3>And running through the bushes and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>look back and you see it just taking its</v>

2511
01:45:10.071 --> 01:45:10.904
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking,</v>

2512
01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:13.430
<v Speaker 3>coming towards her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking its time because it knows it</v>

2513
01:45:13.431 --> 01:45:15.470
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have to chase you just tracks</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't,</v>

2514
01:45:15.471 --> 01:45:17.480
<v Speaker 3>you can't go far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're all fucked up now.</v>

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:20.180
<v Speaker 3>So it oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>

2516
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:23.120
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually it's going to catch you sick</v>

2517
01:45:23.121 --> 01:45:25.990
<v Speaker 3>and shivering and it's just going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>start eating your asshole first.</v>

2518
01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:30.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2519
01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:33.100
<v Speaker 3>they just bite them in the legs and shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they got to be careful.</v>

2520
01:45:33.101 --> 01:45:35.470
<v Speaker 3>They don't get stompy smells with his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with his tongue.</v>

2521
01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:39.010
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ to use a tongue to smell</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2522
01:45:39.011 --> 01:45:41.410
<v Speaker 3>A creepy fucking creature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A jetson.</v>

2523
01:45:41.411 --> 01:45:41.921
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2524
01:45:41.921 --> 01:45:44.370
<v Speaker 3>these buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not natural to the area they've</v>

2525
01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:47.500
<v Speaker 3>been added in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they don't know what the fuck this,</v>

2526
01:45:47.530 --> 01:45:49.050
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been added into feed 'em.</v>

2527
01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2528
01:45:50.641 --> 01:45:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they died.</v>

2529
01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:54.320
<v Speaker 3>They'd say go to the watering hole and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Komodo dragons node,</v>

2530
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:56.590
<v Speaker 3>they're going to go to the watering hole</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just fucking wait for him.</v>

2531
01:45:56.740 --> 01:46:00.670
<v Speaker 3>And so he jacked him on the leg and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>he slowly making his way towards him.</v>

2532
01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if that was you and you had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that thing walking up the bank</v>

2533
01:46:04.631 --> 01:46:06.350
<v Speaker 3>towards you.</v>

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2672
01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:50.290
<v Speaker 3>So many schools in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be so much shit happening</v>

2673
01:51:50.291 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 3>within a thousand feet of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that one of the issues too with</v>

2674
01:51:53.891 --> 01:51:57.470
<v Speaker 3>pot shops like</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can't be anywhere near a church.</v>

2676
01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:02.650
<v Speaker 3>The church parts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How Larry this,</v>

2677
01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:04.670
<v Speaker 3>it's like if that's really the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it,</v>

2678
01:52:04.671 --> 01:52:06.610
<v Speaker 3>is that one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that really is still the case,</v>

2679
01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:10.810
<v Speaker 3>but I get it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really believed and you really</v>

2680
01:52:10.811 --> 01:52:13.390
<v Speaker 3>believe that your church was sacred and</v>
<v Speaker 3>important to you,</v>

2681
01:52:13.391 --> 01:52:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't want like one door down no</v>
<v Speaker 3>door,</v>

2682
01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:18.100
<v Speaker 3>but you not sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All churches are not,</v>

2683
01:52:18.101 --> 01:52:19.470
<v Speaker 3>they're not the ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like that with the lawn.</v>

2684
01:52:19.471 --> 01:52:22.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like you see in the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them in in la or just like in</v>

2685
01:52:22.811 --> 01:52:23.860
<v Speaker 3>between two apartment buildings.</v>

2686
01:52:23.890 --> 01:52:25.960
<v Speaker 3>But also the question is who gets to</v>
<v Speaker 3>choose?</v>

2687
01:52:26.050 --> 01:52:28.060
<v Speaker 3>Who gets to choose that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2688
01:52:28.090 --> 01:52:30.970
<v Speaker 3>How much distance between a church and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>liquor store?</v>

2689
01:52:30.971 --> 01:52:33.760
<v Speaker 3>Well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know is selling liquor okay.</v>

2690
01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Is it okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's okay.</v>

2691
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:38.530
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a lot of people are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like a lot of people are buying</v>

2692
01:52:38.531 --> 01:52:39.670
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like we all agree.</v>

2693
01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if it is the case,</v>

2694
01:52:41.850 --> 01:52:46.290
<v Speaker 3>w w why that radius radius of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even like up blog.</v>

2695
01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:50.390
<v Speaker 3>The rules in Detroit was the same shop</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw also prohibited from operating</v>

2696
01:52:50.391 --> 01:52:53.120
<v Speaker 3>within a thousand foot radius of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>church school park,</v>

2697
01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:58.150
<v Speaker 3>liquor stores or other dispensary or or</v>
<v Speaker 3>a drug free zone such as a library.</v>

2698
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all somewhat close by 8:00 PM other</v>

2699
01:53:01.881 --> 01:53:04.310
<v Speaker 3>dispensary liquor store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other dispensary.</v>

2700
01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all this is a result of people</v>

2701
01:53:07.701 --> 01:53:08.810
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I didn't want them right next to</v>

2702
01:53:08.811 --> 01:53:11.420
<v Speaker 3>this while I'm doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is saying that they can't be</v>

2703
01:53:11.421 --> 01:53:12.650
<v Speaker 3>close to a liquor store.</v>

2704
01:53:12.650 --> 01:53:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Like a liquor store is the same as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>church.</v>

2705
01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:17.240
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were saying a pot,</v>

2706
01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:22.010
<v Speaker 3>a pot shop can't be the alternative to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>business that's already established.</v>

2707
01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:23.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a liquor store.</v>

2708
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:26.210
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't quit booze.</v>

2709
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they saying you cannot wait.</v>

2710
01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:32.300
<v Speaker 3>So the liquor stores must've lobbied to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have that put in there.</v>

2711
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:35.120
<v Speaker 3>They must have figured out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero Liquor Store Union</v>

2712
01:53:37.070 --> 01:53:38.030
<v Speaker 3>liquor board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2713
01:53:38.890 --> 01:53:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2714
01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's obviously that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sense like the church makes sense.</v>

2715
01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Reluctantly I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes Sense.</v>

2716
01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The liquor store doesn't make any sense.</v>

2717
01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:54.740
<v Speaker 3>Know like why can't I just walk right</v>
<v Speaker 3>next door after I buy some weed and buy</v>

2718
01:53:54.741 --> 01:53:58.160
<v Speaker 3>a beer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I have to go 500 feet further?</v>

2719
01:53:58.450 --> 01:53:59.660
<v Speaker 3>And they don't have them here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no.</v>

2720
01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:01.730
<v Speaker 3>How'd they still drive through alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 3>places?</v>

<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

2762
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:25.580
<v Speaker 3>but he was saying that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he had no idea that you couldn't</v>

2763
01:55:25.581 --> 01:55:28.310
<v Speaker 3>crack open a beer and start drinking in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of a cop when he's asking</v>

2764
01:55:28.311 --> 01:55:29.144
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

2765
01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I had done nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best about Southeast Asia.</v>

2766
01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:35.330
<v Speaker 3>You get a beer with your walk with it</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking free America.</v>

2767
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:37.610
<v Speaker 3>You're just like out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to do anything.</v>

2768
01:55:37.670 --> 01:55:38.630
<v Speaker 3>Have a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2769
01:55:39.110 --> 01:55:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Just too many dumb young dudes that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would bring drinks and him on people and</v>

2770
01:55:44.581 --> 01:55:47.160
<v Speaker 3>be walking on the street with open beers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be goofy.</v>

2771
01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I guess so maybe just here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe here,</v>

2772
01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:52.980
<v Speaker 3>but London's got a little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They drink outside.</v>

2773
01:55:52.981 --> 01:55:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not in this trace a drink like an</v>

2774
01:55:54.451 --> 01:55:56.880
<v Speaker 3>outdoor pubs do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it in England.</v>

2775
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:59.350
<v Speaker 3>Would people boozed up on the streets?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2777
01:56:00.811 --> 01:56:03.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like don't put yourself in position</v>

2778
01:56:03.721 --> 01:56:07.320
<v Speaker 3>where you have to fight all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the argument is for.</v>

2779
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:08.820
<v Speaker 3>It's not about drinking outdoors or not.</v>

2780
01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:10.730
<v Speaker 3>It's about like don't drink so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2781
01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.150

<v Speaker 3>or you can walk and do it.</v>

2783

<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

2872
01:59:12.750 --> 01:59:15.420
<v Speaker 1>It got this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentrification has his path.</v>

2873
01:59:15.421 --> 01:59:19.110

01:59:21.810 --> 01:59:24.180
<v Speaker 1>ethnic gentrifying first to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually both.</v>

2877
01:59:24.450 --> 01:59:28.680
<v Speaker 1>So first you have criminals or</v>
<v Speaker 1>warehouses and then the people can like</v>

2878
01:59:28.740 --> 01:59:31.350
<v Speaker 1>are cool artists who have no money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll move in,</v>

2879
01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:34.440
<v Speaker 1>they can get a giant loft for basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing cause you gotta worry about</v>

2880
01:59:34.441 --> 01:59:36.210
<v Speaker 1>getting stabbed or having nothing around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2881
01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:39.270
<v Speaker 1>They start adding the arts to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the area,</v>

2882
01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:42.510
<v Speaker 1>making it more interesting than people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dunkin and me come in,</v>

2883
01:59:43.180 --> 01:59:44.130
<v Speaker 1>what we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like it.</v>

2884
01:59:44.130 --> 01:59:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be the front lines of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2885
01:59:45.970 --> 01:59:47.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need someplace to go like you know,</v>

2886
01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:51.540
<v Speaker 1>get some food but they're still</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals around or like lack of stuff.</v>

2887
01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:54.420
<v Speaker 1>And then the rich people who don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>style of their own,</v>

2888
01:59:54.421 --> 01:59:57.450
<v Speaker 1>they move in and Co op the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's style and then you start</v>

2889
01:59:57.451 --> 02:00:00.870
<v Speaker 1>getting too many like coffee shops and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they start changing the law to</v>

2890
02:00:00.871 --> 02:00:02.830
<v Speaker 1>drive out the people who lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2891
02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>and this is a park where they all are</v>
<v Speaker 1>camped out and go on us.</v>

2892
02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:08.850
<v Speaker 1>And every Sunday they would cook out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they started saying,</v>

2893
02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>the rich people was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh the smoke is going to my windows.</v>

2894
02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>So he started making laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About how you can't have cookouts and</v>

2895
02:00:16.591 --> 02:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>that pretty much just drove out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who wanted to have that as part</v>

2896
02:00:19.171 --> 02:00:20.210
<v Speaker 1>as their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just like,</v>

2897
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:22.700
<v Speaker 3>you don't make the laws saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal to be ethnic,</v>

2898
02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:24.840
<v Speaker 3>but you make laws around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>

2899
02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:27.260
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a park down the street from</v>

2900
02:00:27.261 --> 02:00:28.010
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2901
02:00:28.010 --> 02:00:30.680
<v Speaker 3>we could go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like only a couple of minutes away.</v>

2902
02:00:30.710 --> 02:00:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go there on the weekends,</v>

2903
02:00:33.170 --> 02:00:35.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a festival.</v>

2904
02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:38.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like people use those barbecue</v>
<v Speaker 3>grill to have out there that gets,</v>

2905
02:00:38.730 --> 02:00:42.680
<v Speaker 3>then they set up a picnic tables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lay out a,</v>

2906
02:00:42.681 --> 02:00:45.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cloth and the picnic tables and paper</v>

2907
02:00:45.051 --> 02:00:47.540
<v Speaker 3>cups and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they got coolers at porn,</v>

2908
02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:51.710
<v Speaker 3>like Koolaid and shed and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're cooking all kinds of different</v>

2909
02:00:51.711 --> 02:00:53.060
<v Speaker 3>things on these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these racks.</v>

2910
02:00:53.061 --> 02:00:56.690
<v Speaker 3>And there's like maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six families spread out in these areas</v>

2911
02:00:56.691 --> 02:00:58.700
<v Speaker 3>that are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then as kids are playing and</v>

2912
02:00:58.701 --> 02:01:00.920
<v Speaker 3>everybody's running around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of people that live in</v>

2913
02:01:00.921 --> 02:01:03.860
<v Speaker 3>apartments that don't have a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they don't have,</v>

2914
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:05.450
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a big backyard.</v>

2915
02:01:05.570 --> 02:01:07.610
<v Speaker 3>So now they just go to the park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

2916
02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:09.470
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's like this sense of</v>

2917
02:01:09.471 --> 02:01:10.640
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's laughing.</v>

2923
02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:24.410

<v Speaker 3>This doesn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2931
02:01:39.401 --> 02:01:40.080

<v Speaker 1>I'm not that.</v>

2934
02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:46.400
<v Speaker 1>So let me do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of diseases can you get from</v>

2935
02:01:46.401 --> 02:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>one of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Park grills,</v>

2936
02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.910
<v Speaker 1>who's cleaning that grill through?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the best barbecues I ever had was</v>

2937
02:01:52.911 --> 02:01:55.040
<v Speaker 1>on top of in Vail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of the mountain.</v>

2938
02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>So we were skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was skiing with his chef and he had a</v>

2939
02:01:57.411 --> 02:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>bunch of fucking chicken in his back</v>
<v Speaker 1>marinating in the of the sags are those</v>

2940
02:02:01.491 --> 02:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>boxes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ziploc bags?</v>

2941
02:02:02.630 --> 02:02:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's kept shaking it up,</v>

2942
02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>his snowboard and hitting jumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just marinate in this chicken and</v>

2943
02:02:08.001 --> 02:02:08.511
<v Speaker 1>then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2944
02:02:08.511 --> 02:02:09.291
<v Speaker 1>you want to eat with us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2945
02:02:09.291 --> 02:02:09.651
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2946
02:02:09.651 --> 02:02:10.270
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

2947
02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I was going into the restaurant party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no out here and just use that</v>

2948
02:02:12.951 --> 02:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>thing and it's just make grilled fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken up on top of fucking wow.</v>

2949
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>The rockies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so good.</v>

2950
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>So did he have like a little grill in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his pack too?</v>

2951
02:02:20.841 --> 02:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had the public grill up there.</v>

2952
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

2953
02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got some wood and stuff.</v>

2954
02:02:26.541 --> 02:02:27.890
<v Speaker 1>It was just coal's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2955
02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would like to do that up there.</v>

2956
02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Those things are so nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nasty.</v>

2957
02:02:34.590 --> 02:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>It was like the bird shitting on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's ever claimed anywhere else,</v>

2958
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:42.110
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the idea is once the fire gets</v>

2959
02:02:42.111 --> 02:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's going to stay alive on it,</v>

2960
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2961
02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:49.420
<v Speaker 1>When that motherfucker gets red hot to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where you could see her a</v>

2962
02:02:49.421 --> 02:02:51.560
<v Speaker 1>steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing surviving on that.</v>

2963
02:02:52.190 --> 02:02:53.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the whole principle behind</v>

2964
02:02:53.961 --> 02:02:57.020
<v Speaker 1>cast iron pans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't really wash a cast iron</v>

2965
02:02:57.021 --> 02:02:57.650
<v Speaker 1>pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

2966
02:02:57.650 --> 02:03:00.710
<v Speaker 1>you just sort of scratch out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's dare throw some water on</v>

2967
02:03:00.711 --> 02:03:01.370
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2968
02:03:01.370 --> 02:03:05.270
<v Speaker 1>But like that dark blackness that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get from a cast iron pan.</v>

2969
02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I cook on one of those I feel</v>

2970
02:03:07.881 --> 02:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking man sign grill man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

2971
02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:13.190
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a man in frying pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a man,</v>

2972
02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>if you give me a choice and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cast iron pan and some bitch ass fucking</v>

2973
02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:23.450
<v Speaker 1>heats the whole take on the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those ones that you could</v>

2974
02:03:23.451 --> 02:03:27.300
<v Speaker 1>like flip a cheeseburger without putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a non stick.</v>

2975
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Those are so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And me and Martha Usos nonstick pans and</v>

2976
02:03:30.711 --> 02:03:33.110
<v Speaker 1>now a lot of that got into your food</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they'd been cooking that shit for</v>

2977
02:03:33.111 --> 02:03:35.820
<v Speaker 1>like 10 years on the scratch and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking.</v>

2978
02:03:36.230 --> 02:03:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you go and you're like,</v>

2979
02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:38.990
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut off to it.</v>

2980
02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just date it.</v>

2981
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to come out and metal flakes.</v>

2982
02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:46.130
<v Speaker 1>My dog ate a packet of glitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2983
02:03:46.190 --> 02:03:47.580
<v Speaker 1>And he shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2984
02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:48.493
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glitter.</v>

2985
02:03:49.770 --> 02:03:52.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like in roped up in his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to take a picture of it,</v>

2986
02:03:52.881 --> 02:03:55.220
<v Speaker 1>put it on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking it's probably like</v>

2987
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:59.540
<v Speaker 1>they could probably take that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get mad at you for shit.</v>

2988
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3127
02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I tried early on to realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3128
02:09:28.451 --> 02:09:31.510
<v Speaker 1>this is where ads go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to make it just addie.</v>

3129
02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like let's make an actual more</v>

3130
02:09:34.271 --> 02:09:37.270
<v Speaker 1>content and then if you have to throw an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ad in there to a fine,</v>

3131
02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:40.150
<v Speaker 1>but like he was going to be some good</v>
<v Speaker 1>times as well.</v>

3132
02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I don't even have that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3135
02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:46.000

<v Speaker 1>If it's funny,</v>

3136

<v Speaker 1>if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be recording our funny and it's</v>

3137
02:09:48.191 --> 02:09:50.230
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing because you're</v>

3138
02:09:50.231 --> 02:09:53.110
<v Speaker 1>getting a chance to see you sorta</v>

<v Speaker 1>But what is the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>

3334
02:18:20.051 --> 02:18:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3335
02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:23.830
<v Speaker 1>it's all obviously ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when do we get over this ancestor</v>

3336
02:18:23.831 --> 02:18:25.750
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many generations in do we do we</v>

3337
02:18:25.751 --> 02:18:28.240
<v Speaker 1>just treat people as individuals and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3338
02:18:28.241 --> 02:18:29.530
<v Speaker 1>it's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they want?</v>

3339
02:18:29.590 --> 02:18:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Some people got an advantage for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White people got an advantage for sure.</v>

3340
02:18:34.450 --> 02:18:35.231
<v Speaker 1>But it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3341
02:18:35.231 --> 02:18:36.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more so,</v>

3342
02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:39.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's not 100% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I came from,</v>

3343
02:18:39.431 --> 02:18:39.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

3344
02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:40.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3345
02:18:40.630 --> 02:18:42.720
<v Speaker 1>divorced household,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't write,</v>

3346
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:45.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my dad wasn't around and my dad beat</v>

3347
02:18:45.031 --> 02:18:46.270
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3348
02:18:46.450 --> 02:18:50.650
<v Speaker 1>that can be a way worse and harder</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience then the cosby kids.</v>

3349
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:51.783
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3350
02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

3351
02:18:53.831 --> 02:18:57.250
<v Speaker 1>just because you're this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might make the odds harder for you,</v>

3352
02:18:57.251 --> 02:18:59.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's not 100%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an origins thing.</v>

3353
02:18:59.890 --> 02:19:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And one of the origins that every black</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid has to face when they think about</v>

3354
02:19:04.751 --> 02:19:07.840
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it someone down the line was a slave</v>

3355
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:11.620
<v Speaker 1>and they're not slaves anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's why people who look like him</v>

3356
02:19:11.621 --> 02:19:14.260
<v Speaker 1>are here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all here because someone brought</v>

3357
02:19:14.261 --> 02:19:15.880
<v Speaker 1>them over here in chains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3358
02:19:15.881 --> 02:19:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And there's still true with remnants of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3359
02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some,</v>

3360
02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:23.160
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be a weird self esteem or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a self identity issue attached to</v>

3361
02:19:23.951 --> 02:19:26.650
<v Speaker 1>knowing that everybody knows who your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors were.</v>

3362
02:19:26.651 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's</v>

3363
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:30.470
<v Speaker 3>a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a certain thing that people</v>

3364
02:19:30.471 --> 02:19:34.730
<v Speaker 3>do when someone has something and</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else wants it.</v>

3365
02:19:35.350 --> 02:19:35.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3366
02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:37.390
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a,</v>

3367
02:19:37.391 --> 02:19:41.620
<v Speaker 3>a group of people that's different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like really easy to almost think of</v>

3368
02:19:41.621 --> 02:19:44.680
<v Speaker 3>them as not you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how they've justified wars.</v>

3369
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:49.030
<v Speaker 3>That's how so many people I by</v>
<v Speaker 3>dehumanizing the other,</v>

3370
02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:52.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>

3371
02:19:52.850 --> 02:19:57.440
<v Speaker 3>this thing that has to balance out that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cass is,</v>

3372
02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:02.690
<v Speaker 3>I guess just the echoes of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we have to get so many</v>

3373
02:20:02.691 --> 02:20:07.691
<v Speaker 3>generations away from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from people being slaves and any</v>

3374
02:20:08.241 --> 02:20:10.760
<v Speaker 3>repercussions of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Socially I cannot,</v>

3375
02:20:10.761 --> 02:20:13.880
<v Speaker 3>we have to get so far away that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't factor anymore where we don't</v>

3376
02:20:13.881 --> 02:20:14.510
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3377
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:16.130
<v Speaker 3>That's well expressed for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3378
02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:17.293
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

3379
02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:20.680
<v Speaker 3>That kind of like calm way to explain</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3380
02:20:20.681 --> 02:20:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Rarely gets put out and of course</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming and yelling.</v>

3381
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:25.450
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not teaching anyone</v>

3382
02:20:25.451 --> 02:20:27.520
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest problem on the left and the</v>

3383
02:20:27.521 --> 02:20:28.660
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ones that are angry,</v>

3384
02:20:28.661 --> 02:20:30.910
<v Speaker 3>the angry mobs is they never seek to</v>
<v Speaker 3>educate.</v>

3385
02:20:30.911 --> 02:20:34.090
<v Speaker 3>They only seek to like punish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also grandstand.</v>

3386
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:36.850
<v Speaker 3>They want to make this bigger here in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that lady's voice,</v>

3387
02:20:36.851 --> 02:20:39.240
<v Speaker 3>she was going for audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The audience clap two,</v>

3388
02:20:39.310 --> 02:20:40.420
<v Speaker 3>three times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't get it.</v>

3389
02:20:40.421 --> 02:20:41.500
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll keep going.</v>

3390
02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:44.140
<v Speaker 3>She's seen Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knows how to manipulate a crowd.</v>

3391
02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:46.600
<v Speaker 3>She knows how to get those people riled</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3392
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well listen man,</v>

3393
02:20:48.370 --> 02:20:52.000
<v Speaker 3>that's part of being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's half the reward for saying</v>

3394
02:20:52.001 --> 02:20:55.660
<v Speaker 3>something that's right is the love that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get from people when you say that</v>

3395
02:20:55.661 --> 02:20:57.400
<v Speaker 3>it's right and they recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they go,</v>

3396
02:20:57.401 --> 02:20:58.120
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3397
02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:00.250
<v Speaker 3>So people get addicted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3398
02:21:00.370 --> 02:21:05.230
<v Speaker 3>So they constantly do things that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>think are at least perceived as being</v>

3399
02:21:05.231 --> 02:21:09.730
<v Speaker 3>right and they get very vocal with</v>
<v Speaker 3>things when they perceive those things</v>

3400
02:21:09.731 --> 02:21:13.060
<v Speaker 3>are going to get a very big reaction for</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing up against them.</v>

3401
02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:17.920
<v Speaker 3>And it becomes this moral high ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of grand standing peacocking sort</v>

3402
02:21:17.921 --> 02:21:21.270
<v Speaker 3>of a thing where they just are</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly trying to let everyone who</v>

3403
02:21:21.271 --> 02:21:25.450
<v Speaker 3>know how uncool it is to do this and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong it is to do that.</v>

3404
02:21:25.451 --> 02:21:30.451
<v Speaker 3>Like settle the fuck down like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird thing.</v>

3405
02:21:30.641 --> 02:21:33.130
<v Speaker 3>And then sometimes they'll see something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't quite fit in.</v>

3406
02:21:33.131 --> 02:21:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Like they'll sit there was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make,</v>

3407
02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:36.490
<v Speaker 3>you know how they make rape a broader</v>
<v Speaker 3>and broader and broader.</v>

3408
02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which was really does think does a</v>

3409
02:21:39.101 --> 02:21:43.910
<v Speaker 3>disservice to ripe it does to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it seem like anyway,</v>

3410
02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:46.300
<v Speaker 3>there was some coercion is rape where if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk someone into it,</v>

3411
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:47.350
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

3412
02:21:47.350 --> 02:21:49.600
<v Speaker 3>And then a bunch of men was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well if that's true then I've been</v>

3413
02:21:49.601 --> 02:21:51.790
<v Speaker 3>raped a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the super liberal left.</v>

3414
02:21:51.791 --> 02:21:52.241
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3415
02:21:52.241 --> 02:21:54.430
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to make that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were on wanting to make you be able</v>

3416
02:21:54.431 --> 02:21:55.300
<v Speaker 3>to evict them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so okay,</v>

3417
02:21:55.301 --> 02:21:58.630
<v Speaker 3>that's no longer rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coercion was one,</v>

3418
02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:02.050
<v Speaker 3>someone under the influence of alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was very questionable.</v>

3419
02:22:02.470 --> 02:22:06.010
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one because we all know</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's different states of mind</v>

3420
02:22:06.100 --> 02:22:11.100
<v Speaker 3>and that a woman who decides to get how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get a couple drinks and then wants to</v>

3421
02:22:11.921 --> 02:22:15.490
<v Speaker 3>have sex if the man is sober and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a weird one.</v>

3422
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:17.860
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do it because she's under</v>

3423
02:22:17.861 --> 02:22:20.890
<v Speaker 3>the influence like that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the argument that was be</v>

3424
02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:23.680
<v Speaker 3>opposition to black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like I know a lot of women who</v>

3425
02:22:23.681 --> 02:22:24.191
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3426
02:22:24.191 --> 02:22:26.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't have sex without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to drink before I have sex.</v>

3427
02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:27.901
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3428
02:22:27.901 --> 02:22:29.580
<v Speaker 3>what's so then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3429
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:31.380
<v Speaker 3>it's a split.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Said they don't all think the same</v>

3430
02:22:31.381 --> 02:22:32.250
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

3431
02:22:32.251 --> 02:22:35.580
<v Speaker 3>So some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the militant ones want to say you're a</v>

3432
02:22:35.581 --> 02:22:37.440
<v Speaker 3>rapist now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of the other one's like,</v>

3433
02:22:37.441 --> 02:22:37.680
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3434
02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Women could take control of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can have some drinks and lubricate</v>

3435
02:22:41.101 --> 02:22:43.490
<v Speaker 3>themselves if they want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also really the only time we're</v>

3436
02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:47.820
<v Speaker 3>ever asking people to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're saying like you don't have</v>

3437
02:22:47.821 --> 02:22:48.930
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3438
02:22:48.931 --> 02:22:51.900
<v Speaker 3>You're not even responsible for what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing as opposed to like driving.</v>

3439
02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're under the influence and</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive,</v>

3440
02:22:53.951 --> 02:22:54.960
<v Speaker 3>like no one says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3441
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:59.070
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't your fault that you plowed</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that school bus full of kids with</v>

3442
02:22:59.071 --> 02:23:01.170
<v Speaker 3>your car because you were drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but used to be the rule.</v>

3443
02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:02.580
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3444
02:23:02.581 --> 02:23:05.370
<v Speaker 3>it still is the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying like it's,</v>

3445
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:07.800
<v Speaker 3>they'll say that if it comes to sexual</v>
<v Speaker 3>intercourse,</v>

3446
02:23:08.050 --> 02:23:09.810
<v Speaker 3>but they won't say that it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving.</v>

3447
02:23:09.930 --> 02:23:13.290
<v Speaker 3>Like no one's going to say you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>consent to being behind the wheel.</v>

3448
02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:15.150
<v Speaker 3>You were under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the influence is not your fault,</v>

3449
02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:19.560
<v Speaker 3>but you're supposed to know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's supposed to be deeply embedded</v>

3450
02:23:19.561 --> 02:23:22.470
<v Speaker 3>in your head enough that you don't go</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that car and started,</v>

3451
02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:24.120
<v Speaker 3>even though you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sex,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you can't handle it.</v>

3455
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't handle it.</v>

3456
02:23:27.181 --> 02:23:30.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like desperate drunk driver.</v>

3457
02:23:30.901 --> 02:23:32.520
<v Speaker 3>You ran over somebody while you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk driving and they're like,</v>

3458
02:23:32.521 --> 02:23:33.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry officer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3459
02:23:33.630 --> 02:23:34.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self defense.</v>

3460
02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:35.670
<v Speaker 3>I was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same Shit.</v>

3461
02:23:35.810 --> 02:23:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it on purpose.</v>

3462
02:23:37.290 --> 02:23:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was drunk.</v>

3463
02:23:38.821 --> 02:23:41.160
<v Speaker 3>That's why I lost control the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it's hard to control the car</v>

3464
02:23:41.161 --> 02:23:41.880
<v Speaker 3>and you're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3465
02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:44.460
<v Speaker 3>So that's what happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did it become illegal to drink and</v>

3466
02:23:44.461 --> 02:23:45.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3467
02:23:45.801 --> 02:23:46.950
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3468
02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:50.050
<v Speaker 10>I look that up.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We're not too long because it sees my</v>

3469
02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:52.310
<v Speaker 10>peers,</v>
<v Speaker 10>my friends and whatnot.</v>

3470
02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:54.580
<v Speaker 10>They did it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Or like in the 70s or</v>

3471
02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:56.480
<v Speaker 3>like what your thoughts on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's Google it and find out.</v>

3472
02:23:56.481 --> 02:23:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take a guess.</v>

3473
02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:02.560
<v Speaker 3>I say fifties fifties I 61 that's how</v>
<v Speaker 3>late in the fifties I'm going to go with</v>

3474
02:24:04.131 --> 02:24:07.370
<v Speaker 3>69 okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fun to say that.</v>

3475
02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:08.480
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3476
02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:13.250
<v Speaker 3>73 73 that seems so late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

3477
02:24:13.610 --> 02:24:14.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3478
02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I should stick to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties</v>

3479
02:24:18.300 --> 02:24:23.300
<v Speaker 10>first state that adopted any sort of law</v>
<v Speaker 10>was New York in 1910 but um,</v>

3480
02:24:25.950 --> 02:24:28.740
<v Speaker 3>port we off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what that car is that I</v>

3481
02:24:28.741 --> 02:24:33.741
<v Speaker 3>feel like when I looked this up before I</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought cars like late twenties people</v>

3482
02:24:34.291 --> 02:24:37.260
<v Speaker 3>were drug two years into having cars</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get on your horse.</v>

3483
02:24:37.770 --> 02:24:38.640
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

3484
02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:42.690
<v Speaker 10>Remember looking this up,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think like if sometime in the fifties</v>

3485
02:24:42.690 --> 02:24:46.260
<v Speaker 10>or sixties or maybe even as up to like</v>
<v Speaker 10>1980 when mad started data,</v>

3486
02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:48.600
<v Speaker 10>the states that weren't adopting it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we're going to get stopped getting</v>

3487
02:24:48.601 --> 02:24:51.520
<v Speaker 10>funding for federal road ladies like</v>
<v Speaker 10>that.</v>

3488
02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:54.150
<v Speaker 10>So they had to adopt all the laws.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's like how they forced everyone.</v>

3489
02:24:54.740 --> 02:24:55.770
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course people would drink.</v>

3490
02:24:55.890 --> 02:24:58.020
<v Speaker 3>It would be a bunch of people drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But have you tried driving yet?</v>

3491
02:24:58.220 --> 02:24:58.951
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awesome.</v>

3492
02:24:58.951 --> 02:25:00.360
<v Speaker 3>And the sun was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you tried to drunk?</v>

3493
02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:03.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm for sure going to do that.</v>

3494
02:25:03.031 --> 02:25:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that's where a horse is superior</v>

3495
02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:09.390
<v Speaker 3>because the horse isn't going to crash</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the horse is so bought a pilot.</v>

3496
02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:09.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3497
02:25:09.991 --> 02:25:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a form.</v>

3498
02:25:11.081 --> 02:25:12.730
<v Speaker 3>You pass that on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>

3499
02:25:12.810 --> 02:25:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Here your form of travel and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways you have a relationship with this</v>

3500
02:25:15.991 --> 02:25:18.900
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know like you up to hey there,</v>

3501

3504
02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:32.560
<v Speaker 3>That's probably a way better way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting around as long as you're not</v>

3505
02:25:32.561 --> 02:25:33.520
<v Speaker 3>allergic to horses.</v>

3506
02:25:35.170 --> 02:25:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I said,</v>

3507
02:25:36.401 --> 02:25:37.720
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're allergic to horse in the West,</v>

3509
02:25:41.981 --> 02:25:44.350
<v Speaker 3>horses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how weak our gene pool has</v>

3510
02:25:44.351 --> 02:25:45.980
<v Speaker 3>gotten folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3511
02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:48.230

<v Speaker 3>I feel sad.</v>

3512
02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:53.340
<v Speaker 3>I feel so bad for people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>allergic to animals and people that are</v>

3513
02:25:53.801 --> 02:25:58.801

<v Speaker 3>allergic to a lot of people close to me</v>

3514

<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3515
02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:04.100
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to watch because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>annoying like that,</v>

3516
02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:06.520
<v Speaker 3>that there's a thing out there that can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that to them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the thing.</v>
