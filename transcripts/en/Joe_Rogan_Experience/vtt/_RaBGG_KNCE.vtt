00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.990
Ooh,
oh,
we live.

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.050
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.830
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for the fleshlight and then you

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:15.740

you get 50% about 50.
The rest say 1515.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.410
I'm not,
I'm not add new coupons folks.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.670
I've just high 15% off the number one sex toy from Matt does.
Number one,
it was,

7
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:27.510
there was a fucking race apparently and the fleshlight one.
How did they,

8
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:31.350
how did they,
it's ridiculous I guess because they sell more.

9
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:33.930
You can just call yourself number one.
That must be what it is.

10
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.770
It's a solid product.
Don't get me wrong,
we're making fun of it,

11
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.890
but if you're going to masturbate and you're going to masturbate,

12
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:43.500
stop fucking around.
This is technology for masturbation.

13
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.200
It's an embarrassing purchase.
Indeed.
It's a fucking commitment,

14
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.620
but it is worth it.
It's fucking great.
Works,
works awesome.

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.240
Way better than your hand or your cat.
And uh,

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.730
we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n n I t.com,

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.980
the makers of Alpha brain.

18
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:03.981
The cognitive enhancing supplement that a ice whereby I love the stuff and um,

19
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.350
you can find out about it online.
If you don't know too much about nootropics,

20
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:07.921
just Google it.

21
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:10.830
There's a bunch of different articles have been written on the subject and if

22
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:12.690
you're interested in an experiment on your own,

23
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.910
and like we always say if you like,

24
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.570
you know the idea behind Alpha brain but you think it's too expensive or what?

25
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:21.840
It just copied the ingredients,
go buy it in bulk,
mix it yourself.

26
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.880
I'm a much more interested in people not getting ripped off than I am in making

27
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.270
any money off this thing.
If you,
you don't like it,

28
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:34.170
you also get 100% money back guarantee.
It's real simple.
If you order it,

29
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:36.090
you say it sucks,
you get your money back.

30
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.790
I try to be as even as possible with this.

31
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.300
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for Alpha brain,

32
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.620
you can get 10% off by entering the code name Rogan and you know there's also a

33
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:49.710
bunch of other cool shit that we have this new mood.

34
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.320
It is a five HTP,

35
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.320
serotonin boosting supplement that I really like.

36
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.300
And then there's a this quarter zips,

37
00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:01.320
mushrooms supplement called shroom tech sport,

38
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:05.310
which is great for anybody who likes to really work out hard and it's got like a

39
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:09.600
lot of vitamin B 12 and in as well.
And together it's just a,
it's a really good,

40
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.590
like vigorous workout formula.
Brian does not need that shit though.

41
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.760
It makes me type faster.
Did it do anything for you?

42
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.970
<v 1>Uh,
you know,
I haven't really tried that one yet.</v>

43
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.860
That's the only way that I tried,

44
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.630
but I'm doing everything else and I really liked the immune.
That's my favorite.

45
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.210
<v 0>Yeah,
the shroom tech immune is a really fascinating one because what it is is,</v>

46
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:30.660
uh,
somehow or another,
I don't,
I don't know the total science behind it,

47
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:31.830
so I don't want to speak out of school.

48
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:35.670
But from what it's explained to me is the,
when you eat these mushrooms,

49
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.110
your immune system reacts to them as if they're like,
uh,
like,
like they've had,

50
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.530
there's an issue,
like there's a bacterial infection,
a cold or something,

51
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.640
but there is no cold.

52
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.990
So it jumps up your immune system so your immune system builds up this big crazy

53
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:52.440
army.
But then there's no war,
right?
So some other punks come along.

54
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.850
Your immune system is ready anyway.
That's the end of the commercials.

55
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.340
Hit The music bitch.
We got Everlast in the house today.

56
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.350
Come on son.

57

58
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.403

60
00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:31.210

couple of grants.
Hell help as a need.

63
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.130
A brand new job with a health care plan they closed.

64
00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:45.890
The plant is don't match APP until on the crown.

Don't pay unless you ask the math.
So small below

66
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.960
to try to kill.

67
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.590
Never seen them all by by them paying it.

68
00:03:57.591 --> 00:03:59.020
No mind

69
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.790
they can't.

70
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.510
That's good shit.
Like loving man.

71
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.040
This is classic.

72
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.540
<v 2>Gotcha video.
Where can you find the video</v>

73
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.870
<v 0>on Youtube?
Everlast music channel.
We only gave you a taste.
Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

74
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:26.810
This is more of that song.
Obviously that's,

75
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.240
but you could tell that's classic shit.
That's you.

76
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.670
That's you and your groove man.
Yeah.

77
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.520
<v 1>And you know what?</v>

78
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.860
It's one of those cds I was talking about talking about this earlier,

79
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.980
that I buy cds and I usually like two or three songs.

80
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.000
It's just one of those cds where I honestly like every single song on STD and

81
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:46.090
there's a few of them that like my house,
I fucking love.
This is awesome.

82
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.900
<v 0>It's been a while since he puts something out.
And so is it like couple years?</v>

83
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.820
How many years has it been to clean?
I put a three so,

84
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:54.830
oh eight I put out the record.

85
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.170
He was like having like that kind of a space in between records where you really

86
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:01.880
get to work on your shit and really get to like put it in a form you like.
Yeah,

87
00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:02.920
I got no choices.

88
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.190
<v 4>Just songs come to me in groups and in bunches and then I,</v>

89
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.850
I get caught up.
Just live in,
you know what I mean?
It's

90
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.690
just kind of,
I can't force an issue if I'm,

91
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.630
if I tried to write a song when I wasn't feeling like writing a song,

92
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:22.000
it would just be horrible,
you know?
I mean,
I've done it,
I've tried it,

93
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:22.451
you know what I mean?

94
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.870
It's just sometimes it's like life says don't write a record.

95
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.870
Right,
right,
right.
And I told her and I lay back and I,
I take my time.

96
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:36.640
I just,
I like taking in as much music as,
as,
as,
as I do put,

97
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.000
putting out music.
So I listen to things.
I learned more about music.
Right.

98
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.550
<v 0>Do you like,
um,
when,
when you write,
do you just say,
do you have like a whim?</v>

99
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.820
Like it just comes across you like,
no,
I'm gonna sit down right now.

100
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:50.770
I started writing a song.
Like,
you don't have like a set aside time or anything.

101
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:53.050
Like what do you go,
I'm just going to work on music.

102
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.110
How does it work with you nowadays?
I just go,
you know,

103
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:58.070
I keep a studio away from the house,

104
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 4>just,
you know,
kind of,
uh,
and make it like a job.
Just go every day,
you know,
not,</v>

105
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.970
not quite nine to five hours,

106
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:09.850
but try to keep it as respectful to the family and whatnot is,
you know,

107
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.670
before it was just,
yes.
I mean if it,

108
00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:14.430
if I wanted to work at two in the morning and I work at two in the morning and

109
00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:16.820
here,
I mean,
and that's still the case,
but it's,

110
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.060
I don't really live in that hour anymore.
Yeah.
I don't either.

111
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:23.000
But there's something kind of bad ass about that shit that comes out at like

112
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:27.110
4:00 AM.
Yeah.
You know,
that's why you can't,
you know,
can't not do it if it's,

113
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.550
if it needs to be done,

114
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:31.790
but I'm not sitting around it two in the morning waiting on it,

115
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:34.490
you know what I mean?
If,
if it jumps on me,
I'm,
I'm working on it.

116
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.480
But I always personally felt like it was right in anything that you don't get

117
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.690
into the real trance until like the whole house is asleep.
Oh yeah.

118
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:45.380
Until it's just you and the silence and the keyboard and then you get into the

119
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:48.740
real trance.
Well.
That's also why I keep a separate area.
Like,
you know,

120
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.020
I'm just talking about like a good hour away from the house.

121
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.560
I got to drive to go to the studio and I usually spend a day or two there and

122
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.790
you know,

123
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.790
just block my mind out of everything and try and you know,

124
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.970
it's,
there's no way so it could be two in the morning,
you know,

125
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.350
are you always writing shit down to like if you like a,

126
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.540
if you're looking at a restaurant or something,

127
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.800
you have an idea for something to do,

128
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:13.370
write it down and he just honestly never written an idea down ever.
Wow.

129
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.050
Not a lyric.
Got a rap lyric.
None.
She just keeps on your head.
Yeah.

130
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:22.490
Not a chord progression on an wow.
I can't remember it.

131
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.920
It's lost to the universe.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

132
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.980
There's something beautiful about that bad.

133
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.320
<v 5>Pretty much.
Yeah.
I'm like a beautiful mind.
Kind of an idiot,
idiot savant,</v>

134
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.463
you know?

135
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.970
<v 4>No,
half the chords I play on the guitar,
man,</v>

136
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:41.990
I've just copied them from other people and really holy shit.

137
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.740
It doesn't Jz do that as well.
He doesn't write any of his raps and leave.

138
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:49.360
So yeah,
that's incredible.
That's incredible.
So all your shit,

139
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.530
<v 5>it just started for me as a,
as a,
as a,
as a way of exercising your mind.</v>

140
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:55.720
When I was a young kid trying to be a rapper,
I was like,

141
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:59.020
you should always have it ready in your brain.
And then I,

142
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.810
my style of writing just became kind of visual.

143
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:05.470
And it's like in my mind when I write lyrics,
I have the pictures in my brain.

144
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.510
I equate it to that cat on Oz that drew pictures on paper.
But he was a poet,

145
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.180
you know what I mean?
It wasn't words.
It was always this picture.

146
00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:16.390
But he would read it as a poem and it's almost the same thing.

147
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:18.370
It's three dimensional in my head,
a song,

148
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.340
the minute I would start writing the words out two dimensionally,

149
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.400
it would just lose all meaning and feeling to me.

150
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.620
<v 4>Oh,
that's fascinating.</v>

151
00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:30.600
So you feel like the writing in a writing and in just a verbal and an audio way

152
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.150
is the way to do it?
Right.

153
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.140
<v 5>It's just very dimensional for me.</v>

154
00:08:34.141 --> 00:08:36.860
Like in my mind it's like three dimensional pictures of,

155
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:39.310
of what I'm writing about and that totally,

156
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.840
the minute I committed them to paper and they're two dimensional,
I lose all it.

157
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.560
I hate,
I mean it's a despise will.
They'd go from something I'm really digging,

158
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.520
so let me write that down and see it and then I see it as a whole different

159
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.440
meaning.
It's not,
it's words,
it's paper.
It's,
that's amazing.
Yeah.

160
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.430
That's a fascinating

161
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.100
<v 0>mind you.
I only put out a record every two or three years.</v>

162
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.330
That's really interesting though,
but you're totally right.
Well,

163
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:07.330
there's some people that have just a way of expressing themselves that's like a

164
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.470
fun way to listen to.
I always bring up my friend Joey does.

165
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.940
Do you know Joey Diaz?
The comedian sounds familiar.
He's,
he's,

166
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.260
if you ever listened to the podcast,
he's on all the time.

167
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:19.650
He's one of my best friends.
He's this guy that is just,
he's,

168
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.030
the way he talks is just like poetry.
Right?
You know?
He's just like,

169
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.470
what's up dog?
What do we,
what is this party kicking motherfucker?

170
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.080
What are we doing?
Bitches?
He's given.

171
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.410
Everybody knocked goes and everybody's laughing and smiling or it just takes you

172
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:35.310
off in a wave.
And Joey Diaz is not something you could write down on paper.

173
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.760
That's a flavor.
That's a real live like,
as you said,

174
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.420
three dimensional flavor to the way his words come out.
It's alive.
It's,
you know,

175
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.000
it's surrounds me in my head.
If I'm writing it in my head,
it's all around me.

176
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.730
Why me?
I committed to paper.
It's just flat.
And so do you have a,

177
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.540
so if none of this is all written down,

178
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:58.500
do you have like a set list in your mind of how you put it in order in your

179
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:02.700
shows or do you wing it?
They'd go on on how you feel or not?

180
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:03.870
I'll write the titles down.

181
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.860
<v 5>I W it's also become a superstition at this point in my life.</v>

182
00:10:12.071 --> 00:10:15.520
It's like after you make a record,
they want the lyrics.

183
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.361
You know what they want to know?

184
00:10:16.361 --> 00:10:19.810
The publishing company is that's giving you money for what you written,

185
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:25.030
wants to know what you wrote.
But I actually,
I have to have one of my people,

186
00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:26.320
my assistants,
like,
hey,

187
00:10:26.321 --> 00:10:29.920
write the lyrics down and I'll sit there and dictate them to you because it's

188
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.490
become like a superstition at this

189
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.180
<v 0>point.
Two.
Wow.
Have you ever tried to like break away from that?</v>

190
00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:38.660
Only let me see if I could just ride one star from scratch by writing it down.

191
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:40.850
I have and it's just,
again,
it's like I don't,

192
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.350
I live in a song until it's done.
You know what I mean?
Until it's finished.

193
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:48.080
It's all around me and said once it's on paper,
it's like,

194
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.540
well you hit some notes,
man,
you hit some notes in that.
What it's like song.

195
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:58.250
We're like,
whoa.
Like you know the one about the girl finding out she's pregnant,

196
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.410
the guy leaving and find that man again,

197
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:02.010
she's going to cut off his balls like you.

198
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.020
You hit that note and that note maybe wasn't something that would have ever been

199
00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:08.930
the same if it was written down.
You know what I'm saying?
Like you,
you,

200
00:11:08.931 --> 00:11:13.100
you hit it with the feeling of being that girl and that situation and it was

201
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:15.440
realistic and,
and,
and you know,

202
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.170
like alive three dimensional.

203
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.860
<v 5>I mean there's trust,
there's times I wish I could take,
do that,</v>

204
00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.490
but like take that and write it on a piece of paper in a way that I thought was

205
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.990
beautiful and artistic.
Cause I'd love to write a movie but I can't do that.

206
00:11:29.991 --> 00:11:34.310
I'm not,
I'm saying this thing about music and the way it lives in my head,

207
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.570
I don't really know how to make music,
man.
I've been faking it for a long time.

208
00:11:38.571 --> 00:11:41.870
Dude.
I just been picking up things and making sounds that I'm like,

209
00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:44.630
I like this sound,
I'm going to make this sound.
You know what I mean?

210
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.190
This thing way I can put it.
I mean I've learned along the way how to become,

211
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.560
you know,
a musician and her producer record.

212
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:54.040
But I'm saying it started with just kind of being like,

213
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.780
<v 4>I'm just going to rapper or whatever it was I was going to do,
you know,</v>

214
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:00.220
and then pick up the guitar was just,

215
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.890
and I'm just going to play this little thing I wrote and maybe if he,
uh,

216
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.870
that's kind of brilliant though in a way because it's so uninfluenced and

217
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:09.520
influence at the same time,
you know,

218
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:13.200
instead of being influenced by like classical instruction and you know,

219
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.650
structure and all that stuff,

220
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.370
you're influenced by just what you enjoy and imitating that,
you know,

221
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:21.570
and then expressing it in your own way.
It's,
you know,
it's amazing.
It's a,

222
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.510
that's very rare that you know that someone's ever done that.
Right.
And that,

223
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:27.280
you know,
when you meet other people that are musicians,

224
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:29.500
so they have the same story.
No,
not really.
I mean,

225
00:12:29.501 --> 00:12:32.960
a lot of them really trip on the way I like do what I do,
you know,

226
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.060
especially like when I bring,

227
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:36.660
because I always bring in cast to help produce records.
I,
I,

228
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.600
I think even though I could probably accomplish the deed on my own,

229
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:45.070
you need people to challenge you in the course of creating something,

230
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:48.530
just to make it that much better.
Collaborate and bounce shit back and forth.

231
00:12:48.531 --> 00:12:52.900
Just somebody that you can trust enough that would say,
that sucks.
Even just,

232
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:55.480
even if it's just somebody that's at your guy,
he's your my guy,

233
00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:59.770
to make sure if something sucks,
you're the voice.
You know what I mean?
Who's,

234
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.060
who's opinion you trust.
Yeah.
And also creatively,
whatever it is,
you know?
I mean,

235
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:05.770
there's a lot of instruments I can't play,
you know,

236
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.240
that I know cats that can play.
So,
um,
it's just,
you know,

237
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.070
they,
you know,
all of them go to school,
all that.
That's what I'm saying.

238
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:17.680
I steal everything I can from all of them,
you know what I mean?

239
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.340
It's like I'm always the worst musician in the room in my mind because I don't

240
00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:22.900
know what I don't.
I still,

241
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.790
even though I'll get up and play with anybody and it'll work,

242
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.340
I still have this thing in the back of my mind was like,

243
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:33.580
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
It's like,
man,
okay.

244
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:36.760
I'm just kind of sneaking on stage and seeing if I blend.

245
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:39.970
I'm like the soy bomb guy from the,
from the Grammy's.

246
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:43.360
Remember that guy who came out here and dealing with the soy bomb written on his

247
00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:44.780
chest?
It was wild.
I'm like,
Geez,

248
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.430
I'm just sneaking onto the set trying to get some,
but you got another.

249
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.710
People must love that.
There's something so authentic about that.

250
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.490
There's something so authentic about just kind of like learn how to play music

251
00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:57.010
by making noises with a guitar until you figured it out.

252
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.340
Pretty fucking watching,
watching the videos real close and right.

253
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.520
Vhs,

254
00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:07.390
pausing them and the things shaken and you're trying to see where his fingers

255
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:11.610
are on the thing.
We like,
what card is that?
I'm going to try and do that.

256
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.830
Did you breed a book on it or anything and he's not,
you know,

257
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.340
I took a few guitar lessons when like when I was real young,

258
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:22.120
like maybe six or eight guitar lessons and then kind of lost interest in it.

259
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.870
And then cause hip hop kind of stole my mind away.

260
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.320
And then later on during the house of pain days I,

261
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:33.040
there's actually a bunch of stuff on house of Payne records that are just little

262
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:35.830
things that I played that we looped up and put it,
you know,

263
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:39.520
like little country riff or that shit kicker song ever.

264
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.790
Every time I go to town,
people started kicking my dog around.

265
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:44.950
There's a guitar piece under the air that I played is,

266
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.110
so there's little bits of it,
but it's like after I left house of pain,

267
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:52.340
I just started,
I had a guitar around

268
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.950
<v 5>me all the time and I just started really actually saying,</v>

269
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.570
let me see what I can do with this thing.

270
00:14:56.571 --> 00:15:00.600
And the cat who helped me produce Weide Force sings the blues,
uh,

271
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.930
or I should say produced the record with me,

272
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:08.230
Dante Ross w we were just working on hip hop music and I was just kind of

273
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.930
crashing his place and playing guitar all the time.
And he'd be like,

274
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.490
what is that?
And it was this thing and I didn't even know what it was.
Yeah,

275
00:15:14.491 --> 00:15:17.540
but that's what it turned out to be.
What it's like,
he was like,

276
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:21.110
we're going to record that tomorrow.
And I was like,
I don't even know what it is.

277
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:23.150
So now I'm thinking I got to record this meeting tomorrow.

278
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:26.890
So I stay up all night and I like write lyrics to it.
And you know,

279
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.540
it turned out we'd put it into a little beat and we were sitting there listening

280
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:32.540
to it and were like,
that works.
But how does it work with all this stuff?

281
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.980
You're doing this rat record.

282
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:37.870
And that's how the other songs and Whitey Ford just kind of started happening.

283
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.090
I just,
they just,
like I said,
the music just started surrounding me.
I lit,

284
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:46.180
I listened to the music more than let's say I have this definite idea of what a

285
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:48.170
song is.
I'll,

286
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:53.090
I'll get a lyrical idea or a little riff idea and I'll start working on that.

287
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.330
And then once that takes a little bit of life,

288
00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.090
it'll start telling me what it wants.
It will be like,
I want to,

289
00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:04.070
I want out here a slide guitar on it or there should be a piano right there.

290
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:06.980
I can hear it in the,
in the,
in the space that's in between.

291
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:10.550
It's telling me I don't like,
I'm not this dude who was like,

292
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:12.200
I know what parts and what,
but I'll be like,

293
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:15.110
I know what sounds should go right there cause it's,
I can hear it.

294
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.560
And then you add that sound and it will sub harmonically create this other go

295
00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:22.030
sound in there that you're like,
oh that's a violin.
I can hear it.

296
00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:25.850
Let's put a violin in there.
And it builds itself into what it's supposed to be.

297
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.320
That's amazing.
That's pretty fucking fat ass man.
When I was a kid,

298
00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:32.900
I had friends that were musicians and I was always terrified to learning a

299
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:36.190
musical instrument.
I was like,
that shit looks like it.
Take it to mine.

300
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.930
I'm still terrified of learning a new musical instrument,
man.

301
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.120
<v 1>Do you find like,
like technology has helped you a lot?
Like,
er,
you know,</v>

302
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.350
like not garageband bite and they guide programming and the most programs

303
00:16:46.351 --> 00:16:46.950
nowadays,

304
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.340
<v 5>and I,
I do,</v>

305
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.270
I have to keep an engineer around all the time on,
on,

306
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:57.630
on duty and ready to go because I'm so I can get on the laptop and go on youtube

307
00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:01.980
and find some stupid videos that'll make me laugh.
You know,

308
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.830
I can get on the Facebook and the Twitter and whatnot,
but I,
you know,

309
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.330
if I could,

310
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.440
I could probably get two tracks recorded at the studio on my own before I just,

311
00:17:11.441 --> 00:17:15.130
you know,
turned in for the day.
That would take me probably about six hours,

312
00:17:15.131 --> 00:17:18.870
which would take him about eight minutes.
Wow.
Yeah.
So,
um,

313
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.830
the technology is helped

314
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.390
by making it easier to have your own studio.
You know what I mean?

315
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.160
Instead of spending $1 million on a studio and spend 40 $50,000 and I have a

316
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:34.970
really beautiful studio.
Know what I mean?
But uh,
Eh,
um,

317
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.490
I'm,
I'm,
I'm still with just,
it's all about 90% of what I do is,

318
00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:40.923
you know,

319
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:46.050
either at my studio or late at night in a room by myself with the Acoustic

320
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.670
Guitar Banging on it,
trying to think of something or witty or

321
00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:51.600
<v 0>will you,</v>

322
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.600
will you really nailed was this kind of like bluesy smooth hip hoppy sound,

323
00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.880
you know,
that nobody had ever done before.
Like,
like what it's like,

324
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.090
that's like there's a lot of blues to that song.
You know,

325
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:09.040
<v 5>there's just kind of walk the line between Brad from sublime and why clef John</v>

326
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.780
has kind of really like,
was like I saw,

327
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.870
I saw with white cliffs started doing,
you know,

328
00:18:14.871 --> 00:18:18.710
with all his arm being an island influenced music makes him that way.
Hip Hop.

329
00:18:18.711 --> 00:18:22.730
And I was just kind of starting to record this guitar stuff to what it's like

330
00:18:22.731 --> 00:18:27.710
song and I was a big fan of sublime and how he always like injected little these

331
00:18:27.711 --> 00:18:29.900
little hip hop phrases into lyrics and things.

332
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.120
I knew he had to be never really knew the dude,

333
00:18:32.121 --> 00:18:36.350
but knew we had to be kind of a bboy to a certain degree and those kinds of

334
00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:37.500
things.
I,
that's,
that's,

335
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.070
that's Kinda how we saw that it would all work when we were,

336
00:18:40.071 --> 00:18:42.230
we were looking at the record and me and my friend Dante,

337
00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:46.810
my label thought Whitey Ford sings the blues was a horrible idea.
You're like,

338
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.350
it always works.
Yeah.

339
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:53.810
It was because we were convinced what we know this is gonna work.
This is like,

340
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.650
there's no,
you know,
it's just what it is,
you know?
It's all the same thing to me.

341
00:18:57.651 --> 00:18:59.730
I'm a,
that's what I always say is like,
I'm a,

342
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.470
I consider myself a hip hop artists,

343
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:03.800
but I also don't really believe in any genre of music.

344
00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:05.480
I just think music's music.
You know what I mean?

345
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.490
Tony Bennett has some stuff that makes me go like this.
Right.
And I'll be like,

346
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.810
oh that's hip hop to me.
Cause that's the same thing.
Hip Hop made me the reins,

347
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.290
Zeppelin song,

348
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.150
somebody else that's rock and roll with somebody who has caused that jazz.

349
00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:22.880
It's somebody,
you know what I mean?
But it's whatever makes you personally.
Yeah.

350
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:27.640
Ooh.
What does that kind of feeling?
Yeah,
I like a lot of country music and some,

351
00:19:27.641 --> 00:19:31.010
some people give me shit about that.
I like some Toby Keith songs.
Man,

352
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.030
not so big on new country cause I'm just not hip to the game.

353
00:19:35.031 --> 00:19:36.890
But I love country music.
When you're going to,

354
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.480
you're going to like that record shop.
I love it.

355
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:41.440
I'm a fan of yours and you drive home tonight,

356
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:42.770
you popped that record and you took,

357
00:19:42.771 --> 00:19:45.500
by the time you get home and find him see like a text from me.

358
00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:49.360
Like that's a bad ass.
Right?
It goes great with whiskey.
I,
I feel,
I bet.

359
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.490
I believe it will.
But I know Anthony Martinez again country,

360
00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:54.470
but there's definitely country friendly man.

361
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.720
<v 0>Yeah,
well it's got a,
a slang to it,
you know,</v>

362
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.010
it's kind of smoothness to it.
I know.
It's a,
it's a,
it's great shit man.

363
00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.140
I love it.
I'm a,
I'm a huge fan of shit.

364
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.020
And one of the things that Anthony Bordain said we were having this conversation

365
00:20:08.021 --> 00:20:10.630
once,
you know,
he didn't become famous till he's like in his forties.

366
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:14.240
<v 5>Oh,
hold up,
let me pick up their name.
You just dropped your man.
No,
no,</v>

367
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.970
it's good because I'm going to say it because it for you.
Um,

368
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.310
<v 0>but he said,
well,</v>

369
00:20:19.311 --> 00:20:22.800
the coolest thing about becoming famous is that you get to meet famous people.

370
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.390
Like that is the coolest day.
Absolutely.

371
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:27.540
And meeting you and hanging out with you at the UFC.
Look,
one time we were,

372
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:30.490
we were smoking a joint in a Vegas Casino.
We're in,

373
00:20:30.491 --> 00:20:35.310
in the middle of a bar and a,
I go,
are you go,
you wanna smoke a joint?
I go,

374
00:20:35.311 --> 00:20:38.340
yeah,
where are we?
Where are you going to go?
And he goes,
Everlast just goes,
me,

375
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:39.174
me and go.

376
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.570
<v 5>Yeah.
I was like,
where you go satellite or pulls out a lot.
I'm like,
oh,
all right,</v>

377
00:20:43.571 --> 00:20:45.190
well fuck it man.
If I got arrested,

378
00:20:45.191 --> 00:20:48.760
at least I'm getting arrested with Everlast the worst day and ask us to put it

379
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:51.010
out,
man,
you don't have to worst.
We'd be like,
Hey,
come on man.

380
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.440
They give you that look like,
dude,
don't make my job harder.

381
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.630
You can still smoke in a nightclub in Vegas,
Huh?

382
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.960
<v 1>Cigarettes allowed in nightclubs in Vegas.</v>

383
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.180
I don't know but we've smoked in a nightclub before.

384
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.650
Remember we just stepped out that door and
door.

385
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:07.600
That's outside.
But is there an inside area?

386
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:10.540
Are you allowed to smoke inside anywhere in the morning now it's not.

387
00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.240
I try to remember last time I still do it in the casino

388
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.930
<v 5>cause I still see people smoking in the casinos pulling that out though.</v>

389
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.930
They're slowly pulling the cigarettes will fight that tooth and nail at all.

390
00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.500
I guess it's the real problem is that people that work there and I get it man,

391
00:21:24.501 --> 00:21:26.030
if you're a waitress,
why the fuck you should?

392
00:21:26.031 --> 00:21:30.620
You have to breathe that shit in all day.
I smoked a cigarette and a long time.

393
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.240
That's a tricky drug.
Still.
Think about it.
Nah.
See,

394
00:21:35.241 --> 00:21:39.860
cause what happened to me was I woke up in the hospital that had emergency heart

395
00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:44.060
surgery like 98.
So it was like,
I was like,
Oh,
I'm done smoking.
Wow.

396
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.720
I didn't even,
I didn't even,
I mean like I still smoke some weed now and then,

397
00:21:47.721 --> 00:21:50.810
but like,
you know,
even for like three years,
two years after that,

398
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.530
about two years after the surgery,
I didn't,
I was like,
awesome.
Hell No,
I'm,

399
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:59.300
I'm alive.
I'm trying to what?
I can never sleep because I,

400
00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:04.210
um,
I what happened was I went to bed Stuy.
I'm real tired.

401
00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.090
I'm not feeling good.

402
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.950
Went to sleep and woke up in cedars like after surgery.

403
00:22:09.951 --> 00:22:14.040
So like in my mind was on this like,
don't go sleep.
Kind of like trip.
Oh,

404
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.290
like a long time.
I was like an insomniac man.
Oh Man.

405
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.460
But I would let my band guys smoke a little weed up in the front of the bus and

406
00:22:22.461 --> 00:22:25.070
one night I decided was I couldn't sleep as usual,

407
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:29.440
but that somebody has something real.
Just,
I like reminisce.
I was like,
wow.
Now.

408
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.390
That's some,
that's something quality up there.

409
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.140
So I went out to just kind of smelly and I was like,
you know what,
let me just,

410
00:22:36.141 --> 00:22:38.540
and everybody was like,
are you sure?
I was like,
I'm a grown man.

411
00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.660
Let me it like that dad.
So all I did,

412
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.060
I gave it back to them that I went to the back of the bus.

413
00:22:44.061 --> 00:22:46.400
I slept like a God damn baby man.

414
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.760
So it became for like a good long time,
few years I that's,

415
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.730
that's all it was right before bed.
Sleep like a baby.

416
00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.990
A lot of people use it for that.

417
00:22:56.991 --> 00:22:59.720
I know a lot of people that are in Sunday and of course you know we wanted them

418
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.670
started young and after a while you lose,

419
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:07.060
you lose that humbleness that almost dying gives you and you're out at the club.

420
00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:10.070
And so he was like,
I have to join.
I hit the joint before I go to bed.

421
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.310
I'll hit it now.
But now and they say,
no,
you're smoking.

422
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.130
<v 1>It's lucky you had somebody next to you though because you just went to sleep.</v>

423
00:23:16.131 --> 00:23:19.220
What if you didn't have somebody next to you it

424
00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.470
<v 5>than that?
Like during the day,</v>

425
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:22.630
like the guys that were making the record where me,

426
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.130
we had the studio in my house,

427
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:26.870
I had a house up in Mount Olympus in Laurel Canyon and we were just,

428
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.950
I just built a studio up in there to record the record and everybody was living

429
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:34.620
in the house and apparently just all day I wasn't feeling,
I don't,

430
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.310
I just didn't feel well and I didn't look well.
And when I went to lay down,

431
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.080
I guess somebody came and checked on me just to be like,
hey,
you all right.

432
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:46.010
And I guess I was breathing funny and they just panicked,
called hot.

433
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.270
<v 4>Like coach shook me a few times.
I guess I wouldn't wake up,
call the hospital,</v>

434
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:54.980
you know,
it was my extreme fortune to live in a neighborhood,
uh,
that the,
the,

435
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:59.210
the closest hospital was Cedar Sinai.
Oh,
nice.
And then it was,
it was,
you know,

436
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:02.690
also my,
uh,
Irish luck that,
uh,

437
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.600
the best heart surgeon in the world who Dr. William Trento was,

438
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.040
who's chief of heart surgery over there.
I think of maybe even of all surgery,

439
00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:13.580
saw my case and told somebody else that you can't do that.

440
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:16.970
I have to do that my life.
This is what happened to me is the same.

441
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.170
He killed John Ritter in like 30 minutes.
Jesus Christ,
the same exact thing.

442
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.890
What is it exactly?
I believe if I remember correctly,

443
00:24:24.891 --> 00:24:29.480
it was called an upper ascending aortic aneurism and what I have in there now as

444
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:32.270
a saint Jude's heart valve,
it's a titanium heart valve.

445
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.960
Like I tick like a watch man woe and you want to hear,
hold on,

446
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.090
get real sensitive on this mark right here.

447
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.593
<v 6>Oh my God.</v>

448
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.340
<v 4>Holy Shit.
Wow.
Yeah,
like 14 years now.</v>

449
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.610
That's like white noise to me.
I,
I,
I could take my pulse without anything.

450
00:24:52.611 --> 00:24:53.444
I could just,

451
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:54.510
<v 6>okay.</v>

452
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:59.360
<v 4>Take my whole
career about titanium valve in your heart.</v>

453
00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:03.920
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
Is it Bluetooth enabled

454
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.300
dude kill like a robot.
The bionic bionic rapper man.
For Real.

455
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:13.220
That is kind of crazy,
man.
Isn't it amazing they can do shit like that,
right?

456
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:13.460
Yeah.

457
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.570
And you've had it in your body for how many years in [inaudible] 98 since nine

458
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.550
February 98

459
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:20.640
<v 6>that's amazing.</v>

460
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.600
<v 4>Freaking me out,
man.
That's incredible.
Yeah.
I don't know how to react to that.</v>

461
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.150
It's amazing.
Alien Technology,
man.

462
00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:30.950
That's why I love while watching your Twitter dude,

463
00:25:30.951 --> 00:25:34.430
cause they'll always be some crazy tweet like some fan or tweet you like Yo

464
00:25:34.431 --> 00:25:37.480
aliens dropped off the cure for cancer ed.

465
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.390
You know the whatever it is.
Fort Knox.
Yeah,

466
00:25:41.391 --> 00:25:44.390
it's flying over some of the hospital right now.
Yeah.
I'll be like,
Oh man,

467
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:47.510
I love that.
Cause I know I got an alien technology and my body man,

468
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.770
it's titanium that's got a titanium heart valves and saying how does that work?

469
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.730
Wow,
that's amazing.
I mean imagine trying to explain that to someone.

470
00:25:55.731 --> 00:25:58.880
200 years ago they were going to cut this dude open and we're going to stick

471
00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:00.800
some shit inside there where his shit's broken.

472
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:05.250
It's going to be made out of a metal craft.
You're just a weird metal.
Yeah.

473
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.210
Why wouldn't even bother trying to comprehend this man,
this man,

474
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:11.120
the way it's burning him,
all the bacteria off of him.

475
00:26:11.121 --> 00:26:12.130
How are you going to do that?
I,

476
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.690
that's what the bacteria is there to test the weakness.
You know,

477
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:17.390
you get cut open like that.
It's supposed to attack.
That's nature.

478
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:21.980
Like some subverting the entire system sticking titanium inside of PE,

479
00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:23.360
but it's amazing.
It's incredible.

480
00:26:23.361 --> 00:26:25.310
I have to take a blood thinner for the rest of my life,

481
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:28.430
so a clap doesn't form around it and break off and going into my brain.

482
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.330
What is the flow?
Huh?
What's a blood thinner?
How's that work?

483
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.950
It's an anticoagulant.

484
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.190
Just so just a pill that you take that you know and I have to like,

485
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.030
does it make you like bleed more if you get cut?
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

486
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.100
You're quite as fast.
Wow.
I should give up

487
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.570
<v 5>riding my motorcycle and a few other entities of that nature because if you get</v>

488
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:52.680
cut you just start bleeding out.
Yeah.
If it was severe enough.
Cut.
Yeah.

489
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:53.670
Wow.

490
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.190
<v 0>Who Shit that's in.</v>

491
00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:01.070
Isn't it amazing how the human body can just just be fragile at some points and

492
00:27:01.071 --> 00:27:04.730
just you have to just deal with some issues.
But when you do,
there's a,

493
00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.560
there's a certain humility and a certain like respect for life when you've

494
00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:13.700
gotten through some bad shit,
you know,
do you feel that

495
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.830
<v 5>the way I tried to explain it to people is like most people,</v>

496
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.360
unless you're really highly intelligent and enlightened,

497
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.780
which is not what I'm saying I am when I'm about to say what I'm about to say,

498
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:28.290
I'm just saying some cats just reached death at this point where they're just

499
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:31.290
ready for it and they,
and they're,
and they're ready to cope.

500
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.960
You know what I mean?
But most of us probably see death,
you know,

501
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:38.100
coming at us and you know,
there's,
I look at it like a roller coaster.
Like,

502
00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:40.260
you know,
going on this roller coaster,

503
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:43.170
you told us the scariest roller coaster of all time and you're waiting to go on

504
00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:45.270
it and probably the whole time you're waiting to go on that motherfucker,

505
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:46.590
it's probably really scary.

506
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.370
Then you get on it and you're riding once and it's probably really scary,

507
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.470
but then you know,
if you,
if you get off it and get right back in line,

508
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.121
you know,

509
00:27:57.121 --> 00:28:00.300
the waiting line isn't so scary and then you get back on the ride again.

510
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.950
It's like I,
that's what I compared that to.

511
00:28:01.951 --> 00:28:03.540
It's like I've gone through all the terror,

512
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:08.070
kind of terrifying parts of death thinking I was,
it was upon me.
I was,

513
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.630
I was like,
you know,
woke up in the hospital like I did what?
To me,

514
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:16.980
there's this like,
I got this scar on my chest.
I'm thinking,
you know,
it's so rap.

515
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.180
You know what I mean?
I,
I,
I vaguely remember like,

516
00:28:21.181 --> 00:28:25.250
people talk about a flash of your life flashing before your eyes,
but it,

517
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:29.460
to me it was more of just the sum,
the sum realization of,
wow,
man,

518
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:34.590
that whole 28 years was that long.
That's,

519
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.070
that's Kinda what it was for me.
It wasn't like all these moments.

520
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:40.210
It was just like the summit,
the,
the uh,

521
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:45.300
the realize the realization that my life was like a second long in the scheme of

522
00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:49.050
things.
Wow.
And uh,
so it's intense.

523
00:28:49.051 --> 00:28:52.020
It's about as intense as it gets.
Right.
You know,
it's,
it's crazy.

524
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.140
Surgery is about as intense as it gets,

525
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.480
but I figure like this the next time death upon me,

526
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.770
all the scary parts or con I've been on this roller coaster.
What,

527
00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.560
what comes after that?
It's,
it really is a trip that it's facing everyone,

528
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:09.000
but no one wants to bring it up.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's really the subject.

529
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.260
I can't testify either to any lights at the end,
any tunnels.
But like,

530
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.680
I do also remember hearing a v like what I,

531
00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:19.980
the only way I can describe it as hearing a very familiar voice.

532
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.270
Like I never really knew any of my grandfather's,

533
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:28.860
but it seemed like a grandfather's type voice.
Just kind of,

534
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.450
you know,
it ain't,
you ain't ready yet.
It's not your time.
But I didn't,

535
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.350
I didn't go along with like a light or a vision or a figure.
It was just,
I was,

536
00:29:36.351 --> 00:29:36.901
I don't remember,

537
00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:41.901
is other than this realization about how short my life was and my life could

538
00:29:42.861 --> 00:29:46.700
have been 90 years and that,
that realization would have been exactly the same.

539
00:29:46.701 --> 00:29:47.534
You know what I mean?

540
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.260
But then there's this kind of blackness and his voice being like,
Nah,
no,
no,

541
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:55.130
you ain't get anytime or something of that nature.
Like that's the,

542
00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:59.300
I can't even say it was words as much as just something communicating that

543
00:29:59.301 --> 00:30:00.134
feeling to me

544
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.830
<v 0>it's a real trip to think the idea that this is,</v>

545
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.740
there is a time for you and there is a place for you and there's a thing that

546
00:30:07.741 --> 00:30:08.580
you should be doing.

547
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.520
A lot of people want to think that that's grandiose to think like that.

548
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.280
<v 5>Oh,
you silly.
You know,
you're like,
cause it's been like,
you know,
the deep,</v>

549
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:19.960
this parts of my subconscious like fighting for their lives,

550
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.250
trying to convince me there's a reason to be a lot.
You know,
there's that part,

551
00:30:24.251 --> 00:30:27.810
there's that part.
I mean there's,
uh,
I've battled it ever since.
Was it was,

552
00:30:27.811 --> 00:30:28.190
it was.

553
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:33.190
Was where those spiritual thoughts or where was it scientific and your mind

554
00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:38.140
fighting to stay alive.
Right.
You know what I mean?
The Ego.
Plenty of stuff,
man.

555
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.120
I don't get no chamber but I get in my pool often late at night with the lights

556
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:47.170
off and just lay there with it over my ears in silence for a couple hours

557
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.110
<v 0>you would dig an isolation tank.
You would take the shit out of it,
man.</v>

558
00:30:52.111 --> 00:30:54.870
For you it'd be beautiful because it's a non drug drug.

559
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:59.160
He could just go in there and be healthy and great for your body and it's very

560
00:30:59.161 --> 00:31:02.760
relaxing.
Oh my God,
I bet it's things like bad,

561
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.860
that tank that might be,

562
00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:09.480
you might have the trippiest dreams in there ever because well you know what it

563
00:31:09.481 --> 00:31:10.314
is.
You know how it works.

564
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.320
You've never done it before and I've never actually done it.
Man.

565
00:31:13.321 --> 00:31:15.300
You should own one and you should be in it daily.

566
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:20.780
It's a beautiful thing is going to set me back proper 7,000 for a real good one.

567
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:25.190
That'll last forever.
It's got a big thick lining like the the,
the,

568
00:31:25.191 --> 00:31:29.340
the kind of used to make Koi ponds.
It's all heated.
The water,
it's beautiful.

569
00:31:29.341 --> 00:31:31.530
It's,
it's super reliable.
It never leaked.

570
00:31:31.531 --> 00:31:34.230
You just turn it on when you want to get in there,
boom.

571
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.490
Opened the door hop band and after you get out of the turn,
you turn on the pump.

572
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.880
It's like the most low maintenance thing and man,
it's what a,

573
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.390
what an environment that is proud is often you do it all the time.

574
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.000
I mean every day as much as I can.

575
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.940
Sometimes I don't like to do it every day because then reality gets a little

576
00:31:50.941 --> 00:31:55.620
slippery.
Isn't that right?
Yeah.
I spent too much time alone with the tank.

577
00:31:55.621 --> 00:31:58.170
I just find myself getting really weird dates going on.

578
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.500
I find myself going to friends with my thoughts.
I get,

579
00:32:01.501 --> 00:32:05.370
I get so far deep that it's very difficult to go to the supermarket.

580
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.620
Do you not get pruney when you get in,

581
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.450
you don't come out looking like Mr. Burns or side notes.

582
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.540
I think maybe the saltwater keeps that from happening.

583
00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.140
You know the water's really salted is 800 pounds of salt in it,

584
00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.670
so it's a different thing when you come out and you don't,

585
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:21.790
you're not all pruned up.
I don't know have be funny if you're,

586
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.290
even if you're worried just that's why you failed to always mentioned that every

587
00:32:25.291 --> 00:32:28.080
time you get out and he just looked like a five year old kid dying.

588
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.790
It's one of those things.
Whenever I get out of there I'm like,

589
00:32:32.791 --> 00:32:35.100
this is amazing that no one knows about this.
They should be,

590
00:32:35.101 --> 00:32:36.600
they should teach this in school.

591
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:40.610
They should have people in high school getting an tanks and have people talking

592
00:32:40.611 --> 00:32:43.850
to them and coach them through life.
You shouldn't help everybody.
Joe Rogan,

593
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:46.850
isolation tank.
Too much work.

594
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.810
I don't have time for that a pop man.

595
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:54.270
It sounds like there's that much profit.
To be honest with you,
it's,

596
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.790
it's a lot of it is steel components.
You have to get it manufactured and built.

597
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:00.980
There's this super fucking Jacuzzi system.

598
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:04.970
What's his incredible filtration system and make sure that no microbes can get

599
00:33:04.971 --> 00:33:06.920
in there and fuck with your skin.
And then on top of that,

600
00:33:06.921 --> 00:33:09.410
you have to make sure the water stays exactly the same temperature.

601
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.180
It's a lot of technology into it.

602
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.490
<v 1>You know how you could do it is you have to get it like a $200 on Amazon,</v>

603
00:33:15.491 --> 00:33:18.790
like affordable system that you make out of like a box.
Oh Dude,

604
00:33:18.791 --> 00:33:21.180
you wouldn't want that.
What does it fucking broke in your living room?

605
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.050
<v 0>Fucked up your whole house then I'd be responsible.
No,
you don't want that man.</v>

606
00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.490
George Foreman of a isolation tank.
So that's the thing about a tank man.

607
00:33:29.491 --> 00:33:32.910
If you're going to get one,
you gotta,
you know it's gotta be built correctly.

608
00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:35.490
Someone's got to go in there and do it.
They have a build it yourself one.

609
00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.640
It seems to me too much room for error,
but you know,

610
00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:41.920
people would buy it works pretty good late at night with the lights off,
man.

611
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:46.710
You know,
I'm a floating the floating right.
I'm boy yet.
Oh,
you just,

612
00:33:46.711 --> 00:33:51.420
you can float on your back in the pool.
Holy Shit.
That's amazing.

613
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.800
That's incredible.
I sink like a rock.
I can't do that,

614
00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.980
but if you get in that water tank,
the isolation tank,
then it's beautiful.

615
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.170
Imagine the other thing is that the temperature is perfect.

616
00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.470
It's the exact temperature is your skin so that when you're in there,

617
00:34:07.471 --> 00:34:10.220
you fail to be able to,
after a while you don't differentiate,

618
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:14.340
which isn't the exact temperature of p yeah,
probably

619
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:17.060
comes out of your body.
Right.

620
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.210
It must be just need a garbage bag and just piss yourself sitting inside of it.

621
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:25.810
Yeah.
I try not to pee in the tank,
but you know sometimes shit happens.
Nasty.

622
00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.730
Yeah.
You don't want to smell that while you're in there trying to achieve

623
00:34:29.731 --> 00:34:32.970
enlightenment,
smelling your own piss going,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

624
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.050
Sitting there,
sitting there pressing on myself and an isolation.

625
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.170
<v 1>Have you ever seen somebody that had a pool that was so bad ass,</v>

626
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.840
like they had a lazy river around it?
Can you imagine how bad has,

627
00:34:42.841 --> 00:34:45.870
would that be if you just had a lazy river?
I'm like a huge pool.

628
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:47.410
<v 0>Yeah.
I knew this dude who had a,</v>

629
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.440
he had this giant pool and he had some crazy fucking slide system built into it,

630
00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:55.660
like water slides and everything built into the side of his hill,

631
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:56.850
just like a floating,

632
00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:58.590
<v 1>Dang.
We're just goes around and around.</v>

633
00:34:58.591 --> 00:35:01.470
So you just sit and they're like a little raft and just go in and circle a

634
00:35:01.471 --> 00:35:02.460
Disneyland ride.

635
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.890
Like those pools are where they had like a little lazy river around the whole

636
00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:05.620
entire cool.

637
00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.080
<v 0>That would be okay,
but I'm telling you the isolation tanks better.</v>

638
00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.850
I want to meet somebody so flows a moat.
The moat,

639
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:15.730
the next level that's like of Croatia.

640
00:35:15.731 --> 00:35:20.270
Shit you live in Glendale with.
I know there's no,
Princeton's is in Croatia.

641
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.550
Don't,
don't get angry at me.
Croatian people.
I love you guys.
Yeah,
man.

642
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:28.690
That's some next level shit.
Right?
That's what after the next Zombie Apocalypse,

643
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:33.040
after 2012 people are going to start making moats.
I'm moving out to city.

644
00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:36.220
I'm going to have a moat.
Where are you going to try to make this compound?

645
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.700
And when you're thinking northern California is a good move.

646
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.970
Northern cal could climate.
Yeah.
Not Too.
Not Too hot.

647
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.240
Not too cold or too rainy.
Gets you a little,

648
00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.360
you get a little weather which keeps you honest.
I like the weapons.

649
00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.250
The vegan people.
Well the weather's good for people.

650
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.980
I think people are delusional in California because they never get hit by

651
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.200
whether they're like they just like have no,

652
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.950
they have no respect for what nature can do to Garmin.
Yeah.
It never hits here.

653
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.290
You know when you get here you get a little bit of rain.
Do you do,

654
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:02.430
it's like every now and then it rains.

655
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:06.060
Like people here really have no idea what the fuck whether is like,
yeah,

656
00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:10.080
but we get earthquakes.
Rarely man.
Rarely you're going to have,

657
00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.500
they're definitely coming.
We're all going to and we're all going to be like,

658
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:18.030
why didn't we paid?
The Tab
is indeed,

659
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.040
but I think earthquakes by and large,
you know,

660
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:26.160
you don't get trapped under a giant building.
The crushes your head.
By and large.

661
00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.300
See,
I'm thinking San Diego be close to the biggest air force base ever.
You know,

662
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.830
that just seems like it would make sense.

663
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.180
San Diego be close to the base will be the most protected other than being in

664
00:36:36.181 --> 00:36:40.340
Los Angeles where everyone's going to fucking die.
Does that what you think?
Why,

665
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.950
but why do you think that earthquakes won't hit like a turf wars earthquakes?
No,

666
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:48.360
no,
no,
no strikes out or a Zombie apocalypse or when the Martians come,

667
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.730
we'll actually talk about this.
I'm worried about this shit,
dude.

668
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.450
We're worried about the fall of civilizations.

669
00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.160
Andy boy listens to like Alex Jones,
all that stuff.

670
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.020
Like he's got that iHeart radio APP and he's always watching,

671
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.970
listening to that late night over right.
Stuffed all the craziness.

672
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:06.960
And I was like this,

673
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.310
he was listening to a show that was actually about Zombie apocalypse and zombies

674
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:14.490
and people discussing them.
And I was like,
this is real.

675
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.730
People talking about this.
That's crazy is ridiculous.

676
00:37:17.731 --> 00:37:21.450
But could you imagine if it was possible to make a Zombie?
You know,

677
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.450
it could be it,
it would probably just be a virus of some kind.

678
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:28.590
Now we're talking about,
well it sounds stupid,
but there's this way,

679
00:37:28.591 --> 00:37:30.930
crazier parasites that exist in the world.
You know,

680
00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:33.740
every single human being is essentially a symbiotic.

681
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.560
Every person has a conglomeration of all sorts of different organisms living

682
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:41.200
inside their body.
And without those,
you can't even be alive.
It's,

683
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:45.810
and when you get a parasite,
like when a parasite fucks up a body,
what that is,

684
00:37:45.811 --> 00:37:47.280
is a failed symbiotic.

685
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:51.570
It's like it's trying to have a symbiotic relationship with the organism,

686
00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:55.140
but it's failing.
So it's sucking out too many resources so becomes a parasite.

687
00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:57.390
It's not contributing to the overall system.
Understood.

688
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.690
It is possible that they could come up with something that would hijack your

689
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:04.410
shit so bad that you would be like one of those 28 days later,
motherfucker.

690
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:09.490
That is so 100% absolutely.
Speaking of the dead rise,
oh no,

691
00:38:09.491 --> 00:38:14.040
no.
We're talking about lanes.
28 days later is a Zombie movie.

692
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:16.210
Apocalypse so long enough to figure this out.

693
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:20.280
And I just like these things about zombies right now,
dude,
I'm telling you.

694
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:24.600
Realistic Zombie rules totally geeking out on Zombie rules.

695
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:28.420
The 28 days later was not a Zombie movie in the same thing.

696
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.520
It was a disease or that was created.
It was like,
what was it called,

697
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:35.380
rage or something like that and they gave it to champion and chimps got out and

698
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:36.040
fucked up a whole

699
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.880
<v 4>city with it.
Totally.
That's totally possible.
It is totally possible.</v>

700
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.750
There's a worm that lives inside a grasshopper.

701
00:38:43.751 --> 00:38:47.890
It's an aquatic worm and it grows in its body and then when it gets to the age

702
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:51.940
where it's about to hatch,
it talks the grasshopper into drowning itself.

703
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.500
It controls the grasshoppers body,
hops the grass over over to some water,

704
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:01.450
leaps into it.
So then he called pop out some aquatic worm,
some aquatic worms.

705
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:06.360
It's an actual grantee.
Google aquatic worm.
Grasshopper parasite.
Yeah,

706
00:39:06.361 --> 00:39:10.340
Harris parasite.
None.
Amazing.
Tricks it into drowning itself.
That's amazing.

707
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:14.950
They can pop out of its little body if that's possible.
Anything's possible.

708
00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:18.100
I know that's a lower organism.
They've already extracted it and there's a pill.

709
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.750
Yeah.
And the guy talking to you,
it was already infected by,
hey,
we all might be,

710
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.070
that's what I said about clones.
Found it on Google.
You found the gold,

711
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:31.570
the grasshopper thing.
Brainwashed by parasitic worms and that amazing.

712
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.590
Yeah,
that baby.
Where is that?

713
00:39:35.591 --> 00:39:38.050
Cause I want to go there and just find some drown.

714
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.990
That's like a fun camping trip.
Well,

715
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:45.310
they're finding now more and more of these parasitic relationships that worms

716
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:49.660
have.
Dude.
I mean to people.
Millions of organisms are living on us as we speak.

717
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.740
There's all,
there's a lot on yours right there.
This one are mine.

718
00:39:53.741 --> 00:39:57.010
I'm sure the little bugs that are actually probably helping out,

719
00:39:57.011 --> 00:39:59.800
keeping it clean and shit.
Yeah,
exactly right.

720
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.430
I mean that's what rubbing butts with the whole deal of Acidophilus is.
Right.

721
00:40:03.431 --> 00:40:06.400
You know.
I won't lie though,
man.
It brings them in my mind.

722
00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:08.050
That brings me straight to bed bugs.

723
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:09.900
Like how that whole outbreak in the east coast,

724
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.200
I was like not wanting to go to that.
I was like,
man,

725
00:40:14.201 --> 00:40:16.210
I ain't trying to bring bedbugs home.
I know.

726
00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.940
Can imagine that they get in your clothes and shit,
you're fucked.

727
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.710
It's just multiplying your house.
Oh,
and you've got to get a diffused.

728
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:24.800
It's easy to believe all that.
How quickly,
you know,

729
00:40:24.801 --> 00:40:27.430
it was like people trip on know the nuclear,
this nuclear,

730
00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:30.300
they're not and it's going to be a little germ.
Nate gets all of us,
man.

731
00:40:30.301 --> 00:40:33.790
It can be easily.
It could be.
There's been threats of it for,
you know,

732
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:36.790
who knows how long.
I mean every time.
One of the things that hits everybody,

733
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:39.910
like when the swine flu came out of the bird flu or anything that comes out,

734
00:40:39.911 --> 00:40:43.510
it's like this might be the one we're all scared of because we all know that

735
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:47.430
it's possible.
That one super bug that comes along with,
well,

736
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.120
they got us convinced that at at at least,

737
00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:51.790
and you use every opportunity they can come,
right.

738
00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:54.730
Whatever new vaccine they got out.
I sadly like,

739
00:40:54.731 --> 00:40:59.700
how are we going to sterilize these folks for off?
Yeah.

740
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:03.260
What the fuck is a lot of vaccine drills aren't working fast enough.

741
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:08.830
Are you a believer in chem trails?
I passed them,
right.
It's not pat.

742
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.880
No.
That's how I look at it all.
I mean,
like I look at it like the cats who like,

743
00:41:12.881 --> 00:41:15.700
you know,
if you won't even take the nine 11,
there's cats to be like,

744
00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:17.500
there's no way we did this.
I was like,
well,

745
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.680
there's proof that the very least we knew something was supposed to happen.

746
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.020
Just like that hijacked airplanes.

747
00:41:26.021 --> 00:41:29.760
There was reports that they were going to try and do this and nothing was done

748
00:41:29.761 --> 00:41:34.250
the extra to stop it.
That's kind of a passive participation at the very least.

749
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:39.620
<v 5>So I don't see past anything.
I,
all the heart and all this,</v>

750
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:40.933
I love it.

751
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.410
I love reading about it and learning about it and giving it just enough

752
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:49.850
consideration to be like,
it could be true.
I'm not being,
I'm not living by it,

753
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:53.510
but I'm watching it and be like,
okay,
if,
if,
uh,

754
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:57.380
some crazy scenario breaks out in the world where people just can't breathe

755
00:41:57.381 --> 00:42:00.260
anymore,
there might be something to these stories.

756
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.530
<v 0>Yeah.
You would have to think of why would they be doing it?</v>

757
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.440
There's gotta be a prophet to it.
You've got to talk somebody and doing it.

758
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.170
I think for sure there have been some chem trail experiments.

759
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:13.420
I don't think that's doubted at all.
I think people are well aware of,

760
00:42:13.421 --> 00:42:14.211
there's been some shit,

761
00:42:14.211 --> 00:42:17.690
but the real question is like how much are they doing on a regular basis?

762
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:20.330
I don't think it's like how think they're spraying cities.

763
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.170
<v 5>This is what I call a lot of places and see him everywhere.</v>

764
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.700
<v 1>Do you think this brand,
people do think they try to control the population?</v>

765
00:42:26.701 --> 00:42:27.600
When I was young,

766
00:42:27.601 --> 00:42:31.860
that was just a jet going by ray smoked it and stick around all day.

767
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.120
One of my favorite videos on

768
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:38.210
<v 0>for a ridiculousness is prince sitting down with Dick Gregory and he's talking</v>

769
00:42:38.211 --> 00:42:43.160
about how I think it's Dick Gregory.
He's talking about how um,
there's um,

770
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.730
a chem trails and they fly over the hood and then all of sudden everybody starts

771
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:50.330
fighting and he goes,
and I saw these planes fly over and I was thinking,

772
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:54.240
why is everybody fighting?
And they're like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

773
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.210
You're,
you're in the hood.
Like what do you expect?

774
00:42:56.211 --> 00:42:59.330
Do you think that the planes flying overhead is there spraying,

775
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:01.880
fighting juice down on the people,
not the poverty.

776
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.510
It's not the poverty or the rage or the criminal element.

777
00:43:05.511 --> 00:43:08.300
That's what the drug throughout your community?
Yeah.

778
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:13.280
Or all sorts of corrupt shit that's going on right now.
It's,
this is a plane,

779
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.880
the spraying some shit down and all of a sudden everybody's getting upset.

780
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.370
That's ridiculous.
It's a hilarious video.

781
00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:22.710
<v 1>I think we need to look into those green boxes that used to have in your</v>

782
00:43:22.711 --> 00:43:25.350
backyard that,
that hummed pepper really warm.

783
00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.040
Cause I used to like as a kid lay on those things for probably years.
You know,

784
00:43:29.041 --> 00:43:31.620
and just,
I don't even know what you're talking.

785
00:43:31.621 --> 00:43:35.310
Well in the Midwest or I guess in the suburbs,
not in Los Angeles.
I,

786
00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:38.640
they used to have these green boxes that were like energy plants or something

787
00:43:38.641 --> 00:43:39.870
like that.
I don't know what they were.

788
00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.230
They're just like these and they hum do an eight and there were super warm.

789
00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:46.590
And I remember just sitting out there as a kid for hours,
like on it.

790
00:43:46.591 --> 00:43:49.890
Like I was recharging and I've probably got,
I don't know,

791
00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:55.020
databank bites or something.
I don't know what it's just,
what is that thing?

792
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.660
So many things when you were little that could have made you,
I know.

793
00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.030
What is that thing going on?
I think everyone did that.

794
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:01.700
I don't know what you're talking about for awhile.

795
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:05.490
I'll show you a picture of one.
Familiar yeah.
And the energy source.

796
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.040
It like a weird bond.
Some tasks community,

797
00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:10.860
their own nuclear power plants in their backyard.
Yeah.
Columbus,

798
00:44:10.861 --> 00:44:15.430
Ohio cancer cluster,
nuclear reactors.
There was a test market town.

799
00:44:15.431 --> 00:44:16.360
So like we had like,

800
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:21.200
like you know banana frosties before everyone you were a test market town?
Yes.

801
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:21.811
Columbus,
Ohio.

802
00:44:21.811 --> 00:44:24.930
Who would tell they would test us out like burgers and like I would talk to my

803
00:44:24.931 --> 00:44:27.300
friends,
my cousins that live in a different state and they're like,

804
00:44:27.301 --> 00:44:29.970
we don't have that kind of a weird burger at Mcdonald's.

805
00:44:29.971 --> 00:44:30.804
What are you talking about?

806
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.710
And found out that the people that companies test market Columbus,

807
00:44:34.711 --> 00:44:39.440
Ohio cause that's the most average city in the whole entire country.
Yeah,

808
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.280
that makes sense.

809
00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.130
<v 0>Columbus is like that.
You know,
like the whitest people,
I don't know.</v>

810
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.130
Almost pretty close to the middle too,
isn't it?
Columbus?
Sure.
Yeah.

811
00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.740
<v 1>Do you ever hear of about sister's chicken?</v>

812
00:44:48.741 --> 00:44:52.490
Did you guys ever have that was a Wendy's version of KFC that they were trying

813
00:44:52.491 --> 00:44:56.560
out.
Uh,
and it was just three old ladies was the logo and there was like KFC,

814
00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.950
like wicked sisters and,
and uh,
I don't think it work though,
like last,

815
00:45:00.951 --> 00:45:04.010
like two years or something.
Never heard of it.
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

816
00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.160
<v 7>Yeah.
I'll show you the green box.
Set</v>

817
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.750
<v 0>the green box.
The green box fucked you up.
Another thing that happened to him,</v>

818
00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.720
he was living in an apartment and there's a duct overhead,

819
00:45:14.721 --> 00:45:16.880
like a heating duct where the hot air would come through.

820
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.160
It turns out that wasn't what that was.

821
00:45:19.161 --> 00:45:22.490
Somebody had hooked up the wrong thing to the gas furnace and it was blowing

822
00:45:22.491 --> 00:45:26.630
straight carbon dioxide from the gas furnace.
No.
Yes.
Yeah.

823
00:45:26.631 --> 00:45:27.890
He lived like that for a year.

824
00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.010
<v 1>Okay.
Here's the do not blow up.
He's dead.</v>

825
00:45:30.011 --> 00:45:33.460
And how exactly that on the inside a long time ago.
Uh,
here's,

826
00:45:33.461 --> 00:45:35.470
here's the green box and it makes them stutter.
Now.

827
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.313
<v 7>Green bars,</v>

828
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.590
<v 4>similar things,
but like on the corners of intersection.
Yeah.</v>

829
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:42.781
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

830
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:46.440
We had one in our backyard and I would just sit there and get data bytes pumped

831
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:50.460
into me as a child.
Obviously it has something to do with electricity,

832
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.700
but it's something to do with electricity.
Yeah.
That's not good.

833
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.790
But we didn't have the warning labels.
Like this one has a nice warning label,

834
00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.210
don't like something on it.
Like,
Hey,
don't even get close to this,
this,

835
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.120
have they ever made it

836
00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.900
<v 0>connection or correlation between um,
live in near power?</v>

837
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.190
Like those big giant towers,
you know,
those,
uh,
electrical towers,
right?

838
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:13.880
<v 4>The cancer clusters that they have made a correlation?</v>

839
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.950
Well,
no,
it's,

840
00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:19.410
it's one of them things where you can find both sides that will have equally

841
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:24.270
compelling arguments that right there.
Right.
So that means no,

842
00:46:24.271 --> 00:46:27.530
there has been no definitive,
but I mean it's,

843
00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.440
don't let it write down to kind of common sense a little bit.

844
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:33.270
If you're camped under these things that are like

845
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:39.050
<v 8>scared.
Were you just thinking about that with power lines?
I mean</v>

846
00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.710
<v 4>there's so much fucking power going through their house.</v>

847
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.530
You notice though most public parks or right under it.

848
00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:51.280
Under those.
Yeah.
That's the only free spot that was available.
That's cheap land.

849
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.140
There it is.
That's where we're putting the school.
Yeah man.

850
00:46:56.141 --> 00:46:58.450
When you drive by those things and you can hear them,

851
00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.650
you're roll down your window and the heavy duty ones,
you know what I mean?

852
00:47:01.651 --> 00:47:06.520
A big iron towers were terrified tables.
I did.

853
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.610
I saw a show about that once man with the guys are on helicopters,

854
00:47:09.611 --> 00:47:11.350
they have to do the maintenance for those lines.

855
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:17.180
They actually have to make a connection to the line like with the helicopter to

856
00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:20.530
ground it before they could start working with their parents of the most

857
00:47:20.531 --> 00:47:22.030
dangerous jobs you can have.

858
00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.810
That might've been the show I was watching like life's most dangerous jobs.

859
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.720
Those dudes are nuts.
The fuck they're like in metal.

860
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.850
<v 5>Just think of what that must be.</v>

861
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.810
You must be feeling when you're above one of those things and you know that just

862
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.610
touching it,
just reaching out and touching.

863
00:47:39.611 --> 00:47:43.370
You just would essentially below they're grabbing it.
I like

864
00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:49.110
the connectors that keep working together.
They're fake.
They're fixing it.

865
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.850
You have to trust it.
We gotta know the in the sign,

866
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.080
another piece of the helicopter that they have to call and it has to touch the

867
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:58.300
wire while they're working on it.

868
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:03.160
Apparently one of the most common things is it isn't getting electrocuted.

869
00:48:03.161 --> 00:48:06.700
It's that the tail of the helicopter hits the wire and they just go,

870
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.170
oh my God,
the oblivion.
Oh,
of course.
If they get hit with a gust,
right.

871
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.790
It's almost impossible for them to stop.

872
00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.630
It's apparently like one of the craziest,
most dangerous jobs.
If you did,

873
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:19.570
if you had to do that.
I was watching that.
I was just so nice.

874
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.250
I think I was on the bag and it's all glass,

875
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.750
just like 18 hour drive just watching whenever it was on,

876
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:28.410
but I was a deck stumbled across that.
I was like,
Oh,
here,
here's,

877
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.840
here's the helicopter thing right here.
Actually that's you singing.

878
00:48:31.841 --> 00:48:35.450
What are you doing?
I got on the helicopter.
What's wrong with you?

879
00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.093
<v 4>It's</v>

880
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.220
<v 5>is it?
Yeah.
This might've been the show.
Yeah,
that was me before getting on it.</v>

881
00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:46.050
Watch this dog.
These nuts,
man.
They're like these crazy suits.

882
00:48:46.051 --> 00:48:50.350
One guy's got to touch the wire.
You know what I'm saying?
Like God,
this is

883
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.680
<v 0>Zane.
Oh my God.
He has to climb up.</v>

884
00:48:54.681 --> 00:48:59.410
He climbs up and he's sitting in a harness on top of the fucking wires.
Brian,

885
00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.550
<v 5>why did you mix this together?
Brian made this video himself.
Yeah.</v>

886
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.820
This is an old music video.
I didn't mixed with that stuff in it.

887
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.600
<v 0>Oh.
Oh my God.
Well look at that guy walking on those wires.</v>

888
00:49:08.601 --> 00:49:13.400
That is absolutely horrifying.
That's crazy man.
And I got off garden,

889
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.460
Brent Stafford there volts is know what that is.
Is that what it is?

890
00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.480
How much will kill you?

891
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.750
<v 5>It's a lot less than a lot less now.</v>

892
00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:23.420
That's like they would incinerate you right when you just explode or something.

893
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:26.810
Yeah,
but he's grounded.
So how like he's like grounded on like,

894
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.460
I watched the whole thing.
Hi Man.
It was,
it was amazing.
And they were charged,

895
00:49:31.461 --> 00:49:34.790
like those dudes were on their own.
Some like adrenaline junkie shit.
Oh,

896
00:49:34.791 --> 00:49:37.190
they must be like just the greatest job.

897
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.730
What could you imagine if it was

898
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.210
<v 0>doing something to them?
What if it was like making them super power?</v>

899
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:44.770
They started like

900
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:47.560
<v 5>when the x men thinks starts</v>

901
00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.910
<v 4>the,
the whole,
uh,
it might've been me.</v>

902
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:53.410
What's that really know that had an Ebu Brian,
wasn't it?
And it was pretty loose.

903
00:49:53.411 --> 00:49:58.130
So loud.
No,
I'll tell you right now,
it wasn't me.

904
00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.880
It's not me.
All right,

905
00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:06.200
well I'm just glad I'm not the guy who did it.
Yeah.

906
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.720
Anyway,
where were we?

907
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:13.840
<v 5>We were talking about how mutations to start.</v>

908
00:50:13.841 --> 00:50:16.130
There's where the x men begin is on them lines,
right?
Yeah.
Is Right

909
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:20.110
<v 0>there when,
uh,
one time I,
you know,
when I used to do a fear factor,
I was,
uh,</v>

910
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:23.000
I would eat like pop candies or something before the show,

911
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:27.710
just to kind of keep me like,
hey,
chill,
but happy and fun mood day.

912
00:50:27.711 --> 00:50:30.240
Sometimes you sit around all day and it's boring and if you're not,
you know,

913
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.230
kind of buzz,
it doesn't feel as good sometimes.
Sounds interesting.

914
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:34.910
But one of the days I showed up,

915
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.380
every now and then when something would freak me out,

916
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.230
I would show up at work and I'd be a little banked and they'd tell me what we're

917
00:50:39.231 --> 00:50:41.480
going to do and one of the things they tell them is we're going to have these

918
00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:46.040
people ride bulls.
And I was like,
oh this is a terrible,
terrible,

919
00:50:46.041 --> 00:50:47.060
terrible idea.

920
00:50:47.061 --> 00:50:49.460
Like when you're high and they're telling you you got to ride a bull,

921
00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:53.570
you're like,
oh no sir.
No,
no I'm not getting on that thing.
What is this?

922
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.280
We're going to do what you're going to make people do that.

923
00:50:55.281 --> 00:50:57.740
You're going to get them on and get on there.
I know.
It's fucking crazy.

924
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.770
The only time when we ever did that show where I felt like we were totally

925
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:04.460
rolling the dice,
hoping nobody got hurt.
That was the only time it was.

926
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:06.350
We made them ride bowls cause like you can't,

927
00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:10.760
you can't protect them from that fucking animal.
You can only,
you know,

928
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.100
you can only say so much.
We're gonna try.

929
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:15.650
We're gonna try to keep it from stomping you,
but we can't guarantee you.

930
00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:18.360
We'll give you a chance plate and a helmet,
but you gotta let it.

931
00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:22.470
Imagine you letting the bowl for you with a chest plate and helmet go,

932
00:51:22.471 --> 00:51:25.800
come get me.
I got a chest plate and helmet on.
Oh my God.
You'd feel so fragile.

933
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:31.200
We got lucky with that one.
One girl,
she was 98 pounds something.

934
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.990
Maybe she was on this ball and she agreed to do it.
I'm like,
you're sure?

935
00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.760
She goes,
yeah,
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to go for it.

936
00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.910
She got on the fucking boats.
She,
she lasted for just a couple of seconds.

937
00:51:38.911 --> 00:51:41.790
Of course.
Right?
The bull launches her through the air.

938
00:51:41.791 --> 00:51:45.240
She goes flying and just barely misses her with a kick.

939
00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:46.860
Just barely misses her.

940
00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:49.110
And I just would think about like what we're dataless thing.

941
00:51:49.111 --> 00:51:52.890
We could've got this little girl kicked in the head for some stupid reality
show.

942
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:57.120
You know how much Bray was it at the end of the 50 grand.
If you want.

943
00:51:57.121 --> 00:51:59.700
Right before she falls down.
She was okay.
Funny though,
Dude.

944
00:51:59.701 --> 00:52:01.230
Like not to be little money,
but yeah.

945
00:52:01.231 --> 00:52:03.210
Isn't it funny when people will do for so little money?

946
00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:06.090
Well they do it for fun too.
A lot of them they do it just,
you know,

947
00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.130
there's people that do it and they think that they're going to be able to

948
00:52:08.131 --> 00:52:11.460
eventually get some sort of a career in,
in reality.
More funny to me.

949
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.910
Well you know people have done it even though it's actually turned into that and

950
00:52:14.911 --> 00:52:16.530
know it is weird.
But you know what I'm saying?

951
00:52:16.531 --> 00:52:20.660
Like as long as they're nice people,
I don't give a fuck.
You know,
I,

952
00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:24.270
you could start weird out about what people watch and don't watch.
And I have,

953
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.760
I've gone down that road before.
Look at the fuck is wrong with us.

954
00:52:26.761 --> 00:52:30.270
Why are we watching the Kardashians?
But you know,
the other part of me is like,

955
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:35.070
who gives a fuck?
Hoping she's gonna suck another gig.
So she's done man.

956
00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.950
The only way she would suck another deck and say she would have to like drop

957
00:52:37.951 --> 00:52:40.410
drastically in the ratings to make another sex tape.

958
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.530
It would be really hard to get her to put one out.

959
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.230
Now it's like a Nascar race that's not waiting for the end.

960
00:52:46.231 --> 00:52:48.060
They're waiting for the crash.
You know,
here's my prediction.

961
00:52:48.061 --> 00:52:50.670
The next sex tape won't be her getting fucked.

962
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.060
It'd be a duty and their pussy for like a half an hour.
That's it.

963
00:52:54.061 --> 00:52:54.930
That's a sex tape.

964
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.010
And then she releases that one woopsies that got out and that would,

965
00:52:59.011 --> 00:53:02.370
that would kick her back up to the next level if she was like crying at a press

966
00:53:02.371 --> 00:53:05.490
conference.
I can't believe this.
This was so personal.

967
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.140
I use that image to masturbate too when I'm on the road.
My,

968
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.900
my assistant stole it from my laptop,
you know,

969
00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:18.390
that would,
that could be her next level shit.

970
00:53:18.391 --> 00:53:20.070
She might have to do that in about two years.

971
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.980
Cause like now people are like making like Kardashians jokes are probably like

972
00:53:22.981 --> 00:53:24.740
the number one joke on Twitter.
You know,

973
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:28.570
if you're going make a joke about the Kardashians.
Yeah,
I mean it's like,

974
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:31.520
it's so low hanging fruit.
It's so easy.
Yeah.
I saw that movie,

975
00:53:31.521 --> 00:53:35.240
young adult last night,
the patent Oswald throughout the whole movie.
There's a,

976
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:36.090
you know what it's about now.

977
00:53:36.091 --> 00:53:41.091
I Charlise boron and Patton Oswald and it's fucking really funny and really

978
00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.670
brilliant,
like a brilliant movie.

979
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:47.330
But one of the things is the chick who's the crazy chick Charlise neuron,

980
00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.520
all she watches is Kim Kardashians.

981
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.220
She just watches it every time you seen her at home.

982
00:53:52.221 --> 00:53:55.370
She's just like sitting in front of the TV watching Kim Kardashian and her

983
00:53:55.371 --> 00:53:58.960
sister talk with like this mindless glaze in her.
I had some scenario.
They go,

984
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.010
holy fuck.
That is America man.

985
00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.250
You know those people are responsible for that fucking signal that they're

986
00:54:04.251 --> 00:54:05.960
putting out there,
man.
They are.
They're turning.

987
00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:09.000
If anybody's turning people into zombies.
Yeah,
but this,

988
00:54:09.001 --> 00:54:11.510
this whole movie throughout the whole movie.
That's crazy bitch.

989
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:13.640
Charlie's thrawn is obsessed with her high school boyfriend.

990
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:18.560
I was just watching the Kardashians on TV.
It's a good movie,
man.
It's a really,

991
00:54:18.561 --> 00:54:19.820
like,
the ending is kind of weird.

992
00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:23.040
<v 1>Is it like in the movie theaters movie or just yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

993
00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.280
<v 0>Yeah.
I saw it last night.
It's a good movie.</v>

994
00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:30.260
It's fucking Patton.
Oswalt's a bad motherfucker.
He's funny man.

995
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:33.950
He's going to do the podcast again soon.
Has even done it.
No,

996
00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:39.380
that's it again.
So yeah.
Oops.
Do it soon.
We need to get him on it.

997
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:40.790
Yeah,
that damn movie.

998
00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:45.680
Then he did it with what Galifianakis and the guy with the glasses.

999
00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:50.000
The comedians of comedy.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Those dudes buddy film that.

1000
00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:55.490
Yeah,
that whole thing,
man.
It was hilarious,
man.
Yeah,
those guys are awesome.

1001
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:58.190
There's a,
there's a bunch of real good stand ups right now.

1002
00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.770
It's a good time for standup comedy.

1003
00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.320
This is all starting to break through to like in other forms like,
you know,

1004
00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.220
like you know,
of course Zack.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Patton Oswald everywhere.

1005
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:11.420
Holy Zach Galifianakis is one of those guys that I can help smile when I'm

1006
00:55:11.421 --> 00:55:13.150
watching him.
Yeah.
He's like one of those guys.

1007
00:55:13.151 --> 00:55:15.730
I see him doing something stupid in the movie of,
you know,
even then,

1008
00:55:15.731 --> 00:55:19.990
what was it due date or something like that.
Wasn't the best movie in the world,

1009
00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:24.130
but I'm watching him and he,
he's,
he's,
he makes me smile.
It's just so ridiculous.

1010
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:24.560
You know,

1011
00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.840
<v 1>Brody stole the whole movie,
Do you think so?</v>

1012
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.730
I loved the little Brody hiding like out of nowhere you will find our friend

1013
00:55:31.731 --> 00:55:33.890
Brody Stevens,
I,
he's friends with Zach.

1014
00:55:33.891 --> 00:55:36.980
So every time Zach as a movie or does anything,

1015
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:40.730
Zach throws him in as like these little rolls and stuff and every role it's

1016
00:55:40.731 --> 00:55:43.970
almost playing like a where's Waldo for Brody Stevens.
Like oh there he is.

1017
00:55:43.971 --> 00:55:45.110
He's in the,
he's a police

1018
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:49.200
<v 0>guy.
Whoops.
Why did you have a Google?</v>

1019
00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:53.130
I forgot to switch it back to my camera.
You start tripping me the fuck out.

1020
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.720
I'm like what?
What's your point when now?

1021
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:58.020
Cause the whole thing is starting to trip me out of the car is over here.

1022
00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:02.550
It's very distracted TV over here where my face,
like I'll turn in,

1023
00:56:02.551 --> 00:56:03.450
my face will be on it.

1024
00:56:03.451 --> 00:56:06.780
It'll start on me and then I'll look back and it'll be like some other thing and

1025
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.540
some goats.
Yeah.
This is a,

1026
00:56:09.541 --> 00:56:14.230
the next level of add type shit for people.
Just,

1027
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:18.180
you know,
just a conversation alone.
It's just,
it's too boring,
man.

1028
00:56:18.181 --> 00:56:21.300
It's like 18 screens going,
dude.
He was showing me earlier,

1029
00:56:21.301 --> 00:56:24.070
he was just watching random strangers play video

1030
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.960
<v 4>games.
He does that.</v>

1031
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:29.290
He'll go and watch watch video games essentially would be the home page.

1032
00:56:29.291 --> 00:56:32.010
And it was like,
I was like,
that's the fucking matrix.
Look at it dude.

1033
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:34.630
Like what game do you want to what?
Spy On women's tennis.

1034
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:39.790
All those people are in the fucking computer,
right?
They're all playing games.

1035
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.960
Most of them are trying to kill each other.
Exactly.
The nuts and you know,

1036
00:56:43.961 --> 00:56:46.990
this is only step one.
What's it going to look like a hundred years from now?

1037
00:56:46.991 --> 00:56:49.780
It's going to be a drone warfare dude is just,

1038
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:53.050
what was your go to video game back in the day when you played a lot of games?

1039
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:56.350
The last one I was uh,
I was kind of a socom freak.

1040
00:56:56.490 --> 00:57:01.360
So I like seeing the guy like the character,
I don't like the word you.

1041
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:02.860
All you see is the hands and the gun.

1042
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:05.170
I liked seeing the little guy running around.

1043
00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:07.240
I don't want to feel like I'm actually killing people.

1044
00:57:07.241 --> 00:57:09.980
I know there's a game going.
Right.

1045
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.310
Have you played gears of war that's kind of like that?

1046
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.380
I think one of the first versions I might played,
I,
you know,

1047
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.350
when I got married and had a kid,
man,
it was just,
it was a rap,

1048
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:21.610
like the video games,
like video games.

1049
00:57:21.611 --> 00:57:25.690
It's hard and the video games to me is I've,
I said I just,

1050
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:28.870
I'm always terrified that I'm going to come addicted to them.
I'm terrified.

1051
00:57:28.871 --> 00:57:30.730
They're too good man.
Video Games these days.

1052
00:57:30.731 --> 00:57:33.700
By the time I'm an old man and retire,
I could just sit around and did.

1053
00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:37.030
It shouldn't be crazy by then and be like three dimensional surround sound.

1054
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.040
You're going to pierce your own brand.

1055
00:57:39.041 --> 00:57:42.900
You got to pierce your own temple with somebody else that's going to,
she's at,

1056
00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:48.380
what was that crazy Christopher Walken movie with the brain stuff with Natalie

1057
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:52.930
Wood.
Oh Shit.
Oh,
is that moving?
Yeah.
Dreams.

1058
00:57:52.931 --> 00:57:56.900
Dreams something dreamscape.
Jared is,
yeah.

1059
00:57:57.610 --> 00:57:58.540
Wow.
Did you know that?

1060
00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:02.220
There's a new questions about Natalie Wood and her husband.
Yeah.

1061
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:06.520
A few month or so ago.
Yeah,
man.
Just,
just recently.

1062
00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.950
Robert Wagner.
Wagner man.
Well,
that's what this guy's saying this,
right?

1063
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:15.270
<v 1>Oh yeah,
but they saw him on the the,
on today's show.
I think he was on,</v>

1064
00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:18.040
<v 4>it was also selling a book,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

1065
00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.460
He was selling a book on what she said that Robert Wagner killed her.

1066
00:58:20.461 --> 00:58:22.110
He said he heard a bunch of fighting.

1067
00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:26.130
They heard like violence and then he heard silence.
What's that guy's name again?

1068
00:58:26.131 --> 00:58:29.250
Do you know that?
The guy that the guy was right in the book?
Robert Wagner.

1069
00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:31.400
Robert Wagner?
Yeah.
Robert Wagner.
Natalie,

1070
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:35.570
<v 1>I got to find you this.
I got to find you.
This video.
It's going to trip you out.</v>

1071
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:40.460
This guy asks this question to the guy that's selling the book.

1072
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:44.600
He asked the same question like seven times in a row and it got to the point

1073
00:58:44.601 --> 00:58:48.290
where it was like a joke,
like a Saturday night live skit.
He's like,
okay,

1074
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:50.330
last time.
Same question,

1075
00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.460
and he kept on until the guy wouldn't answer the question.
He,

1076
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:54.210
I'll show it to you.

1077
00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:58.640
<v 4>Hold on one.
[inaudible] there's two.
Does he sell it?
Your cranes.
You Persian,
yes.</v>

1078
00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.360
Oh,
I need to hear that.
Yes.

1079
00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.560
You always need to hear that whenever someone's accusing somebody while he's

1080
00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:06.300
doing that real quick.
And one of your standup specials,

1081
00:59:06.301 --> 00:59:10.010
do you talk about that video?
About the horse,
that Mr Hands,

1082
00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:13.200
did you ever see the documentary?
They made zoo?
Yeah.

1083
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:20.390
Chose joke.
That's the one chosen joke was about I,
they changed the law.

1084
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.250
They changed the law because of that dude's

1085
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:24.370
<v 0>just crazy.
Dot.
Yeah.
That was just like</v>

1086
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.240
seeing these people that being interviewed in speaking about their little

1087
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:33.590
zoophilia or whatever they call it.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
it was,
wow.

1088
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.540
It was sort of a documentary.

1089
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:39.140
It was sort of like a performance documentary where they had actors play roles,

1090
00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:43.550
so it wasn't,
yeah,
cause the guy's dead.
You know,
he was in through a lot of it.

1091
00:59:43.551 --> 00:59:46.160
Like I think it was a real sneaky way they did that documentary,

1092
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:49.250
but what it did was it forced them to change the law there.

1093
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.650
People were moving there so they can fuck animals legally.

1094
00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.920
That's what these people did.
They met online,
they met in a chat room.
They said,

1095
00:59:54.921 --> 00:59:57.170
I like fucking animals.
I'm just going to put that out there.

1096
00:59:57.350 --> 01:00:00.530
And then everybody's like,
damn,
I like animals.
Fucking me.
Let's,
let's do this.

1097
01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:03.170
Let's move in together.
And they moved in together and they've got like,
you know,

1098
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.080
an area where they all lived and they would go to a farm.

1099
01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:10.440
And Phil did hundreds of hours of guys getting fucked by donkeys and horses.

1100
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:15.200
Crazy man.
Insane man.
Here's the video right here.
So he just lets you know,

1101
01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:19.290
man,
that there's always gonna be someone who's taken a deeper,

1102
01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:23.020
<v 9>I can't answer that question right now.
And,
and when,
why not?</v>

1103
01:00:23.021 --> 01:00:24.490
You're referring to mistakes you made.

1104
01:00:24.491 --> 01:00:28.060
Have you changed your story from when you spoke to investigators years ago?

1105
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:35.110
I did lie on a report,
uh,
years ago.

1106
01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:39.200
And what did you lie about then?
It was just a mess.

1107
01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:45.070
I made mistakes,
um,
by not telling the honest truth.

1108
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:48.310
Uh,
in a,
in a police report.
What,
just be specific.
I mean,

1109
01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.290
we've talked about the broad outlines of the story.

1110
01:00:50.291 --> 01:00:52.000
What is it that you were untruthful about?

1111
01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:57.730
Just everything that took place that weekend

1112
01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.280
was the fight between Natalie Wood and her husband,
Robert Wagner.

1113
01:01:03.281 --> 01:01:04.690
What ultimately led to her death?

1114
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.420
Yes.
How so?

1115
01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.980
I tell you that you won't buy my book.
Like I said,

1116
01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:20.610
that's going to be up to the investigators to decide.
Um,

1117
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:25.050
the point you're making is that it's because of information in the book

1118
01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:28.770
information that you're bringing to them that they would be reopening this

1119
01:01:28.771 --> 01:01:33.440
investigation.
Is it your charge that in fact Robert Wagner,
uh,

1120
01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:37.410
essentially tried to make this a low profile investigation,

1121
01:01:37.411 --> 01:01:42.090
did not do everything he could to try to find her once she went missing after

1122
01:01:42.091 --> 01:01:46.940
their arguments?
Yes,
it was,
um,

1123
01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:50.790
it was to be kept a low profile investor,
a little profile investigation.

1124
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:54.660
So you're saying that Wagner did not do everything he should have done to look

1125
01:01:54.661 --> 01:01:59.661
for her after she went missing exactly what she was he responsible for her death

1126
01:02:00.271 --> 01:02:05.210
in some way?
Well,
like I said,

1127
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.080
I think we all made mistakes that night and um,

1128
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.280
Mr that wasn't my question.
Was He responsible for her death?

1129
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:18.080
I'm not asking you about your story.
Um,
yes,
I would say so.
Yes.

1130
01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:18.943
How so?

1131
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:26.090
<v 0>I really don't want to get involved in national television,
sir.</v>

1132
01:02:26.091 --> 01:02:27.080
And accused him of something

1133
01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:28.670
<v 9>thing like that,
but not back it up.</v>

1134
01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:32.800
<v 0>Well that's up to the investigators.
That's actually not,</v>

1135
01:02:32.801 --> 01:02:35.680
the video is pretty interesting.
Well,
yeah,
he sounds as like,

1136
01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.390
this is definitely something missing.

1137
01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:40.720
Something's ticking when she'd be talking and talking and when she'd be ticking.

1138
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.100
Right.
He's awesome.
I mean,
yeah.
That's all he's doing,
right.

1139
01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:47.480
He ain't nothing being speculated about that.

1140
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:51.490
It wasn't speculated about the day she went drowned.
Yeah,
exactly.

1141
01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:55.850
Well,
didn't William Shatner,
his wife like turn up drown too?

1142
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.740
That was in his pool.
Oh Shit.
Wasn't it in his backyard?

1143
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:01.300
Did John Somebody in a pool?
Yeah.
What happened?

1144
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:06.010
I haven't got nothing to William Shatner.
I think he was out of town.
That's good.

1145
01:03:06.011 --> 01:03:07.000
Well,
he did it right.

1146
01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:13.580
We're not insinuating anyway or whatever.
Yeah,
that guy.
I'm not buying that.

1147
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.230
You have to sometimes explain that to people.
Yeah,
you do.

1148
01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:18.860
It's a sad world we live in.
Wow.

1149
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:23.260
When you can say retard without any repercussions,
you don't call unclean.
Sure.

1150
01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.170
Like I think he's a pretty funny too.
It's hilarious.

1151
01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.170
Sometimes he says some real outrageous shit,
right?

1152
01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.000
He gets under people's feathers,

1153
01:03:31.001 --> 01:03:35.440
but like he'll say something about like when Kim Jong Il died or something.

1154
01:03:35.441 --> 01:03:39.160
And Like I love him cause he just retweets every stupid hateful.

1155
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:43.600
It gets sent to him.
But it's like these people are like really saying like,

1156
01:03:43.601 --> 01:03:45.100
how could you say something like that?
It's like,

1157
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:47.980
don't you realize you're following a comedian?

1158
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.940
Like sarcastic one at that.
Yeah.
I was like,

1159
01:03:54.941 --> 01:03:57.890
it just blows my mind how literal people are.
Yeah.

1160
01:03:58.150 --> 01:04:02.230
Well one of the things was a catching news was that he was accusing a will

1161
01:04:02.231 --> 01:04:07.231
Ferrell of stealing from him and talking about the really bad bag drugs that

1162
01:04:07.451 --> 01:04:11.320
will was doing.
I mean it's just so reads like a Goddamn Collin Quinn punchline,

1163
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.520
the really bad,
bad drugs that he was doing,
you know?
And people bought into it.

1164
01:04:15.521 --> 01:04:19.680
Man,
it was becoming news.
I can't even dummies you silly fucks.
We,

1165
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:23.110
we live in them to see how quickly,

1166
01:04:23.111 --> 01:04:27.550
how many people can drop him or his number will fluctuate.

1167
01:04:27.551 --> 01:04:31.010
I look at his number as much as it's too much just because it's funny like who

1168
01:04:31.011 --> 01:04:35.170
do you piss off today?
Yeah,
Colin Quinn is im is underappreciated genius.

1169
01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:37.870
He's just one of the funniest guys I've ever seen.
Any funny.

1170
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:41.140
When people listen to comedians and then a community and actually has to say

1171
01:04:41.141 --> 01:04:42.910
once in a while like,
Yo,
these are jokes.
This is,

1172
01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:46.400
we're not serious Collins style of,
of smart ass.

1173
01:04:46.401 --> 01:04:51.010
He really smart comedy.
It's so unusual,
man.
I never hardly ever get the sense,

1174
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:54.220
it's hard for us to see each other unless we're like,
you know I,

1175
01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:57.220
if I just happen to be in a town where someone's doing a set,

1176
01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:00.430
I'll stop in and watch them do a full set or I catch like a special,

1177
01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:02.820
but other than that,
you know,
I'm in one town,
they were in another,
it's,

1178
01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:03.491
it's hard to see him.

1179
01:05:03.491 --> 01:05:07.150
So I did a tough crowd once and there was like one of the first times I got to

1180
01:05:07.151 --> 01:05:09.940
see Collin do like a long sat and he did it in front of all of his fans,

1181
01:05:09.941 --> 01:05:12.260
you know,
cause they're all so,
so he would like warm up the crowd.

1182
01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:15.250
God Damn he was good,
was really good.

1183
01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:19.690
Like it's like when you see him tight like t Colin Quinn's a bad motherfucker.

1184
01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:22.120
He doesn't get nearly enough respect,
you know,

1185
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:26.460
people that he sold his self deprecating that people just,
you know,
I it,

1186
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:30.700
for whatever reason,
I don't know what it is.
I mean he just,
these two smart,

1187
01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.960
it's whatever it is.
It's his frequencies to,
he's too a,

1188
01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:38.290
it's too good for some people to figure out getting a little too dumb.

1189
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:43.840
Really that bad.
I mean,
isn't there a way to snap us out of this man?

1190
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.810
One of the things you did a couple of years ago,

1191
01:05:46.811 --> 01:05:48.810
I don't know if it was the same special,
but it was about the,

1192
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:53.320
that all the smart people die is that day's coming,
man.
It's possible.

1193
01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.810
It is possible.
And that's what I thought.

1194
01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:00.810
I had a ripped you off a little bit with dead idiocracy a movie maybe,
but it's,

1195
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.860
I don't think I'm the only one that's ever had that thought.

1196
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:06.010
I think other people have been thinking that people are getting stupid ass a

1197
01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.100
little bit.
Yeah.
I ripped off a lot of cords from a lot of songs,
man.

1198
01:06:09.101 --> 01:06:13.180
It's not always,
I met Mike Judge.
He didn't seem guilty when I met him,

1199
01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:16.760
so he probably didn't make that movie.

1200
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.880
I'm just saying this seems like something like,
oh,

1201
01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:21.940
this thing's kind of like that premise.
I should've got that special ed earlier.

1202
01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:26.380
Actually the special was out before idiocracy my point I,
that's what I'm saying,

1203
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:31.440
especially down in 2005 idiocracy was 2006 but I had been doing that bit for a

1204
01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:35.370
couple of years.
That bid came from one mushroom trip,
one mushroom trip.

1205
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:37.570
I just sat and looked at the whole progression of,

1206
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:42.571
of the human race and it was some sort of a crazy fight between overpopulation

1207
01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:46.990
of stupid people and like packets of really intelligent people figuring out

1208
01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:51.940
matter itself to the point of total complete complexity where they blow up the

1209
01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.830
whole universe when we restart all over again,

1210
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:56.530
but that all came from a mushroom trip.

1211
01:06:56.531 --> 01:07:00.280
Then I started thinking about like how ridiculous it was that I put all my
faith,

1212
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:01.210
my food,

1213
01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:05.410
that the warmth and the cold of my family all in the hands of things that I

1214
01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:09.310
totally don't understand.
I just hit switches.
I haven't researched them.

1215
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.450
I don't know what the fuck powers them.
I have no idea of the science behind it.

1216
01:07:13.451 --> 01:07:15.880
I don't know.
I'm just open the frigerator.
It takes some melt pour glass.

1217
01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:16.930
I don't know how to fuck this.

1218
01:07:16.931 --> 01:07:20.770
Milk has been able to sit in my refrigerator for a week and not turn into rotten

1219
01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:23.690
cheese.
You know what I mean?
Like,
but it's been pulverized who?

1220
01:07:23.691 --> 01:07:25.900
Some crazy machine that I'll never be able to understand.

1221
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.080
Gotten to the point where all the bacteria has broken down so you could store it

1222
01:07:29.081 --> 01:07:32.590
in your frigerator that you don't understand some box that keeps shit cold and

1223
01:07:32.591 --> 01:07:34.480
that's the only way we can all live like this.

1224
01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:37.090
The only way we can all live like this and nobody understands it.

1225
01:07:37.091 --> 01:07:40.450
And then I just had that,
you know?
Then the bit just sort of wrote itself.

1226
01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:42.130
I tell everybody,
everybody's like,

1227
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:45.810
you gets on these tangents about nuclear bombs and,

1228
01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:49.240
and even viruses,
which is perfectly logical,

1229
01:07:49.241 --> 01:07:53.260
but I'm saying the real alls it really would take would be let the lights go out

1230
01:07:53.261 --> 01:07:55.940
for a week and let's see where we are as,

1231
01:07:55.941 --> 01:08:00.640
as a civilization when everything stops working.
Yeah.

1232
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:02.200
Well when it's not good man,
you know,

1233
01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:06.100
a person's real true character comes out in a,

1234
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:09.820
in a situation where everything gets tested and a lot of people never get
tested.

1235
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.830
They just never get tested to their life.

1236
01:08:11.831 --> 01:08:16.370
They coast through the boring but easy job and they go to sleep and they get up

1237
01:08:16.371 --> 01:08:18.830
and they do it all over again and the shit never hits the fan.

1238
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:19.940
And if shit does it,

1239
01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:23.930
<v 4>the fans,
when you need to know how to shoot a deer,
you shot the deer,
right?</v>

1240
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:27.380
What do you do now?
You find it now.
How far did it run?

1241
01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:31.150
Can you follow the blood trail and what's okay?
You wait,
you,
you shot it.

1242
01:08:31.151 --> 01:08:35.360
You found it.
It's dead.
Okay.
Even though,
right?
Got It.
Quarter it.

1243
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.570
How do you keep the meat?
Good.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Meets only good for a few hours,
man.

1244
01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.720
When are you going to do,
unless you get it cut up,
right?
Yeah.

1245
01:08:41.721 --> 01:08:43.650
You've got to cut it out and get an a frigerator name.

1246
01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.330
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's nuts,
man.
The A,
the process is so simple.</v>

1247
01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:48.250
Now we go to a supermarket,

1248
01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.990
it's like we've accelerated everything to the point where it's ridiculous.

1249
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:51.830
You can get meat

1250
01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.400
<v 4>like that and you know you could,
well,
no.</v>

1251
01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:57.170
Who would've ever thought that you could just step out into the street,

1252
01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.530
walk a block and get a fucking fat,
thick,

1253
01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.390
juicy ribeye steak.
Perfectly cut.
Like perfectly aged,

1254
01:09:05.391 --> 01:09:09.110
right.
Ready to go.
You'd have do no preparation whatsoever.
Just say,

1255
01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:13.160
I'll take that.
Boom.
You take it home.
There's fire,
boom,

1256
01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:17.510
you're cooking it in like seconds and an Indian patient is nuclear like

1257
01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:20.420
technology right there in your kitchen ready to cook your food.
Yeah,

1258
01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:24.620
you can microwave the fuck out of it as he did then.
Right?
It's amazing.

1259
01:09:24.621 --> 01:09:28.280
It's amazing what we've come to.
It's such a short period of human history.
We,

1260
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:31.130
you know,
they lead the technology man.
Do you think so?
I'm sure it's me.

1261
01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:33.920
I got it in my body,
man.
Part Alien.
Now,

1262
01:09:34.730 --> 01:09:38.240
do you believe in aliens for rails again,
one of those things that I just,

1263
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:42.570
I put up to there was like,
I can't not believe in aliens.
Right?

1264
01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.440
I can't sit here and tell you.
I know there's aliens and I've seen it,

1265
01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:50.210
but it's like,
all right,
every one of those lights up there is a sun.

1266
01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:54.530
Odds are,
there's gotta be,
you know,
another,

1267
01:09:54.531 --> 01:09:56.990
another branch of a intelligence.

1268
01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.920
<v 0>It just seems ridiculous to think that there wouldn't be,
it seems,</v>

1269
01:10:00.921 --> 01:10:03.320
it seems like we've already figured out that things are recreated.

1270
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:07.130
All of the galaxies,
like a glass gas giants,
rocky planets,

1271
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:10.310
planets in the goldilocks zone,
planets with water plants without water.

1272
01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:12.980
Like we can apparently read their atmosphere somehow or another.

1273
01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:14.900
They can figure that shit out.
I don't know how,

1274
01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:17.720
but they could figure out like what temperature a planet is.

1275
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:21.200
Thousands of light years away.
It's a strange,
strange thing.

1276
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:22.370
I don't know how the fuck they do it,

1277
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:25.430
but they found a lot of planets like this a lot.

1278
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:29.660
So there's gotta be some other shit.
Has gotta be some other shit.
So 100%

1279
01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.850
<v 4>I mean,
and then you know,
you get into the whole interdimensional speaking of,</v>

1280
01:10:33.851 --> 01:10:37.630
you know,
how you,
what if we're dealing with dimensional specs,
you know,

1281
01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:40.960
your brain could blow up.
You know,
you gotta be high to think about something.

1282
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:43.930
<v 0>You know,
it's funny,
but we,
we will,</v>

1283
01:10:43.931 --> 01:10:46.630
all we do by ridiculing any of that shit is just,

1284
01:10:46.631 --> 01:10:48.970
we're just trying to control reality too.

1285
01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.950
Even the ridiculous part that we understand as is the ridiculous part of us

1286
01:10:53.951 --> 01:10:58.540
being a part of a galaxy.
And that galaxy,
a part of the universe is university.

1287
01:10:58.541 --> 01:11:01.930
In one part of one universe.
This infinite amount of universes,

1288
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.050
like just all these nutty,
nutty that we know to be true.

1289
01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:08.530
Like wrapping our heads around infinity and the ideas.
We know that to be true.

1290
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.260
We,
we don't want to go any further than that.
You start introducing new shit,

1291
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:18.210
you start introducing aliens,
but
I got no room.
I've got no room for you.

1292
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:19.260
Crazy alien and talk.

1293
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:23.910
It's like there's almost like the reality that we're absorbing as it is,

1294
01:11:23.911 --> 01:11:28.911
is so baffling and so fucking crazy that we're like almost unwilling to look at

1295
01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:32.010
anything that's more confusing,
not to mention it,
you know,

1296
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:36.270
then the powers that be have also mix this magical thing called religion into

1297
01:11:36.271 --> 01:11:39.380
the,
into the fat and to the whole thing.
So if a,

1298
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:42.930
if a ship full of aliens actually came and landed in full view of everybody,

1299
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:47.250
that fucks up a lot of people's belief systems.
Yeah,
that's over.

1300
01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.620
It really does.
You know what I mean?
It would be interesting,

1301
01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:52.950
like who would like jockey first to try to get cool with the aliens?

1302
01:11:52.951 --> 01:11:55.870
Like the Catholic Church.
The aliens have made peace.
And you know,

1303
01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.080
next thing you know is Jesus was an alien.

1304
01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:00.740
He was the first and true and only alien.
You know what I mean?

1305
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:04.310
Because this whole war of like they drop off a new gospel.
Yeah,

1306
01:12:04.311 --> 01:12:06.810
they bring us a new gospel.
It's a floating USB.

1307
01:12:06.811 --> 01:12:11.250
All the other religions are to be wiped out.
That would be so easy.
Matt,

1308
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:14.580
could you imagine if you were from another planet and you had some super dope

1309
01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:17.820
technology and you want to come out and you knew the history of the religions,

1310
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:21.780
okay.
What's the number one religion?
Most popular is a Christianity.
Islam.

1311
01:12:21.781 --> 01:12:22.860
It's one of those,
okay,

1312
01:12:22.861 --> 01:12:26.370
well this is what we do and we're going to come down with one guy that has both

1313
01:12:26.371 --> 01:12:29.850
of those religions in his history and he's going to do some fucking magic and

1314
01:12:29.851 --> 01:12:32.400
he's going to take over the planet.
There you go.
That's all you'd have to do.

1315
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:36.150
Not even magic to them.
Not even levitating.
That's natural.
That can do that.

1316
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.720
Kim Maginnis landing a helicopter a thousand years ago.

1317
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.840
Just going back and landing a fucking helicopter and seeing people freak out and

1318
01:12:42.841 --> 01:12:45.810
run for cover.
You know what?
What are,

1319
01:12:45.811 --> 01:12:49.080
what kind of a world are we going to be living in and just another decade just

1320
01:12:49.081 --> 01:12:51.510
to know that 20 years,
it's just another 50,000 years.

1321
01:12:51.511 --> 01:12:56.000
You could have just broke out a flashlight and got that.
Yeah.

1322
01:12:56.010 --> 01:13:01.000
No Shit.
The finest contained his magic.
Yeah.

1323
01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:03.810
Everybody had fire.
That's what they had for fo for,

1324
01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.340
we told them that was cutting edge technology right there,
man.

1325
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:10.640
A fire and a night.
You were good.
You were caught up with the Joneses.
Why?

1326
01:13:10.670 --> 01:13:13.050
Because electricity is only like a couple of hundred years old.
Right.

1327
01:13:13.190 --> 01:13:17.400
What's the woman's electricity was eating late 18 hundreds Tesla,
right.

1328
01:13:17.401 --> 01:13:18.960
That was the beginning of the next level.

1329
01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:22.950
Maybe not even until the early 19 hundreds yeah.
Wow.
That's amazing.

1330
01:13:22.951 --> 01:13:25.830
They were using fire to state.
They keep things lit.

1331
01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:29.220
If he wasn't angles and shit in the city kites to charge their phones.

1332
01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:33.300
That really makes like,
like Leonardo Davinci,
like some of his shit.

1333
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:36.930
Even more impressive that he did that shit by candlelight.
You know,

1334
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.320
thinking about the Sistine Chapel.
They can doing that shit with candles.

1335
01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:45.480
You know,
God damn motherfucker had fire.

1336
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:50.510
He was lit by fire and he was still motivated enough to do that on his back for

1337
01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:54.780
his back.
However many years,
Jesus Christ.
How long did that take?

1338
01:13:54.781 --> 01:13:56.070
I don't know how to take a couple of years.

1339
01:13:57.030 --> 01:14:00.150
That's one of the great artworks of humankind.
No longer.

1340
01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:02.010
I'm sure I'm underestimating.

1341
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:06.450
Keep matching them with all the other dudes who were like trying to be artists

1342
01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.820
back in the days of Leonardo Da Vinci.

1343
01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:14.080
Guys like thought they were pretty bad ass.
You know,
it's,
you know Morgan on,

1344
01:14:14.081 --> 01:14:16.600
it's pretty cool pieces.
Pretty proud of it.
You know,

1345
01:14:16.601 --> 01:14:19.030
I think I'm kind of the Shit and you,
oh yeah.

1346
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:21.100
You knew that Leonardo Da Vinci Dude.
Yeah.

1347
01:14:21.101 --> 01:14:23.300
He's been painting the ceiling for three years.
Yeah,

1348
01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.570
<v 4>on his back.
It shits brilliant.</v>

1349
01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:29.320
They didn't fit in the helicopter in his spare time in figuring out how to make

1350
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:30.380
a fucking biplane.

1351
01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:37.690
It was on speed.
He's amazing,
dude,
man.

1352
01:14:37.691 --> 01:14:38.524
He's talking about

1353
01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.650
<v 0>super dude.
You know what,</v>

1354
01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:45.660
what an amazing mind that guy had wished it was film of that guy.
You know,

1355
01:14:45.661 --> 01:14:47.430
he's one of those guys you wish like,
man,

1356
01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.670
we really missed out on getting some recordings of that guy talking on my

1357
01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.460
podcast.
He must have been a super genius.

1358
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:57.510
I mean he must've been some insane through the roof Iq type character and he

1359
01:14:57.511 --> 01:14:57.721
just,

1360
01:14:57.721 --> 01:15:01.710
it seemed like he would like just sketch all these like insane machines out and

1361
01:15:01.711 --> 01:15:06.340
figure things out.
And then perfect anatomy.
I mean,
you know,
just what a,

1362
01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:09.870
what an amazing,
amazing mind that guy must have had.

1363
01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:11.700
Do you ever draw or do any kind of art?

1364
01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.810
<v 4>Oh,
I mean a little bit.
I came into music actually I was a graffiti writer,</v>

1365
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:21.370
like with a bunch of cats and some of them started making some music for fun and

1366
01:15:21.371 --> 01:15:24.910
I,
I had kind of followed suit and it just became,
you know,

1367
01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.020
something that happened.
You know,
they have somebody within that group,

1368
01:15:29.021 --> 01:15:33.860
new ice tea and that's how that whole thing took off.
Ice t signed me.
But,
um,

1369
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.460
I don't make as much art is that must be pretty fucking cool to get signed by

1370
01:15:37.461 --> 01:15:39.680
ice tea.
Yeah.
When I was 17

1371
01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:45.060
<v 0>severe like holy shit,
I just got signed by ice.
Tea's amazing.</v>

1372
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:49.680
<v 4>And it was what it was before.
Like people,
it wasn't like about in a note,</v>

1373
01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:54.270
there were no super duper hundred million records selling people in rap.

1374
01:15:54.271 --> 01:15:58.860
It was like,
you know,
the biggest people were like run DMC at that time.
Wow.

1375
01:15:59.030 --> 01:16:02.040
Uh,
not that public enemy in a few,
you know,
stuff like that.

1376
01:16:02.041 --> 01:16:04.470
It was just starting to crack and then,
uh,

1377
01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:07.410
I was just doing it for fun and dude asked me if I wanted to make a record for

1378
01:16:07.411 --> 01:16:11.430
him and I said sure.
Yeah,
why not?
And I made a record for him and

1379
01:16:13.410 --> 01:16:16.680
next thing was house of Payne and whatnot,
but to ask me questions,

1380
01:16:16.681 --> 01:16:20.490
I collect a lot of art.
I don't really,
you do collect I,
I'm a,

1381
01:16:20.491 --> 01:16:25.491
I'm a avid like graffiti based and street art based collector of art.

1382
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:27.413
Yeah.

1383
01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:31.650
<v 1>I love that.
There's a website for,
I think it's e s t.
Y I think it is.
What it is,</v>

1384
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:32.641
something like that.

1385
01:16:32.641 --> 01:16:36.300
But it's a four artists and a lot of our listeners who are artists,

1386
01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:40.530
we'll sell like posters on this website.
And lately I've been,
uh,

1387
01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.970
lately I've been just buying up so much like posters,
like original prints,

1388
01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:48.270
cause it's like one out of 20,
we're only printing out 20 pieces of this.

1389
01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:50.820
And so for 15 bucks I'll just,
all right,

1390
01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:54.090
I'll have one of those 15 or one of his 20 and now I'm just out of nowhere,

1391
01:16:54.091 --> 01:16:58.110
it started collecting art because of this one website.
It's amazing website.
Yes.

1392
01:16:58.111 --> 01:16:59.160
T I believe

1393
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.970
<v 4>I started out like,
I don't know,
10 years or so,
maybe more ago,</v>

1394
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:05.920
maybe 15 years ago,

1395
01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.220
collecting all these toys out of Hong Kong that these graffiti writers

1396
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:13.010
<v 5>from America,
we're going like all these Asian cats,</v>

1397
01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:15.080
we're big fans of the whole graffiti scene.

1398
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:19.670
And they would hire these cats to make toys for like companies like bounty

1399
01:17:19.671 --> 01:17:21.710
hunter and Metacam and all these.

1400
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.730
So I collected all these toys and then I ran into her homie that was like the

1401
01:17:25.731 --> 01:17:30.110
editor of a,
of a art magazine called juxtapose.
And,
uh,

1402
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:33.290
he was like,
Yo,
this is cool.
You collect these toys,
but he's like,

1403
01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:38.240
you should be actually collecting paintings in an art.
And I was like,
okay.

1404
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:41.390
And the next thing I knew,
I was like,
you know,
going out of it became,

1405
01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:45.410
I'm like an obsessive,
I have,
I have like a thousand pairs of sneakers.

1406
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.590
I like having a whole,
what's your,
what's your brands of them aren't even open?

1407
01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:49.424
Most of them.
Like

1408
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:54.320
I got like 200 pairs of sneakers probably that I just rotate.
Wow.

1409
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:56.780
You know what I mean?
That I'd wear and then there's probably like six,

1410
01:17:56.781 --> 01:17:59.150
800 pairs of sneakers.
Like in boxes.

1411
01:17:59.151 --> 01:18:01.750
Like I had a whole thing at the Grammy Museum.
They had a hip hop exhibit,

1412
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:06.470
like all my sneeze,
like top 50 sneakers,
sneakers.
Well,

1413
01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:09.940
what I'm explaining is like,
I go well for,
for cat like me and wrapped like this,

1414
01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:15.050
there's a whole like,
um,
I can,
I'm what I call a w I consider myself a bboy.

1415
01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.500
Right.
Which is like,
you know,
in the truest sense of the word is a break boy,

1416
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:24.050
a cat that break dancers.
But it became like the,
the the title,

1417
01:18:24.051 --> 01:18:26.390
if you're a hip hop like console or like

1418
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:32.990
that I consider myself to be and that's how I live a B boy.
Like you know,
like a,

1419
01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:35.060
like a Hesher would be a rock dude.

1420
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:40.070
A bboy is hip hop sat question.
That's how it would be.

1421
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:44.780
Asher is to rock cause B boy his third base they will be bboys sure,

1422
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.860
definitely.
But collected sneakers is kind of part of that sneaker.

1423
01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:50.770
It's part of the culture.
I agree.
I you,

1424
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:54.440
I could be in some dirty clothes if I had done a new piece of jewelry and some

1425
01:18:54.441 --> 01:18:59.420
new sneakers.
You can't tell me nothing.
You have a favorite brand.

1426
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:03.950
Yeah,
but like I'm pretty much a Nike Snob,

1427
01:19:03.951 --> 01:19:07.040
you know like old school air force ones and Jordans and stuff like that.

1428
01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:09.470
But did you get the Voltron's?
I haven't.

1429
01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:11.960
I stopped collecting a couple of years ago.
I still buy sneakers,

1430
01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:15.460
but I forced myself to wear them all.
Like,
I ha I don't buy,

1431
01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:18.010
I used to buy compulsively just to be like if I,

1432
01:19:18.011 --> 01:19:19.790
I don't even know if I like those but could a moment.

1433
01:19:19.791 --> 01:19:23.430
So do you have like a closet that's specially designed for sneakers?

1434
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:25.310
That bedroom that no,
it's not designed.

1435
01:19:25.311 --> 01:19:30.200
It's just looks like a backroom storage spot of a footlocker.
It's kind of crazy.

1436
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:32.360
Really?
Yeah,
it's retarded.

1437
01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:35.900
I won't even show it anymore cause it's shameful.

1438
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:39.740
Shameful.
But the point I,

1439
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:43.940
the reason I even brought it up though is that I'm compulsive like that after I

1440
01:19:43.941 --> 01:19:44.960
was doing the sneakers and I,

1441
01:19:44.961 --> 01:19:48.350
like I said I collected these toys but I stopped doing both of those.

1442
01:19:48.351 --> 01:19:50.930
I kind of sick all that energy into collecting like paintings.

1443
01:19:50.931 --> 01:19:54.710
I have like paintings now in,
in how I,
I have a couple of different houses.

1444
01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:58.220
I have paintings like just that there's too many even hanging on walls,

1445
01:19:58.221 --> 01:20:00.080
they're like in stacks just laying on the,

1446
01:20:00.081 --> 01:20:04.120
on against leaning up against walls or you should give tours.
Man.

1447
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:08.820
I bet you have some amazing shit or do it.
Little video blog for your website.

1448
01:20:08.890 --> 01:20:12.180
There's a lot of cats that are blowing up really big right now that I've had for

1449
01:20:12.181 --> 01:20:17.110
a long time.
Cause and shepard Fairey I was collecting before she was,
you know,

1450
01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:22.170
like bank Banksy,
you know all,
you know Jose Parla.

1451
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.370
Yeah.
Just and all kinds of this,
I'm big on a cat name.

1452
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:30.790
Crayola,
Greg symptons.
It's a big time pain,
you know what I mean?
It's all,

1453
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:34.320
everything it future,
uh,
all cast like that.

1454
01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:37.880
But everything's based around graffiti or street art,
like cats.

1455
01:20:37.881 --> 01:20:41.040
That actually started like industry's putting their art up.
It has awesome.

1456
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:42.640
I went to this dude's house

1457
01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.520
<v 0>once you had a house in the Hollywood hills and uh,</v>

1458
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:46.640
he had a whole wall of his house.

1459
01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:49.790
Like we had a crazy house with a glass wall that faces the city,
you know,

1460
01:20:49.791 --> 01:20:54.770
the whole deal.
And a whole,
like long wall of his house was a gallery.

1461
01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.840
It was set up like four rotating pieces of art.
And he would,
you know,

1462
01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:03.080
literally like harbor some of the best artists in the world and buy their shit

1463
01:21:03.081 --> 01:21:05.540
and rotate new stuff from their tos.

1464
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:09.800
Like he had warehouses where it would store pieces that he wasn't showing.

1465
01:21:09.850 --> 01:21:12.970
I'm getting to the point where I have to find like a professional place soon to

1466
01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:16.790
store a lot of my art.
Yeah.
This dude had his house set up like a museum.

1467
01:21:16.791 --> 01:21:19.490
I mean he would wrote him.
He's incredibly,
incredibly rich.

1468
01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.480
<v 5>The House I was telling you about up here in the hills before I had a kid and</v>

1469
01:21:23.481 --> 01:21:26.600
got married,
that's all it was.
The downstairs of the house had no furniture.

1470
01:21:26.601 --> 01:21:29.780
It was just paintings all around.
Let me ask you something.

1471
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:33.790
<v 0>Well,
living in the house,
cause I,
I've had friends that were robbed up there.</v>

1472
01:21:33.791 --> 01:21:36.820
I've had a couple of friends that have been coming here up in the Hollywood

1473
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:40.260
hills,
Hollywood hills.
Oh,
you're talking about Yup.
Here.
Yeah.

1474
01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:43.460
But the Hollywood hills is what I was talking about.
Like I,

1475
01:21:43.461 --> 01:21:47.230
I've heard a lot of people getting like home invasions of shit in the Hollywood

1476
01:21:47.231 --> 01:21:47.720
hills.

1477
01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.310
<v 5>Sure.
Man,
you get caught slipping.
I mean,</v>

1478
01:21:49.311 --> 01:21:51.320
I used to live in Mount Olympus actually,

1479
01:21:51.321 --> 01:21:53.560
which is right up here in Laurel Canyon and,

1480
01:21:53.561 --> 01:21:56.300
and I lived up there for many years and never had a problem.

1481
01:21:56.301 --> 01:21:59.930
But I'm that dude dead when he's driving home from the store,

1482
01:21:59.931 --> 01:22:04.931
like has the gun in his lap and I make two extra turns on that.

1483
01:22:05.061 --> 01:22:06.140
Dude.
I just,
that's awesome.

1484
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:09.170
It's not because I'm on this thing that everybody's out to get me,

1485
01:22:09.171 --> 01:22:13.460
but it's like I'm not going to beat the guy to get got because I was stupid and

1486
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.200
I just been trained like that.

1487
01:22:15.201 --> 01:22:20.201
But I owe that to like actually a lot of like Cypress homeys and them cats when

1488
01:22:20.331 --> 01:22:23.690
we was all coming up together cause they kind of came,
I came from suburbia,

1489
01:22:23.691 --> 01:22:25.940
you know what I mean?
Not Rich Suburbia,
you know,
lower class,

1490
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:29.840
lower middle class but middle class nonetheless.
And these cats came from,

1491
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:31.720
you know like I was with ice and all them,

1492
01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:34.910
like I ran with the syndicate for awhile but I never was like dipped into like

1493
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:38.240
he was already a grown man into the entertainment business is big gangster.

1494
01:22:38.241 --> 01:22:42.140
And all that days were right behind him.
Cypress guys were fresh off the street,

1495
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.630
you know what I mean?
Like when they first made that first record.

1496
01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:48.740
So I learned a lot from them about like how to roll like places and Yo,

1497
01:22:48.741 --> 01:22:51.170
they were always worried about who was following them when they were leaving.

1498
01:22:51.171 --> 01:22:53.840
So it kind of,
even though it didn't apply to me,
always,

1499
01:22:53.841 --> 01:22:56.300
it's stuck with me to be that alert about things.

1500
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:58.700
And also because I tend to wear a lot of jewelry.
I have a,

1501
01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:01.810
I have a really nice car,
you know what I mean?
The sucker that it,

1502
01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.130
constant paranoia almost like you're at olive garden.
Know,
like I said,

1503
01:23:06.131 --> 01:23:08.260
I'm not like everybody's out to get me,
but it's like,

1504
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:12.460
let me just be sure of who I am and where I am and what's what's around me,

1505
01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:15.350
you know what I mean?
So I'll make that extra turn.
I'll make that.
If I,
and I,

1506
01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:20.020
and I've,
I've been lucky long enough to think that luck is,
I don't,
you know,

1507
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.410
I really don't believe in luck.
It's just a word that you use because if,

1508
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.990
if there was such thing as luck,
you know,

1509
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:27.940
you could fuck a pig and actually have a real kid,
you know what I mean?

1510
01:23:27.941 --> 01:23:32.650
Like that'd be,
that would be magic.
More broadly.
He lucky.
It'd be lucky.

1511
01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:36.880
I don't believe in magic.
So,
but it's Matt Luckiest Magic to a certain degree.

1512
01:23:36.881 --> 01:23:39.460
That's my point in a way.
In a weird way what I'm saying.

1513
01:23:39.461 --> 01:23:43.450
It's like I've been alert enough that I know that I have actually avoided a few

1514
01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:48.451
times of actually beings robbed or this or that and the other by just by

1515
01:23:48.581 --> 01:23:51.550
circumstances and how I reacted to them and how I was alerted to them.

1516
01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.910
There was times when I was in New York at certain clubs where I've definitely

1517
01:23:54.911 --> 01:23:59.230
knew I was being,
I was being like stalked and about to be preyed upon.

1518
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:02.440
And I would happen to bump into some cats that I knew and I'd be like,

1519
01:24:02.441 --> 01:24:05.860
I'm already alerted to these dudes w you know?
And it'd be like,

1520
01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:09.760
just the fact that now with some people's,
I know and then I,

1521
01:24:09.761 --> 01:24:12.550
they know I'm on to them.
You know what I mean?
You're by yourself.

1522
01:24:12.551 --> 01:24:14.980
You know what I mean?
If you,
if you ain't getting your oblivious,

1523
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:17.220
I mean like it's,
you know,
that's the,

1524
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:19.810
that's the worst thing is being oblivious to what's going on around you.

1525
01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.080
That is a crazy thing.
You have to worry about people physically jacking you.

1526
01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.950
Dude,
I'm not going to come on everybody.
You don't think about it all.

1527
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.060
But I mean like it's a thing that we have to worry about it so real.

1528
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.290
I made a lot of music and all that but my profile is nowhere near yours.

1529
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:33.730
You know what I mean?
I've sold a lot of records,
whatever.

1530
01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:36.820
I keep a low profile on purpose.
I like going to Ralph's.
I like it.

1531
01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:39.940
I like going into the olive bar and making my own little bowl of olives.

1532
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.250
I like that.
I enjoy that.

1533
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:47.251
I like getting a little blue box of cheezits and some olives and going home and

1534
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.260
watching whatever it is does UFC or a football game,
whatever.

1535
01:24:50.261 --> 01:24:53.020
I like to be able to do that.
I like to be able to drive my car and enjoy it.

1536
01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:57.340
Right.
I mean,
so I keep my,
my music is far more famous than I am as a face.

1537
01:24:57.750 --> 01:25:01.480
You got to work,
you're the face of a sport to a certain degree.

1538
01:25:01.481 --> 01:25:05.770
So it's like your most bottles.
Very nice to me.
Most people are decent,

1539
01:25:05.771 --> 01:25:09.810
nice people.
We're not worried about those people.
It's true table.

1540
01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:13.370
We're worried about the small percentage that are nice.
Yeah.

1541
01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:17.600
<v 1>He,
you had a public uh,
online battle with m and M and,</v>

1542
01:25:17.601 --> 01:25:22.150
and I know this is old and everything like that,
but a lot of us followed it.
Uh,

1543
01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:26.080
<v 5>I didn't find out about it until today.
Is that right?
Yeah,
it was,
it was,</v>

1544
01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:29.380
it was a very,
I mean,
amongst us it was known in our fans.

1545
01:25:29.381 --> 01:25:31.780
It was known but it wasn't like,
it was like this thing over Napster.

1546
01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:35.500
Like I never released a record about it because I wasn't trying to profit off

1547
01:25:35.501 --> 01:25:38.020
the situation.
It was a personal thing between me and him.

1548
01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:39.370
What'd you guys get mad at each other for?

1549
01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:42.650
I got a little mad at him cause I went to shake his hand somewhere and he kind

1550
01:25:42.651 --> 01:25:45.750
of,
before he was m and m who he is now Elvis,
you know,

1551
01:25:45.751 --> 01:25:47.380
the as big as Elvis type character.

1552
01:25:47.381 --> 01:25:50.530
This was like when he was first coming in and I just went to shake his hand and

1553
01:25:50.531 --> 01:25:54.220
he kind of,
I felt disrespected,
found out later that,
you know,

1554
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:55.510
he didn't really see it the same way.

1555
01:25:55.511 --> 01:25:58.240
He didn't realize it was that kind of situation after the fact.
Like I said,

1556
01:25:58.241 --> 01:26:00.240
we haven't had a problem for 10 years.
Right.

1557
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:02.980
So it's just a short little thing or like words,
words,
words.

1558
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:07.250
And then it was like,
you know,
it was just,
you know,
just became like,
all right,

1559
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:08.690
well you know,
you don't talk about me,

1560
01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.840
we won't talk about you and we'll just keep it at that.

1561
01:26:10.930 --> 01:26:14.130
<v 0>One of the things that I've found,
and it's pretty easy to,</v>

1562
01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:16.170
to to grab upon this,

1563
01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:19.680
is that whenever you're around anybody who's really creative or really out there

1564
01:26:19.681 --> 01:26:22.770
really like dynamic and the way they perform,

1565
01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.860
they're also almost always very emotional,
you know?

1566
01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:28.800
And some of them have a good handle on it.
Like you,
you know,

1567
01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:33.600
you're always a pretty relaxed,
mellow in a certain groove.

1568
01:26:33.601 --> 01:26:36.360
Dude,
you're never like,
I've been around you a bunch of times.

1569
01:26:36.361 --> 01:26:40.530
I never seen you like agitated and never seen you like stress in about anything.

1570
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:43.830
You're always,
you know,
you,
you,
you maintain a certain pace.

1571
01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.580
Some people would really just can't do that.
You know?

1572
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:51.580
<v 5>Also,
I'm not,
there's no show.
I told you,
I said it earlier in the show.</v>

1573
01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:54.550
I've been faking it for years,
man.
I'm just trying to figure,
I'm making music.

1574
01:26:54.551 --> 01:26:57.130
I don't even know how to make music.
I don't even know.
You know,
this is,

1575
01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:00.340
all of this is luck and icing and as much as I feel like,
Yo,

1576
01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:03.220
I'm listening to this what I'm meant to do,
you know,
I feel like it to a degree,

1577
01:27:03.221 --> 01:27:06.860
it's what it's meant to do.
It's a lot of luck.
Do you guys do,
you know,

1578
01:27:06.861 --> 01:27:11.861
is that you feel personally or as smart as you and as talented as you that for

1579
01:27:12.071 --> 01:27:14.440
one reason or another without being like,

1580
01:27:14.441 --> 01:27:17.920
they didn't get convicted of rape or nothing stupid like that,
but just it just,

1581
01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:20.950
something doesn't click.
Like something doesn't happen for them.

1582
01:27:20.951 --> 01:27:24.790
And it's like I got a bunch of musician friends of mine that are geniuses that

1583
01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:28.030
I'm just like,
why?
Why?
What is it about them?
Why,
why,

1584
01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.610
what that element is,
whatever.

1585
01:27:30.611 --> 01:27:33.670
That planets lining up that just you're at the right place,

1586
01:27:33.671 --> 01:27:36.910
right time and you know how to react.
You know what I mean?
I agree to we all.

1587
01:27:36.911 --> 01:27:38.860
We all are responsible for our fates.

1588
01:27:38.861 --> 01:27:41.050
I believe I made a choice somewhere along the line.

1589
01:27:41.051 --> 01:27:45.220
It contributed to what I'm doing.
It's not just blind luck,
but there's,
there's,

1590
01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:48.400
that's an element in the,
in the thing you could have all the other things,

1591
01:27:48.401 --> 01:27:52.810
the talent,
the drive,
the w,
the work ethic,

1592
01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:53.880
and if that one.
