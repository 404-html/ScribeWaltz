169
00:04:45.621 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>What we produce is so much more entertaining I think,</v>

170
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:54.410
<v Speaker 1>and like our friends like Ari shift fear and Thompson what they produced.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>So Okay Duncan even,</v>

176
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 1>but all the things that we produce are so much more entertaining then fucking I</v>

177
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>just taught us to us.</v>

178
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.873
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

179
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't very specific.</v>

180
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to me what's going on with some of these radio shows is</v>

181
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>because it's just the same shit every fucking day and they're just,</v>

182
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like a soap opera of people screaming.</v>

183
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's get through this commercial.</v>

184
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a good thing to talk about because it's been very,</v>

185
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>and know exactly what you're saying,</v>

186
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

187
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Go to on.com and check out some shit.</v>

188
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.931
<v Speaker 1>What is a,</v>

189
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>what are Alpha brain?</v>

190
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 1>What does Alpha brands in nootropic and when nootropics,</v>

191
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>ours is a very controversial field of vitamins and nutrients,</v>

192
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 1>being able to enhance brain function.</v>

193
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>There is some evidence,</v>

194
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:48.481
<v Speaker 1>there's a a very detailed website on on a.com where it goes over all of the</v>

195
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>different scientific aspects of each individual ingredient.</v>

196
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like I said,</v>

197
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

198
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>it is a controversial thing.</v>

199
00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>It's gets a lot of people up</v>

200
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.551
<v Speaker 3>in arms,</v>

201
00:05:58.551 --> 00:05:58.980
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

202
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 3>I firmly believe in nutrition and I firmly believe in supplementing nutrition</v>

203
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 3>and I know it's aided me and I know Alpha brain most certainly aids me.</v>

204
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:07.491
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

205
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:07.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

206
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely enjoy the effects.</v>

207
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not a placebo by any stretch of the imagination and to make sure that</v>

208
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 3>people don't think it is the way we have it set up as if you,</v>

209
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 3>you order 30 pills,</v>

210
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 3>you get a hundred percent money back guarantee,</v>

211
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 3>you don't even have to return the product.</v>

212
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:21.381
<v Speaker 3>You just say,</v>

213
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:21.980

<v Speaker 3>Give me my money back,</v>

215
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 3>it's over.</v>

216
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 3>And we just don't want anybody to feel ripped off.</v>

217
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 3>So that's how we have it set up.</v>

218
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.090

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

228
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 3>the kind of stuff that you see like MMA fighters use is trying to conditioning</v>

229
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 3>videos w body weight,</v>

230
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.330
<v Speaker 3>like full body exercise movements like clean and press and,</v>

231
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 3>and Hindu squats and chin ups and things where you move your body around plus</v>

232
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>

233

<v Speaker 3>you these Turkish getups.</v>

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 3>These things are amazing for your core strength.</v>

236
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.090
<v Speaker 3>It's just wood.</v>

237
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Kettlebells are is basically,</v>

238
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like a cannon ball with a handle on it and one of the coolest exercises as</v>

239
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 3>you just lying down on your back and standing up with that thing and then</v>

240
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 3>bringing your brown down to your back and then standing up with it again.</v>

241
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 3>It is fucking hard.</v>

242
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Try doing that shit with a 70 pound kettle bells fuck man.</v>

243
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.310
<v Speaker 3>To balance that bitch out,</v>

244
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 3>straighten your arm out and you engage muscles in a way that you almost never do</v>

245
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 3>by traditional weightlifting.</v>

246
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 3>It's really a weird type of working out and I enjoy it and it's my favorite</v>

247
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning exercises as far as like applicable strength for</v>

248
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and um,</v>

249
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 3>for uh,</v>

250
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.040
<v Speaker 3>I think for anything athletic,</v>

251
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 3>anything we'd have to move things around.</v>

252
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 3>When you have a body that's used to moving it around itself around plus weight</v>

253
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 3>in really awkward ways,</v>

254
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:53.510
<v Speaker 3>you develop a very strong body and there's a lot of videos online.</v>

255
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.040
<v Speaker 3>We have summit on at.com we're going to produce some videos and uh,</v>

256
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 3>take you guys through a really good strength and conditioning work on.</v>

257
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be a great thing for us to do too.</v>

258
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Just so you can get a sense of like what kind of benefits you can get from,</v>

259
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 3>especially if you see some of these like really fit dudes that are,</v>

260
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:10.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

261
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 3>like these like Steve Maxwell type dudes that have been doing it their whole</v>

262
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:14.481
<v Speaker 3>lives that are in there.</v>

263
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

264
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Maxwell,</v>

265
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like close to 60 and he looks fucking phenomenal and he's a big</v>

266
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 3>advocate of a,</v>

267
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 3>of kettle bells and battle ropes with these.</v>

268
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Ours might have seen him.</v>

269
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Brock Lesnar use them and one of the countdown shows that these giant ropes and</v>

270
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 3>electric you would like tie a ship down with like 40 feet long and they have</v>

271
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:34.334
<v Speaker 3>these uh,</v>

272
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 3>kept ends and you grab a hold of him and you whip these motherfuckers through</v>

273
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:43.391
<v Speaker 3>the air and you can do these different sequences of movements like in sprint you</v>

274
00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 3>doing for like sprints of 30 seconds and then you relax for 20 seconds and then</v>

275
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 3>sprint for 30 seconds and holy fuck is it brutal?</v>

276
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is some old school caveman type shit,</v>

277
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 3>throwing ropes around man.</v>

278
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 3>And when you throw ropes around,</v>

279
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.321
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

280
00:08:58.321 --> 00:08:58.711
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

281
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 3>it's a real wild thing,</v>

282
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:00.661
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

283
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like all your,</v>

284
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 3>everything's working kind of together,</v>

285
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.591
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

286
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 3>it's all like one big unit.</v>

287
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:07.651
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

288
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:07.921
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

289
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:11.610

<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be honest with you.</v>

317

00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:00.900
<v Speaker 3>it's expensive to make.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but it's the shit.</v>

322
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:04.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

323
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 3>it's because the hemp,</v>

324
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 3>the hemp farms is only like three farms in Canada then it's be because our</v>

325
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 3>country is fucking retarded when it comes to certain plants.</v>

326
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 3>Hamp is illegal.</v>

327
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Even though hemp is not psychoactive,</v>

328
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:19.680
<v Speaker 3>you can't get high from it.</v>

329
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Hemp is illegal.</v>

330
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:20.991
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

331
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 3>hemp is a tremendous source of protein.</v>

332
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 3>And even though we're allowed to buy him products in this country,</v>

333
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 3>like hemp protein,</v>

334
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>which we import from Canada,</v>

335
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 3>even though you're allowed to buy it,</v>

336
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 3>you can't grow it here.</v>

337
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.721
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

338
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:36.090
<v Speaker 3>it's really stupid.</v>

339
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 3>It's the farms have limited production.</v>

340
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.430
<v Speaker 3>They can't keep up with the demand.</v>

341
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 3>We and we can't do anything about it.</v>

342
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:43.301
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

343
00:10:43.301 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 3>it would just pay some American farmers to start growing hemp here and put</v>

344
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

345
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.780

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.851
<v Speaker 4>I love that stuff.</v>

436
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:13.684
<v Speaker 4>I love guns.</v>

437
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff.</v>

438
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Does it feel weird to you go in there right after the tragedy.</v>

439
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 4>I haven't gone to see the movie yet because I don't want to sit down.</v>

440
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 4>I want to sit there and go,</v>

441
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 4>this is what these pull last people seen as what?</v>

442
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:26.284
<v Speaker 4>They got scared.</v>

443
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.293
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even think of that,</v>

444
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.211
<v Speaker 4>that angle of it.</v>

445
00:13:29.211 --> 00:13:30.520
<v Speaker 4>I never thought about it like that,</v>

446
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:31.440
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>

447
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.670
<v Speaker 4>the tragedy,</v>

448
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.431
<v Speaker 4>it was a bad thing.</v>

449
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:34.740
<v Speaker 4>It was four weeks.</v>

450
00:13:34.741 --> 00:13:39.741
<v Speaker 4>So can you imagine something like that hitting close to home when you start</v>

451
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 4>seeing people that are trying to do a copycat crimes now,</v>

452
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.100
<v Speaker 4>didn't you say that someone got arrested in Ohio,</v>

453
00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:48.791
<v Speaker 4>in Ohio,</v>

454
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:50.200
<v Speaker 4>somebody came up with like a knife,</v>

455
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 4>a gun,</v>

456
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.633
<v Speaker 4>ammo,</v>

457
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.653
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

458
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:53.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

459
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.473
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

460
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 4>this is where the real cynical people,</v>

461
00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.540
<v Speaker 4>the really cynical,</v>

462
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 4>crazy conspiracy people,</v>

463
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 4>these are the ones,</v>

464
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.580
<v Speaker 4>this is where they start thinking that the government is doing this and that</v>

465
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 4>they're doing this on purpose because they want to disarm Americans because they</v>

466
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:10.180
<v Speaker 4>know that everything's going to fall apart and they don't want people to have</v>

467
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:11.014
<v Speaker 4>guns.</v>

468
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:11.741
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

469
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 4>that's sounds completely ridiculous,</v>

470
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.670
<v Speaker 4>but if you were going to write a movie about how some super corrupt</v>

471
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.890
<v Speaker 4>multinational corporations figure out a way to control the whole world,</v>

472
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 4>it would probably write it like that.</v>

473
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:25.961
<v Speaker 4>You'd probably,</v>

474
00:14:25.961 --> 00:14:28.240
<v Speaker 4>you'd probably have everything wired and hooked up like that.</v>

475
00:14:28.241 --> 00:14:28.410
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

476
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.270
<v Speaker 4>If you throw the Jab,</v>

477
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Alex Jones,</v>

478
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 4>I am his witness and Houston at the UFC.</v>

479
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.080
<v Speaker 4>He told me to my face,</v>

480
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:35.950
<v Speaker 4>I did two years,</v>

481
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 4>there was only be TSA security at Parks and movie theaters and I was right there</v>

482
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:41.884
<v Speaker 4>when he told me that.</v>

483
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 4>He told me that to my face was sitting outside of the UFC and we're just talking</v>

484
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:46.751
<v Speaker 4>about different things.</v>

485
00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:47.584
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

486
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.271
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

487
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 4>Is it because,</v>

488
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 4>is it just a natural thing</v>

489
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

490
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:56.200
<v Speaker 3>because there's a lot of crime because there's a lot of disparate.</v>

491
00:14:56.201 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 3>The economy's in the toilet,</v>

492
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

493
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.640
<v Speaker 3>it's a natural thing that things pop off and crazy people do shit like this.</v>

494
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Or do you want to follow the conspiracy theory point where they think that</v>

495
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:10.400
<v Speaker 3>they're doing this on purpose because they've engineered the collapse of the</v>

496
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 3>dollar.</v>

497
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.270
<v Speaker 3>They know that the world economy is going to implode and they don't want people</v>

498
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:15.104
<v Speaker 3>to be armed.</v>

499
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 3>They want to be able to maintain power.</v>

500
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't looking at it like that.</v>

501
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very cynical person.</v>

502
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.440
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at it as a business angle.</v>

503
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.873
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

504
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.460
<v Speaker 3>fucking shoot somebody to move movie theater.</v>

505
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 3>They got to put security of 2 million thousand movie theaters across the</v>

506
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:28.634
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

507
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 3>The next is parks,</v>

508
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:30.050
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

509
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.670
<v Speaker 3>But that I come to my senses,</v>

510
00:15:31.671 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 3>I wake up and I put the joint down and then I go to bad things happen every</v>

511
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:36.120
<v Speaker 3>fucking day.</v>

512
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

513
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.221
<v Speaker 3>that's here.</v>

514
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:38.054
<v Speaker 3>They happen,</v>

515
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 3>they happen somewhere.</v>

516
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 3>That is though,</v>

517
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 3>if you were a government and you are evil and you were trying to control the</v>

518
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

519
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 3>that is what you do.</v>

520
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:45.881
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

521
00:15:45.881 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 3>you organize attacks.</v>

522
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 3>And it's been pointed out before that the American public has tried to do this</v>

523
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.310
<v Speaker 3>or the mare,</v>

524
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.731
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

525
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 3>the American,</v>

526
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 3>the government has tried to do this.</v>

527
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 3>They at one point in time to the,</v>

528
00:15:56.871 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

529
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 3>operation Northwoods was written,</v>

530
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:00.700
<v Speaker 3>where was an idea that they were gonna do,</v>

531
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.550
<v Speaker 3>were gonna fake attacks on American civilians to get us to go to war with Cuba.</v>

532
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.230
<v Speaker 3>They're going to blow up a jet liner and say there was people in it there we're</v>

533
00:16:08.231 --> 00:16:10.740
<v Speaker 3>going to arm Cuban friendlies to tack wan taught them,</v>

534
00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:10.971
<v Speaker 3>obey.</v>

535
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:11.530
<v Speaker 3>It was going to be,</v>

536
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

537
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.040
<v Speaker 3>that's like a real thing that they were going to do to try to get us into a war</v>

538
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:16.874
<v Speaker 3>with Cuba.</v>

539
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.750
<v Speaker 3>So when you find out about conspiracies like crazy things like that where you're</v>

540
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:20.931
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

541
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:21.351
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

542
00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 3>like they would fake shit.</v>

543
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Like they're allowed to think like that when that came out.</v>

544
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.970
<v Speaker 3>That should have been a huge piece of news.</v>

545
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.830
<v Speaker 3>That should have been something where you know,</v>

546
00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 3>everyone demanded that should be hearings on this.</v>

547
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 3>It should be like brought out in front of the public.</v>

548
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 3>People should be in the streets like screaming about this.</v>

549
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Like how is this possible?</v>

550
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:42.500
<v Speaker 3>How would they now prosecuted?</v>

551
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 3>They were really going to risk American lives and have Americans killed just to</v>

552
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:47.600
<v Speaker 3>further their agenda.</v>

553
00:16:47.601 --> 00:16:51.230
<v Speaker 3>They were going to fake an act of war in order to get us into war because they</v>

554
00:16:51.231 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 3>thought they knew better than us.</v>

555
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:55.670
<v Speaker 3>So it was this just one dumb fuck that just like,</v>

556
00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 3>hey this is my idea.</v>

557
00:16:56.721 --> 00:16:57.111
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

558
00:16:57.111 --> 00:16:57.381
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

559
00:16:57.381 --> 00:16:57.740
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

560
00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

561
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.220
<v Speaker 3>What was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the joints chiefs of stats on,</v>

562
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 3>did they have a math problem at the time and they got like new ones like the</v>

563
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:07.440
<v Speaker 3>next day.</v>

564
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I think they used to rocket like that all the time.</v>

565
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 3>That's why when you know you,</v>

566
00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:14.150
<v Speaker 3>these conspiracy nuts come out and they say,</v>

567
00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:14.361
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

568
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:19.150
<v Speaker 3>we believe that this guy was brainwashed and someone got ahold of him and they</v>

569
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 3>did an experiment with him and he's like a Manchurian candidate.</v>

570
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.170
<v Speaker 3>It sounds fucking completely ridiculous.</v>

571
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 3>It sounds completely ridiculous.</v>

572
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 3>But if,</v>

573
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:27.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

574
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.480
<v Speaker 3>if they were willing to do that other stuff,</v>

575
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.600
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't they be willing to do that if they really could do that?</v>

576
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.320
<v Speaker 3>You imagine if they figured out a way to reprogram people,</v>

577
00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:37.640
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't science fiction,</v>

578
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.230
<v Speaker 3>you don't think they would do it.</v>

579
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Of course they would do it.</v>

580
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 3>If the government really did find some super sophisticated way where they could</v>

581
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:48.790
<v Speaker 3>just say pumpkin to you and you fucking snap and,</v>

582
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 3>and why yourself up</v>

583
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.760
<v Speaker 5>with grenades and run into a room full of important people and blow yourself up,</v>

584
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 5>you don't think they would do that?</v>

585
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 5>Of course they would.</v>

586
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 5>That's a great way to do it.</v>

587
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 5>You get some idiot is willing to do that for you and have him walk in and pull</v>

588
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:01.441
<v Speaker 5>the trigger.</v>

589
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:01.951
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

590
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I haven't really focused on the Colorado thing as much cause he's just fucking</v>

591
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 5>negative and anything like that until my mind,</v>

592
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.870
<v Speaker 5>my mind is just tragic,</v>

593
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:10.620
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

594
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.060
<v Speaker 5>I want to know what the fuck happened.</v>

595
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 5>I want to know where the system went wrong.</v>

596
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 5>Now you've heard I'd been here before and I told you about Colorado.</v>

597
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:19.200
<v Speaker 5>We both discuss Colorado,</v>

598
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 5>but I've lived in New York,</v>

599
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:21.231
<v Speaker 5>California,</v>

600
00:18:21.231 --> 00:18:24.150
<v Speaker 5>and I hang out with gangsters and the craziest motherfuckers.</v>

601
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:25.540
<v Speaker 5>I know when the amounts.</v>

602
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:26.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

603
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay now let's just leave that.</v>

604
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 5>You know I've been reading bits and pieces like he was going to a</v>

605
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 5>psychotherapist or psychiatrist.</v>

606
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.353
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

607
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.280
<v Speaker 5>Now she alarmed somebody.</v>

608
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 5>She warned somebody.</v>

609
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:37.850
<v Speaker 5>Just psycho therapists.</v>

610
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 5>This is what I heard.</v>

611
00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 5>Is this true or is this not true?</v>

612
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 5>Who did she want?</v>

613
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 5>Who does she want him?</v>

614
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Why weren't these people?</v>

615
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:46.150
<v Speaker 5>Why was this fucking lunatic contact?</v>

616
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.880
<v Speaker 5>Then the other side of me says,</v>

617
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.590
<v Speaker 5>I understand we can't react to every fucking call the police because a guy up</v>

618
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:53.730
<v Speaker 5>here waving a gun,</v>

619
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 5>is he hurt anybody?</v>

620
00:18:55.081 --> 00:18:55.261
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

621
00:18:55.261 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 5>we cannot respond to every call because of the budgets and whatever.</v>

622
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 5>So who dropped this?</v>

623
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:06.420
<v Speaker 5>This is a kid that bought thousands of rounds of ammunition at a local fucking</v>

624
00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:06.721
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 5>The guns all legit.</v>

626
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 5>Like I told you in Colorado,</v>

627
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.320
<v Speaker 5>but you can buy a fucking bazooka.</v>

628
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.361

629
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:11.790

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.310
<v Speaker 5>This is what fucks with me.</v>

647
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:34.370
<v Speaker 5>How the system fail that this big got fucking helmets</v>

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 5>It fails somewhere and where did he get the money?</v>

650
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.970
<v Speaker 5>They said that the speculation was that he used as a scholarship money.</v>

651
00:19:43.971 --> 00:19:44.491
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

652
00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:44.731

00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:47.730
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know you could just use your scholarship money for other shit and you</v>

654
00:19:47.731 --> 00:19:48.760

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.233
<v Speaker 5>He withdrew.</v>

657
00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.510
<v Speaker 5>Well when you get a scholarship,</v>

658
00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:53.040
<v Speaker 5>but you're like responsible for that money,</v>

659
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.530
<v Speaker 5>like say if you've got $20,000 for a scholarship,</v>

660
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.791

700
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 2>What you do is you sign up rating and credits and you get money for 18 credits</v>

701
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:21.310
<v Speaker 2>but right before the school season starts you cut it down to nine and you pocket</v>

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.910
<v Speaker 2>bad for what happened in Colorado.</v>

745
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.030
<v Speaker 4>you could figure out the plans to build a nuclear bomb online.</v>

853
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:50.810

864
00:26:07.551 --> 00:26:10.600
<v Speaker 5>I come back as Joe Lowe's serious.</v>

865
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.200
<v Speaker 5>I love that Jujitsu Shit like that.</v>

866
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.100
<v Speaker 5>He's a fuck.</v>

867
00:26:13.101 --> 00:26:13.401
<v Speaker 5>I love.</v>

868
00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:15.800
<v Speaker 5>Everything he did was awesome and Jamie Varner was awesome.</v>

869
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

870
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.290
<v Speaker 5>That guy's making a huge comeback.</v>

871
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.720
<v Speaker 5>He just didn't have enough time to get into condition for this fight.</v>

872
00:26:20.721 --> 00:26:22.170
<v Speaker 5>I think eight weeks,</v>

873
00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.790
<v Speaker 5>four weeks.</v>

874
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.060
<v Speaker 5>I think he took it on short notice.</v>

875
00:26:24.061 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

876
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:25.280
<v Speaker 5>it's a tough fight.</v>

877
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 5>Joe Lozan is uh,</v>

878
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.320
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the best.</v>

879
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 5>He's a dangerous kid.</v>

880
00:26:29.181 --> 00:26:30.170
<v Speaker 5>He's got a lot of tools.</v>

881
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.150
<v Speaker 5>One thing I love about Joe Lowe's on is when they match them up just by Uli,</v>

882
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.680
<v Speaker 5>like if they match up against somebody who's a great striker,</v>

883
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.400
<v Speaker 5>does striker,</v>

884
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 5>I know Joe loads and that hasn't been a chance of winning.</v>

885
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 5>This is the craziest drilling because if you hit you,</v>

886
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 5>gets on his</v>

887
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.341
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

888
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 3>he attack you from his back.</v>

889
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 3>He don't give a fuck.</v>

890
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:47.910
<v Speaker 3>He said he fucked up a couple of people.</v>

891
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Let me get a,</v>

892
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.590
<v Speaker 3>and Gallard too.</v>

893
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:49.981
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

894
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 3>He got up and go.</v>

895
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.031
<v Speaker 3>I can do that.</v>

896
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:51.841
<v Speaker 3>Jumping and screaming.</v>

897
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:52.621
<v Speaker 3>He fucking did keep,</v>

898
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Melvin keeps talking like saying that Joe Lowe's on got lucky.</v>

899
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:57.270
<v Speaker 3>But let me tell you something.</v>

900
00:26:57.271 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 3>When someone wants to punch you in the face and they do punch you in the face,</v>

901
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 3>that's not luck.</v>

902
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.761
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

903
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:04.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what he wanted to do and that's what he did.</v>

904
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 3>It ain't no lucky punches.</v>

905
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Did you just say it's a lucky punch is one of the craziest things people could</v>

906
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 3>ever say when you rush in like that like he did with his face exposed with a</v>

907
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 3>good fighter,</v>

908
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:18.030
<v Speaker 3>a guy is going to snap off a jam on you.</v>

909
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 3>I think you probably underestimated Lozan striking,</v>

910
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:21.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

911
00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 3>his striking Melvin's striking so good and so fast.</v>

912
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:25.830
<v Speaker 3>He's so fast,</v>

913
00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:26.131
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

914
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 3>When you watch him put combinations together and go,</v>

915
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 3>God damn it's technique just clean.</v>

916
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 3>He's got a lot of power in his hands and I think he just got a little</v>

917
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:38.871
<v Speaker 3>overconfident in Lozan is not to be fucked with like 44 fights or something.</v>

918
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:39.923
<v Speaker 3>Those on is obese.</v>

919
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:40.231
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

920
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:41.250
<v Speaker 3>that was an awesome fight.</v>

921
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:42.000
<v Speaker 3>He's smart.</v>

922
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.790
<v Speaker 3>That's the most dangerous thing about Joe Lowe's on is he's smart.</v>

923
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:45.780
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

924
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.910
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm looking for Anthony.</v>

925
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Pettis just knocked Joe Lowe's on the out in the first round,</v>

926
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 3>their fight,</v>

927
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:50.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

928
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:51.750
<v Speaker 3>and he hasn't fought since then.</v>

929
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward to seeing him fight again.</v>

930
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.900
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got an injured though.</v>

931
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.183
<v Speaker 3>Pedes.</v>

932
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

933
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.210
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

934
00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.460
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to set something up with him at cowboy Cerrone of Serone gets by</v>

935
00:28:00.461 --> 00:28:01.294
<v Speaker 3>Gallard.</v>

936
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Even if he doesn't your bike go out and still be a great fine,</v>

937
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 3>and my man got her caught check us out or it gets Ellenberger he's got a disc</v>

938

939
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:09.740

972
00:28:53.491 --> 00:28:54.930
<v Speaker 3>tagged him two more times for the ref.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Got to him like a fucking karate kid.</v>

974
00:28:56.791 --> 00:28:58.080
<v Speaker 3>And Beta was a great fight.</v>

975
00:28:58.081 --> 00:28:58.914
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

976
00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Liotta Machida is scary guy.</v>

977
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.280
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you gotta get,</v>

978
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 3>you gotta get ahold of that guy and it's,</v>

979
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.820
<v Speaker 3>that's no picnic either.</v>

980
00:29:05.821 --> 00:29:08.100
<v Speaker 3>He just got great wrestling and great use of his body.</v>

981
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.990
<v Speaker 3>He did a lot of sumo when he was a kid,</v>

982
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.070
<v Speaker 3>which sounds silly,</v>

983
00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:11.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

984
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.660
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

985
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

986
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.081
<v Speaker 3>they really,</v>

987
00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:16.320
<v Speaker 3>they're really good at like throwing people off in certain directions and</v>

988
00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 3>pushing forward and,</v>

989
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:18.780
<v Speaker 3>and planting yourself.</v>

990
00:29:18.781 --> 00:29:19.230
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

991
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

992
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:19.770
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

993
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:24.720
<v Speaker 3>he's got amazing tricks that he does inside with like little leg trips and shit</v>

994
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:25.554
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

995
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.030
<v Speaker 3>It'd be interesting to see,</v>

996
00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:27.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

997
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:27.870
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

998
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:28.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

999
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:29.730
<v Speaker 3>versus look if he,</v>

1000
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:35.120
<v Speaker 3>if Henderson somehow or another beats Jon Jones seeing him the Oda Machida</v>

1001
00:29:35.251 --> 00:29:36.150
<v Speaker 3>versus Henderson,</v>

1002
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.580
<v Speaker 3>I would really like to see that fight.</v>

1003
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.050
<v Speaker 3>That would be crazy.</v>

1004
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 3>I would love to that fight because they're both kind of on the small side for</v>

1005
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:44.764
<v Speaker 3>light heavyweight,</v>

1006
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.400
<v Speaker 3>the Oda way to oh one Henderson's usually somewhere around there.</v>

1007
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 3>Even when he fights it,</v>

1008
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:49.781
<v Speaker 3>two oh five,</v>

1009
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:51.820
<v Speaker 3>he usually weighs around 200 ish.</v>

1010
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1011
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.670
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be an incredible fight.</v>

1012
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Henderson Jones is going to be a crazy fight to man if Henderson wins.</v>

1013
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.020
<v Speaker 3>He's like the greatest mixed martial arts fighter of all time.</v>

1014
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:02.950
<v Speaker 3>If you really look at it,</v>

1015
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.990
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it like as far as accomplishments,</v>

1016
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.040
<v Speaker 3>they've got wins.</v>

1017
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Two different titles in pride in two different weight classes at,</v>

1018
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 3>and then he holds them at the same time.</v>

1019
00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 3>It comes over to strike force.</v>

1020
00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.810
<v Speaker 3>When's the title and strike for us?</v>

1021
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.360
<v Speaker 3>He has,</v>

1022
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.120
<v Speaker 3>he's a knockout over heavyweights.</v>

1023
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Like fate or million.</v>

1024
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.700
<v Speaker 3>ENCO got knocked out fatal.</v>

1025
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:22.883
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1026
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Dan Henderson is a mother fucker dude.</v>

1027
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.560
<v Speaker 3>That guy is a motherfucker.</v>

1028
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:27.670
<v Speaker 3>You can never sleep on that.</v>

1029
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if he figures out Jon Jones,</v>

1030
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.440
<v Speaker 3>if he fit the fingers on anybody.</v>

1031
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:31.751
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1032
00:30:31.751 --> 00:30:32.584
<v Speaker 3>he's got that.</v>

1033
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 3>He's got that one weapon that's so retarded.</v>

1034
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Strong.</v>

1035
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:41.170
<v Speaker 3>His right hand is so powerful and he has this crazy confidence in it and he can</v>

1036
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:41.920
<v Speaker 3>takes it.</v>

1037
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.600
<v Speaker 3>He takes an amazing shot.</v>

1038
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.740
<v Speaker 3>He's so tough.</v>

1039
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:49.150
<v Speaker 3>So he'll wade through some shit to get to you and clip you with that thing and</v>

1040
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:51.070
<v Speaker 3>just put the lights out.</v>

1041
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1042
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:52.930
<v Speaker 3>He's dangerous man.</v>

1043
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.270
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking dangerous.</v>

1044
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 3>And I think he's more dangerous at two oh five and he hasn't won 85.</v>

1045
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 3>I think especially as you get older,</v>

1046
00:31:00.101 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for a guy like that to cuddle that weight.</v>

1047
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:02.921
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1048
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 3>I think when he doesn't cut weight and he's one of the rare guys that can do it.</v>

1049
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.170
<v Speaker 3>If fights effectively at two oh five.</v>

1050
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 3>And I think when he doesn't cut that way,</v>

1051
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:10.991
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe,</v>

1052
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:11.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1053
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.400
<v Speaker 3>maybe he feels a little bit healthier at a so many a years of doing that shit.</v>

1054
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:15.641
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1055
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Speaker 3>That's like one of the worst aspects of fighting.</v>

1056
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:18.334
<v Speaker 3>It's the weight cutting.</v>

1057
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Sad drives me nuts because it's,</v>

1058
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 3>the sport is always supposed to be about being healthy.</v>

1059
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:26.410
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be about,</v>

1060
00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:26.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1061
00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:31.651
<v Speaker 3>like you know your body being tuned in in the best possible way for combat,</v>

1062
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's really not because of the 24 hours before you fight,</v>

1063
00:31:35.541 --> 00:31:37.990
<v Speaker 3>you fuck it up hard core,</v>

1064
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.980
<v Speaker 3>you suck all the water out of it so you could flight in a lower weight class.</v>

1065
00:31:41.981 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 3>It's this weird fucking silly thing that's still around.</v>

1066
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:47.591
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't,</v>

1067
00:31:47.591 --> 00:31:48.940
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't be a factor.</v>

1068
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:49.780
<v Speaker 3>It should be.</v>

1069
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:50.651
<v Speaker 3>It really,</v>

1070
00:31:50.651 --> 00:31:51.484
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

1071
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.860
<v Speaker 3>it is a part of the sport is probably no getting rid of it at this point without</v>

1072
00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:59.770
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a radical restructuring of the way people look at martial arts.</v>

1073
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.320
<v Speaker 3>But I think that it's almost like it's,</v>

1074
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.210
<v Speaker 3>it's not in the proper spirit of martial arts and competition.</v>

1075
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.343
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

1076
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:13.210
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you have to do it today if you're a professional because everyone's</v>

1077
00:32:13.211 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 3>doing it and if you want to fight against guys your size,</v>

1078
00:32:15.671 --> 00:32:16.810
<v Speaker 3>there's only one way to do that.</v>

1079
00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:18.070
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to fight against.</v>

1080
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:18.671
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1081
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:20.050
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to fight against the scales.</v>

1082
00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:20.351
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1083
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:23.110
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to cut weight and you're going to have to go in because</v>

1084
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:24.010
<v Speaker 3>everybody else is doing it.</v>

1085
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.150
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you're not going to win.</v>

1086
00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to beat 190 pound guy if you really wait one 70 if he's just as</v>

1087
00:32:29.201 --> 00:32:30.034
<v Speaker 3>skilled as you,</v>

1088
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1089
00:32:30.551 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 3>that extra 20 pounds,</v>

1090
00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:35.860
<v Speaker 3>even though it fucked his organs up and might have almost shut it's kidney down</v>

1091
00:32:35.861 --> 00:32:38.470
<v Speaker 3>and he had to get reinflated with Ivs.</v>

1092
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 3>He's probably still gonna beat you</v>

1093
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.350
<v Speaker 4>because he's a bigger guy and he's got more mass,</v>

1094
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 4>especially if you can get you to the ground and have more space,</v>

1095
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.160
<v Speaker 4>more strength of,</v>

1096
00:32:46.161 --> 00:32:46.521
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

1097
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 4>more to push around.</v>

1098
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 4>And when they refuel themselves with ivy and he's like,</v>

1099
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 4>they can do it pretty well with Ivs,</v>

1100
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Speaker 4>we're in 24 hours,</v>

1101
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1102
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 4>it's worth it for them,</v>

1103
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 4>but it's still bad for your body.</v>

1104
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.840
<v Speaker 4>And it's unfortunate and I think I,</v>

1105
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 4>I hate the idea that those people have to do that,</v>

1106
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.013
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1107
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.303
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>

1108
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do?</v>

1109
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.500
<v Speaker 4>It's part of the fucking game.</v>

1110
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:07.250
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1111
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.551
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:09.590
<v Speaker 4>We've got to go to a Starbucks and write jokes.</v>

1113
00:33:09.591 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 4>They got to lose fucking white.</v>

1114
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.181
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1115
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 4>but wouldn't it be better if they all just fought their way class,</v>

1116
00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1117
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:18.870
<v Speaker 4>which I think a perfect utopia of mixed martial arts would be everybody fights</v>

1118
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:22.250
<v Speaker 4>in one of the fuck their way and we find out what everybody waves.</v>

1119
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.130
<v Speaker 4>We just naturally you get this is what you weigh when you're in shape.</v>

1120
00:33:25.131 --> 00:33:25.431
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

1121
00:33:25.431 --> 00:33:26.360
<v Speaker 4>what do you weigh when you're like,</v>

1122
00:33:26.361 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1123
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 4>like when dog fighting shape,</v>

1124
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 4>when they used to fight dogs,</v>

1125
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.650
<v Speaker 4>you know that he used to weigh him in.</v>

1126
00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that shit now?</v>

1127
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:32.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1128
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.330
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1129
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 4>the really light ones.</v>

1130
00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:35.300
<v Speaker 4>Just the ones they want.</v>

1131
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.480
<v Speaker 4>You don't like see these big giant pit bulls that everybody has today.</v>

1132
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.230
<v Speaker 4>These people have bred these things to make them really big and crazy.</v>

1133
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.620
<v Speaker 4>But I had a friend who had like one of the really small game once.</v>

1134
00:33:45.621 --> 00:33:46.361
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy,</v>

1135
00:33:46.361 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 4>a little animal man.</v>

1136
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.110
<v Speaker 4>It was a really smart,</v>

1137
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.390
<v Speaker 4>they don't even have to look like if they're really small.</v>

1138
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.680
<v Speaker 4>It was like 35 pounds.</v>

1139
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:55.310
<v Speaker 4>Are you serious?</v>

1140
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.550
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1141
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.111
<v Speaker 4>barely have.</v>

1142
00:33:56.111 --> 00:33:57.770
<v Speaker 4>Basically you can get a 20 pounds,</v>

1143
00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.670
<v Speaker 4>25 pound pit bull.</v>

1144
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.070
<v Speaker 4>There's a really small ones,</v>

1145
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.971
<v Speaker 4>but those little,</v>

1146
00:34:01.971 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 4>little tiny ones are crazy.</v>

1147
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.420
<v Speaker 4>They don't look like pit bulls.</v>

1148
00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:06.110
<v Speaker 4>Like where would,</v>

1149
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.780
<v Speaker 4>we're used to seeing them with like the really boxy,</v>

1150
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.590
<v Speaker 4>muscular heads and huge shoulders.</v>

1151
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Like those are the pitfalls you see on the streets.</v>

1152
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.810
<v Speaker 4>The amazing looking dogs,</v>

1153
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:17.720
<v Speaker 4>the ones that you use an angel heart to bite Mickey Rourke,</v>

1154
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:21.580
<v Speaker 4>the two little fucking pit bulls and New Orleans watch that movie with a little</v>

1155
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.381
<v Speaker 4>real little ones.</v>

1156
00:34:22.381 --> 00:34:23.191
<v Speaker 4>We'll look at them and go,</v>

1157
00:34:23.191 --> 00:34:23.451
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1158
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:23.961
<v Speaker 4>that's weird.</v>

1159
00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 4>It was 87 so nobody really knew about the fucking pit bull who was still stuck</v>

1160
00:34:27.441 --> 00:34:30.950
<v Speaker 4>on Goldman pinches retrievers some.</v>

1161
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:31.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1162
00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Speaker 4>some people know about and they made that movie when they sent the mob guy to</v>

1163
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:35.750
<v Speaker 4>beat him up in that movie,</v>

1164
00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:36.540
<v Speaker 4>the devil,</v>

1165
00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.210
<v Speaker 4>whether it beats him up in Angel Heart,</v>

1166
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.260
<v Speaker 4>that's what he had.</v>

1167
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.860
<v Speaker 4>These little tiny pimples that we didn't even have a big chest when they fucking</v>

1168
00:34:42.861 --> 00:34:43.694
<v Speaker 4>ran after him.</v>

1169
00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:45.380
<v Speaker 4>You could even see they ran different,</v>

1170
00:34:45.381 --> 00:34:48.950
<v Speaker 4>like it was the beginning before they started giving him juice and gun powder.</v>

1171
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:52.170
<v Speaker 4>Do you know at one point in time the pit bull was like a,</v>

1172
00:34:52.171 --> 00:34:52.730
<v Speaker 4>the the,</v>

1173
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.850
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to argue for it being the national animal.</v>

1174
00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Like instead of the ego representation of America was going to be a pit bull.</v>

1175
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.240
<v Speaker 4>Pretty lucky.</v>

1176
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1177
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:01.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:02.121
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>

1179
00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:03.370
<v Speaker 4>there was a movement for that.</v>

1180
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.530
<v Speaker 4>I got that movement like three guys and Compton.</v>

1181
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.790
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty legit.</v>

1182
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1183

00:38:02.791 --> 00:38:03.870
<v Speaker 5>were on Facebook.</v>

1288
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.531
<v Speaker 5>There was an earthquake.</v>

1289
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:05.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel that shit.</v>

1290
00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people called me a pussy because I felt that I wasn't at the Ice House</v>

1291
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:14.460
<v Speaker 5>and it was like a huge jolt and then like a sway in the whole building made like</v>

1292
00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:17.280
<v Speaker 5>this crackly noise and I'm like okay,</v>

1293
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:21.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting the fuck out of here because this building is way like building some</v>

1294
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:22.070
<v Speaker 5>check,</v>

1295
00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:22.561
<v Speaker 5>check to,</v>

1296
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:23.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1297
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:23.740
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

1298
00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.470
<v Speaker 5>if you look they have those things already in the walls or retrofits.</v>

1299
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.810
<v Speaker 5>We have 50 it's like the outside of it.</v>

1300
00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:31.800
<v Speaker 5>It's just retrofit,</v>

1301
00:38:31.801 --> 00:38:32.221
<v Speaker 5>retrofit,</v>

1302
00:38:32.221 --> 00:38:32.641
<v Speaker 5>retrofit.</v>

1303
00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:33.120
<v Speaker 5>Retrofit.</v>

1304
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.500
<v Speaker 5>So I'm thinking if I'm gonna,</v>

1305
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 5>if there's ever an earthquake here,</v>

1306
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 1>run the fuck out of this building.</v>

1307
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Might collapse.</v>

1308
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.850
<v Speaker 1>It might collapse billings</v>

1310
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:43.263
<v Speaker 1>bricks.</v>

1311
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.700
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's not that the bricks are going to fall apart,</v>

1312
00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:49.840
<v Speaker 1>but they shift or that shift because you hear that shit.</v>

1313
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1314
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 1>that is traumatizing.</v>

1315
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And so it looked at Hollywood.</v>

1316
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I live in a brick building kind of.</v>

1317
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Couple of people were calling me pussies and stuff like on Twitter.</v>

1318
00:38:58.121 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Me Like you're a pussy,</v>

1319
00:38:59.411 --> 00:38:59.771
<v Speaker 1>pussy,</v>

1320
00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:00.250
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1321
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1322
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1323
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you could be in Malibu,</v>

1324
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.160
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot farther away from where I was at,</v>

1325
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:06.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1326
00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 1>to the earthquake and be like,</v>

1327
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.291
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1328
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel anything you pussy,</v>

1329
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1330
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:10.961
<v Speaker 1>But that would,</v>

1331
00:39:10.961 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I felt last night was fucking jolting.</v>

1332
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:13.924
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

1333
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:14.680
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1334
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel,</v>

1335
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I forgot there's earth.</v>

1336
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.570
<v Speaker 1>This is earthquake stuff just underneath me.</v>

1337
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.673
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1338
00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:24.250
<v Speaker 1>It gets so hot.</v>

1340
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I am only hoping that since nobody ever predicts things correctly that because</v>

1341
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:29.770
<v Speaker 1>you're saying it's earthquake,</v>

1342
00:39:29.771 --> 00:39:30.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever that you're wrong.</v>

1343
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:31.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1344
00:39:31.331 --> 00:39:32.620
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's so hot.</v>

1345
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.371
<v Speaker 1>It's so hot.</v>

1346
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the earthquake last night happened around 10 at night or whatever</v>

1347
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.980
<v Speaker 1>because the ground gets so fucking hot and then at night it gets cold and that,</v>

1348
00:39:41.981 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 1>that con,</v>

1349
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1350
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.930
<v Speaker 1>shift shift.</v>

1351
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.413
<v Speaker 1>That's earthquake,</v>

1352
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:48.260
<v Speaker 1>earthquake,</v>

1353
00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:48.791
<v Speaker 1>seasoning.</v>

1354
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:49.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's made of.</v>

1355
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Like hot and cold.</v>

1356
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.113

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:12.650
<v Speaker 4>He listened to his show the other day on Sirius and I found out why chocolate</v>

1369
00:40:12.651 --> 00:40:13.484
<v Speaker 4>kills dogs.</v>

1370
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:14.973
<v Speaker 4>It's the caffeine.</v>

1371
00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.850
<v Speaker 4>It's a caffeine and chocolate.</v>

1372
00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.820
<v Speaker 4>Apparently chocolate has caffeine in it and the caffeine and chocolate.</v>

1373
00:40:19.821 --> 00:40:21.440
<v Speaker 4>Just Jack's dogs' bodies,</v>

1379
00:40:26.401 --> 00:40:31.070
<v Speaker 4>That's good to know because my daughter told me there's something else you can't</v>

1380
00:40:31.071 --> 00:40:32.630
<v Speaker 4>give it to you and John Rollo.</v>

1381
00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.670
<v Speaker 4>Most unlikely cat owners ever,</v>

1382
00:40:34.671 --> 00:40:37.640
<v Speaker 4>I guess meet to a lot of people get talked to John Rollo all the time about</v>

1383
00:40:37.641 --> 00:40:37.910
<v Speaker 4>cats.</v>

1384
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:38.511
<v Speaker 4>He's excited.</v>

1385
00:40:38.511 --> 00:40:39.710
<v Speaker 4>He just got something else to do.</v>

1386
00:40:39.711 --> 00:40:40.110
<v Speaker 4>It got to,</v>

1387

1388
00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:42.140
<v Speaker 4>He's got the billboards.</v>

1389
00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:42.973
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go see him.</v>

1392
00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.220
<v Speaker 4>So I'm pretty excited.</v>

1393
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:47.481
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1394
00:40:47.481 --> 00:40:49.520
<v Speaker 4>We haven't had a UFC in that area.</v>

1395
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.950
<v Speaker 4>We haven't done like a Baltimore USA.</v>

1396
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:53.540
<v Speaker 4>Baltimore's aren't doing so good.</v>

1397
00:40:53.541 --> 00:40:54.374
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1398
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1399
00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.020
<v Speaker 4>when I first got into comedy,</v>

1400
00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:00.000
<v Speaker 4>one of the clubs that gave me working for them see was a Baltimore Club.</v>

1401
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.130
<v Speaker 4>Remember the Improv down there?</v>

1402
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.840
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever do that?</v>

1403
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.420
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1404
00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.253
<v Speaker 4>They had a good Improv,</v>

1405
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.470
<v Speaker 4>their improv down in this kind of crazy area where there's like a lot of</v>

1406
00:41:06.471 --> 00:41:07.304
<v Speaker 4>different clubs.</v>

1407
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:08.301
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1408
00:41:08.301 --> 00:41:09.600
<v Speaker 4>it's like this little,</v>

1409
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.493
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1410
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.080
<v Speaker 4>little patches of,</v>

1411
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:15.830
<v Speaker 4>of fun places in this world where people figured out how to do something right.</v>

1412
00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:19.790
<v Speaker 4>But there's something cool about when you go to a place and like all these</v>

1413
00:41:19.791 --> 00:41:22.570
<v Speaker 4>different places all empty out into a common place,</v>

1414
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:23.870
<v Speaker 4>like a courtyard area.</v>

1415
00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.610
<v Speaker 4>As long as everybody can keep their shit together.</v>

1416
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.823
<v Speaker 4>Baltimore,</v>

1417
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:27.740
<v Speaker 4>that's also,</v>

1418
00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.311
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1419
00:41:28.311 --> 00:41:31.910
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it that the same place where that dude got knocked unconscious and they</v>

1420
00:41:31.911 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 4>fucking filmed it and they took his clothes</v>

1421
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.620
<v Speaker 5>off and made a video of it.</v>

1422
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that Baltimore,</v>

1423
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.653
<v Speaker 5>I think it was,</v>

1424
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:39.870
<v Speaker 5>they shot the wire there.</v>

1425
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 5>They shot the wire that,</v>

1426
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.590
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1427
00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:41.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1428
00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.710
<v Speaker 5>Boston was duly fucking duty.</v>

1480
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 5>So the other day when I saw that,</v>

1488
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.050

<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

1490
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

1491
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.750
<v Speaker 5>We're looking down in the crowd and Henzel Gracie was there laughing his ass</v>

1492
00:43:05.751 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>

1493
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 5>Asked to place.</v>

1494
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.521
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1495
00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:08.354
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1496
00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:11.720
<v Speaker 5>That was when the IFL and Enzo was something to do with the IFL.</v>

1497
00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.390
<v Speaker 5>Like a lot of us went,</v>

1498
00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:17.680
<v Speaker 5>Hari the IFL was an interesting idea.</v>

1499
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 5>Just he can't take the whole team thing.</v>

1500
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:21.930
<v Speaker 5>It's an individual sport.</v>

1501
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.230
<v Speaker 5>The whole team thing really didn't work.</v>

1502
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like stand up,</v>

1503
00:43:25.191 --> 00:43:25.821
<v Speaker 5>it's just me.</v>

1504
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:26.840
<v Speaker 5>You went to Mike Bench,</v>

1505
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:27.870
<v Speaker 5>you can't do,</v>

1506
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.000
<v Speaker 5>teams are standing up,</v>

1507
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.670
<v Speaker 5>you come in and we tag team me and you should say that.</v>

1508
00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:33.590
<v Speaker 5>But we kind of do have a team.</v>

1509
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.060
<v Speaker 5>We're the team death squad.</v>

1510
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.073
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1511
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.733
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1512
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:38.990
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1513
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:40.130
<v Speaker 5>that's it is a team.</v>

1514
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:40.731
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1515
00:43:40.731 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 5>if you were really thinking about it,</v>

1516
00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:46.040
<v Speaker 5>all the people that we have in our inner circle that we considered a lot writing</v>

1517
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:46.874
<v Speaker 5>secrets.</v>

1518
00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1519
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.201
<v Speaker 5>You should do.</v>

1520
00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:48.740
<v Speaker 5>Don't do it.</v>

1521
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1522
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's kind of like a team,</v>

1523
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.230
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1524
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean if anybody is,</v>

1525
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:54.950
<v Speaker 5>in most cases standup is not like that.</v>

1526
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.150
<v Speaker 5>But with us,</v>

1527
00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.780
<v Speaker 5>I think a stand,</v>

1528
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.210

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.730
<v Speaker 5>Frankie Edgar finds a way that motherfucker finds a mine.</v>

1579
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.870
<v Speaker 5>He's a little dog.</v>

1580
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 5>He's got a mind that is like,</v>

1581
00:45:24.571 --> 00:45:25.710
<v Speaker 5>he don't like losing,</v>

1582
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1583
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:26.520

<v Speaker 5>and he comes back stronger.</v>

1585
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 5>He comes back stronger than ever.</v>

1586
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.230
<v Speaker 5>He should see you lead guy.</v>

1587
00:45:31.231 --> 00:45:32.640
<v Speaker 5>He looks fucking rain man.</v>

1588
00:45:32.641 --> 00:45:35.220
<v Speaker 5>Up to eight dribbler like what the fuck's rain man?</v>

1589
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 5>And you want to giggle?</v>

1590
00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.890
<v Speaker 5>He said about who likes you to fuck up?</v>

1591
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.551
<v Speaker 5>He's a bad mother.</v>

1592
00:45:38.551 --> 00:45:39.750
<v Speaker 5>I just watched him as great.</v>

1593
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 5>Made it the second one.</v>

1594
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:41.820
<v Speaker 5>The third one again.</v>

1595
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.270
<v Speaker 5>The other,</v>

1596
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.000
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1597
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 5>You gotta be able to keep that pace up too,</v>

1598
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1599
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.530
<v Speaker 5>You gotta be able to keep pace with him.</v>

1600
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:47.611
<v Speaker 5>He'll,</v>

1601
00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:50.040
<v Speaker 5>he'll drag you into some deep fucking conditioning water.</v>

1602
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1603
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.740
<v Speaker 5>that guy can do that for an hour and a half.</v>

1604
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.341
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

1605
00:45:53.341 --> 00:45:55.290
<v Speaker 5>he's one of the best condition guys in the sport.</v>

1606
00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.930
<v Speaker 5>And one of the reasons for that is what we talked about earlier.</v>

1607
00:45:57.931 --> 00:45:59.250
<v Speaker 5>Frankie Edgar doesn't cut.</v>

1608
00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:01.860
<v Speaker 5>That guy weighs 155 pounds.</v>

1609
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

1610
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.080
<v Speaker 5>I love it when he can win.</v>

1611
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 5>I love it when he can win,</v>

1612
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.180
<v Speaker 5>but when,</v>

1613
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 5>when he loses and he loses because of guys bigger than him,</v>

1614
00:46:09.091 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 5>it makes you think like,</v>

1615
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:10.411
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1616
00:46:10.411 --> 00:46:11.244
<v Speaker 5>I wish.</v>

1617
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:16.320
<v Speaker 5>I wish you could do it at one 55 I hope you can do it at one 55 but you know,</v>

1618
00:46:16.321 --> 00:46:18.450
<v Speaker 5>maybe one 45 is your weight class closet songs.</v>

1619
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:23.451
<v Speaker 5>He goes to talk 45 that could be one of the greatest fights him against fucking,</v>

1620
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:24.750
<v Speaker 5>I'll go,</v>

1621
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.910
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>command.</v>

1623
00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:26.490
<v Speaker 5>I've said that to this day one.</v>

1624
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm pushing for it.</v>

1625
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:27.901
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

1626
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:30.150
<v Speaker 5>At one 45 in Vegas,</v>

1627
00:46:30.151 --> 00:46:30.630
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

1628
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1629

1630
00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:32.011
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1631

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:33.261
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1635
00:46:33.261 --> 00:46:33.630
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1636
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:35.310
<v Speaker 5>Knock him out by any stretch of imagination.</v>

1637
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.410
<v Speaker 5>That kid like I can win,</v>

1638
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:36.750
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1639
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:39.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't want him in my future and my past him for you,</v>

1640
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:40.691
<v Speaker 5>you don't need that.</v>

00:46:40.691 --> 00:46:41.520
<v Speaker 5>And you're fucking white,</v>

1642
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:41.821
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1643
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't need that shit in my fucking life.</v>

1644
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.420
<v Speaker 5>I love the fact that if I,</v>

1645
00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:47.610
<v Speaker 5>if I see him and then I see him six months later,</v>

1646
00:46:47.611 --> 00:46:49.470
<v Speaker 5>I look forward to seeing what,</v>

1647
00:46:49.471 --> 00:46:50.430
<v Speaker 5>what's improved,</v>

1648
00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:50.791
<v Speaker 5>what's,</v>

1649
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:52.800
<v Speaker 5>what's gotten better because it's going to be better.</v>

1650
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:53.580
<v Speaker 5>He's going to be better.</v>

1651
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.600
<v Speaker 5>It's going to do something better.</v>

1652
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:56.760
<v Speaker 5>He's going to have some move that you didn't expect.</v>

1653
00:46:56.761 --> 00:46:57.041
<v Speaker 5>Common.</v>

1654
00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:59.000
<v Speaker 5>Some lead right hand that you didn't see coming.</v>

1655
00:46:59.001 --> 00:46:59.834
<v Speaker 5>He's going to shift his,</v>

1656
00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.770
<v Speaker 5>his was wait a little bit differently.</v>

1657
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 5>He's going to do something better.</v>

1658
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.680
<v Speaker 5>He's going to have a little bit more conditioning.</v>

1659
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:06.140
<v Speaker 5>He's not like an asshole,</v>

1660
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:06.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1661
00:47:06.621 --> 00:47:08.220
<v Speaker 5>it takes time off and gets fat.</v>

1662
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.390
<v Speaker 5>That's 40 years at genes.</v>

1663
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 5>Those kids from down the shore of just scrapping,</v>

1664
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:17.770
<v Speaker 5>scrapping because the other half is the Guido's and all that stability,</v>

1665
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:20.910
<v Speaker 5>but the other half of a lot of people don't know is those kids have to go to</v>

1666
00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Speaker 5>like brick township.</v>

1667
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:26.010
<v Speaker 5>Like what Mike Dolce when they got to go to these schools and they group for</v>

1668
00:47:26.011 --> 00:47:26.844
<v Speaker 5>schools,</v>

1669
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:27.930
<v Speaker 5>group for schools.</v>

1670
00:47:27.931 --> 00:47:32.931
<v Speaker 5>You play black schools that I was six foot four and his Frankie Edgar wrestling</v>

1671
00:47:33.251 --> 00:47:35.890
<v Speaker 5>against these schools and they wrestle it weight categories,</v>

1672
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:36.724
<v Speaker 5>but it's the same day.</v>

1673
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:41.020
<v Speaker 5>If Frankie wrestled at one 35 that guy that he wrestled against was a lot bigger</v>

1674
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:41.130
<v Speaker 5>than,</v>

1675
00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:42.010
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1676
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 5>Wrestling was the most ridiculous.</v>

1677
00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Those guys from up,</v>

1678
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 5>the kids I grew up with would go down south and they walk all over that fucking</v>

1679
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 5>show up and eventually those kids nights,</v>

1680
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 5>40 years of portrait that every summer they got to fight somebody fucking beggar</v>

1681
00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.720
<v Speaker 5>and they do it and the rides down there,</v>

1682
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:02.740
<v Speaker 5>if you've ever been done that there's a fight every fucking night and it always</v>

1683
00:48:02.741 --> 00:48:07.270
<v Speaker 5>includes a Guido from up debt against a regular guy from down there and the</v>

1684
00:48:07.271 --> 00:48:09.100
<v Speaker 5>regular guy who always takes him to fuck off.</v>

1685
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.040
<v Speaker 5>We don't shows up with his buddies or juice stop,</v>

1686
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.810
<v Speaker 5>take off his shirt.</v>

1687
00:48:13.811 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 5>I've been training and those guys down the show like shut the fuck up.</v>

1688
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:18.790
<v Speaker 5>And he's one of those guys.</v>

1689
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:19.990
<v Speaker 5>I sent it to him all the time.</v>

1690
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 5>Used to light people up and Mr Breakfast,</v>

1691
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 5>that's the hang out down there.</v>

1692
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.780
<v Speaker 5>They all go down there with no shirts on that goal.</v>

1693
00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 5>They breakfast.</v>

1694
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:27.911
<v Speaker 5>How you doing?</v>

1695
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:28.744
<v Speaker 5>How's the advice?</v>

1696
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.120
<v Speaker 5>He's the guys that don't even work on their legs,</v>

1697
00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:32.413
<v Speaker 5>don't even care.</v>

1698
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:33.970
<v Speaker 5>They don't even care about their stomachs.</v>

1699
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.140
<v Speaker 5>Don't care about that lats.</v>

1700
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 5>They just working on their biceps.</v>

1701
00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:40.030
<v Speaker 5>That chest and maybe a little trap is hilarious.</v>

1702
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.570
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious at bay with no supervision.</v>

1703
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:43.980
<v Speaker 5>Vinny,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no Olufsen I love San Diego.</v>

1810
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:14.710
<v Speaker 3>Let's get the crazy beautiful San Diego on the Mexico side is you cross into</v>

1811
00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Mexico guys right there.</v>

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:17.570
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking scary.</v>

1814
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.180
<v Speaker 3>It's scary.</v>

1815
00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.780
<v Speaker 3>It goes from the five two dirt roads.</v>

1816
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Well it goes from,</v>

1817
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.120
<v Speaker 3>there's an immediate lack of a,</v>

1818
00:51:24.121 --> 00:51:25.430
<v Speaker 3>a feeling of a net.</v>

1819
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:26.181
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1820
00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Cause there's a net when you're walking around in San Diego there's a net of</v>

1821
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:33.370
<v Speaker 3>society and civilization and culture and like the biggest trust,</v>

1822
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.830
<v Speaker 3>you trust people more like military base there to protect you.</v>

1823
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean you not,</v>

1824
00:51:37.491 --> 00:51:41.090
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the police when you live there you have like the one of the</v>

1825
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:43.360
<v Speaker 3>biggest military basis protecting your there.</v>

1826
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.890
<v Speaker 3>So it's safe still to live there in San Diego.</v>

1827
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.121
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1828
00:51:46.121 --> 00:51:46.251
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1829
00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:47.300
<v Speaker 3>I know for sure but I'm,</v>

1830
00:51:47.301 --> 00:51:50.630
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying is that when you walk through to Tiawana there's this feeling</v>

1831
00:51:50.631 --> 00:51:51.980
<v Speaker 3>like the net's been removed.</v>

1832
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:56.600
<v Speaker 3>Like all of a sudden I'm seeing all these beggars and all this weirdness on the</v>

1833
00:51:56.601 --> 00:51:57.830
<v Speaker 3>street and all these people.</v>

1841
00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:09.530
<v Speaker 3>it's just that when you do cross that border,</v>

1842
00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:14.300
<v Speaker 3>it's a very bizarre feeling that you're only 20 minutes away from the place</v>

1843
00:52:14.301 --> 00:52:16.640
<v Speaker 3>where all of the law doesn't apply.</v>

1844
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 3>All of it is gone.</v>

1845
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:18.463
<v Speaker 3>It's all gone.</v>

1846
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:22.820
<v Speaker 3>And now you have to live with this rinky dink set of laws from this other</v>

1847
00:52:22.821 --> 00:52:23.511
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

1848
00:52:23.511 --> 00:52:24.350
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1849
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:27.350
<v Speaker 3>you might run into a cop who says that you were speeding and you just got to</v>

1850
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:29.690
<v Speaker 3>give him money because that's how they roll down there.</v>

1851
00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:30.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1852
00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 3>and who knows how many fucking people are involved in and doing illegal shit,</v>

1853
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.730
<v Speaker 3>moving drugs around and it's right there 20 minutes away.</v>

1854
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.721
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1855
00:52:38.721 --> 00:52:41.600
<v Speaker 3>it's way scarier than the ghettos in America,</v>

1856
00:52:41.601 --> 00:52:42.020
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1857
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you say that?</v>

1858
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Awana is scarier than most of the ghetto.</v>

1859
00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Always five minutes away.</v>

1860
00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:48.621
<v Speaker 3>But one thing,</v>

1861
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:53.621
<v Speaker 3>I know tons of people that go the Tijuana all the time and I don't know anybody</v>

1862
00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:58.610
<v Speaker 3>that goes to like Harlem and all the time you really know tons of people who go</v>

1863
00:52:58.611 --> 00:52:59.241
<v Speaker 3>to Tijuana.</v>

1864
00:52:59.241 --> 00:53:00.530
<v Speaker 3>All it sound all the time.</v>

1865
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:00.801
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1866
00:53:00.801 --> 00:53:01.281
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>

1867
00:53:01.281 --> 00:53:04.880
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bourdain went recently on a show and I really enjoyed that show.</v>

1868
00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:09.881
<v Speaker 3>It was cool because he met with a lot of cool Mexicans that live in Tijuana that</v>

1869
00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:13.250
<v Speaker 3>were like sort of giving them the real deal on how everything went down there</v>

1870
00:53:13.251 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 3>and took them to a bunch of different bars and it didn't seem to me to be as</v>

1871
00:53:17.211 --> 00:53:20.240
<v Speaker 3>dangerous as I thought it was or as dangerous is.</v>

1872
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Everybody always publicize it,</v>

1873
00:53:22.701 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to realize that it could get way at any moment.</v>

1874
00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:27.140
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1875
00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:27.630
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1876
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:28.131
<v Speaker 5>it's you're,</v>

1877
00:53:28.131 --> 00:53:32.340
<v Speaker 5>you're living your party and in the country where shit is just way different,</v>

1878
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 5>it's just way different and you can get lucky and do it a thousand times in a</v>

1879
00:53:35.731 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 5>row or you could get unlucky and you be there when some drug lord is trying to</v>

1880
00:53:39.481 --> 00:53:40.230
<v Speaker 5>make a point,</v>

1881
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:43.770
<v Speaker 5>like some dudes trying to move product and someone's trying to block him so he</v>

1882
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:46.080
<v Speaker 5>decides the light as fucking nightclub on fire.</v>

1883
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.310
<v Speaker 5>They do shit like that.</v>

1884
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:48.910
<v Speaker 5>Like in Tijuana,</v>

1885
00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:52.050
<v Speaker 5>not until on a and M can coon,</v>

1886
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:54.180
<v Speaker 5>there was a a sell coke on the beach.</v>

1887
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.420
<v Speaker 5>Do they really sell coke on the beach.</v>

1888
00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:58.283
<v Speaker 5>We'd go,</v>

1889
00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:00.030
<v Speaker 5>why are we talking about sandals?</v>

1890
00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:00.881
<v Speaker 5>Tiawana no,</v>

1891
00:54:00.881 --> 00:54:03.430
<v Speaker 5>they'd come up to you and so you fucking blow on the beach.</v>

1892
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:05.040
<v Speaker 5>But you know it's been decriminalized.</v>

1893
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:07.470
<v Speaker 5>Everything's been decriminalized and Co,</v>

1894
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:08.670
<v Speaker 5>which is really weird.</v>

1895
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.330
<v Speaker 5>It's awesome.</v>

1896
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.320
<v Speaker 5>Get acid in Mexico.</v>

1897
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:12.330
<v Speaker 5>I am scan on the last time I was done.</v>

1898
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:12.621
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

1899
00:54:12.621 --> 00:54:13.680
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean it's legal.</v>

1900
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:14.421
<v Speaker 5>It's not legal.</v>

1901
00:54:14.421 --> 00:54:15.254
<v Speaker 5>It's to be criminal law.</v>

1902
00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.113
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1903
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.090
<v Speaker 5>I think it's still a crime.</v>

1904
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:18.241
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1905
00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:20.290
<v Speaker 5>That is why when you do get caught with it,</v>

1906
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:21.450
<v Speaker 5>you got to pay out the ass.</v>

1907
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:22.411
<v Speaker 5>Cause I wouldn't let you go.</v>

1908
00:54:22.411 --> 00:54:23.244
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1909
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:25.050

1910
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:30.080
<v Speaker 5>But maybe if you had a couple extra thousand on you maybe.</v>

1911
00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.240
<v Speaker 5>Is that what they're saying?</v>

1912
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.810
<v Speaker 5>We can work something in my friends.</v>

1913

1915
00:54:35.521 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 5>They want to keep this business going and it shouldn't be an understanding that</v>

1916
00:54:38.311 --> 00:54:39.810
<v Speaker 5>I just got to give you a little bribery.</v>

<v Speaker 4>which is really crazy.</v>

1998
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:28.270
<v Speaker 4>Like people you know,</v>

1999
00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 4>report that they're building a hit by a bullet from Mexico.</v>

2000
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:36.300
<v Speaker 4>I know people have gone down there to get volumes oxycontin's edition.</v>

2001
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:37.720
<v Speaker 4>I've never dealt with them,</v>

2002
00:56:37.721 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 4>but I know they've gone on it,</v>

2003
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 4>but I know millions of people going on there for the juice.</v>

2004
00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:43.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2005
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you something about the juice and Mexico was just Mexican juice.</v>

2006
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 4>Was this still the juice that you get here and they just sell it over the</v>

2007
00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:50.441
<v Speaker 4>counter Mexico?</v>

2008
00:56:50.441 --> 00:56:51.710
<v Speaker 4>That's the question I want to know.</v>

2009
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:53.590
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

2010
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Like is this the deck of the Robin when I go to Germany that I get in Germany</v>

2011

<v Speaker 4>Not very departure health.</v>

2016
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:07.600
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm worried about.</v>

2017
00:57:07.601 --> 00:57:12.040
<v Speaker 4>If you go to fucking Mexico and buy 60 be balls and they'd be ball or they'd be</v>

2046
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:56.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't wonder what I was wearing.</v>

2047
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.510
<v Speaker 4>I might've went shirtless cause I'm so small.</v>

2048
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:01.450
<v Speaker 4>You did a Sandler.</v>

2049
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:02.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I did though.</v>

2050
00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:03.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I went shirtless.</v>

2051
00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:04.181
<v Speaker 4>If I did,</v>

2052
00:58:04.181 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 4>how dare I were outside.</v>

2053
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:06.970
<v Speaker 4>It was fun.</v>

2054
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:07.481
<v Speaker 4>It was a,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was a fun,</v>

2056
00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:09.940
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know who any of the bands where it was.</v>

2057
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Even back then I still was in the dark.</v>

2058
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:13.960
<v Speaker 4>It's still like new bands.</v>

2059
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:15.580
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to reach me.</v>

2060
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:16.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2061

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:18.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2063
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't really,</v>

2070
00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 4>You got to think that every year a new couple of bands come along and if they're</v>

2071
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:35.440
<v Speaker 4>good they stick around and there's no way you can keep in track with all of</v>

00:59:59.081 --> 01:00:00.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't fuck around at red rocks,</v>

2142
01:00:00.371 --> 01:00:02.110

2143
01:00:02.111 --> 01:00:03.550
<v Speaker 5>their whole repertoire is kind of,</v>

2144
01:00:03.551 --> 01:00:04.384
<v Speaker 5>it's so much.</v>

2145
01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.060
<v Speaker 5>It's the fans that always startled me.</v>

2146
01:00:07.061 --> 01:00:07.894
<v Speaker 5>Dog.</v>

2147
01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2148
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:09.011
<v Speaker 5>I lived in boulder.</v>

2149
01:00:09.011 --> 01:00:09.880
<v Speaker 5>They pull up with a bus.</v>

2150
01:00:09.881 --> 01:00:11.650
<v Speaker 5>They haven't showered in the fucking six months,</v>

2151
01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:12.341
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2152
01:00:12.341 --> 01:00:13.540
<v Speaker 5>that follow with this band,</v>

2153
01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:14.201
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at them,</v>

2154
01:00:14.201 --> 01:00:15.940
<v Speaker 5>are they really dirty or they hippies.</v>

2155
01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.430
<v Speaker 5>Half of them are trust funders.</v>

2156
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.310
<v Speaker 5>Hi.</v>

2157
01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:18.890
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2158
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2159
01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:19.660
<v Speaker 5>aw,</v>

2160
01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.170
<v Speaker 5>fuck cooperations.</v>

2161
01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.440
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile that's how they're living off.</v>

2162
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:24.790
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking credit card.</v>

2163
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.200
<v Speaker 5>Sneaking showers.</v>

2164
01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:27.251
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>

2165
01:00:27.251 --> 01:00:28.090
<v Speaker 5>they drive a beamer,</v>

2166
01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:29.350
<v Speaker 5>but they either round the corner.</v>

2167
01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:29.970
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2168
01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:31.120
<v Speaker 5>Boulder's very unique.</v>

2169
01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:31.541
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2170
01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:34.570
<v Speaker 5>a lot of kids get to boulder in the anti fucking cooperation,</v>

2171
01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:35.920
<v Speaker 5>anti money.</v>

2172
01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>

2173
01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.960
<v Speaker 5>your dad owns fucking Pepsi.</v>

2174
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.490
<v Speaker 5>And you know what I'm saying?</v>

2175
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.541
<v Speaker 5>Get it together.</v>

2176
01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:42.830
<v Speaker 5>You've done a little fuck before I smack you.</v>

2177
01:00:42.831 --> 01:00:45.670
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of that rebelling from their successful frog.</v>

2178
01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.350
<v Speaker 5>Well fuck him.</v>

2179
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:47.951
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

2180
01:00:47.951 --> 01:00:51.010
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile you got an Audi and you haven't worked the whole time he head and</v>

2181
01:00:51.011 --> 01:00:52.540
<v Speaker 5>you're buying big bags of wheat,</v>

2182
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:53.540
<v Speaker 5>cut it out.</v>

2183
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.290
<v Speaker 5>There's a weird balance between like your,</v>

2184
01:00:56.291 --> 01:01:00.400
<v Speaker 5>your parents being successful and your parents being a good parent because of</v>

2185
01:01:00.401 --> 01:01:01.540
<v Speaker 5>the parents really successful.</v>

2186
01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:02.710
<v Speaker 5>They probably have to work a lot.</v>

2187
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.350
<v Speaker 5>And if they work all the time constantly,</v>

2188
01:01:05.351 --> 01:01:07.180
<v Speaker 5>they're probably not going to be around as much.</v>

2189
01:01:07.181 --> 01:01:08.920
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to be as good of a father.</v>

2190
01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.190
<v Speaker 5>And if you're not going to be as good,</v>

2191
01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:12.730
<v Speaker 5>if you can dedicate more time to work than you are to your kids,</v>

2192
01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.490
<v Speaker 5>your kids are probably going to grow up to fucking resent.</v>

2193
01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:16.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2194
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:16.570
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2195
01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:17.500
<v Speaker 5>And that's what happens.</v>

2196
01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:20.500
<v Speaker 5>You get a lot of these trust fund liberal.</v>

2197
01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:21.790
<v Speaker 5>He was fair for me.</v>

2198
01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:26.110
<v Speaker 5>He never went to another bank ballet checking back check and balance on your</v>

2199
01:01:26.111 --> 01:01:26.680
<v Speaker 5>account.</v>

2200
01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.820
<v Speaker 5>What's in the fucking account?</v>

2201
01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.351
<v Speaker 5>Did you have a lead?</v>

2202
01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:30.161
<v Speaker 5>I think no,</v>

2203
01:01:30.161 --> 01:01:31.030
<v Speaker 5>they shut the fuck up.</v>

2204
01:01:31.031 --> 01:01:31.780
<v Speaker 5>Cock sucker.</v>

2205
01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.450
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend that grew up with and every time he had three beers,</v>

2206
01:01:34.451 --> 01:01:38.800
<v Speaker 5>my father never went to another my football games really look at the nice</v>

2207
01:01:38.801 --> 01:01:39.161
<v Speaker 5>sneakers.</v>

2208
01:01:39.161 --> 01:01:42.460
<v Speaker 5>Yet you had a fucking 300 Zx in fucking high school,</v>

2209
01:01:42.461 --> 01:01:45.430
<v Speaker 5>your first car and you still bitching about your fucking parents.</v>

2210
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:46.780
<v Speaker 5>You know they can't do everything,</v>

2211
01:01:46.781 --> 01:01:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

2212
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.910
<v Speaker 5>You can not be the perfect parent.</v>

2213
01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.770
<v Speaker 5>You cannot or you could do is fucking try because somebody is not going to be</v>

2214
01:01:53.771 --> 01:01:55.180
<v Speaker 5>happy with your fucking job.</v>

2215
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:58.630
<v Speaker 5>I would hope that you can teach your children to not think like that.</v>

2216
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:59.920
<v Speaker 5>I would hope that you would teach.</v>

2217
01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.800
<v Speaker 5>You'd be able to teach your children to not blame.</v>

2218
01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:05.050
<v Speaker 5>Your parents are paying for the last aspect of your life.</v>

2219
01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.490
<v Speaker 5>It'd be nice if your parents,</v>

2332
01:04:40.431 --> 01:04:42.940
<v Speaker 1>the flash is getting worse and worse and worse.</v>

2333
01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>It's gotten to the point now where my,</v>

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2335
01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:47.150
<v Speaker 1>my computer and I found out this does it on the alien.</v>

2336
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Where does it on like every computer that uses flash where like a lit up a flash</v>

2337
01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>movie in your whole computer just kind of freezes for like a second.</v>

2338
01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:55.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And then it,</v>

2340
01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:59.080
<v Speaker 1>then it kind of catches back up at the flash.</v>

2341
01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>If you look at your,</v>

2342
01:05:00.311 --> 01:05:00.760
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2343
01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.091
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2344
01:05:01.091 --> 01:05:01.421
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2345
01:05:01.421 --> 01:05:02.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2346
01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>your computer Cpu Monitor and then you do that,</v>

2347
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.120
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice it goes up to a hundred percent,</v>

2348
01:05:07.121 --> 01:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>from like 10%.</v>

2349
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>How is a dual core,</v>

2350
01:05:10.691 --> 01:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>whatever triple court fats,</v>

2351
01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>top of the line computer like,</v>

2352
01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2353
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>It can't handle a fucking flash.</v>

2354
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2355
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:19.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2356
01:05:19.031 --> 01:05:19.864
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough.</v>

2357
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Last computer die eat aids.</v>

2358
01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.131
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're going to eat it.</v>

2359
01:05:24.131 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun.</v>

2360
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I think if someone can give you a bowl aids and you could be fine.</v>

2361
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 1>So let's put flash on your fucking phone goes in that way.</v>

2362
01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll bowl of a scoop of a bull aids.</v>

2363
01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:35.651
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

2364
01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:36.484
<v Speaker 1>What color would it be?</v>

2365
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd say yellow.</v>

2366
01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:38.043
<v Speaker 1>So why don't we,</v>

2367
01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>why don't we enjoy like let flash onto our phone.</v>

2368
01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:42.881
<v Speaker 1>That does,</v>

2369
01:05:42.881 --> 01:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a good idea.</v>

2370
01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's just change the subject like everybody else.</v>

2371
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:48.281
<v Speaker 1>Go with the flow.</v>

2372
01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>You fuck it's flash thing.</v>

2373
01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>He's obsessed with them.</v>

2374
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:52.563
<v Speaker 1>But what's flash?</v>

2375
01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:54.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just a program that you run on the um,</v>

2376
01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.300
<v Speaker 1>on a android phones that you can't run on apple iPhones.</v>

2377
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.390
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially a animation web animation.</v>

2378
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 1>It looks like little videos.</v>

2379
01:06:02.261 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Youtube used to use it,</v>

2380
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:08.431
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of what they use now is a html five and they also have it directly for</v>

2381
01:06:08.471 --> 01:06:09.100
<v Speaker 1>the iPhone.</v>

2382
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:09.790
<v Speaker 1>So you just,</v>

2383
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:13.840
<v Speaker 1>anytime you click on a youtube video you have like a youtube application that</v>

2384
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:14.674
<v Speaker 1>opens up,</v>

2385
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:17.170
<v Speaker 1>recognizes most new videos like pretty quickly.</v>

2386
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:17.711
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2387
01:06:17.711 --> 01:06:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2388
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:22.330
<v Speaker 1>my phone also has a floppy disk and the iPhone doesn't so well.</v>

2389
01:06:22.331 --> 01:06:22.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2390
01:06:22.601 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I definitely,</v>

2391
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.820
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think that it works really seamlessly on the iPhone.</v>

2392
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:28.500
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>

2393
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.490
<v Speaker 1>like when I got a youtube videos and shit like that,</v>

2394
01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:34.000
<v Speaker 1>he works pretty fucking smooth and it would have to be,</v>

2395
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I would have to be really impressed with how well it worked on the droid to</v>

2396
01:06:37.451 --> 01:06:39.310
<v Speaker 1>think about switching over just because of that.</v>

2397
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I tell you that the hottest thing,</v>

2398
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:42.190
<v Speaker 1>hottest thing.</v>

2399
01:06:42.191 --> 01:06:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And Mac Technology,</v>

2400
01:06:43.211 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

2401
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 1>The hottest thing right now,</v>

2402
01:06:44.681 --> 01:06:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cool</v>

2403
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.820
<v Speaker 6>is the new operating system</v>

2404
01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>that the new operating system,</v>

2405
01:06:56.391 --> 01:06:59.900
<v Speaker 1>new Mac has a screen sharing on it.</v>

2406
01:06:59.901 --> 01:07:00.890
<v Speaker 1>So you just like,</v>

2407
01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>you can just hit this button and in any TV that has apple TV,</v>

2408
01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>it's sends your monitor to the TV now.</v>

2409
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>So like if you want to work on it,</v>

2410
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>70 inch resolution screen,</v>

2411
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>you just on your laptop or whatever,</v>

2412
01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you just hit this button and it will flip it to your TV.</v>

2413
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:18.300
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

2414
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sitting there watching youtube or doing websites and love watching videos</v>

2415
01:07:22.701 --> 01:07:23.181

2418
01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:30.681
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>

2419
01:07:30.681 --> 01:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just getting too crazy.</v>

2420
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:33.380

2568
01:11:48.611 --> 01:11:52.570
<v Speaker 3>I was running out the door when I read this and um,</v>

2569
01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

2570
01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:57.520
<v Speaker 3>didn't get a chance to really look at it like deep in there,</v>

2571
01:11:57.521 --> 01:12:00.460
<v Speaker 3>but this is apparently it's a recent discovery and what,</v>

2572
01:12:00.461 --> 01:12:01.270
<v Speaker 3>what they're,</v>

2573
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:04.120
<v Speaker 3>what they've decided is that,</v>

2574
01:12:04.121 --> 01:12:04.954
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2575
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:10.350
<v Speaker 3>they found thousands of skeletons and mass graves in London's east end and they</v>

2576
01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:14.350
<v Speaker 3>believe that many were victims of a 13th century volcanic eruption.</v>

2577
01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2578
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:16.943
<v Speaker 3>I'm not nuts.</v>

2579
01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:17.950
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>

2580
01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.293
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2581
01:12:19.570 --> 01:12:20.201
<v Speaker 3>They found,</v>

2582
01:12:20.201 --> 01:12:21.034
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2583
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:22.181
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2584
01:12:22.181 --> 01:12:22.961
<v Speaker 3>This is amazing,</v>

2585
01:12:22.961 --> 01:12:23.794
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2586
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:26.740
<v Speaker 3>The skeletons were uncovered next to a s.</v>

2587
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2588
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.061
<v Speaker 3>This is a weird word.</v>

2589
01:12:28.061 --> 01:12:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Spit of fields.</v>

2590
01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:30.123
<v Speaker 3>Bill fields.</v>

2591
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.780
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit of fields market.</v>

2592
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.353
<v Speaker 3>When the news,</v>

2593
01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:34.721
<v Speaker 3>new,</v>

2594
01:12:34.721 --> 01:12:35.554
<v Speaker 3>spittle,</v>

2595
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:36.091
<v Speaker 3>spittle,</v>

2596
01:12:36.091 --> 01:12:36.940
<v Speaker 3>square one.</v>

2597
01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.790
<v Speaker 3>What kind of name is that new spittle square,</v>

2598
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:41.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2599
01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:43.180
<v Speaker 3>development we started 20 years ago.</v>

2600
01:12:43.181 --> 01:12:43.840
<v Speaker 3>So I guess they,</v>

2601
01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.880
<v Speaker 3>they started digging and they found that shit.</v>

2602
01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.000
<v Speaker 3>And now a 10 year ecological investigation by the Museum of London has</v>

2603
01:12:50.001 --> 01:12:53.110
<v Speaker 3>discovered that the likely cause to be volcano,</v>

2604
01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:55.390
<v Speaker 3>which led to world temperatures,</v>

2605
01:12:55.391 --> 01:12:57.730
<v Speaker 3>cooling down and crops failing,</v>

2606
01:12:58.030 --> 01:13:00.130
<v Speaker 3>resulting in a mass starvation.</v>

2607
01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.360
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2608
01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 3>10,500 skeletons dating from the 12th to the 16th century were uncovered by the</v>

2609
01:13:08.321 --> 01:13:09.041
<v Speaker 3>archeologists,</v>

2610
01:13:09.041 --> 01:13:14.041
<v Speaker 3>including mass burial pits that had scientists baffled because the radio carbon</v>

2611
01:13:14.111 --> 01:13:16.990
<v Speaker 3>dating didn't match known events in medieval England,</v>

2612
01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.000
<v Speaker 3>like the black death or the great famine.</v>

2613
01:13:19.001 --> 01:13:19.840
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

2614
01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 3>This is 1258 there was a colossal volcano in 1258 wow.</v>

2615
01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.980
<v Speaker 3>This is amazing,</v>

2616
01:13:29.981 --> 01:13:30.814
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2617
01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:33.940
<v Speaker 3>So this is a new discovery that such a,</v>

2618
01:13:33.941 --> 01:13:35.410
<v Speaker 3>a massive global,</v>

2619
01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:36.160
<v Speaker 3>national,</v>

2620
01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.160
<v Speaker 3>natural disaster has been identified in a small area of east London.</v>

2621
01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:43.240
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible,</v>

2622
01:13:43.241 --> 01:13:44.074
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2623
01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.300
<v Speaker 3>That is amazing shit.</v>

2624
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2625
01:13:48.461 --> 01:13:49.420
<v Speaker 3>We don't know too much.</v>

2626
01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:50.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2627
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:50.771
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>

2628
01:13:50.771 --> 01:13:52.300
<v Speaker 3>when they really talk about history,</v>

2629
01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:53.950
<v Speaker 3>like what we really know about the past,</v>

2630
01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:54.671
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2631
01:13:54.671 --> 01:13:55.720
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know that much.</v>

2632
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:56.500
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

2633
01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.850
<v Speaker 3>We just make a fucking assumption.</v>

2634
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.811
<v Speaker 3>We dig,</v>

2635
01:13:58.811 --> 01:13:59.550
<v Speaker 3>we dig,</v>

2636
01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:01.630
<v Speaker 3>and every other week we come up with a new fucking assumption.</v>

2637
01:14:01.631 --> 01:14:02.920
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how much we're fine,</v>

2638
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:05.170
<v Speaker 3>but that fucking take either that looks kinky,</v>

2639
01:14:05.171 --> 01:14:06.004
<v Speaker 3>come eat too.</v>

2640
01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:07.063
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's fair.</v>

2641
01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:09.110
<v Speaker 2>And who gives a fuck?</v>

2642
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:10.550
<v Speaker 2>You got to go to bars now.</v>

2643
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Now $14 billion.</v>

2644
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.061
<v Speaker 5>A lot of shit.</v>

2645
01:14:13.061 --> 01:14:14.710
<v Speaker 5>We got going on this fucking country.</v>

2646
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:15.700
<v Speaker 5>Mars for what?</v>

2647
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 5>Who gives a fuck about Mars?</v>

2648
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:17.921
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting there going,</v>

2649
01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:19.390
<v Speaker 5>this is who Gazeena this fucking the tape.</v>

2650
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:20.740
<v Speaker 5>They made this in Burbank.</v>

2651
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 5>Well this is what I think.</v>

2652
01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:22.961
<v Speaker 5>I think first of all,</v>

2653
01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:23.530
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2654
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:25.390
<v Speaker 5>they did go and it's awesome.</v>

2655
01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:30.420
<v Speaker 5>And when you spend money on scientific innovation for space travel,</v>

2656
01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:35.950
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with the cream of the crop of people that are trying to figure</v>

2657
01:14:35.951 --> 01:14:40.951
<v Speaker 5>out how to manipulate space and matter and and transport things and how to,</v>

2658
01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:42.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2659
01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're dealing with the most,</v>

2660
01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.200
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2661
01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:50.200
<v Speaker 5>the most knowledgeable scientists on earth that has right to be strived.</v>

2662
01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.660
<v Speaker 5>And Suzanne.</v>

2663
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.091
<v Speaker 5>Joey,</v>

2664
01:14:53.091 --> 01:14:53.411
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>

2665
01:14:53.411 --> 01:14:53.651

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying silly.</v>

2668
01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.050
<v Speaker 5>This is what every,</v>

2669
01:14:57.051 --> 01:15:00.940
<v Speaker 5>let me tell you that everything that they do when they got to go to fucking</v>

2670
01:15:00.941 --> 01:15:01.181
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>

2671
01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:02.680
<v Speaker 5>I ex what it has to do.</v>

2672
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:04.630
<v Speaker 5>We got diseases.</v>

2673
01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:08.910
<v Speaker 5>We've got fat kids running around and [inaudible] march.</v>

2674
01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.020
<v Speaker 5>Definitely we should pay attention to the IRC.</v>

2675
01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.900
<v Speaker 5>We should go and explore the universe all burn me a little by little.</v>

2676
01:15:16.901 --> 01:15:17.810
<v Speaker 5>We'll fucking dying.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He had dog.</v>

2678
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.020
<v Speaker 5>This country is fucking dying.</v>

2679
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:21.220
<v Speaker 5>We got time to,</v>

2680
01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:22.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck what goes on at Mars.</v>

2681
01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:26.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck what goes on in Oakland and loved it either 1529 I'm from</v>

2682
01:15:26.891 --> 01:15:28.000
<v Speaker 5>the Church of what's happening now,</v>

2683
01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:28.834
<v Speaker 5>mother fucker.</v>

2684
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 5>If you care about that shit,</v>

2685
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:32.300
<v Speaker 5>you got too much fucking time on your hands guy.</v>

2686
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:34.123
<v Speaker 5>What's that got to do?</v>

2687
01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:34.811
<v Speaker 5>We've got kids.</v>

2688
01:15:34.811 --> 01:15:35.644
<v Speaker 5>We've got houses.</v>

2689
01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.820
<v Speaker 5>Shut the fuck down.</v>

2690
01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:38.960
<v Speaker 5>You've got billions of dollars to go to model.</v>

2691
01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:39.701
<v Speaker 5>Give a fuck about,</v>

2692
01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:40.120
<v Speaker 5>I know this.</v>

2693
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.920
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you get this excited about the wars?</v>

2694
01:15:41.921 --> 01:15:43.420
<v Speaker 5>Because that costs a thousand times.</v>

2695
01:15:43.421 --> 01:15:46.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't get excited about mother shit because it doesn't have what the fuck that</v>

2696
01:15:46.801 --> 01:15:50.440
<v Speaker 5>that they'd been fighting for 10 years and I'm still paying $5 for a fucking gas</v>

2697
01:15:50.441 --> 01:15:51.274
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

2698
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:54.400
<v Speaker 5>The money we're spending on the war is a billion,</v>

2699
01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:54.490
<v Speaker 5>billion,</v>

2700
01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:57.460
<v Speaker 5>billions and billions of dollars every fucking year and how are we going to</v>

2701
01:15:57.461 --> 01:15:59.260
<v Speaker 5>spend more fucking money on going to Mars?</v>

2702
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:01.390
<v Speaker 5>It's bad luck was going to Afghanistan.</v>

2703
01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.340
<v Speaker 5>That Mars thing is a positive thing.</v>

2704
01:16:03.341 --> 01:16:04.174
<v Speaker 5>The Mars thing,</v>

2705
01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:06.240
<v Speaker 5>they're going to get innovation out of this project.</v>

2706
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.590
<v Speaker 5>I need them in,</v>

2707
01:16:07.591 --> 01:16:08.710
<v Speaker 5>in everything else.</v>

2708
01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.360
<v Speaker 5>It's going to eventually lead to,</v>

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying I advocate drones because fuck load of civilians have died from</v>

2849
01:20:26.791 --> 01:20:27.630
<v Speaker 4>the use of drone attack,</v>

2850
01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:30.750
<v Speaker 4>but they eventually get that shit wire to the point where they can kill</v>

2851
01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:31.890
<v Speaker 4>everybody they want to kill.</v>

2852
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.910
<v Speaker 4>That's where it's the scientists that are involved in making that shit or the</v>

2853
01:20:35.911 --> 01:20:39.120
<v Speaker 4>saint scientists that are involved in making all sorts of,</v>

2854
01:20:39.150 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 4>I love it and spacecrafts and Aircrafts and love technology,</v>

2855
01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:43.531
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2856
01:20:43.531 --> 01:20:44.341
<v Speaker 4>you want to kill somebody?</v>

2857
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:44.700
<v Speaker 4>You make up.</v>

2858
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.720
<v Speaker 4>I want to see the bullet.</v>

2859
01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't need a gun for it.</v>

2860
01:20:47.111 --> 01:20:49.740
<v Speaker 4>I just got to go like this and a hitching your head blows up.</v>

2861
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.180
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate the scientist,</v>

2862
01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:52.320
<v Speaker 4>but not right now.</v>

2863
01:20:52.321 --> 01:20:55.170
<v Speaker 4>Billions of dollars to go to phone only Joey.</v>

2864
01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:58.680
<v Speaker 4>That is a tiny fraction of what our military budget.</v>

2865
01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.920
<v Speaker 4>It's a tiny tach for freedom.</v>

2866
01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.720
<v Speaker 4>What does Mars has to do with it?</v>

2867
01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a Martian gonna come back to Vegas.</v>

2868
01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.170
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy thing to say.</v>

2869
01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.010
<v Speaker 4>The military is fighting for our freedom.</v>

2870
01:21:11.011 --> 01:21:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Is that why we're in countries that have absolutely nothing to do with us.</v>

2871
01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:15.090
<v Speaker 4>That's why and we invited them to,</v>

2872
01:21:15.091 --> 01:21:15.451
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

2873
01:21:15.451 --> 01:21:15.900
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2874
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.733
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

2875
01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:18.140
<v Speaker 4>That fucking flag brother.</v>

2876
01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:19.683
<v Speaker 4>What bad?</v>

2877
01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:20.660
<v Speaker 4>We got to kill some money.</v>

2878
01:21:20.661 --> 01:21:23.480
<v Speaker 4>You got to break a fucking few homage to fucking make an album.</v>

2879
01:21:23.481 --> 01:21:26.430
<v Speaker 4>You got to break some eggs to make a few of them that whatever they're doing,</v>

2880
01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.260
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot better than fucking,</v>

2881
01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:29.340
<v Speaker 4>they're selling drugs.</v>

2882
01:21:29.341 --> 01:21:30.450
<v Speaker 4>The CIA sells coke.</v>

2883
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:31.590
<v Speaker 4>At least they make him money,</v>

2884
01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.453
<v Speaker 4>Mars and got,</v>

2885
01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:33.721
<v Speaker 4>here's the big thing,</v>

2886
01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:34.011
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

2887
01:21:34.011 --> 01:21:35.010
<v Speaker 4>is that every time,</v>

2888
01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.400
<v Speaker 4>every time they send something to like Mars or the,</v>

2889
01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:38.490
<v Speaker 4>or do these missions,</v>

2890
01:21:38.491 --> 01:21:43.140
<v Speaker 4>they are also doing hundreds of experiments and these experiments are</v>

2891
01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.330
<v Speaker 4>experiencing that we can't do,</v>

2892
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:46.303
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2893
01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:51.720
<v Speaker 4>down on earth where do in a lot of these experiments lead to other things that</v>

2894
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.711
<v Speaker 4>do help us out,</v>

2895
01:21:52.711 --> 01:21:55.340
<v Speaker 4>like cures for cancer and fucking time travel.</v>

2896
01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:55.411
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2897
01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:56.244
<v Speaker 4>let's get the cure.</v>

2898
01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:56.641
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

2899
01:21:56.641 --> 01:21:57.660
<v Speaker 4>just to be a dollar.</v>

2900
01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.381
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be,</v>

2901
01:21:58.381 --> 01:21:59.760
<v Speaker 4>it's going to come a point in time.</v>

2902
01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:04.470
<v Speaker 4>If we follow the path that we're on right now where we might not be living on</v>

2903
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:05.670
<v Speaker 4>this fucking planet anymore,</v>

2904
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:07.880
<v Speaker 4>we're human beings might pollute this motherfucker.</v>

2905
01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.380
<v Speaker 4>The point where we're going to want to escape and what they're gonna do is I'm</v>

2906
01:22:10.381 --> 01:22:11.700
<v Speaker 4>going to send shit to Mars,</v>

2907
01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:12.570
<v Speaker 4>to terraform,</v>

2908
01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:14.640
<v Speaker 4>just like they did in the movie aliens,</v>

2909
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:17.880
<v Speaker 4>and they're going to put a fucking fake atmosphere on Mars and that's going to</v>

2910
01:22:17.881 --> 01:22:22.380
<v Speaker 4>bear a little escape colony graduate question you got to do with us.</v>

2911
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:23.560
<v Speaker 4>You'll be dead.</v>

2912
01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.250
<v Speaker 4>Be Dead.</v>

2913
01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:24.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

2914
01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:25.301
<v Speaker 4>It'll be fun.</v>

2915
01:22:25.301 --> 01:22:25.531
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2916
01:22:25.531 --> 01:22:26.370
<v Speaker 4>you know what else to do it.</v>

2917
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:28.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm alive right now and when something lands on Mars,</v>

2918
01:22:28.981 --> 01:22:29.940
<v Speaker 4>I get geeked out.</v>

2919
01:22:30.170 --> 01:22:32.240
<v Speaker 4>I want to see that shit out.</v>

2920
01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:33.090
<v Speaker 4>Looking at the photos,</v>

2921
01:22:33.091 --> 01:22:33.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm like that,</v>

2922
01:22:33.670 --> 01:22:34.740
<v Speaker 4>that land.</v>

2923
01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:36.360
<v Speaker 4>Has it ever been seen before?</v>

2924
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.961
<v Speaker 4>Is that like,</v>

2925
01:22:36.961 --> 01:22:38.520
<v Speaker 4>is there have been people that have walked on?</v>

2926
01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:39.810
<v Speaker 4>It looks like fucking Arizona.</v>

2927
01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:39.991
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2928
01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:40.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2929
01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:41.340
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really Arizona,</v>

2930
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:42.570
<v Speaker 4>but you know there is,</v>

2931
01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:47.670
<v Speaker 4>there's a real theory that's a fascinating theory that Mars used to inhabit life</v>

2932
01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:48.870
<v Speaker 4>than it used to have an atmosphere,</v>

2933
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:52.830
<v Speaker 4>but it was hit by an asteroid and that's one of the reasons why they want to</v>

2934
01:22:52.831 --> 01:22:54.690
<v Speaker 4>keep sending things there and get to task.</v>

2935
01:22:54.691 --> 01:22:57.990
<v Speaker 4>Because if it was a planet that supported life like ours,</v>

2936
01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.670
<v Speaker 4>but then it was hit by an asteroid,</v>

2937
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.050
<v Speaker 4>we realize that we've,</v>

2938
01:23:01.051 --> 01:23:03.780
<v Speaker 4>we've had mass extinctions on this planet,</v>

2939
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 4>at least two of them that caused by asteroids,</v>

2940
01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:07.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2941
01:23:07.001 --> 01:23:09.450
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of millions of years ago and then 65 million years ago.</v>

2942
01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.100
<v Speaker 4>They know that there's been some just doozies that have landed,</v>

2943
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:15.190
<v Speaker 4>but it's possible that one could land that just kills the whole thing.</v>

2944
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.091
<v Speaker 4>That's a wrap.</v>

2945
01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:16.781
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you something,</v>

2946
01:23:16.781 --> 01:23:17.614
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

2947
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.113
<v Speaker 4>You up.</v>

2948
01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:19.340
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2949
01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Can you sell an asteroid?</v>

2950
01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Can You bring an asteroid to a check cashing?</v>

2951
01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:24.910
<v Speaker 4>Send a dog to get my fucking money.</v>

2952
01:23:24.911 --> 01:23:26.950
<v Speaker 4>Fucking ass to really going to vote for this year.</v>

2953
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:27.551
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2954
01:23:27.551 --> 01:23:29.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to write in Doug.</v>

2955
01:23:29.690 --> 01:23:30.400
<v Speaker 4>Stan hope.</v>

2956
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.260

<v Speaker 4>right it Doug Stanhope</v>

2958
01:23:33.630 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 4>and you see what's going on in this country.</v>

2959
01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.140
<v Speaker 4>We could get a lot of people that read it and go,</v>

2960
01:23:37.141 --> 01:23:38.170
<v Speaker 4>what's going on in this country?</v>

2961
01:23:38.171 --> 01:23:39.004
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan,</v>

2962
01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:41.750
<v Speaker 4>intelligent guy.</v>

2963
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking Momo and I know that those both of them a bumps.</v>

2964
01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:46.590
<v Speaker 4>You're an intelligent guy.</v>

2965
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.520
<v Speaker 4>You just looking at my face and told me you're not confident about anybody who's</v>

2966
01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:51.281
<v Speaker 4>running for president.</v>

2967
01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:52.030
<v Speaker 4>This country,</v>

2968
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:55.510
<v Speaker 4>you and another fucking million people feel that way.</v>

2969
01:23:55.570 --> 01:23:55.721
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2970
01:23:55.721 --> 01:23:56.700
<v Speaker 4>this is the real problem.</v>

2971
01:23:56.701 --> 01:23:57.430
<v Speaker 4>We feel that way.</v>

2972
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have to,</v>

2973
01:23:58.331 --> 01:24:00.640
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have to restructure this whole fucking thing.</v>

2974
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:01.840
<v Speaker 4>The way this thing works.</v>

2975
01:24:01.841 --> 01:24:02.350
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2976
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:04.470
<v Speaker 4>the first of all there was getting people to offices,</v>

2977
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:05.800
<v Speaker 4>absolute horse shit.</v>

2978
01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:08.800
<v Speaker 4>This whole electoral college that might've worked when there was a hundred</v>

2979
01:24:08.801 --> 01:24:11.740
<v Speaker 4>fucking farmers out there in the middle of Pennsylvania,</v>

2980
01:24:11.741 --> 01:24:12.540
<v Speaker 4>and that's it.</v>

2981
01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.280
<v Speaker 4>It's shit that's not going to fly anymore.</v>

2982
01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.070
<v Speaker 4>That's stupid.</v>

2983
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:16.900
<v Speaker 4>The electoral college is ridiculous.</v>

2984
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.130
<v Speaker 4>It should be one person,</v>

2985
01:24:18.131 --> 01:24:18.671
<v Speaker 4>one vote,</v>

2986
01:24:18.671 --> 01:24:19.241
<v Speaker 4>one adult,</v>

2987
01:24:19.241 --> 01:24:19.691

01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:39.010
<v Speaker 4>we talked about the,</v>

3041
01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:41.230
<v Speaker 4>these little men fly through the air barefoot,</v>

3044
01:25:46.031 --> 01:25:47.610
<v Speaker 4>I watch the gymnastics a little bit.</v>

3045
01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:49.360
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting when it's happening.</v>

3046
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:50.570
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of a,</v>

3047
01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:54.520
<v Speaker 4>what I like about the Olympics is it becomes like sort of a national festivity.</v>

3048
01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:57.880
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody's like everybody's rooting for us and excited.</v>

3049
01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Apparently the boxing team had the worst showing ever.</v>

3050
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:02.830
<v Speaker 4>The boxing team didn't metal it all.</v>

3051
01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 4>It is really fucked up.</v>

01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.060
<v Speaker 5>like a first time ever.</v>

3054
01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:07.250
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's boxing them.</v>

3055
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:08.900
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if that's what people said.</v>

3056
01:26:08.901 --> 01:26:09.734
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

3060
01:26:12.141 --> 01:26:12.891
<v Speaker 5>I bet you're right.</v>

3061
01:26:12.891 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 5>I was watching wrestling today when I was at the y.</v>

3062
01:26:14.901 --> 01:26:15.880
<v Speaker 5>Wrestling was on the side,</v>

3063
01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 5>so I didn't really understand what's going on,</v>

3064
01:26:18.411 --> 01:26:19.101
<v Speaker 5>but the bottom now,</v>

3065
01:26:19.101 --> 01:26:19.934
<v Speaker 5>what happened with the,</v>

3066
01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:21.080
<v Speaker 5>the judo Cuban guy,</v>

3067
01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:22.060
<v Speaker 5>he hit the refaced hub.</v>

3068
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:23.620
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear somebody who'd been done?</v>

3069
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:23.850
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3070
01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:24.720
<v Speaker 5>A taekwondo guy.</v>

3071
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:30.270
<v Speaker 5>I saw this basketball game where somebody just like,</v>

3072
01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:31.490
<v Speaker 5>like he seriously,</v>

3073
01:26:31.491 --> 01:26:34.010
<v Speaker 5>he just ran into the guy and pretty much almost punched.</v>

3074
01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.750
<v Speaker 5>He says ball out of it.</v>

3075
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:36.081
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3076
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:38.000
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people getting fucking uptight.</v>

3077
01:26:38.001 --> 01:26:38.271
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3078
01:26:38.271 --> 01:26:40.730
<v Speaker 5>you think about the pressure involved and being in the Olympics,</v>

3079
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:44.870
<v Speaker 5>you represent your whole country and flying through the air</v>

3080
01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:51.590
<v Speaker 5>and just trying to land perfect and that all your life has been built up for</v>

3081
01:26:51.591 --> 01:26:55.130
<v Speaker 5>this moment to practice all for this one moment,</v>

3082
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:57.530
<v Speaker 5>just hurling yourself to the air flipping</v>

3083
01:26:59.200 --> 01:26:59.960
<v Speaker 5>fucking feeling.</v>

3084
01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:00.711
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna be insane.</v>

3085
01:27:00.711 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be a great feeling to what?</v>

3086
01:27:02.271 --> 01:27:03.104
<v Speaker 5>A battle.</v>

3087
01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:05.870
<v Speaker 5>It just got to be a great feeling to just be able to go to the Olympics.</v>

3088
01:27:05.871 --> 01:27:06.590
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

3089
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:07.910
<v Speaker 5>And just to win a silver,</v>

3090
01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:08.960
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck you do.</v>

3091
01:27:08.961 --> 01:27:12.350
<v Speaker 5>You think you could drop Michael Phelps off in the middle of the ocean and he</v>

3092
01:27:12.351 --> 01:27:13.670
<v Speaker 5>would find a way to get to the shore?</v>

3093
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:14.533
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3094
01:27:14.650 --> 01:27:15.080

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.640
<v Speaker 5>how long do you think it would take that guy to drown?</v>

3096
01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:18.853
<v Speaker 5>Three days.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Seven days I think.</v>

3099
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:22.400
<v Speaker 5>I think you could do two days.</v>

3100
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:23.540
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3101
01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.341

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:32.661
<v Speaker 5>he was swimming the pool.</v>

3109
01:27:32.661 --> 01:27:33.690
<v Speaker 5>When you imagine,</v>

3110
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:35.120
<v Speaker 5>imagine if you get dropped off.</v>

3111
01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:35.690
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3112
01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:40.690
<v Speaker 5>To your right in one mile is an island to your left in 2000 miles is the shore.</v>

3113
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:43.880
<v Speaker 5>And where do you go?</v>

3114
01:27:44.210 --> 01:27:44.781
<v Speaker 5>Do you go left?</v>

3115
01:27:44.781 --> 01:27:45.510
<v Speaker 5>You go right?</v>

3116
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:46.343
<v Speaker 5>You imagine,</v>

3117
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:47.000
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

3118
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:47.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't know which way to go.</v>

3119
01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.100
<v Speaker 5>But you don't know where the island is.</v>

3120
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:50.690
<v Speaker 5>You don't know you're in the middle.</v>

3121
01:27:50.691 --> 01:27:51.231
<v Speaker 5>All you see,</v>

3122
01:27:51.231 --> 01:27:54.050
<v Speaker 5>you could get in a spot in the water where all you see is water.</v>

3123
01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:54.913
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3124
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:58.370
<v Speaker 5>And could you imagine that decision go left or go right?</v>

3125
01:27:58.460 --> 01:27:59.540
<v Speaker 5>How do you trust your instincts?</v>

3126
01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:02.870
<v Speaker 5>How do you not second guess yourself to tune yourself into true north?</v>

3127
01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.170
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what the fucking land,</v>

3128
01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:05.810
<v Speaker 5>think about those fucking Cuban's Bro.</v>

3129

<v Speaker 5>The tide is high.</v>

3142
01:28:25.810 --> 01:28:28.840
<v Speaker 5>There's not a blondie song when the tide is,</v>

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.850
<v Speaker 5>I gotta tell you that's one of the roughest waters.</v>

3151
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the coldest water.</v>

3152
01:28:51.370 --> 01:28:52.940
<v Speaker 5>What are the most shocking fest awards?</v>

3153
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:55.850
<v Speaker 5>You can be in a pool and it's 60 degrees,</v>

3154
01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:56.451
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

<v Speaker 5>oh shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't know how cold the ocean is dirty.</v>

3158
01:29:00.651 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's cold as fuck</v>

3159
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.750
<v Speaker 2>and the whole nine 30 but then it would be ice.</v>

3160

<v Speaker 2>But I know that I fucking making slows down.</v>

3161
01:29:06.130 --> 01:29:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3162
01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:08.880
<v Speaker 2>it does something to your joints and to your,</v>

3163
01:29:08.881 --> 01:29:09.980
<v Speaker 2>to your muscles contract.</v>

3166
01:29:13.571 --> 01:29:15.160
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to breathe.</v>

3167
01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:15.941
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3187
01:29:54.941 --> 01:29:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else had to go up for your hair and go back down,</v>

3216
01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:35.951
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3217
01:30:35.951 --> 01:30:36.501
<v Speaker 2>go on the pool.</v>

3218
01:30:36.501 --> 01:30:36.791
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3219
01:30:36.791 --> 01:30:37.624
<v Speaker 2>you're a genius.</v>

3220
01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:38.810
<v Speaker 2>The pool's not.</v>

3221
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:40.810
<v Speaker 2>So I would go early and going to training pool,</v>

3222
01:30:40.811 --> 01:30:42.010
<v Speaker 2>which is 90 degrees,</v>

3223
01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:42.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3224
01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:43.181
<v Speaker 2>The water,</v>

3225
01:30:43.181 --> 01:30:44.020
<v Speaker 2>you're in the water.</v>

3226
01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:44.471
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3227
01:30:44.471 --> 01:30:46.660
<v Speaker 2>you get when you go and maybe be why you got to look at you.</v>

3228
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:48.280
<v Speaker 2>You're doing back shit.</v>

3229
01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:49.710
<v Speaker 2>You're flipping up the water.</v>

3230
01:30:49.730 --> 01:30:51.100
<v Speaker 2>You're like fucking splash,</v>

3231
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:52.390
<v Speaker 2>your throwing side kicks.</v>

3232
01:30:52.391 --> 01:30:54.040
<v Speaker 2>You're throwing punches like Muhammad Ali.</v>

3233
01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:56.380
<v Speaker 2>But one day I went and it was fucking,</v>

3234
01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:56.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3235
01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:57.713
<v Speaker 2>the afternoon.</v>

3236
01:30:58.150 --> 01:30:59.740
<v Speaker 2>So I had to go into the Olympic Pool.</v>

3237
01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:01.210
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go sign your name.</v>

3238
01:31:01.211 --> 01:31:01.591
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

3239
01:31:01.591 --> 01:31:01.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3240
01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been swimming for two weeks.</v>

3241
01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:04.900
<v Speaker 2>You know I could do this.</v>

3242
01:31:04.930 --> 01:31:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I got this.</v>

3243
01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:06.280
<v Speaker 2>That's what I went,</v>

3244
01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:06.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3245
01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I had swam in Boulder,</v>

3246
01:31:07.731 --> 01:31:08.880
<v Speaker 2>the masters from program,</v>

3247
01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:12.190
<v Speaker 2>so actually just could took a couple of weeks to get the the ship back to you.</v>

3248
01:31:12.191 --> 01:31:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know Bro.</v>

3249
01:31:13.450 --> 01:31:17.530
<v Speaker 2>I signed up and I jumped in the middle lane at the YMC Andy Olympic Pool.</v>

3250
01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:19.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3251
01:31:19.230 --> 01:31:21.900
<v Speaker 2>That water's like fucking 42 or whatever it is.</v>

3252
01:31:21.901 --> 01:31:23.220
<v Speaker 2>As soon as I hit Joe Rogan,</v>

3253
01:31:23.221 --> 01:31:26.240
<v Speaker 2>everything just froze and my fat little legs were moving.</v>

3254
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:27.721
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't moving.</v>

3255
01:31:27.721 --> 01:31:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I was just spinning around in circles because I think once the water gets cold,</v>

3256
01:31:31.411 --> 01:31:33.030
<v Speaker 2>it's even harder to maneuver in that.</v>

3257
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:33.893
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3258
01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.610
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't done it in a lot.</v>

3259
01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Listening.</v>

3260
01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Your body freezes up.</v>

3261
01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:38.381
<v Speaker 2>Listen Bro,</v>

3262
01:31:38.381 --> 01:31:38.941
<v Speaker 2>I'm Baldwin.</v>

3263
01:31:38.941 --> 01:31:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm the witness to this and bolden.</v>

3264
01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:42.270
<v Speaker 2>She does that class outside year round.</v>

3265
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:45.270
<v Speaker 2>What class a masters from a program has done outside.</v>

3266
01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:46.021
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

3267
01:31:46.021 --> 01:31:47.760
<v Speaker 2>So when you get there on your bicycle,</v>

3268
01:31:48.150 --> 01:31:48.983

3269
01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:51.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3270
01:31:51.670 --> 01:31:53.530
<v Speaker 2>So you run from the front.</v>

3271
01:31:53.531 --> 01:31:54.790
<v Speaker 2>So that's the pools outside.</v>

3272
01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I still got a change in the side of bolden.</v>

3273
01:31:56.690 --> 01:31:57.040

3275
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:04.000

3279
01:32:13.091 --> 01:32:14.380
<v Speaker 2>The pool's not that either.</v>

3280
01:32:14.381 --> 01:32:15.214
<v Speaker 2>Not Jacuzzi.</v>

3281
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:16.270

3284
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:18.881
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3285
01:32:18.881 --> 01:32:20.120
<v Speaker 2>Even if the water is heated,</v>

3286
01:32:20.121 --> 01:32:20.450
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>

3287
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:21.250
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking,</v>

3288
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:22.390
<v Speaker 2>when your head gets wet,</v>

3289
01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.270
<v Speaker 2>pop your head out and it's 10 degrees outside.</v>

3290
01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Even if the water is 90 degrees,</v>

3291
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.420
<v Speaker 2>it's still sucks.</v>

3292
01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't see that fucking steam coming off that water.</v>

3293
01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.090
<v Speaker 2>But I jumped into this.</v>

3294
01:32:31.091 --> 01:32:31.381
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3295
01:32:31.381 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 2>And I go into the middle and I'm trying to get out of that.</v>

3296
01:32:33.670 --> 01:32:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Joan is these two Mexican kids like Mr,</v>

01:32:36.221 --> 01:32:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3299
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:37.343
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah.</v>

3300
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:39.610
<v Speaker 2>So I tried to pull me out and they can't pull me out.</v>

3301
01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:40.481
<v Speaker 2>So they go,</v>

3302
01:32:40.481 --> 01:32:41.021
<v Speaker 2>we'll get you,</v>

3303

<v Speaker 2>we'll save you.</v>

3304
01:32:41.591 --> 01:32:43.220
<v Speaker 2>And they go and Austin and they brought her hoisting.</v>

3305
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:46.060
<v Speaker 2>So a whole waste is what they put in the middle of the thing.</v>

3306
01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And they wanted me to swim back into the middle.</v>

3307
01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna go in there with my fat little Orca body and they were going to pull</v>

3308
01:32:50.861 --> 01:32:52.060
<v Speaker 2>me out like they pulled Orca.</v>

3309
01:32:52.061 --> 01:32:52.691
<v Speaker 2>That's a hoist.</v>

3310
01:32:52.691 --> 01:32:52.871
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3311
01:32:52.871 --> 01:32:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3312
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:53.951
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3313
01:32:53.951 --> 01:32:54.191
<v Speaker 2>Dawg,</v>

3314
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm drowning here.</v>

3315
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I can't go back to the middle.</v>

3316
01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.030
<v Speaker 2>And then also they press,</v>

3317
01:32:58.040 --> 01:32:59.140
<v Speaker 2>they call the ambulance.</v>

3318
01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:00.640
<v Speaker 2>So the ambulance came,</v>

3319
01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:01.550
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't sign.</v>

3320
01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I ain't paying the 1800 I ran out of that before I,</v>

3321
01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:07.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy I got the fuck out of there before the ambulance came,</v>

3322
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:09.070
<v Speaker 2>as they were coming in with the thing,</v>

3323
01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I was walking out.</v>

3326
01:33:13.511 --> 01:33:14.710
<v Speaker 2>I was so fucking embarrassed.</v>

3327
01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to drowned at the Hollywood.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to really fucking meet them.</v>

3345
01:33:40.001 --> 01:33:40.270

<v Speaker 2>And that a lot more water.</v>

3355
01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:54.850
<v Speaker 2>This is what you got to get in your head to water.</v>

3356
01:33:54.851 --> 01:33:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Tastes fucking good.</v>

3357
01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Water tastes good.</v>

3358
01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:57.393
<v Speaker 2>It tastes good.</v>

3359
01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:57.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3360
01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.300
<v Speaker 2>it's not like cold calling.</v>

3361
01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Eat a soda.</v>

3362
01:34:00.281 --> 01:34:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes warranty is better than soda.</v>

3363
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Like he just in your head,</v>

3364
01:34:04.031 --> 01:34:04.571
<v Speaker 2>the sodas,</v>

3365
01:34:04.571 --> 01:34:05.500
<v Speaker 2>like the naughty thing,</v>

3366
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:06.610
<v Speaker 2>but a meatball sandwich.</v>

3367
01:34:06.611 --> 01:34:07.610
<v Speaker 2>You got to get a beer with him.</v>

3368
01:34:07.930 --> 01:34:08.561
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3369
01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Like if we're going to get a sausage sandwich right now,</v>

3370
01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:11.493
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get out.</v>

3371
01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:12.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3372
01:34:12.311 --> 01:34:16.000
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things that you gotta get a cocktail with or a,</v>

3373
01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.480
<v Speaker 2>a fucking something water doesn't taste good with something,</v>

3374
01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:20.920
<v Speaker 2>has no taste too well.</v>

3375
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:22.870
<v Speaker 2>When you're talking about for enjoyment.</v>

3376
01:34:22.871 --> 01:34:23.501
<v Speaker 2>For food.</v>

3377
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3378
01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:24.671
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3379
01:34:24.671 --> 01:34:26.950
<v Speaker 2>But like as far as like a clean taste,</v>

3380
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:29.350
<v Speaker 2>if water was rare and you know,</v>

3381
01:34:29.351 --> 01:34:33.250
<v Speaker 2>and and may very well be some day and may very well be some day that our gen in</v>

3382
01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:34.210
<v Speaker 2>our future generations,</v>

3383
01:34:34.211 --> 01:34:36.940
<v Speaker 2>we fucked up so bad that water becomes like valuable.</v>

3384
01:34:36.941 --> 01:34:38.740
<v Speaker 2>I looked up you could only drink soda.</v>

3385
01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:40.090
<v Speaker 2>I did look up what you told me.</v>

3386
01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:43.360
<v Speaker 2>We were in trouble as far as why they leasing up these rivers,</v>

3387
01:34:43.361 --> 01:34:44.194
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

3388
01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:46.150
<v Speaker 2>We discussed it for water.</v>

3389
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Water.</v>

3390
01:34:47.170 --> 01:34:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I think they leased out,</v>

3391
01:34:48.171 --> 01:34:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many fucking rivers in 2000 for bottled waters.</v>

3392
01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:52.613
<v Speaker 2>Bottled water.</v>

3393
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:52.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3394
01:34:52.991 --> 01:34:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Well it's so funny if you think about water because you know,</v>

3395
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 2>water new water hasn't</v>

3396
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.960
<v Speaker 4>been made for millions of years.</v>

3397
01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3398
01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:00.831
<v Speaker 4>So like we're,</v>

3399
01:35:00.831 --> 01:35:01.581
<v Speaker 4>we're fucking,</v>

3400
01:35:01.581 --> 01:35:01.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3401
01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:05.510
<v Speaker 4>drinking water that Jesus pooped out at one point.</v>

3402
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:06.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3403
01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:09.530
<v Speaker 4>the water just gets recycled and recycled and stuff like that.</v>

3404
01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.460
<v Speaker 4>It actually comes here and it goes towards to comes here and comets.</v>

3405
01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:13.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3406
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:15.800
<v Speaker 4>When you see a comment flying across the Scott at trail,</v>

3407
01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:16.431
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

3408
01:35:16.431 --> 01:35:17.420
<v Speaker 4>that's a melting ice.</v>

3409
01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:18.530
<v Speaker 4>That's what that is.</v>

3410
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:22.310
<v Speaker 4>So we get really small amounts of water from the earth,</v>

3411
01:35:22.311 --> 01:35:23.420
<v Speaker 4>from the earth was born.</v>

3412
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.950
<v Speaker 4>We had been hit by you know,</v>

3413
01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:26.421
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

3414
01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:29.180
<v Speaker 4>many different asteroids and many bodies from outer space,</v>

3415
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:32.420
<v Speaker 4>but very likely you've been hit by giant slabs of ice from outer space.</v>

3416
01:35:32.421 --> 01:35:36.980
<v Speaker 4>And that the water that we have on this earth comes from other planets and that</v>

3417
01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:42.040
<v Speaker 4>every thing in this world is extra terrestrial because the whole,</v>

3418
01:35:42.230 --> 01:35:43.280
<v Speaker 4>the whole planet,</v>

3419
01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:47.750
<v Speaker 4>it's been created by things that have come from other planets that have been</v>

3420
01:35:47.751 --> 01:35:48.584
<v Speaker 4>sucked into it.</v>

3421
01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:49.610
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>

3422
01:35:49.670 --> 01:35:50.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3423
01:35:50.031 --> 01:35:52.400
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like there was a thing and it was the earth,</v>

3424
01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.120
<v Speaker 4>the thing,</v>

3425
01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.890
<v Speaker 4>the earth was nailed by asteroids.</v>

3426
01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.740
<v Speaker 4>The moon was created because it was hit by another planet.</v>

3427
01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:01.550
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of shit has hit it and comments have hit the earth apparently and</v>

3428
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:04.130
<v Speaker 4>dropped water and that's like where all the water comes from.</v>

3429
01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:04.521
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3430
01:36:04.521 --> 01:36:08.840
<v Speaker 4>But isn't it like on fire when it's entering the earth too big?</v>

3431
01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:12.680
<v Speaker 4>You know you're talking about a piece of ice that's who knows how many fucking</v>

3432
01:36:12.681 --> 01:36:17.681
<v Speaker 4>miles wide and it actually survives reentry and try to wrap your head around</v>

3433
01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:18.980
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3434
01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:22.460
<v Speaker 4>Try to have wrap your head around a piece of ice that can survive reentry.</v>

3435
01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:23.450
<v Speaker 4>How big does that have to be?</v>

3436
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:25.760
<v Speaker 4>This guy is old and you live in boulder,</v>

3437
01:36:25.761 --> 01:36:26.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3438
01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:26.870
<v Speaker 4>do all that.</v>

3439
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:27.111
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3440
01:36:27.111 --> 01:36:28.600
<v Speaker 4>you smoke dope and he'd go to old.</v>

3441
01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:30.350
<v Speaker 4>A lot of hippie things.</v>

3442
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:31.341
<v Speaker 4>Let me just say one thing.</v>

3443
01:36:31.341 --> 01:36:32.500
<v Speaker 4>It might not survive the entry.</v>

3444
01:36:32.501 --> 01:36:33.640
<v Speaker 4>You might get burned up in the atmosphere.</v>

3445
01:36:33.670 --> 01:36:34.503
<v Speaker 4>It comes storms.</v>

3446
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:35.330
<v Speaker 4>The fuck knows.</v>

3447
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:37.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many of them actually do land,</v>

3448
01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:39.290
<v Speaker 4>but I do know that the water that we have is from other,</v>

3449
01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.320
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it they believe is from like a pence barrier.</v>

3450
01:36:42.321 --> 01:36:43.430
<v Speaker 4>The idea that comes from asteroids,</v>

3451
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:48.490
<v Speaker 4>so you can almost say that our waters could be being like ingredients added to</v>

3452
01:36:49.671 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 4>it from aliens.</v>

3453
01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.193
<v Speaker 4>You could be,</v>

3454
01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:53.451
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have water,</v>

3455
01:36:53.451 --> 01:36:54.284
<v Speaker 4>did come here,</v>

3456
01:36:54.650 --> 01:36:55.041
<v Speaker 4>come here.</v>

3457
01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:57.200
<v Speaker 4>It could have had biological entities frozen side of it,</v>

3458
01:36:57.201 --> 01:37:01.220
<v Speaker 4>so that's how they give us the firmware upgrades is from fucking comment water.</v>

3459
01:37:01.221 --> 01:37:01.521
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

3460
01:37:01.521 --> 01:37:01.851
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3461
01:37:01.851 --> 01:37:02.280
<v Speaker 4>we're going to,</v>

3462
01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:02.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3463
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:03.440
<v Speaker 4>well that could be that.</v>

3464
01:37:03.441 --> 01:37:04.670
<v Speaker 4>That's what asteroids are.</v>

3465
01:37:04.671 --> 01:37:06.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like the reset button software updates.</v>

3466
01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:07.820
<v Speaker 4>It says reset button.</v>

3467
01:37:07.821 --> 01:37:09.530
<v Speaker 4>Let's why they had to get rid of the dinosaurs.</v>

3468
01:37:09.531 --> 01:37:10.400
<v Speaker 4>They got too crazy.</v>

3469
01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.380
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe the dinosaurs would be like a good idea.</v>

3470
01:37:12.381 --> 01:37:13.250
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like tigers.</v>

3471
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:15.700
<v Speaker 4>We've kind of keep control of them but still maintain some sort of a</v>

3472
01:37:15.701 --> 01:37:16.534
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>

3473
01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.860
<v Speaker 4>But t rex just got way too fucking big,</v>

3474
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:19.820
<v Speaker 4>you know this giant,</v>

3475
01:37:19.821 --> 01:37:20.660
<v Speaker 4>huge lizard.</v>

3476
01:37:20.661 --> 01:37:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Just run it through villages eating people.</v>

3477
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:24.110
<v Speaker 4>So they had to just Jack Amal,</v>

3478
01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:25.040
<v Speaker 4>start fresh,</v>

3479
01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:27.110
<v Speaker 4>boom media impact.</v>

3480
01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:29.540
<v Speaker 4>One of those geniuses and bold.</v>

3481
01:37:29.541 --> 01:37:31.790
<v Speaker 4>I took a course from time and evolution,</v>

3482
01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.040
<v Speaker 4>just some shitty three critic thing.</v>

3483
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.500
<v Speaker 4>This guy was saying that the world was a lot fucking bigger and circumference</v>

3484
01:37:39.501 --> 01:37:40.334
<v Speaker 4>diameter,</v>

3485
01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:42.380
<v Speaker 4>but over the years before,</v>

3486
01:37:42.381 --> 01:37:44.090
<v Speaker 4>well you were saying all the hits,</v>

3487
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:45.710
<v Speaker 4>it's gotten down.</v>

3488
01:37:46.130 --> 01:37:47.350
<v Speaker 4>Really it gets smaller.</v>

3489
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.440
<v Speaker 4>That's what he was feeling.</v>

3490
01:37:48.441 --> 01:37:50.150
<v Speaker 4>That's what his theory was.</v>

3491
01:37:50.151 --> 01:37:50.751
<v Speaker 4>That theory,</v>

3492
01:37:50.751 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3493
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:52.190
<v Speaker 4>This is 20 years ago,</v>

3494
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:53.803
<v Speaker 4>but he was saying,</v>

3495
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.651
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>

3496
01:37:54.651 --> 01:37:55.210
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3497
01:37:55.210 --> 01:37:56.250
<v Speaker 4>these were the bottom.</v>

3498
01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:56.791
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3499
01:37:56.791 --> 01:37:57.950
<v Speaker 3>even when we walk around and,</v>

3500
01:37:58.040 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 3>and all those mountains where the bottom of that,</v>

3501
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 3>that was bigger at one time.</v>

3502
01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3503
01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:02.500
<v Speaker 3>We feel,</v>

3504
01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3505
01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.421
<v Speaker 3>these people,</v>

3506
01:38:03.421 --> 01:38:05.010
<v Speaker 3>whatever felt that it was big.</v>

3507
01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.980
<v Speaker 3>We just been getting it for the last million years.</v>

3508
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:09.061
<v Speaker 3>It's really creepy.</v>

3509
01:38:09.061 --> 01:38:10.080
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at the moon,</v>

3510
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.000
<v Speaker 3>because the moon doesn't have anything up there,</v>

3511
01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:13.830
<v Speaker 3>it's just this one surface color,</v>

3512
01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:14.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3513
01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't vary that much.</v>

3514
01:38:15.271 --> 01:38:16.051
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at it,</v>

3515
01:38:16.051 --> 01:38:18.840
<v Speaker 3>all you're seeing is she's fucking craters.</v>

3516
01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:20.160
<v Speaker 3>There's no atmosphere.</v>

3517
01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:21.240
<v Speaker 3>So they don't get burnt up.</v>

3518
01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:22.074
<v Speaker 3>They just hit it.</v>

3519
01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.340
<v Speaker 3>So you just see doom,</v>

3520
01:38:23.341 --> 01:38:23.791
<v Speaker 3>doom,</v>

3521
01:38:23.791 --> 01:38:24.511
<v Speaker 3>doom everywhere.</v>

3522
01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:26.330
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing's just pockmark like,</v>

3523
01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:30.510
<v Speaker 3>like that dude's face from was such as names almost.</v>

3524
01:38:30.511 --> 01:38:31.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy.</v>

3525
01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:32.163
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3526
01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:32.551
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3527
01:38:32.551 --> 01:38:33.384
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

3528
01:38:34.150 --> 01:38:34.983
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

3529
01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.290
<v Speaker 3>if that,</v>

3530
01:38:37.290 --> 01:38:39.180
<v Speaker 3>that's how many are coming at us.</v>

3531
01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.310
<v Speaker 3>All those holes that are on the moon,</v>

3532
01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:42.990
<v Speaker 3>if that's how many things are coming at us.</v>

3533
01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Some of those are big,</v>

3534
01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.120
<v Speaker 3>but there's some really big craters was the last time we got,</v>

3535
01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:47.911
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3536
01:38:47.911 --> 01:38:50.100
<v Speaker 3>but speculation has been,</v>

3537
01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:50.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3538
01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:50.970
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

3539
01:38:50.970 --> 01:38:55.970
<v Speaker 3>most recent big one they think was about somewhere around 12,000 years ago,</v>

3540
01:38:56.670 --> 01:39:00.810
<v Speaker 3>10 to 12,000 years ago because they found all of this.</v>

3541
01:39:00.811 --> 01:39:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3542
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:05.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a type of molten rock that occurs during nuclear tests,</v>

3543
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3544
01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.240
<v Speaker 3>and it also occurs during meteor impacts and they found it all over the world at</v>

3545
01:39:12.031 --> 01:39:14.190
<v Speaker 3>this same core level.</v>

3546
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3547
01:39:14.530 --> 01:39:19.500
<v Speaker 3>when they do call a soil samples and then they go down to between 10 and 12,000</v>

3548
01:39:19.501 --> 01:39:19.711
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

3549
01:39:19.711 --> 01:39:21.210
<v Speaker 3>I believe it is somewhere in that range.</v>

3550
01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.490
<v Speaker 3>That's where they keep finding it all over the earth.</v>

3551
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:24.930
<v Speaker 3>And that's also,</v>

3552
01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:25.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3553
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:30.570
<v Speaker 3>significantly when the end of the ice age sort of is like if you,</v>

3554
01:39:30.571 --> 01:39:33.030
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of coinciding with the same time,</v>

3555
01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:33.301
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3556
01:39:33.301 --> 01:39:33.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3557
01:39:33.670 --> 01:39:34.800
<v Speaker 3>10,000 years ago,</v>

3558
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3559
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.540
<v Speaker 3>that's when people were,</v>

3560
01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:36.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3561
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.430
<v Speaker 3>making their way across here from,</v>

3562
01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:38.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3563
01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:40.020
<v Speaker 3>from Russia on the Bering Strait.</v>

3564
01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's when there's the,</v>

3565
01:39:41.011 --> 01:39:41.250
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3566
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:46.170
<v Speaker 3>the whole ice age of a 10,000 years ago ended abruptly and a lot of animals died</v>

3567
01:39:46.171 --> 01:39:47.190
<v Speaker 3>in mass extinction.</v>

3568
01:39:47.191 --> 01:39:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Events like woolly mammoths,</v>

3569
01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:51.180
<v Speaker 3>saber tooth tigers died in mass graves.</v>

3570
01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:54.720
<v Speaker 3>And the speculation is that was the last big meteor shower and that somewhere</v>

3571
01:39:54.721 --> 01:39:56.310
<v Speaker 3>around 10 to 12,000 years ago,</v>

3572
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:57.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3573
01:39:57.330 --> 01:40:00.540
<v Speaker 3>most of the civilization got fucked sideways all over again.</v>

3574
01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:02.220
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people start all over again.</v>

3575
01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:03.630
<v Speaker 3>And that explains a lot of things.</v>

3576
01:40:03.631 --> 01:40:07.530
<v Speaker 3>It explains a lot of ancient buildings that nobody knows how the fuck they built</v>

3577
01:40:07.531 --> 01:40:08.160
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3578
01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:08.993
<v Speaker 3>It's most,</v>

3579
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.760
<v Speaker 3>most likely that we had went on a,</v>

3580
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:15.300
<v Speaker 3>we had gotten a very high level of sophistication.</v>

3581
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:16.020
<v Speaker 3>I say we,</v>

3582
01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:18.720
<v Speaker 3>they the people in a bunch of different shit,</v>

3583
01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:20.130
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

3584
01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:22.830
<v Speaker 3>we went in a totally different path once we rebuilt.</v>

3585
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:24.340
<v Speaker 3>And then our path when we,</v>

3586
01:40:24.341 --> 01:40:27.810
<v Speaker 3>when we rebuilt was a little bit more lost and became more technological in</v>

3587
01:40:27.811 --> 01:40:28.500
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>

3588
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.600
<v Speaker 3>But you can't deny the shit that they built.</v>

3589
01:40:30.630 --> 01:40:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Just this to stuff they built in in Greece.</v>

3590
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:33.091
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3591
01:40:33.091 --> 01:40:35.360
<v Speaker 3>just really look at the crop lips and the Parthenon.</v>

3592
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:38.370
<v Speaker 3>You think these motherfuckers built that shit thousands and thousands of years</v>

3593
01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:42.060
<v Speaker 3>ago on top of some shit that was from thousands of years before that.</v>

3594
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 3>It might've been a super advanced culture.</v>

3595
01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:44.971
<v Speaker 3>You've got fucked up.</v>

3596
01:40:44.971 --> 01:40:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I immediately,</v>

3597
01:40:45.450 --> 01:40:46.470
<v Speaker 3>cause I get a little fucked up,</v>

3598
01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:48.600
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff that they have in Greece now.</v>

3599
01:40:49.130 --> 01:40:50.880
<v Speaker 3>Was this also part of Greek mythology?</v>

3600
01:40:50.881 --> 01:40:51.714
<v Speaker 3>Like Medusa?</v>

3601
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Like why watch the clash of the,</v>

3602
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm just asking you</v>

3603
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.580
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

3604
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.690
<v Speaker 4>when the fuck was clad,</v>

3605
01:40:55.691 --> 01:40:56.351
<v Speaker 4>not to the ship,</v>

3606
01:40:56.351 --> 01:40:58.750
<v Speaker 4>they came out with the original with Mark Hamill,</v>

3607
01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:01.630
<v Speaker 4>whatever that ball fuck his name is the original plan.</v>

3608
01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:06.250
<v Speaker 4>I think if I had to guess with the Greek gods were all about,</v>

3609
01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:09.100
<v Speaker 4>I would have to guess you have to have,</v>

3610
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:09.821
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3611
01:41:09.821 --> 01:41:13.780
<v Speaker 4>some sort of an explanation for storms and you know,</v>

3612
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:17.380
<v Speaker 4>we don't have to deal with too much fucking weather here in Sunny California and</v>

3613
01:41:17.381 --> 01:41:19.090
<v Speaker 4>we were getting pretty soft because of that.</v>

3614
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:22.600
<v Speaker 4>But if you live on the east coast and you've been anywhere near Hurricane,</v>

3615
01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:26.470
<v Speaker 4>you know how God damn terrifying mother nature can be.</v>

3616
01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.480
<v Speaker 4>And if you're living in Greece,</v>

3617
01:41:28.481 --> 01:41:28.721
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3618
01:41:28.721 --> 01:41:30.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming they get some sort of storms.</v>

3619
01:41:30.701 --> 01:41:34.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming that they're leaders would have to have some sort of an explanation</v>

3620
01:41:34.031 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 4>of what the fuck is going on.</v>

3621
01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.080
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's a form of expression in the and creativity.</v>

3622
01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:42.040
<v Speaker 4>They figured out a way to create Thor and Zeus and create this whole myth</v>

3623
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:43.360
<v Speaker 4>mythology behind it.</v>

3624
01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:45.520
<v Speaker 4>And it was probably just a calm,</v>

3625
01:41:45.521 --> 01:41:47.770
<v Speaker 4>everybody the fuck now and keep everybody together.</v>

3626
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:50.320
<v Speaker 4>They probably had to have some sort of an explanation.</v>

3627
01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:51.280
<v Speaker 4>What is the lightning,</v>

3628
01:41:51.281 --> 01:41:52.120
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>

3629
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:53.343
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3630
01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:54.700
<v Speaker 4>it's a guy named Thor.</v>

3631
01:41:54.701 --> 01:41:55.720
<v Speaker 4>He's the god of thunder.</v>

3632
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.500
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3633
01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:59.410
<v Speaker 4>He's up there and he's shooting lightning bolts down.</v>

3634
01:41:59.411 --> 01:42:02.200
<v Speaker 4>He's actually in a fight with his brother who's a dick.</v>

3635
01:42:02.201 --> 01:42:03.580
<v Speaker 4>His brother's name is Loci.</v>

3636
01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:06.400
<v Speaker 4>LOCI wants to run shit and he's an asshole.</v>

3637
01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:06.630
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

3638
01:42:06.630 --> 01:42:07.820
<v Speaker 4>so what about gladiator?</v>

3639
01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:08.580
<v Speaker 4>And then there's move.</v>

3640
01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:09.850
<v Speaker 4>That shit wasn't that one.</v>

3641
01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:13.120
<v Speaker 4>Zoosh was around Odin and then there's Odin gladiator.</v>

3642
01:42:13.121 --> 01:42:13.481
<v Speaker 4>Was that one?</v>

3643
01:42:13.481 --> 01:42:14.314
<v Speaker 4>Zeus is around,</v>

3644
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:19.580
<v Speaker 4>not even the same gotry that's role there was as the Roman gladiators.</v>

3645
01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:22.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3646
01:42:22.391 --> 01:42:23.021
<v Speaker 4>What's his face?</v>

3647
01:42:23.021 --> 01:42:23.854
<v Speaker 4>The actor.</v>

3648
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:25.660
<v Speaker 4>So he was his last great movie,</v>

3649
01:42:25.661 --> 01:42:26.494
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3650
01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.080
<v Speaker 4>That was the best one he ever did.</v>

3651
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:29.240
<v Speaker 4>That was the best.</v>

3652
01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.073
<v Speaker 4>That was iconic.</v>

3653
01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:31.001
<v Speaker 4>That's like a,</v>

3654
01:42:31.001 --> 01:42:32.510
<v Speaker 4>that puts him in list of all,</v>

3655
01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.311
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is his name?</v>

3656
01:42:33.311 --> 01:42:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Russell Crowe.</v>

3657
01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:35.440
<v Speaker 4>That puts him in the list of all time.</v>

3658
01:42:35.441 --> 01:42:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Greatest movie stars is a handful of five or 10 dudes.</v>

3659
01:42:38.411 --> 01:42:39.100
<v Speaker 4>He's right in there.</v>

3660

3668
01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:52.870
<v Speaker 4>He's one of those few dudes,</v>

3669
01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:53.840
<v Speaker 4>those few dudes at Chameleon.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But Chino plays the reporter from 60 minutes to hold.</v>

3676

01:43:09.911 --> 01:43:10.690
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to,</v>

3687
01:43:10.690 --> 01:43:11.710
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to find a good one.</v>

3688
01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:13.150
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to find them like that.</v>

3689
01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:14.013
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3694
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:29.800
<v Speaker 4>nobody even talks for the first like 15 minutes of that movie.</v>

3695
01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:31.940
<v Speaker 4>It's a bunch of shit happening where you watched them,</v>

3696
01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:33.250
<v Speaker 4>this guy live in his life.</v>

3697
01:43:33.610 --> 01:43:34.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's driving his car.</v>

3698
01:43:34.811 --> 01:43:35.650
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't say anything.</v>

3699
01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.150
<v Speaker 4>He goes to locker room.</v>

3700
01:43:37.151 --> 01:43:37.984
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't say anything.</v>

3701
01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:39.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like you're,</v>

3702
01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.750
<v Speaker 4>you're watching everything go out there.</v>

3703
01:43:40.751 --> 01:43:42.850
<v Speaker 4>It's telling you a story without a single word.</v>

3704
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:44.200
<v Speaker 4>It's really fascinating.</v>

3705
01:43:44.201 --> 01:43:49.201
<v Speaker 4>And I think if you're going to use the visual medium of movie IG,</v>

3706
01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 4>that is one of the coolest ways to tell a story because</v>

3707
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.400
<v Speaker 5>you don't,</v>

3708
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is the one thing that you cannot achieve in writing.</v>

3709
01:43:55.521 --> 01:43:55.701
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3710
01:43:55.701 --> 01:43:57.650
<v Speaker 5>if you say that it can never live up to the writing,</v>

3711
01:43:57.651 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 5>well well this is where we're showing you things with no dialogue whatsoever.</v>

3712
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:02.811
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3713
01:44:02.811 --> 01:44:03.644
<v Speaker 5>like painting.</v>

3714
01:44:03.730 --> 01:44:07.670
<v Speaker 5>That's what like one of the best ways you can create with a visual medium,</v>

3715
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3716
01:44:08.211 --> 01:44:09.460
<v Speaker 5>to not even use the word why,</v>

3717
01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:10.640
<v Speaker 5>show me some shit.</v>

3718
01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:13.520
<v Speaker 5>Bait me into this conversation because you know where it's going to go.</v>

3719
01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:14.150
<v Speaker 5>Where's it going to?</v>

3720
01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:16.640
<v Speaker 5>It's going to go back to the best movies one where they made,</v>

3721
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:17.181
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3722
01:44:17.181 --> 01:44:18.620
<v Speaker 5>if you watch her best songs,</v>

3723
01:44:18.621 --> 01:44:19.241
<v Speaker 5>when were they made?</v>

3724
01:44:19.241 --> 01:44:19.400
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3725
01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:21.470
<v Speaker 5>when they didn't really know what they were doing yet.</v>

3726
01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:23.510
<v Speaker 5>Lamont,</v>

3727
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:25.970
<v Speaker 5>if I put Lamont on for fucking red band,</v>

3728
01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:30.980
<v Speaker 5>red will throw me out of his house because red band is part of,</v>

3729
01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3730
01:44:32.210 --> 01:44:32.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3731
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:33.800

3732
01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:34.821
<v Speaker 5>like if you watch,</v>

3733
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 5>can you think from the 70s?</v>

3734
01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:37.020
<v Speaker 5>It's a tough luck.</v>

3735
01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:39.800
<v Speaker 5>The Godfather's easy.</v>

3736
01:44:39.801 --> 01:44:40.970
<v Speaker 5>The excesses is easy.</v>

3737
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:45.350
<v Speaker 5>But how best was won and they did not have Twitter attention span.</v>

3738
01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.540
<v Speaker 5>You have to understand.</v>

3739
01:44:47.541 --> 01:44:48.374
<v Speaker 5>So when we tell him,</v>

3740
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.681
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3741
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:49.550
<v Speaker 5>I watched your movie,</v>

01:44:49.551 --> 01:44:50.870

01:44:52.131 --> 01:44:53.510
<v Speaker 5>what a crazy fucking movie.</v>

3745
01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:54.531
<v Speaker 5>And it's still,</v>

3746
01:44:54.531 --> 01:44:55.880
<v Speaker 5>if you're with the wrong people in the room,</v>

3747
01:44:55.881 --> 01:44:56.241
<v Speaker 5>they're going to go,</v>

3748
01:44:56.241 --> 01:44:56.630
<v Speaker 5>Joey,</v>

3749
01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:57.351
<v Speaker 5>you got to change it.</v>

3750
01:44:57.351 --> 01:44:58.310
<v Speaker 5>Before I fucked him flawless.</v>

3751
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:59.183
<v Speaker 5>I learned that from him.</v>

3752
01:44:59.190 --> 01:45:00.230
<v Speaker 5>Anthony Bourdain too.</v>

3753
01:45:00.231 --> 01:45:02.420
<v Speaker 5>I was watching his show on Boston.</v>

3754
01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:03.670
<v Speaker 5>He did a show on Boston,</v>

3755
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:04.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3756
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:05.180
<v Speaker 5>grew up in Boston site.</v>

3757
01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.180
<v Speaker 5>I was excited by it.</v>

3758
01:45:06.490 --> 01:45:07.340
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty interesting.</v>

3759
01:45:07.341 --> 01:45:09.500
<v Speaker 5>He decided to hang out mostly in South Boston.</v>

3760
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:10.640
<v Speaker 5>Hung around and like,</v>

3761
01:45:10.641 --> 01:45:14.750
<v Speaker 5>like weird little places where you get lobster sandwiches and real boxing gyms</v>

3762
01:45:14.751 --> 01:45:15.201
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>

3763
01:45:15.201 --> 01:45:16.490
<v Speaker 5>But then he brought up that movie.</v>

3764
01:45:16.491 --> 01:45:17.330
<v Speaker 5>I had never heard of it.</v>

3765
01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:21.420
<v Speaker 5>Robert Mitchum movies from Moses from the 73 and this movie,</v>

3766
01:45:22.530 --> 01:45:24.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you want some ways a lot of character actors,</v>

3767
01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.210
<v Speaker 5>directors,</v>

3768
01:45:26.210 --> 01:45:27.290
<v Speaker 5>but those movies,</v>

3769
01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.080
<v Speaker 5>they're pieces of wood.</v>

3770
01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:32.720
<v Speaker 5>We discussed this with Charles Bronson comes up and he goes,</v>

3771
01:45:32.721 --> 01:45:34.220
<v Speaker 5>did you bring all ours for me?</v>

<v Speaker 5>you brought one to many.</v>

3778
01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:45.920
<v Speaker 5>One to that takes 15 fucking minutes.</v>

3779
01:45:45.921 --> 01:45:46.754
<v Speaker 5>That scene,</v>

3780
01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:51.590
<v Speaker 5>you will go Joey changes when he gets off the train to bell rings,</v>

3781
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:53.300
<v Speaker 5>the Crow Flies.</v>

3782
01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.040
<v Speaker 5>Three guys walk this way.</v>

3783
01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:56.840
<v Speaker 5>Three guys walk this way again.</v>

3784
01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.240
<v Speaker 5>If you want to go back to movie,</v>

3785
01:45:59.241 --> 01:46:00.890
<v Speaker 5>bad asses all time.</v>

3786
01:46:00.891 --> 01:46:01.551
<v Speaker 5>Great movie.</v>

3787
01:46:01.551 --> 01:46:02.390
<v Speaker 5>Bad asses.</v>

3788
01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:03.980
<v Speaker 5>In my opinion,</v>

3789
01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:05.990
<v Speaker 5>no one can fuck with Charles Bronson.</v>

3790
01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:07.880
<v Speaker 5>You can't fuck with Charles Bronson movie.</v>

3791
01:46:07.881 --> 01:46:08.540
<v Speaker 5>Bad asses.</v>

3792
01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:10.190
<v Speaker 5>Legitimate real movie,</v>

3793
01:46:10.191 --> 01:46:11.024
<v Speaker 5>bad asses.</v>

3794
01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:12.040
<v Speaker 5>You know as far as like,</v>

3795
01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.980
<v Speaker 5>like a guy who really believed I believed him in hard times.</v>

3796
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.880
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3797
01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:17.570
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3798
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:19.280
<v Speaker 5>I believe cleaning should a little bit,</v>

3799
01:46:19.281 --> 01:46:22.760
<v Speaker 5>but he did comedies like every which way but loose and when you do those,</v>

3800
01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:25.970
<v Speaker 5>there is a little something lost.</v>

3801
01:46:25.971 --> 01:46:27.830
<v Speaker 5>Charles Bronson never did a stupid comedy.</v>

3802
01:46:27.831 --> 01:46:28.760
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't that funny,</v>

3803
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.450
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3804
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:32.540
<v Speaker 5>But still Vaughn has Stallone had that one with his mother.</v>

3805
01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:33.463

01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:37.183
<v Speaker 5>What was the other one?</v>

3811
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:38.430
<v Speaker 5>What was the point where Russell,</v>

3812
01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:42.920
<v Speaker 5>he was a cop and it's one of the worst movies of all time.</v>

3813
01:46:42.921 --> 01:46:46.520
<v Speaker 5>The dialogue is so bad in that movie with him and Kurt Russell that people like</v>

3814
01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:47.540
<v Speaker 5>replay it.</v>

3815
01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Speaker 5>They do it as like theater art as a performance art cause the the lyrics or it'd</v>

3816
01:46:51.991 --> 01:46:52.201
<v Speaker 5>be the,</v>

3835
01:47:25.651 --> 01:47:28.120
<v Speaker 5>Fist was good to pull it out with a song.</v>

<v Speaker 5>What did you even just say?</v>

3876
01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:35.490
<v Speaker 5>Just go to fucking Sylvester Stallone and look at 1990 and see what movie came</v>

3877
01:48:35.491 --> 01:48:39.060
<v Speaker 5>out and you could see everything we're talking about what you put on my glasses.</v>

3878
01:48:39.090 --> 01:48:39.960
<v Speaker 5>I can't do this.</v>

3879
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:40.570
<v Speaker 5>I can't.</v>

3880
01:48:40.570 --> 01:48:43.860
<v Speaker 5>I want to know what this fucking movie is because you don't care enough to get</v>

3881
01:48:43.861 --> 01:48:44.341
<v Speaker 5>specific.</v>

3882
01:48:44.341 --> 01:48:46.950
<v Speaker 5>If you think that that movie you think is bad,</v>

3883
01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:49.140
<v Speaker 5>the one with karate with the kid,</v>

3884
01:48:49.141 --> 01:48:49.920
<v Speaker 5>the Bouncer,</v>

3885
01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.170
<v Speaker 5>you got watch road house.</v>

3886
01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:52.470
<v Speaker 5>This house is amazing.</v>

3887
01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.270
<v Speaker 5>This is a roadhouse is bad.</v>

3888
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:55.830
<v Speaker 5>This is not bad.</v>

3889
01:48:55.831 --> 01:48:57.000
<v Speaker 5>Roadhouse is so bad.</v>

3890
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.990
<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>

3891
01:48:57.990 --> 01:49:02.040
<v Speaker 5>That's why Roadhouse roadhouses my favorite hotel movie.</v>

3892
01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:04.950
<v Speaker 5>If I'm flipping through the channels out of respect,</v>

3893
01:49:04.951 --> 01:49:05.940
<v Speaker 5>if roadhouse comes on,</v>

3894
01:49:05.941 --> 01:49:06.774
<v Speaker 5>I keep it on.</v>

3895
01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:09.390
<v Speaker 5>If I'm just flipping to the challenge and any other movie comes on,</v>

3896
01:49:09.391 --> 01:49:09.691
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

3897
01:49:09.691 --> 01:49:10.860
<v Speaker 5>I'll see what else is on.</v>

3898
01:49:10.890 --> 01:49:12.240
<v Speaker 5>I'll keep changing much.</v>

3899
01:49:12.241 --> 01:49:12.601
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

3900
01:49:12.601 --> 01:49:17.601
<v Speaker 5>but that day is the worst movie that you leave on because it's so bad when he</v>

3901
01:49:18.001 --> 01:49:19.020
<v Speaker 5>takes the wire,</v>

3902
01:49:19.230 --> 01:49:21.630
<v Speaker 5>when he thinks the guy's intestines and he flies out the door.</v>

3903
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:22.021
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

3904
01:49:22.021 --> 01:49:22.860
<v Speaker 5>why would you watch that?</v>

3905
01:49:22.890 --> 01:49:26.940
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm high and I can't find the remote and the hotel room lock I like,</v>

3906
01:49:26.941 --> 01:49:28.320
<v Speaker 5>I like a lot of friends that are Mexican,</v>

3907
01:49:28.321 --> 01:49:30.820
<v Speaker 5>so I got a one 80 lockup lockup.</v>

3908
01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:31.733
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

3909
01:49:31.770 --> 01:49:34.770
<v Speaker 5>He works on the car and then the warden tells him,</v>

3910
01:49:34.771 --> 01:49:35.820
<v Speaker 5>if you fix the car,</v>

3911
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to shut your pro parole off.</v>

3912
01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.840
<v Speaker 5>So he has to beat up the award.</v>

3913
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.690
<v Speaker 5>It's like the longest because trust me,</v>

3914
01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:46.710
<v Speaker 5>I tried to watch the new Ari and I tried to watch the new Sherlock Holmes movie</v>

3915
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:47.771
<v Speaker 5>and we're like,</v>

3916
01:49:47.771 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 5>what</v>

3917
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.120
<v Speaker 1>the fuck is this?</v>

3918
01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.530
<v Speaker 1>What did they do?</v>

3919
01:49:50.531 --> 01:49:50.940
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

3920
01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:52.420
<v Speaker 1>They just put this together in a week.</v>

3921
01:49:52.450 --> 01:49:52.781
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3922
01:49:52.781 --> 01:49:53.400
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3923
01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.570
<v Speaker 1>it was like so clunky,</v>

3924
01:49:55.571 --> 01:49:57.220
<v Speaker 1>like the was clunky.</v>

3925
01:49:57.221 --> 01:50:02.221
<v Speaker 1>The dialogue was like these characters that that was cool.</v>

3926
01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:03.370
<v Speaker 1>If it was a book,</v>

3927
01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:04.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3928
01:50:04.001 --> 01:50:04.900
<v Speaker 1>back in the old days,</v>

3929
01:50:04.901 --> 01:50:05.531
<v Speaker 1>but now it's like,</v>

3930
01:50:05.531 --> 01:50:05.771
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3931
01:50:05.771 --> 01:50:07.130
<v Speaker 1>do you want to see what we need with hardy boy?</v>

3932
01:50:07.450 --> 01:50:08.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is,</v>

3933
01:50:08.321 --> 01:50:08.800
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3934
01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:09.451
<v Speaker 1>They fuck it.</v>

3935
01:50:09.451 --> 01:50:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a Guy Robert Downey jr?</v>

3936
01:50:11.231 --> 01:50:11.921
<v Speaker 1>They got it right.</v>

3937
01:50:11.921 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Speaker 1>The first one.</v>

3938
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought the first Sherlock Holmes movie was good,</v>

3939
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:14.951
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

3940
01:50:14.951 --> 01:50:16.120
<v Speaker 1>the latest one was like,</v>

3941
01:50:16.121 --> 01:50:17.260
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

3942
01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:18.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like a parody.</v>

3943
01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It was not good that that,</v>

3944
01:50:20.251 --> 01:50:24.420
<v Speaker 1>that new movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis expendables.</v>

3945
01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:25.930
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be awesome.</v>

3946
01:50:25.931 --> 01:50:26.620
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

3947
01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:27.453
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is.</v>

3948
01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 1>If you want to go see that kind of movie,</v>

3949
01:50:29.861 --> 01:50:30.620
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be awesome.</v>

3950
01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:31.020
<v Speaker 1>It looks hard.</v>

3951
01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:31.811
<v Speaker 1>I never saw the first one.</v>

3952
01:50:31.811 --> 01:50:32.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what that is?</v>

3953
01:50:32.981 --> 01:50:33.461
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

3954
01:50:33.461 --> 01:50:36.130
<v Speaker 1>that's like a champ driving a muscle car.</v>

3955
01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Think it's just crazy to watch.</v>

3956
01:50:38.530 --> 01:50:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I saw the preview and heart source.</v>

3957
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3958
01:50:40.090 --> 01:50:41.650
<v Speaker 1>it goes back and I'm like,</v>

3959
01:50:41.651 --> 01:50:42.431

3960
01:50:42.431 --> 01:50:43.720
<v Speaker 1>He's really fun course.</v>

3961
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:44.621
<v Speaker 1>He'll say that,</v>

3962
01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:44.951
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3963
01:50:44.951 --> 01:50:47.620
<v Speaker 1>If you're in the theater and he gets out there and he locks and loads,</v>

3964
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:48.820
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3965
01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm back.</v>

3966
01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:50.403
<v Speaker 1>You'll go.</v>

3967
01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you were 14 you were thinking about that.</v>

3968
01:50:54.821 --> 01:50:56.440
<v Speaker 1>If you were 14 you were back in Ohio,</v>

3969
01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:58.720
<v Speaker 1>would you not go crazy for this moment?</v>

3970
01:50:58.721 --> 01:50:59.051
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

3971
01:50:59.051 --> 01:50:59.591

3972
01:50:59.591 --> 01:50:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3973
01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:00.221
<v Speaker 1>Sort of saying,</v>

3974
01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit about this dude name.</v>

3975
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.391
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3976
01:51:01.391 --> 01:51:03.640

3977
01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:04.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3978
01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:05.120
<v Speaker 1>you know like kids,</v>

3979
01:51:05.670 --> 01:51:07.240
<v Speaker 1>if you watch terminator right now,</v>

3980
01:51:07.241 --> 01:51:07.721
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3981
01:51:07.721 --> 01:51:08.440
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

3982
01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:09.700
<v Speaker 1>But they got transformers,</v>

3983
01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Arnold's Schwartzenegger and we think it's good,</v>

3984
01:51:14.591 --> 01:51:15.424
<v Speaker 1>but I</v>

3985
01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:18.640
<v Speaker 1>will not think that's good.</v>

3986
01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I watch superman the other day and I watched Batman with uh,</v>

3987
01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:24.633
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3988
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:25.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3989
01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:29.320
<v Speaker 1>be returned Batman or whatever the one with Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny Devito</v>

3990
01:51:29.321 --> 01:51:30.190
<v Speaker 1>as the joker.</v>

3991
01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:32.510
<v Speaker 1>That was horrible.</v>

3992
01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Almost awful to watch that.</v>

3993
01:51:34.511 --> 01:51:35.291
<v Speaker 1>Michael Douglas,</v>

3994
01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:36.124
<v Speaker 1>Michael Douglas,</v>

3995
01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:36.861
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>

3996
01:51:36.861 --> 01:51:37.121
<v Speaker 1>Mikey,</v>

3997
01:51:37.121 --> 01:51:39.040
<v Speaker 1>keep make a case to think in my head.</v>

3998
01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:39.251
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3999
01:51:39.251 --> 01:51:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Michael Keaton was the best bet.</v>

4000
01:51:40.451 --> 01:51:40.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4001
01:51:40.581 --> 01:51:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I like Michael Keaton.</v>

4002
01:51:41.410 --> 01:51:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I watched off the biggest pile of shit ever.</v>

4003
01:51:43.931 --> 01:51:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I ever thought that movie was good.</v>

4004
01:51:46.330 --> 01:51:47.500
<v Speaker 1>And I watched superman.</v>

4005
01:51:47.501 --> 01:51:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4006
01:51:47.950 --> 01:51:51.220
<v Speaker 1>this is the dumbest cheesiest fucking movie ever.</v>

4007
01:51:51.330 --> 01:51:54.040
<v Speaker 1>It's your prime to one of them.</v>

4008
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Three or four,</v>

4009
01:51:55.090 --> 01:51:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

4010
01:51:55.770 --> 01:51:56.280
<v Speaker 1>but superman,</v>

4011
01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.090
<v Speaker 1>like here's like a part was like prior,</v>

4012
01:51:58.150 --> 01:51:59.830
<v Speaker 1>like this one girl,</v>

4013
01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:03.460
<v Speaker 1>like Lois lane that he pushed over the edge or something like that.</v>

4014
01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:07.180
<v Speaker 1>And then he jumped over the edge and then he went and got her,</v>

4015
01:52:07.210 --> 01:52:07.661
<v Speaker 1>got her.</v>

4016
01:52:07.661 --> 01:52:08.321
<v Speaker 1>But then he's like,</v>

4017
01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:12.400
<v Speaker 1>they didn't explain like he was Clark Kent or what's his name?</v>

4018
01:52:12.710 --> 01:52:13.061
<v Speaker 1>Character.</v>

4019
01:52:13.061 --> 01:52:13.894
<v Speaker 1>Clark Kent.</v>

4020
01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:15.520
<v Speaker 1>He was Clark Clinton when he jumped off.</v>

4021
01:52:15.521 --> 01:52:18.520
<v Speaker 1>And then like he supposedly like changed his clothes while he was falling and</v>

4022
01:52:18.521 --> 01:52:21.130
<v Speaker 1>then put his clothes somewhere and then like grabbed her.</v>

4023
01:52:21.190 --> 01:52:24.460
<v Speaker 1>It was like so many dumb things like that superman is supposed to be able to</v>

4024
01:52:24.461 --> 01:52:25.810
<v Speaker 1>move faster than the speed of light.</v>

4025
01:52:25.811 --> 01:52:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So he could do that Brian now.</v>

4026
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:29.380
<v Speaker 1>But it was really horribly done.</v>

4027
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure greenscreen flying over and you're just sitting there like this is so</v>

4028
01:52:34.001 --> 01:52:34.834
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>

4029
01:52:34.850 --> 01:52:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of this movie cause your,</v>

4030
01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:38.680
<v Speaker 1>your guys are obviously not flying right now.</v>

4031
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:39.910
<v Speaker 1>It was that bad.</v>

4032
01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:40.421
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

4033
01:52:40.421 --> 01:52:42.340
<v Speaker 1>you see a 13 year old kid watched that movie.</v>

4034
01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:43.860
<v Speaker 1>He's never going to get into that.</v>

4035
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4036
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Well one thing that kids get</v>

4037
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:49.030
<v Speaker 3>today though that they never got before is he get um,</v>

4038
01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:49.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4039
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:52.640
<v Speaker 3>a history of cinema like in a full form.</v>

4040
01:52:52.641 --> 01:52:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Like they get to see a vast difference between like King Kong from the 1930s and</v>

4041
01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:58.310
<v Speaker 3>a movie of today.</v>

4042
01:52:58.340 --> 01:52:58.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a,</v>

4043
01:52:58.851 --> 01:53:00.170
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing if you watch,</v>

4044
01:53:00.171 --> 01:53:03.620
<v Speaker 3>if you're a kid today and you watch like old movies that they,</v>

4045
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:05.540
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be a real mind fuck.</v>

4046
01:53:05.541 --> 01:53:08.180
<v Speaker 3>Like how stupid were people that they thought that was cool?</v>

4047
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:11.870
<v Speaker 3>We've seen it a little bit because I remember when I was a kid growing up,</v>

4048
01:53:11.871 --> 01:53:15.950
<v Speaker 3>I was really into special effects from monster movies and Harry housing.</v>

4049
01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.960
<v Speaker 3>I think that's guys Harrington was that the same,</v>

4050
01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:19.340
<v Speaker 3>whatever the guy's name was.</v>

4051
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:24.520
<v Speaker 3>There was the animation dude who did like King Kong and Rick Baker and we did</v>

4052
01:53:24.561 --> 01:53:25.341
<v Speaker 3>all the shit for,</v>

4053
01:53:25.341 --> 01:53:25.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4054
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:28.550
<v Speaker 3>he did an American Werewolf in London and like really cool,</v>

4055
01:53:28.551 --> 01:53:28.960
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4056
01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:29.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4057
01:53:29.150 --> 01:53:30.440
<v Speaker 3>special effects type shit.</v>

4058
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:31.520
<v Speaker 3>And I remember thinking like,</v>

4059
01:53:31.521 --> 01:53:33.530
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing like from the 1930s,</v>

4060
01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:34.790
<v Speaker 3>the 1980s like,</v>

4061
01:53:34.791 --> 01:53:37.970
<v Speaker 3>look at how much better they've gotten through the 1970s.</v>

4062
01:53:37.971 --> 01:53:38.721
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking that.</v>

4063
01:53:38.721 --> 01:53:38.871
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4064
01:53:38.871 --> 01:53:39.051
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

4065
01:53:39.051 --> 01:53:41.180
<v Speaker 3>they were terrible back in those King Kong days.</v>

4066
01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:44.810
<v Speaker 3>But you look at it now and through our lifetimes,</v>

4067
01:53:44.811 --> 01:53:46.490
<v Speaker 3>things have reached critical mass.</v>

4068
01:53:46.491 --> 01:53:50.390
<v Speaker 3>They've gotten really crazy to the point where you're seeing an artificial,</v>

4069
01:53:50.391 --> 01:53:51.380
<v Speaker 3>like everything,</v>

4070
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:53.300
<v Speaker 3>like you're seeing asteroid impacts,</v>

4071
01:53:53.301 --> 01:53:54.380
<v Speaker 3>alien invasions,</v>

4072
01:53:54.381 --> 01:53:57.230
<v Speaker 3>all these different things in movies that look incredibly realistic.</v>

4073
01:53:57.740 --> 01:53:59.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean incredibly realistic.</v>

4074
01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:03.380
<v Speaker 3>Like undiscernible like you don't know what's fake and what's real.</v>

4075
01:54:03.710 --> 01:54:06.140
<v Speaker 3>I watched aliens the other night.</v>

4076
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:07.820
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't hold up.</v>

4077
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:08.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4078
01:54:08.210 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4079
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:09.463
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4080
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:11.570
<v Speaker 3>The suspense still holds up.</v>

4081
01:54:11.571 --> 01:54:12.110
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

4082
01:54:12.110 --> 01:54:16.700
<v Speaker 3>there's a scene where the fucking spaceship is flying through the clouds and it</v>

4083
01:54:16.701 --> 01:54:18.020
<v Speaker 3>looks so bad.</v>

4084
01:54:18.021 --> 01:54:19.970
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a Saturday night live episode.</v>

4085
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:21.400
<v Speaker 3>It looks like two inches.</v>

4086
01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:24.190
<v Speaker 3>The cat is driving the spaceship and I missed tune.</v>

4087
01:54:24.191 --> 01:54:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Says it didn't even look remotely real.</v>

4088
01:54:26.421 --> 01:54:26.751
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4089
01:54:26.751 --> 01:54:27.740
<v Speaker 3>this is so fucking,</v>

4090
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:29.780
<v Speaker 3>it's so takes me out of this movie.</v>

4091
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Like it's so clunky.</v>

4092
01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:31.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4093
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:36.510
<v Speaker 2>the other night I went to do comedy and I got home and as I walk in the fucking</v>

4094
01:54:36.581 --> 01:54:36.941
<v Speaker 2>door,</v>

4095
01:54:36.941 --> 01:54:38.490
<v Speaker 2>I sit down and to see who's on Letterman,</v>

4096
01:54:38.491 --> 01:54:39.090
<v Speaker 2>he was on level.</v>

4097
01:54:39.090 --> 01:54:43.660

4098

01:55:11.230 --> 01:55:14.020
<v Speaker 2>He started beating up white people at the 16 minute mark.</v>

4120
01:55:14.530 --> 01:55:15.341

<v Speaker 5>19 minutes.</v>

4246
01:58:03.151 --> 01:58:03.271
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4247
01:58:03.271 --> 01:58:05.310
<v Speaker 5>I think it was 63 or some shit like that.</v>

4248
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:07.320
<v Speaker 5>And that's another movie that was a,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

4250
01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:10.890
<v Speaker 5>it's like you gotta like really have an attention span and watch that movie.</v>

4251
01:58:10.891 --> 01:58:12.210
<v Speaker 5>It's a different sort of thing.</v>

4252
01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:14.310
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of subtlety back then.</v>

4253
01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:17.970
<v Speaker 5>Like a guy would like walk in and like look at the clock and then look at a guy</v>

4254
01:58:17.971 --> 01:58:21.030
<v Speaker 5>who worked there and the guy worked there would go over and change the clock.</v>

4255
01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:21.990
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't say a word.</v>

4256
01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:23.040
<v Speaker 5>The guy would look at him.</v>

4257
01:58:23.130 --> 01:58:24.660
<v Speaker 5>Jackie Gleason looks at his watch,</v>

4258
01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:25.613
<v Speaker 5>looks at him,</v>

4259
01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.790
<v Speaker 5>and the guy just changes the clock.</v>

4260
01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:27.241
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

4261
01:58:27.241 --> 01:58:29.820
<v Speaker 5>It's like there was like subtlety to two movies back then.</v>

4262
01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:30.001
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4263
01:58:30.001 --> 01:58:31.350
<v Speaker 5>they gave you a magic nation,</v>

4264
01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:36.270
<v Speaker 5>a director in the sixties seventies and the beginning of the eighties he gave</v>

4265
01:58:36.271 --> 01:58:37.104
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4266
01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:39.270
<v Speaker 5>he let your mind run away with it,</v>

4267
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4268
01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:43.290
<v Speaker 5>and I always say that scene in the of Marlon Brando goes down to director,</v>

4269
01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:45.280
<v Speaker 5>would have showed him this director,</v>

4270
01:58:45.281 --> 01:58:49.480
<v Speaker 5>pulled it back and let the wind blow and he showed the fucking things from the</v>

4271
01:58:49.481 --> 01:58:50.740
<v Speaker 5>fruit checking.</v>

4272
01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:52.690
<v Speaker 5>They didn't show Marlon Brando and the beauty of us,</v>

4273
01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:54.700
<v Speaker 5>he didn't shoot Marlon Brando straight.</v>

4274
01:58:54.701 --> 01:58:55.630
<v Speaker 5>He shot it this way.</v>

4275
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 5>So Marlon Brando was dead somewhere in that corner.</v>

4276
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:00.040
<v Speaker 5>That's your imagination.</v>

4277
01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:01.540
<v Speaker 5>You're already judging like,</v>

4278
01:59:01.541 --> 01:59:02.374
<v Speaker 5>where is he?</v>

4279
01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.580
<v Speaker 5>He just died of a heart attack.</v>

4280
01:59:03.581 --> 01:59:03.941
<v Speaker 5>Where is it?</v>

4281
01:59:03.941 --> 01:59:04.630
<v Speaker 5>You're trying to look.</v>

4282
01:59:04.630 --> 01:59:05.530
<v Speaker 5>He didn't give it to you.</v>

4283
01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:06.551
<v Speaker 5>That was artistic.</v>

4284
01:59:06.551 --> 01:59:07.301
<v Speaker 5>That was artistic.</v>

4285
01:59:07.301 --> 01:59:08.134
<v Speaker 5>It was a different,</v>

4286
01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:08.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4287
01:59:08.321 --> 01:59:12.640
<v Speaker 5>that guy's a great fucking director and today we have a few couple of directors</v>

4288
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:15.190
<v Speaker 5>but not that show you that imagination bro.</v>

4289
01:59:15.191 --> 01:59:16.270
<v Speaker 5>When you leave there fluctuate,</v>

4290
01:59:16.290 --> 01:59:17.123
<v Speaker 5>you had a little bit.</v>

4291
01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:17.501
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

4292
01:59:17.501 --> 01:59:20.500
<v Speaker 5>What's going on now too is that there's so much money involved and making a</v>

4293
01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:24.100
<v Speaker 5>movie and there's so many different people involved in like their opinions and</v>

4294
01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:24.581
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4295
01:59:24.581 --> 01:59:28.120
<v Speaker 5>you know when you get a hundred million dollar investment in some crazy ass</v>

4298
01:59:28.810 --> 01:59:29.980
<v Speaker 5>unless you're James Cameron,</v>

4299
01:59:30.010 --> 01:59:31.090
<v Speaker 5>we could just run the show.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know like a guy like you.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's an asshole.</v>

4305
01:59:36.370 --> 01:59:37.300
<v Speaker 5>That's what he has to do.</v>

4306
01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:38.980
<v Speaker 5>This is the only one way to make a titanic.</v>

4307
01:59:39.010 --> 01:59:42.110
<v Speaker 5>You have to have one guy who is powerful as fuck with a crazy vision because</v>

<v Speaker 4>Ronda Rousey's very fucking Straw.</v>

4452
02:03:47.630 --> 02:03:47.811
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't happen,</v>

4457
02:03:50.521 --> 02:03:51.050
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

4458
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.960
<v Speaker 4>I was watching her.</v>

4459
02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:52.490
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

4460
02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:52.911
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

4461
02:03:52.911 --> 02:03:54.950
<v Speaker 4>he was teaching some high level shit last night.</v>

4462
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.780
<v Speaker 4>He was on a row last night.</v>

4463
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:57.471
<v Speaker 4>I went yesterday,</v>

4464
02:03:57.471 --> 02:03:58.880
<v Speaker 4>the day time and last night.</v>

4465
02:03:58.900 --> 02:03:59.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4466
02:03:59.440 --> 02:03:59.780
<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>

4467
02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:00.800
<v Speaker 4>He's been on a roll lately.</v>

4468
02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:01.730
<v Speaker 4>He's been on the road,</v>

4469
02:04:01.730 --> 02:04:05.960
<v Speaker 4>but last night he was teaching some high level shit dark and when she packs that</v>

4470
02:04:05.961 --> 02:04:06.794
<v Speaker 4>food over,</v>

4471
02:04:07.770 --> 02:04:08.030
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4472
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:09.050
<v Speaker 4>she was powerful legs.</v>

4473
02:04:09.051 --> 02:04:09.884
<v Speaker 4>Mindful Lady.</v>

4474
02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:10.450
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

4475
02:04:10.450 --> 02:04:12.320
<v Speaker 4>Armando hormones are nasty man.</v>

4476
02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:14.060
<v Speaker 4>She's a strong woman.</v>

4477
02:04:14.061 --> 02:04:14.411
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

4478
02:04:14.411 --> 02:04:15.470
<v Speaker 4>she gets a hold of your arm.</v>

4479
02:04:15.490 --> 02:04:16.020
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

4480
02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:16.853
<v Speaker 4>she knows,</v>

4481
02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:19.250
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't just know how to get an arm bar.</v>

4482
02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:21.740
<v Speaker 4>She knows how to correct as you're correcting.</v>

4483
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:22.480
<v Speaker 4>So she knows,</v>

4484
02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:23.540
<v Speaker 4>she knows to anticipate,</v>

4485
02:04:23.710 --> 02:04:24.920
<v Speaker 4>like here for instance,</v>

4486
02:04:24.921 --> 02:04:26.780
<v Speaker 4>like this is the way to get a person in an arm bar.</v>

4487
02:04:26.781 --> 02:04:28.160
<v Speaker 4>You got to extend their arm like that.</v>

4488
02:04:28.190 --> 02:04:30.590
<v Speaker 4>So if you think that someone's going to try to arm bar you,</v>

4489
02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 4>the first thing you do is turn your hand this way.</v>

4490
02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.780
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why you turn your hand this way is because then you straighten it</v>

4491
02:04:35.781 --> 02:04:36.021
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

4492
02:04:36.021 --> 02:04:37.830
<v Speaker 4>You force it like to what they want.</v>

4493
02:04:37.831 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 4>They want</v>

4494
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.830
<v Speaker 3>to straighten your arm out so you turn it like that and then go like this.</v>

4495
02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:43.320
<v Speaker 3>So that way when they pull on the arm,</v>

4496
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:46.740
<v Speaker 3>it's going to go with the joint and it's going to bend and then that's their job</v>

4497
02:04:46.741 --> 02:04:47.880
<v Speaker 3>to try to turn it back around.</v>

4498
02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:53.360
<v Speaker 3>She's a master at adjusting that armbar like making sure that once she locks</v>

4499
02:04:53.941 --> 02:04:54.001
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

4500
02:04:54.001 --> 02:04:54.690
<v Speaker 3>hold that arm,</v>

4501
02:04:54.690 --> 02:04:56.070
<v Speaker 3>she rolls with them.</v>

4502
02:04:56.071 --> 02:04:57.060
<v Speaker 3>She flipped some.</v>

4503
02:04:57.061 --> 02:04:57.721
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

4504
02:04:57.721 --> 02:04:59.550
<v Speaker 3>if you watch her fight with Misha Tate,</v>

4505
02:04:59.551 --> 02:05:01.590
<v Speaker 3>or if you watch a lot of our victories when one of the girls,</v>

4506
02:05:01.591 --> 02:05:04.770
<v Speaker 3>he dislocated her arm and the girl said she didn't tap it or is Jack,</v>

4507
02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:05.020
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

4508
02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Jack's everybody's arms and she,</v>

4509
02:05:06.671 --> 02:05:08.940
<v Speaker 3>she is a master at adjusting.</v>

4510
02:05:08.941 --> 02:05:10.320
<v Speaker 3>As soon as she locks that thing up,</v>

4511
02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:10.921
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

4512
02:05:10.921 --> 02:05:13.200
<v Speaker 3>the speed that she locks it up as nasty as fuck.</v>

4513
02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:15.030
<v Speaker 3>Her technique is pinpoint,</v>

4514
02:05:15.330 --> 02:05:18.300
<v Speaker 3>everything's perfect and she's a master at adjusting.</v>

4515
02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:18.710
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

4516
02:05:18.710 --> 02:05:20.100
<v Speaker 3>once she grabs a hold that arm,</v>

4517
02:05:20.101 --> 02:05:21.150
<v Speaker 3>you start flopping around,</v>

4518
02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:22.770
<v Speaker 3>but she knows where you're going to go.</v>

4519
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:23.610
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>

4520
02:05:23.610 --> 02:05:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Because she puts on bars on people every fucking day of the week,</v>

4521
02:05:26.490 --> 02:05:27.990
<v Speaker 3>so she knows exactly what to do.</v>

4522
02:05:28.110 --> 02:05:31.140
<v Speaker 3>There's certain positions that when you get used to,</v>

4523
02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:33.360
<v Speaker 3>you know how a guy can get out of him,</v>

4524
02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:34.380
<v Speaker 3>you know the defense.</v>

4525
02:05:34.381 --> 02:05:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Like if you first learned a rear naked choke and you've never choke the guy</v>

4526
02:05:37.321 --> 02:05:38.130
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

4527
02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:40.920
<v Speaker 3>the guy gets a hand on a 10 he turns the next thing you know he's out and you</v>

4528
02:05:40.921 --> 02:05:41.760
<v Speaker 3>don't even know what happened.</v>

4529
02:05:42.030 --> 02:05:43.260
<v Speaker 3>But if you get good at it,</v>

4530
02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:45.270
<v Speaker 3>you know what a guy can do to get out.</v>

4531
02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:49.770
<v Speaker 3>And so you stop all that shit from you anticipate it and the more you roll,</v>

4532
02:05:49.771 --> 02:05:50.900
<v Speaker 3>the more mat time to get in.</v>

4533
02:05:50.901 --> 02:05:51.750
<v Speaker 3>The more reps you get,</v>

4534
02:05:51.751 --> 02:05:53.960
<v Speaker 3>the more time you spend actually choking people,</v>

4535
02:05:53.961 --> 02:05:54.900
<v Speaker 3>the better you get at that.</v>

4536
02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:56.010
<v Speaker 3>It's just no way around it.</v>

4537
02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Or Rhonda has got to that point,</v>

4538
02:05:58.621 --> 02:05:59.730
<v Speaker 3>that master point.</v>

4539
02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:00.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4540
02:06:00.110 --> 02:06:02.190
<v Speaker 3>there's a point that someone gets to a certain moves,</v>

4541
02:06:02.191 --> 02:06:04.090
<v Speaker 3>like with Cody Mackenzie's that crazy guillotine.</v>

4542
02:06:04.091 --> 02:06:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Tina gets people with Rhonda.</v>

4544
02:06:07.321 --> 02:06:10.200

4545
02:06:10.201 --> 02:06:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Cause Misha Tate is also a bad motherfucker and me should take out her back and</v>

<v Speaker 3>she got out of that,</v>

4595
02:07:13.861 --> 02:07:14.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

4596
02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.940
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

4597
02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:15.571
<v Speaker 3>I think uh,</v>

4598

<v Speaker 3>Rhonda is funding another time.</v>

02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:19.640
<v Speaker 3>So there's two different strike force think.</v>

4600
02:07:19.650 --> 02:07:20.850
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not sure.</v>

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.350
<v Speaker 4>called funky forest,</v>

4615

<v Speaker 4>the first contact,</v>

4616
02:07:38.321 --> 02:07:39.990
<v Speaker 4>and it's a hilarious movie.</v>

4617
02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4618
02:07:41.650 --> 02:07:44.800
<v Speaker 4>it's just a great movie to watch when you're super stoned around mushrooms.</v>

4619
02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:45.630
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

4620
02:07:45.630 --> 02:07:47.290
<v Speaker 4>if you go on Google or on Youtube,</v>

4621
02:07:47.291 --> 02:07:49.540
<v Speaker 4>you could watch clips of it and if you,</v>

4622
02:07:49.541 --> 02:07:50.770
<v Speaker 4>if I showed you it,</v>

4623
02:07:50.771 --> 02:07:52.510
<v Speaker 4>you would fucking freak the fuck out.</v>

4624
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.701
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4625
02:07:52.701 --> 02:07:52.991
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

4626
02:07:52.991 --> 02:07:55.910
<v Speaker 4>This is August 18th it's the same car I knew.</v>

4627
02:07:56.070 --> 02:07:56.903
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

4628
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:58.120
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

4629
02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:59.650
<v Speaker 4>That means it's going to be too big.</v>

4630
02:07:59.651 --> 02:08:00.910
<v Speaker 4>Women's fights on one card.</v>

4631
02:08:00.911 --> 02:08:01.870
<v Speaker 4>I thought they would space it out.</v>

4632
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.211
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4633
02:08:04.211 --> 02:08:04.691
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

4634
02:08:04.691 --> 02:08:04.990
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4635
02:08:04.990 --> 02:08:06.070
<v Speaker 4>the reality is,</v>

4636
02:08:06.071 --> 02:08:10.960
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda is such a Badass that there's been a lot of attention on the women's MMA</v>

4637
02:08:10.961 --> 02:08:14.770
<v Speaker 4>movement now there where there wasn't just a year or two ago when Gina Carano</v>

4638
02:08:14.771 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 4>stopped fighting when she stepped out and Rhonda,</v>

4639
02:08:17.351 --> 02:08:17.980
<v Speaker 4>the other theaters,</v>

4640
02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:18.510
<v Speaker 4>I Rhonda,</v>

4641
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:21.430
<v Speaker 4>it's like stepped up to Cyborg like a bunch of times.</v>

4642
02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:22.263
<v Speaker 4>So if you've never seen,</v>

4643
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:23.670
<v Speaker 4>if you don't know what the fuck we're talking about,</v>

4644
02:08:23.690 --> 02:08:24.880
<v Speaker 4>there's a woman named Cyborg.</v>

4645
02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:26.530
<v Speaker 4>If you were a chick and you were fighting,</v>

4646
02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:27.820
<v Speaker 4>what would be your biggest nightmare?</v>

4647
02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:30.760
<v Speaker 4>So your biggest night would be a woman who's not attractive,</v>

4648
02:08:30.761 --> 02:08:31.600
<v Speaker 4>who looks like a man,</v>

4649
02:08:31.601 --> 02:08:33.970
<v Speaker 4>is built like a man and she knows how to fuck people up.</v>

4650
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:34.850
<v Speaker 4>But I saying that,</v>

4651
02:08:35.170 --> 02:08:35.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4652
02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:36.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go to Woolworths.</v>

4653
02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:39.170
<v Speaker 4>And that's almost exactly what Cyborg is.</v>

4654
02:08:39.171 --> 02:08:39.701
<v Speaker 4>It's fuck.</v>

4655
02:08:39.701 --> 02:08:43.850
<v Speaker 4>And she tested positive for testosterone and male hormones or whatever.</v>

4656
02:08:43.890 --> 02:08:46.730
<v Speaker 4>Whatever she had taken whatever banned substance that she had taken.</v>

4657
02:08:46.731 --> 02:08:47.500
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't it?</v>

4658
02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:48.820
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Anna Bar,</v>

4659
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:49.743
<v Speaker 4>but I don't remember.</v>

4660
02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:50.920
<v Speaker 4>But whatever it was,</v>

4661
02:08:50.921 --> 02:08:51.980
<v Speaker 4>it's some sort of a,</v>

4662
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.171
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

4663
02:08:52.171 --> 02:08:52.930
<v Speaker 4>a steroid,</v>

4664
02:08:52.930 --> 02:08:54.910
<v Speaker 4>which is what everybody at accused her of everywhere.</v>

4665
02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:55.481
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4666
02:08:55.481 --> 02:08:55.841
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

4667
02:08:55.841 --> 02:08:57.040
<v Speaker 4>so Ronda Rousey's center,</v>

4668
02:08:57.041 --> 02:08:57.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4669
02:08:57.490 --> 02:08:58.271
<v Speaker 4>you have a Dick,</v>

4670
02:08:58.271 --> 02:08:59.104
<v Speaker 4>you dick,</v>

4671
02:09:00.490 --> 02:09:01.300
<v Speaker 4>she uh,</v>

4672
02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:05.500
<v Speaker 4>she said a picture of Gina Carano Cyborg did cause Ronda Rousey said that,</v>

4673
02:09:05.550 --> 02:09:06.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4674
02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:07.390
<v Speaker 4>you know that she was a cheater.</v>

4675
02:09:07.450 --> 02:09:08.770
<v Speaker 4>So she sent a picture of,</v>

4676
02:09:08.771 --> 02:09:09.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4677
02:09:09.190 --> 02:09:09.640
<v Speaker 4>of uh,</v>

4678
02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:12.190
<v Speaker 4>Gina Carano when their face busted up after Cyborg,</v>

4679
02:09:12.191 --> 02:09:13.750
<v Speaker 4>beat her up and she said,</v>

4680
02:09:13.751 --> 02:09:14.980
<v Speaker 4>you have a deck you'd tick,</v>

4681
02:09:16.210 --> 02:09:17.440
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty fucking funny.</v>

4682
02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:18.783
<v Speaker 4>And it was just,</v>

4683
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:20.050
<v Speaker 4>if you really think about it,</v>

4684
02:09:20.051 --> 02:09:21.280
<v Speaker 4>if she really wants cheating,</v>

4685
02:09:21.281 --> 02:09:22.900
<v Speaker 4>and that's what she did once she was cheating.</v>

4686
02:09:22.901 --> 02:09:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Like if you really,</v>

4687
02:09:23.861 --> 02:09:24.041
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

4688
02:09:24.041 --> 02:09:24.874
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you,</v>

4689
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:26.050
<v Speaker 4>it's really not that many.</v>

4690
02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:27.250
<v Speaker 4>We talked about on the podcast,</v>

4691
02:09:27.251 --> 02:09:30.010
<v Speaker 4>we even had a doctor who had doctor Steve Call up and explain it to us.</v>

4692
02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:33.430
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible to look like that without some sort of enhancement?</v>

4693
02:09:33.431 --> 02:09:34.390
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't believe it is.</v>

4694
02:09:34.570 --> 02:09:37.570
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't think it's physiologically possible for a woman to be built like that</v>

4695
02:09:37.571 --> 02:09:40.300
<v Speaker 4>and less somewhere along the lunch has been taken some shit.</v>

4696
02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:43.870
<v Speaker 4>Like if you look at those really fit crossfit girls,</v>

4697
02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:45.580
<v Speaker 4>those really in shape women,</v>

4698
02:09:45.581 --> 02:09:46.930
<v Speaker 4>they look fucking tremendous.</v>

4699
02:09:47.230 --> 02:09:48.190
<v Speaker 4>But they look like women,</v>

4700
02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:48.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4701
02:09:48.890 --> 02:09:50.440
<v Speaker 4>they have good arms and they have,</v>

4702
02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:50.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4703
02:09:50.741 --> 02:09:53.350
<v Speaker 4>they're thick and they have like big legs and everything like that,</v>

4704
02:09:53.351 --> 02:09:56.470
<v Speaker 4>but they have a much more feminine look to their musculature.</v>

4705
02:09:57.010 --> 02:09:57.191
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4706
02:09:57.191 --> 02:09:58.420
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain level that,</v>

4707
02:09:58.421 --> 02:09:58.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4708
02:09:58.690 --> 02:10:00.130
<v Speaker 4>that some women have gotten.</v>

4709
02:10:00.490 --> 02:10:01.323
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4710
02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Cyborg.</v>

4711
02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:02.290
<v Speaker 4>One of them.</v>

4712
02:10:02.290 --> 02:10:04.290
<v Speaker 4>What's the joke used to do about the fucking,</v>

4713
02:10:05.170 --> 02:10:07.850
<v Speaker 4>the whole Noah's Ark was a retarded boy.</v>

4714
02:10:08.150 --> 02:10:09.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh boy,</v>

4715
02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:12.520
<v Speaker 4>look at a little bit on steroids and tell you something ain't right there.</v>

4716
02:10:12.610 --> 02:10:12.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4717
02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:13.181
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4718
02:10:13.181 --> 02:10:13.830
<v Speaker 4>You could see it.</v>

4719
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:14.111
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>

4720
02:10:14.111 --> 02:10:17.160
<v Speaker 4>you see the neck and the fucking jaw line and the,</v>

4721
02:10:17.290 --> 02:10:17.561
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4722
02:10:17.561 --> 02:10:18.610
<v Speaker 4>her upper body was,</v>

4723
02:10:18.611 --> 02:10:20.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean she had traps [inaudible] traps.</v>

4724
02:10:20.681 --> 02:10:21.000
<v Speaker 4>Can I go?</v>

4725
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:21.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4726
02:10:21.610 --> 02:10:22.361
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

4727
02:10:22.361 --> 02:10:23.950
<v Speaker 4>I understand what a woman burns.</v>

4728
02:10:23.951 --> 02:10:25.910
<v Speaker 4>Fat titties gets lost and it's,</v>

4729
02:10:26.050 --> 02:10:28.030
<v Speaker 4>but it's harder for a woman to have a,</v>

4730
02:10:28.410 --> 02:10:31.600
<v Speaker 4>a muscle definition because they have an extra layer of fat and all that stuff.</v>

4731
02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:32.860
<v Speaker 4>But you could,</v>

4732
02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:36.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm no InQuicker phenologist and I could tell that bitch did something.</v>

4733
02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:37.890
<v Speaker 4>She did a lot more than to see it.</v>

4734
02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:38.590
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4735
02:10:38.590 --> 02:10:38.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4736
02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:41.660
<v Speaker 4>what is it that GNC shake and a fucking weed.</v>

4737
02:10:41.661 --> 02:10:42.050
<v Speaker 4>A pill,</v>

4738
02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:42.531
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

4739
02:10:42.531 --> 02:10:43.340
<v Speaker 4>She did something,</v>

4740
02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:43.491
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4741
02:10:43.491 --> 02:10:44.480
<v Speaker 4>she could tooken this shit.</v>

4742
02:10:44.481 --> 02:10:46.010
<v Speaker 4>They used to be legal at GNC.</v>

4743
02:10:46.070 --> 02:10:48.350
<v Speaker 4>Like she could've gotten on some mag 10 or something like that.</v>

4744
02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:49.470
<v Speaker 4>Was that stuff strong?</v>

4745
02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:50.391
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4746
02:10:50.391 --> 02:10:51.260
<v Speaker 4>It was ridiculous.</v>

4747
02:10:51.290 --> 02:10:51.951
<v Speaker 4>GNC,</v>

4748
02:10:51.951 --> 02:10:53.150
<v Speaker 4>maybe they banned it.</v>

4749
02:10:53.151 --> 02:10:54.020
<v Speaker 4>They used to have it.</v>

4750
02:10:54.021 --> 02:10:54.680
<v Speaker 4>I took it.</v>

4751
02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:55.880
<v Speaker 4>It's called Mag 10.</v>

4752
02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:56.690
<v Speaker 4>I took it.</v>

4753
02:10:56.690 --> 02:10:59.690
<v Speaker 4>You took it easy word to the word.</v>

4754
02:11:00.710 --> 02:11:01.550
<v Speaker 4>If you were lifting weights,</v>

4755
02:11:01.551 --> 02:11:06.551
<v Speaker 4>you would notice if you like did it and took it and lifted weights lifted for</v>

4756
02:11:06.561 --> 02:11:07.430
<v Speaker 4>other reasons.</v>

4757
02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:08.353
<v Speaker 4>What otherwise is we?</v>

4758
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:09.201
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember,</v>

4759
02:11:09.201 --> 02:11:11.020
<v Speaker 4>but maybe I did take it when I was working on,</v>

4760
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:13.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it to be yoked now.</v>

4761
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:15.260
<v Speaker 4>Remember when you got really doing anything to me off?</v>

4762
02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:15.531
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4763
02:11:15.531 --> 02:11:17.840
<v Speaker 4>they got rid of it because it was like a steroid.</v>

4764
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:21.380
<v Speaker 4>It's like taking a steroid and I'm not saying you could get big without juicing,</v>

4765
02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:23.300
<v Speaker 4>but she was at the point where you knew,</v>

4766
02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:24.920
<v Speaker 4>you knew something was going on.</v>

4767
02:11:25.130 --> 02:11:27.960
<v Speaker 4>Her face started looking like very masculine too.</v>

4768
02:11:27.970 --> 02:11:28.803
<v Speaker 4>And what's really crazy.</v>

4769
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:31.160
<v Speaker 4>It was a video of her from her first fight ever.</v>

4770
02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:32.660
<v Speaker 4>And if you go back to her first fight ever,</v>

4771
02:11:32.661 --> 02:11:33.494
<v Speaker 4>she looked like a woman.</v>

4772
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:35.000
<v Speaker 4>She was built very differently.</v>

4773
02:11:35.090 --> 02:11:36.290
<v Speaker 4>If you look at it like she's,</v>

4774
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.801
<v Speaker 4>she looks,</v>

4775
02:11:36.801 --> 02:11:37.760
<v Speaker 4>she's still bad ass.</v>

4776
02:11:37.761 --> 02:11:39.050
<v Speaker 4>She's still going to war with some checks.</v>

4777
02:11:39.051 --> 02:11:39.771
<v Speaker 4>She's thrown down,</v>

4778
02:11:39.771 --> 02:11:40.910
<v Speaker 4>she's a shoot box fighter,</v>

4779
02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:43.130
<v Speaker 4>but she looks like a woman.</v>

4780
02:11:43.131 --> 02:11:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Her body looks like a woman.</v>

4781
02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:46.580
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of shocking the difference cause she looks,</v>

4782
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:48.050
<v Speaker 4>she's scary now.</v>

4783
02:11:48.170 --> 02:11:49.860
<v Speaker 4>She looks like she would fuck with me.</v>

4784
02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:50.713
<v Speaker 4>She come back.</v>

4785
02:11:50.890 --> 02:11:51.723
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4786
02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:52.820
<v Speaker 4>She might not ever come back.</v>

4787
02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.510
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

4788
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.850
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4789
02:11:53.850 --> 02:11:54.683
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

4790
02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:54.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4791
02:11:54.921 --> 02:11:55.551
<v Speaker 4>She'll come back.</v>

4792
02:11:55.551 --> 02:11:56.720
<v Speaker 4>She's got to go after running around.</v>

4793
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4794
02:11:56.871 --> 02:11:57.704
<v Speaker 4>but I mean they have to,</v>

4795
02:11:57.710 --> 02:12:00.560
<v Speaker 4>once she comes back then she has to have a hearing to try to get her license</v>

4796
02:12:00.561 --> 02:12:01.394
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

4797
02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:01.671
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4798
02:12:01.671 --> 02:12:04.100
<v Speaker 4>It's not as simple as you come back once you come back.</v>

4799
02:12:04.101 --> 02:12:05.000
<v Speaker 4>He's due to you.</v>

4800
02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:06.560
<v Speaker 4>Once you do the suspension,</v>

4801
02:12:06.561 --> 02:12:07.010
<v Speaker 4>you're good.</v>

4802
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:08.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's necessarily the truth.</v>

4803
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:11.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if to stall subpoenaed at ACA.</v>

4804
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:15.140
<v Speaker 4>I think you have to get licensed because I think that like Chell son and when</v>

4805
02:12:15.141 --> 02:12:15.591
<v Speaker 4>they had a fight,</v>

4806
02:12:15.591 --> 02:12:16.161
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Silva,</v>

4807
02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:18.800
<v Speaker 4>he had to get licensed in Nevada and that was a part of the thing.</v>

4808
02:12:18.801 --> 02:12:23.390
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just a chill son and had been that he had been a band for x amount of</v>

4809
02:12:23.391 --> 02:12:23.960
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>

4810
02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:25.400
<v Speaker 4>He also had to get licensed.</v>

4811
02:12:25.490 --> 02:12:26.660
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know.</v>

4812
02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:28.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the whole process I think,</v>

4813
02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:29.780
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

4814
02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:30.613
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4815
02:12:30.650 --> 02:12:31.483
<v Speaker 4>there should be consent.</v>

4816
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:36.680
<v Speaker 4>There's a difference between a woman doing performance enhancing drugs and a man</v>

4817
02:12:36.681 --> 02:12:37.370
<v Speaker 4>doing them.</v>

4818
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:38.120
<v Speaker 4>In my opinion,</v>

4819
02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:42.350
<v Speaker 4>when a woman starts in introducing things that just don't exist in that level</v>

4820
02:12:42.351 --> 02:12:43.460
<v Speaker 4>ever in our body,</v>

4821
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:44.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4822
02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:45.920
<v Speaker 4>it's different thing to that.</v>

4823
02:12:45.921 --> 02:12:50.270
<v Speaker 4>Then a guy taking like testosterone replacement therapy to try to be like a</v>

4824
02:12:50.271 --> 02:12:51.104
<v Speaker 4>young man again.</v>

4825
02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:52.460
<v Speaker 4>It's really kind of tricky.</v>

4826
02:12:52.850 --> 02:12:53.683
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>

4827
02:12:54.050 --> 02:12:54.411
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4828
02:12:54.411 --> 02:12:54.760
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4829
02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:56.240
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like you're a,</v>

4830
02:12:56.290 --> 02:12:56.570
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

4831
02:12:56.570 --> 02:12:59.750
<v Speaker 4>you can't go down that slippery path cause they're like we talked about like the</v>

4832
02:12:59.751 --> 02:13:00.620
<v Speaker 4>weight cutting thing.</v>

4833
02:13:00.710 --> 02:13:01.760
<v Speaker 4>If everybody has to wait,</v>

4834
02:13:01.761 --> 02:13:02.330
<v Speaker 4>cut man,</v>

4835
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:02.631
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4836
02:13:02.631 --> 02:13:03.680
<v Speaker 4>that kind of fucks things up.</v>

4837
02:13:03.681 --> 02:13:05.750
<v Speaker 4>It would be better if everybody didn't have to rake weight cut.</v>

4838
02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:07.400
<v Speaker 4>It'd be nice if that was the reality.</v>

4839
02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:10.040
<v Speaker 4>Well if women start taking male hormones,</v>

4840
02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:11.480
<v Speaker 4>that is a mess.</v>

4841
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:14.570
<v Speaker 4>That ruins the whole idea of the woman's sport.</v>

4842
02:13:14.630 --> 02:13:15.021
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4843
02:13:15.021 --> 02:13:15.854
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

4844
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:17.870
<v Speaker 4>if you have women taking male hormones,</v>

4845
02:13:17.970 --> 02:13:18.451
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

4846
02:13:18.451 --> 02:13:20.060
<v Speaker 4>that's not women fighting anymore.</v>

4847
02:13:20.090 --> 02:13:21.200
<v Speaker 4>That's a hybrid.</v>

4848
02:13:21.230 --> 02:13:23.090
<v Speaker 4>That's a woman man hybrid.</v>

4849
02:13:23.130 --> 02:13:24.620
<v Speaker 4>Women with male hormones,</v>

4850
02:13:24.621 --> 02:13:27.710
<v Speaker 4>like you're fucking the whole tree of life up there.</v>

4851
02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Like this isn't just you trying to reclaim lost youth.</v>

4852
02:13:31.351 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 4>You're creating</v>

4853
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:35.070
<v Speaker 3>a thing that's not quite a woman anymore.</v>

4854
02:13:35.190 --> 02:13:36.030
<v Speaker 3>That's what that is.</v>

4855
02:13:36.031 --> 02:13:36.181
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

4856
02:13:36.181 --> 02:13:39.030
<v Speaker 3>you're adding some shit to a woman that doesn't belong there.</v>

4857
02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:42.600
<v Speaker 3>And I think that has to be taken very seriously.</v>

4858
02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:43.723
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

4859
02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:46.620
<v Speaker 3>so sad.</v>

4860
02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:47.311
<v Speaker 3>It's so sad.</v>

4861
02:13:47.311 --> 02:13:48.570
<v Speaker 3>And that's what they have to do,</v>

4862
02:13:48.571 --> 02:13:48.841
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4863
02:13:48.841 --> 02:13:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what that sport demands because the look,</v>

4864
02:13:51.151 --> 02:13:53.160
<v Speaker 3>it's all about body dysmorphia at that point.</v>

4865
02:13:53.161 --> 02:13:54.660
<v Speaker 3>When you're involved in bodybuilding,</v>

4866
02:13:54.810 --> 02:13:56.640
<v Speaker 3>it's just like when you see a woman,</v>

4867
02:13:57.150 --> 02:13:59.760
<v Speaker 3>and no disrespect to anybody who has this,</v>

4868
02:13:59.790 --> 02:14:00.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4869
02:14:00.061 --> 02:14:01.800
<v Speaker 3>your tits are too big and you're crazy.</v>

4870
02:14:01.870 --> 02:14:02.211
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4871
02:14:02.211 --> 02:14:04.800
<v Speaker 3>like you just get like a thousand CC's and they're like,</v>

4872
02:14:04.801 --> 02:14:06.210
<v Speaker 3>I want to get another 200 like,</v>

4873
02:14:06.211 --> 02:14:07.350
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

4874
02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:08.363
<v Speaker 3>Stop it.</v>

4875
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.671
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4876
02:14:08.671 --> 02:14:11.160
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen those videos on these people that can't stop getting bigger</v>

4877
02:14:11.161 --> 02:14:11.461
<v Speaker 3>and bigger?</v>

4878
02:14:11.461 --> 02:14:12.091
<v Speaker 3>10 implants.</v>

4879
02:14:12.091 --> 02:14:12.690
<v Speaker 3>They're crazy.</v>

4880
02:14:12.690 --> 02:14:13.120
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

4881
02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:14.400
<v Speaker 3>that's how bodybuilders are.</v>

4882
02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:16.950
<v Speaker 3>And they get this body dysmorphia and they just,</v>

4883
02:14:17.010 --> 02:14:18.360
<v Speaker 3>it's not about looking good.</v>

4884
02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go back to like the Frank Zane days,</v>

4885
02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:23.220
<v Speaker 3>you know you go back to like before steroids,</v>

4886
02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:23.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4887
02:14:23.551 --> 02:14:26.940
<v Speaker 3>that guy was in tremendous shape and he was proportioned and it was all about</v>

4888
02:14:26.941 --> 02:14:30.570
<v Speaker 3>making your body working hard to get your body in proportion.</v>

4889
02:14:30.810 --> 02:14:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Then it became about steroids and then the Arnold Schwarzenegger error and then</v>

4890
02:14:34.981 --> 02:14:35.814
<v Speaker 3>forward,</v>

4891
02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:36.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4892
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:36.421
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>

4893
02:14:36.421 --> 02:14:37.710
<v Speaker 3>like the Lee Haney era.</v>

4894
02:14:37.711 --> 02:14:40.170
<v Speaker 3>It became about these cartoonish,</v>

4895
02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:42.000
<v Speaker 3>monstrous human beings.</v>

4896
02:14:42.450 --> 02:14:44.160
<v Speaker 3>It became straight Tom Platz.</v>

4897
02:14:44.190 --> 02:14:46.200
<v Speaker 3>It became strained body dysmorphia.</v>

4898
02:14:46.530 --> 02:14:49.140
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they figured out how to add drugs into the equation,</v>

4899
02:14:49.170 --> 02:14:53.700
<v Speaker 3>everything got completely wacky and women started getting wacky to which one was</v>

4900
02:14:53.701 --> 02:14:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Frank Zane.</v>

4901
02:14:54.330 --> 02:14:54.660
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

4902
02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:56.910
<v Speaker 3>there's a woman who lived down the street from me and I won't say her name,</v>

4903
02:14:56.911 --> 02:15:01.800
<v Speaker 3>but she was a very successful female bodybuilder back in the day and now she</v>

4904
02:15:01.801 --> 02:15:02.634
<v Speaker 3>looks,</v>

4905
02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:05.280
<v Speaker 3>she looks like she's paid a price for it.</v>

4906
02:15:05.281 --> 02:15:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

4907
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:06.820
<v Speaker 3>it's sad when he sees her.</v>

4908
02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:09.900
<v Speaker 3>She has a lot of masculine characteristics that she shouldn't have.</v>

4909
02:15:10.290 --> 02:15:11.123
<v Speaker 3>She looks like,</v>

4910
02:15:11.170 --> 02:15:13.740
<v Speaker 3>like she fucking hijacked or system.</v>

4911
02:15:13.741 --> 02:15:13.891
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4912
02:15:13.891 --> 02:15:14.550
<v Speaker 3>she just,</v>

4913
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:15.600
<v Speaker 3>she morphed herself,</v>

4914
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:16.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4915
02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:18.270
<v Speaker 3>she marked herself and turned herself into a man.</v>

4916
02:15:18.271 --> 02:15:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>

4917
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:19.860
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy,</v>

4918
02:15:19.861 --> 02:15:20.550
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4919
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:21.210
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

4920
02:15:21.210 --> 02:15:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Like she's wears makeups,</v>

4921
02:15:23.041 --> 02:15:24.900
<v Speaker 3>tries to be womeny but you like,</v>

4922
02:15:24.901 --> 02:15:27.330
<v Speaker 3>you know what she used to look like and what she did to herself.</v>

4923
02:15:27.331 --> 02:15:30.060
<v Speaker 3>She turned herself into some sort of a masculine creation.</v>

4924
02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:31.800
<v Speaker 3>And even when they get off this stuff,</v>

4925
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:33.660
<v Speaker 3>they still maintain some,</v>

4926
02:15:33.690 --> 02:15:35.100
<v Speaker 3>some masculine features.</v>

4927
02:15:35.101 --> 02:15:36.150
<v Speaker 3>It's really strange.</v>

4928
02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:37.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4929
02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:37.950
<v Speaker 3>they uh,</v>

4930
02:15:37.950 --> 02:15:39.150
<v Speaker 3>their body grows.</v>

4931
02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:40.290
<v Speaker 3>Shepparton gets big,</v>

4932
02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:40.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4933
02:15:40.741 --> 02:15:40.951
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4934
02:15:40.951 --> 02:15:41.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4935
02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:44.940
<v Speaker 3>it's a very unfortunate thing that someone decided that that looks good for</v>

4936
02:15:44.941 --> 02:15:45.670
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

4937
02:15:45.670 --> 02:15:50.520
<v Speaker 3>They taken some crazy shit that makes you closer to a man because a fit woman</v>

4938
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:51.010
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

4939
02:15:51.010 --> 02:15:55.590
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful to look at a fit woman and to not accept that a fit woman is</v>

4940
02:15:55.591 --> 02:15:56.970
<v Speaker 3>going to look different than a fit man.</v>

4941
02:15:56.970 --> 02:15:59.430
<v Speaker 3>It's craziness of fit woman.</v>

4942
02:15:59.431 --> 02:16:00.660
<v Speaker 3>A woman who was in great shape.</v>

4943
02:16:00.661 --> 02:16:01.141
<v Speaker 3>It works out.</v>

4944
02:16:01.141 --> 02:16:01.501
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

4945

<v Speaker 4>What's up?</v>

5395
02:27:20.081 --> 02:27:20.320
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

5396
02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:20.911
<v Speaker 4>the way to come on.</v>

5397
02:27:20.911 --> 02:27:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Will you fuck this chicken?</v>

5398
02:27:21.881 --> 02:27:22.714
<v Speaker 4>Come on up phase.</v>

5399
02:27:22.850 --> 02:27:23.860
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you 500 bucks.</v>

5400
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.721
<v Speaker 4>That's not bad.</v>

5401
02:27:25.721 --> 02:27:27.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna fucking come on somebody's face.</v>

5402
02:27:27.730 --> 02:27:30.550
<v Speaker 4>But to get fucked in the ass for $1,000,</v>

5403
02:27:30.970 --> 02:27:31.930
<v Speaker 4>that's just wrong.</v>

5404
02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:33.310
<v Speaker 4>I would want at least 10 gs.</v>

5405
02:27:33.311 --> 02:27:34.270
<v Speaker 4>15 gs.</v>

5406
02:27:34.750 --> 02:27:34.871
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5407
02:27:34.871 --> 02:27:36.190
<v Speaker 4>the whole world changed.</v>

5408
02:27:36.220 --> 02:27:36.431
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5409
02:27:36.431 --> 02:27:38.920
<v Speaker 4>the whole world of porn completely changed weight.</v>

5410
02:27:38.921 --> 02:27:40.180
<v Speaker 4>When they stop selling DVDs.</v>

5411
02:27:40.330 --> 02:27:43.030
<v Speaker 4>DVD sales disappeared when the internet came along,</v>

5412
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:44.110
<v Speaker 4>they just disappeared.</v>

5413
02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:45.370
<v Speaker 4>They dried up completely.</v>

5414
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:46.370
<v Speaker 4>Remember when laws are,</v>

5415
02:27:46.380 --> 02:27:51.190
<v Speaker 4>WIC was saying the sky is falling because they had figured out a way to download</v>

5416
02:27:51.191 --> 02:27:52.120
<v Speaker 4>things off the internet.</v>

5417
02:27:52.270 --> 02:27:54.630
<v Speaker 4>That was back when people weren't even that good at it.</v>

5418
02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:56.770
<v Speaker 4>Napster file sharing and shit like that.</v>

5419
02:27:56.980 --> 02:27:59.380
<v Speaker 4>Now it's just the fucking game is over.</v>

5420
02:27:59.590 --> 02:28:00.370
<v Speaker 4>The game's over.</v>

5421
02:28:00.370 --> 02:28:02.740
<v Speaker 4>So there's no more money in porn DVDs anymore.</v>

5422
02:28:02.741 --> 02:28:03.574
<v Speaker 4>It's probably,</v>

5423
02:28:03.790 --> 02:28:04.330
<v Speaker 4>I bet it,</v>

5424
02:28:04.330 --> 02:28:05.020
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't,</v>

5425
02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:09.530
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be surprised if it diminished by 95% people will write those.</v>

5426
02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:11.073
<v Speaker 4>They used to,</v>

5427
02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:12.260
<v Speaker 4>but now nobody rents something.</v>

5428
02:28:12.450 --> 02:28:13.580
<v Speaker 4>Now they can,</v>

5429
02:28:14.050 --> 02:28:19.050
<v Speaker 4>they can sell them I guess to direct TV and cable where you can buy videos to</v>

5430
02:28:19.361 --> 02:28:19.691
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

5431
02:28:19.691 --> 02:28:21.440
<v Speaker 4>Cause then if you've flipped through those late night channels,</v>

5432
02:28:21.770 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 4>it's like</v>

5433
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:23.390
<v Speaker 3>10 bucks a movie or something like that,</v>

5434
02:28:23.391 --> 02:28:24.440
<v Speaker 3>or $9 a movie.</v>

5435
02:28:24.441 --> 02:28:24.701
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

5436
02:28:24.701 --> 02:28:25.580
<v Speaker 3>they're always there.</v>

5437
02:28:25.581 --> 02:28:26.780
<v Speaker 3>They always have video.</v>

5438
02:28:26.781 --> 02:28:28.220
<v Speaker 3>So someone's buying content.</v>

5439
02:28:28.490 --> 02:28:31.610
<v Speaker 3>So I'm guessing they're selling something to someone somewhere,</v>

5440
02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:35.780
<v Speaker 3>but it's nothing like the roaring twenties of porn that they had that they</v>

5441
02:28:35.781 --> 02:28:37.880
<v Speaker 3>experienced out here for a couple decades,</v>

5442
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:38.990
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of decades.</v>

5443
02:28:38.991 --> 02:28:39.824
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

5444
02:28:39.890 --> 02:28:42.380
<v Speaker 3>even though it was not respectable,</v>

5445
02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:46.220
<v Speaker 3>there was people that have these giant ass fucking houses and drove Ferrari's</v>

5446
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:47.330
<v Speaker 3>and the neighbors would be like,</v>

5447
02:28:47.331 --> 02:28:47.421
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5448
02:28:47.421 --> 02:28:48.830
<v Speaker 3>who's that guy always in porn?</v>

5449
02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:49.693
<v Speaker 3>He's in porn.</v>

5450
02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:51.770
<v Speaker 3>But it was like he was so rich,</v>

5451
02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:54.290
<v Speaker 3>he didn't candidate the scumbag was living next door to you,</v>

5452
02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:57.590
<v Speaker 3>but this guy was like a porn guy and he would drive front and Ferrari and he was</v>

5453
02:28:57.591 --> 02:29:00.530
<v Speaker 3>making millions and they would laugh at all these people that weren't in the</v>

5454
02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:01.161
<v Speaker 3>porn business.</v>

5455
02:29:01.161 --> 02:29:01.491
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

5456
02:29:01.491 --> 02:29:02.540

5457
02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:03.530

02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:06.020

5461
02:29:06.021 --> 02:29:06.890
<v Speaker 3>but you do buy.</v>

5462
02:29:06.980 --> 02:29:08.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's what my house is.</v>

5463
02:29:08.061 --> 02:29:09.050
<v Speaker 3>So big baby.</v>

5464
02:29:09.410 --> 02:29:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Well that guy doesn't exist anymore.</v>

5465
02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:12.470
<v Speaker 3>That guy doesn't exist now.</v>

5466
02:29:12.471 --> 02:29:15.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like these hustler dudes who are like sticking a camera and a girl's</v>

5485
02:29:39.591 --> 02:29:42.230
<v Speaker 3>behind the green door with Marilyn Chambers.</v>

5486
02:29:42.231 --> 02:29:43.220
<v Speaker 3>That was a porn movie.</v>

5487
02:29:43.221 --> 02:29:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Deep throat was a porn movie.</v>

5488
02:29:45.470 --> 02:29:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Deep throat was a porn movie.</v>

5489
02:29:47.751 --> 02:29:52.751
<v Speaker 3>People went to see it like there's a video of a photo rather of Johnny Carson</v>

5490
02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:54.890
<v Speaker 3>waiting in line to go see deep throat.</v>

5491
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Deep throat was a pornographic movies.</v>

5492
02:29:57.021 --> 02:29:58.070
<v Speaker 3>The chick was sucking Dicks,</v>

5493
02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:01.310
<v Speaker 3>but it was still was a movie and it was an artistic movie.</v>

5494
02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:01.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5495
02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:03.350
<v Speaker 3>that shit doesn't exist anymore.</v>

5496
02:30:03.380 --> 02:30:04.220
<v Speaker 3>That there's no,</v>

5497
02:30:04.250 --> 02:30:05.600
<v Speaker 3>that was back then when you,</v>

5498
02:30:05.601 --> 02:30:06.470
<v Speaker 3>if you made porn,</v>

5499
02:30:06.471 --> 02:30:07.370
<v Speaker 3>it was like you're the only,</v>

5500
02:30:07.371 --> 02:30:09.920
<v Speaker 3>you have the only copy of it to sort of get to,</v>

5501
02:30:09.921 --> 02:30:10.820
<v Speaker 3>so for someone to get it,</v>

5502
02:30:10.821 --> 02:30:12.110
<v Speaker 3>they have to get it from you.</v>

5503
02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:13.460
<v Speaker 3>When you made deep throat,</v>

5504
02:30:13.461 --> 02:30:14.780
<v Speaker 3>there's only one way to get deep throat.</v>

5505
02:30:14.781 --> 02:30:15.860
<v Speaker 3>You've got to get it from the guy who made it.</v>

5506
02:30:15.861 --> 02:30:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Is it going to make more copies of it?</v>

5507
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:18.043
<v Speaker 3>How do I get it?</v>

5508
02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:18.631
<v Speaker 3>It didn't even exist.</v>

5509
02:30:18.631 --> 02:30:20.210
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even a VHS tapes though.</v>

5510
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:23.360
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't even see something again whenever you want it to.</v>

5511
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:25.550
<v Speaker 3>That's why when I saw star wars when I was a little kid,</v>

5512
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:26.091
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

5513
02:30:26.091 --> 02:30:28.070
<v Speaker 3>the thing was you'd go see star wars like 10 times.</v>

5514
02:30:28.071 --> 02:30:28.701
<v Speaker 3>I saw star wars,</v>

5515
02:30:28.701 --> 02:30:31.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like 10 or 13 times or something crazy like that.</v>

5516
02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:32.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what everybody did.</v>

5517
02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:33.350
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>

5518
02:30:33.350 --> 02:30:34.910
<v Speaker 3>Because you couldn't get a DVD.</v>

5519
02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:36.350
<v Speaker 3>There was no DVDs.</v>

5520
02:30:36.351 --> 02:30:38.680
<v Speaker 3>There was no vehicle was gone.</v>

5521
02:30:38.690 --> 02:30:39.523
<v Speaker 3>It was over.</v>

5522
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:40.550
<v Speaker 3>It was over.</v>

5523
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Now we're in the exact opposite.</v>

5524
02:30:42.470 --> 02:30:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm sitting here talking to you and all I have to do is go,</v>

5525
02:30:46.371 --> 02:30:47.150
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

5526
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Well let me go to iTunes real quick.</v>

5527
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:53.600
<v Speaker 3>What the Godfather Dick Order and I'm getting it.</v>

5528
02:30:53.720 --> 02:30:55.160
<v Speaker 3>And then while you're talking,</v>

5529
02:30:55.430 --> 02:30:59.060
<v Speaker 3>I press play and I'm watching the godfather that quickly.</v>

5530
02:30:59.150 --> 02:31:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's ridiculous.</v>

5531
02:31:00.681 --> 02:31:01.514
<v Speaker 3>The saturation.</v>

5532
02:31:02.240 --> 02:31:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Did you go to New York?</v>

5533
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:04.663
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5534
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:07.130

<v Speaker 2>You just want it.</v>

5619
02:33:16.430 --> 02:33:16.701

5624
02:33:20.921 --> 02:33:21.300

02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:21.561
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

5626
02:33:21.561 --> 02:33:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I know you had a common thing for a while.</v>

5627
02:33:22.941 --> 02:33:23.301
<v Speaker 2>What'd you,</v>

5628
02:33:23.301 --> 02:33:24.134
<v Speaker 2>what'd you get into?</v>

5629
02:33:24.140 --> 02:33:25.140
<v Speaker 2>You get hard ons when you,</v>

5630
02:33:25.530 --> 02:33:25.841
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5631
02:33:25.841 --> 02:33:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I never had a problem.</v>

5632
02:33:26.771 --> 02:33:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Not Getting hard on ever with any drug or anything.</v>

5633
02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I think I find it very hard to believe.</v>

5634
02:33:30.491 --> 02:33:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I think once when I was sick,</v>

5635
02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:34.290
<v Speaker 1>like I tried to masturbate when I had like a temperature,</v>

5636
02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:36.550
<v Speaker 1>really high temperature and I couldn't do it once.</v>

5637
02:33:36.551 --> 02:33:37.660
<v Speaker 1>When you're six you couldn't get it up.</v>

5638
02:33:37.810 --> 02:33:39.580
<v Speaker 1>What do you consider it up is you're up.</v>

5639
02:33:39.581 --> 02:33:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Like if I get black eyes draw,</v>

5640
02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I have a harder dick then if I didn't have a drunk.</v>

5641
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.821
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5642
02:33:45.821 --> 02:33:46.960
<v Speaker 1>next time you get black out drunk,</v>

5643
02:33:46.961 --> 02:33:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I want to take a picture of your deck.</v>

5644
02:33:48.110 --> 02:33:48.943
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get it hard.</v>

5645
02:33:49.930 --> 02:33:51.680
<v Speaker 1>You defy the laws of physiology.</v>

5646
02:33:51.681 --> 02:33:52.450
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even make sense.</v>

5647
02:33:52.450 --> 02:33:52.991
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5648
02:33:52.991 --> 02:33:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I seriously like I can call it,</v>

5649
02:33:54.910 --> 02:33:56.180
<v Speaker 1>everybody has a problem.</v>

5650
02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Not only can I have the biggest hard on when I'm drunk.</v>

5651
02:33:59.170 --> 02:34:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I also last like stupid and long amounts of time,</v>

5652
02:34:02.381 --> 02:34:03.460
<v Speaker 1>like an hour and a half.</v>

5653
02:34:03.461 --> 02:34:04.121
<v Speaker 1>That's normal.</v>

5654
02:34:04.121 --> 02:34:07.480
<v Speaker 1>That's because you don't feel as much that that happens with me too,</v>

5655
02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:09.280
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's normal when you're drunk.</v>

5656
02:34:09.281 --> 02:34:09.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5657
02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:09.791
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

5658
02:34:09.791 --> 02:34:10.361
<v Speaker 1>get off dot.</v>

02:34:10.361 --> 02:34:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

5660
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:13.060
<v Speaker 1>But never had not been even such a difference,</v>

5661
02:34:13.061 --> 02:34:13.271
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5662
02:34:13.271 --> 02:34:14.170
<v Speaker 1>People don't smoke.</v>

5663
02:34:14.171 --> 02:34:16.990
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know her fucking feels like when you get high with your,</v>

5664
02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:18.340

02:34:24.371 --> 02:34:25.270
<v Speaker 4>You're not fighting.</v>

5673
02:34:25.271 --> 02:34:26.061
<v Speaker 4>There's no bullshit.</v>

5674
02:34:26.061 --> 02:34:26.891

02:38:13.730 --> 02:38:16.190
<v Speaker 3>I was dating this freak bitch and she would go with me.</v>

5818
02:38:16.191 --> 02:38:17.060
<v Speaker 3>She wanted to fuck all the time.</v>

5819
02:38:17.310 --> 02:38:18.620
<v Speaker 3>She was dirty and she was so dirty.</v>

5820
02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:19.700
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

5821
02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I dated one,</v>

5822
02:38:21.140 --> 02:38:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I did it a few really dirty girls when I was young,</v>

5823
02:38:23.210 --> 02:38:24.440
<v Speaker 3>but this one was just down,</v>

5824
02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:27.350
<v Speaker 3>down DTF all day.</v>

5825
02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:28.610
<v Speaker 3>She was just crazy.</v>

5826
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:32.410
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing when you first start fucking when you're like 15 and 16 that's why</v>

5827
02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

5828
02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:33.950
<v Speaker 3>I always loved that song.</v>

5829
02:38:33.951 --> 02:38:34.760
<v Speaker 3>Night moves,</v>

5830
02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:39.740
<v Speaker 3>that Bob Seger Song because that reminded me of this check because me and this</v>

5831
02:38:39.741 --> 02:38:43.850
<v Speaker 3>chick were just awkward and we were in love with each other supposedly.</v>

5832
02:38:43.851 --> 02:38:45.440
<v Speaker 3>But now really what it really was like,</v>

5833
02:38:45.441 --> 02:38:50.441
<v Speaker 3>we would just go on these horrendous fuck Rampage's to try to escape our reality</v>

5834
02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:53.000
<v Speaker 3>through a relationship,</v>

5835
02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:54.950
<v Speaker 3>through intense sex.</v>

5836
02:38:55.610 --> 02:38:56.151
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

5837
02:38:56.151 --> 02:38:57.440
<v Speaker 3>just the awkwardness of growing up.</v>

5838
02:38:57.441 --> 02:38:58.640
<v Speaker 3>But that night moves song,</v>

5839
02:38:59.290 --> 02:39:01.970
<v Speaker 2>I live a pussy made me get loved back in the sixth grade.</v>

5840
02:39:01.971 --> 02:39:02.804

02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:06.330
<v Speaker 2>they would tell you about the six grade we and what does this experience?</v>

5845
02:39:08.661 --> 02:39:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I was in love with this girl in New York,</v>

5846

<v Speaker 2>12.</v>

5848
02:39:11.541 --> 02:39:15.310
<v Speaker 2>She was a skinny little fucking Cuban chick and a follow up downstairs.</v>

5849
02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:18.110
<v Speaker 2>The mother was hot and every afternoon when she would say to me,</v>

5853
02:39:20.930 --> 02:39:21.920
<v Speaker 2>but we can't date though.</v>

5854

<v Speaker 2>School ends.</v>

5857
02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:30.620
<v Speaker 2>I brother would beat in like each other and I reacted and I bring over to my</v>

5858
02:39:30.621 --> 02:39:30.891
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

5859
02:39:30.891 --> 02:39:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I put on earth one of the fire,</v>

5864
02:39:41.500 --> 02:39:45.620
<v Speaker 2>And finally they had those little funnel to these in the sixth grade.</v>

5865
02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:48.410
<v Speaker 2>The best was my mother hated when she would be in the room,</v>

5866
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:49.970
<v Speaker 2>like my mother would come home and go,</v>

5871
02:39:57.261 --> 02:40:01.130
<v Speaker 2>And one day my mother paid one of the guys from the bar to go over there and get</v>

5872
02:40:01.131 --> 02:40:01.964
<v Speaker 2>a ladder.</v>

5873
02:40:02.390 --> 02:40:03.141

<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>

5881
02:40:13.471 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden I hear,</v>

5882
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:14.963

5890
02:40:26.090 --> 02:40:27.340
<v Speaker 2>broke the phone off the ladders.</v>

02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I was in the sixth grade,</v>

5918
02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I was in the sixth grade and then what happened was we got caught playing hooky,</v>

5919
02:41:29.131 --> 02:41:33.090
<v Speaker 2>so it was like a endless love by parents told us we couldn't hang out with each</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5925
02:41:39.391 --> 02:41:40.350
<v Speaker 2>That's all I would think about.</v>

5926
02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:43.830
<v Speaker 2>She would eat her til six I would go home and eat dinner and then we'd get on</v>

5927

<v Speaker 5>I was a prude.</v>

5998
02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:19.470
<v Speaker 5>I was very prudish.</v>

5999
02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:20.470
<v Speaker 5>Did come in there.</v>

6002
02:43:28.121 --> 02:43:28.954
<v Speaker 5>idea.</v>

6004
02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:31.330
<v Speaker 5>You know I'm coming again.</v>

6005
02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:32.530
<v Speaker 5>But I didn't like it.</v>

6006
02:43:32.531 --> 02:43:33.161
<v Speaker 5>Like I said to him,</v>

6007
02:43:33.161 --> 02:43:34.270
<v Speaker 5>I really didn't like that stuff.</v>

6008
02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:34.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why.</v>

6009
02:43:34.990 --> 02:43:35.823
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know why.</v>

6010
02:43:36.130 --> 02:43:36.970
<v Speaker 5>It was really weird.</v>

6011
02:43:36.971 --> 02:43:37.780
<v Speaker 5>I was uh,</v>

6012
02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:42.340
<v Speaker 5>I was approved to a fucking a long time dog then I didn't give a fuck what you</v>

6013
02:43:42.341 --> 02:43:43.450
<v Speaker 5>probably saw vice,</v>

6014
02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:45.550
<v Speaker 5>he saw so much vice as a kid.</v>

6015
02:43:45.551 --> 02:43:47.080
<v Speaker 5>You saw so many things that you would like,</v>

6016
02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:49.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to avoid all these problems.</v>

6017
02:43:49.481 --> 02:43:51.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to avoid all this shit that I see around me.</v>

6018
02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:52.660
<v Speaker 5>I see chaos,</v>

02:43:53.831 --> 02:43:54.910
<v Speaker 5>I see loss.</v>

6021
02:43:55.090 --> 02:43:56.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to avoid all this vice.</v>

6022
02:43:56.351 --> 02:43:57.280
<v Speaker 5>That's the only thing that makes sense.</v>

6023
02:43:57.281 --> 02:43:58.600
<v Speaker 5>If you didn't want a girl touching your Dick,</v>

6024
02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:03.100
<v Speaker 5>you obviously rejecting the fucking suck.</v>

6026
02:44:04.091 --> 02:44:04.924
<v Speaker 5>I was the captain,</v>

6027
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:07.510
<v Speaker 5>but then I was a captain.</v>

6028
02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:09.490
<v Speaker 5>He didn't want them to touch your dick at all,</v>

6029
02:44:09.491 --> 02:44:10.870
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't do anything to them.</v>

6030
02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:13.150
<v Speaker 5>Like what are you worried about doing something?</v>

6031
02:44:13.151 --> 02:44:13.481
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

6032
02:44:13.481 --> 02:44:14.370
<v Speaker 5>What were you worried about?</v>

6033
02:44:14.371 --> 02:44:16.150
<v Speaker 5>Like what was it about that they were dirty.</v>

6034
02:44:16.151 --> 02:44:16.970
<v Speaker 5>If they touch my,</v>

6035
02:44:16.970 --> 02:44:18.370
<v Speaker 5>like if a woman grabbed your dick,</v>

6036
02:44:18.371 --> 02:44:19.204
<v Speaker 5>she was dirty.</v>

6037
02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:20.320
<v Speaker 5>She was crazy.</v>

6038
02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:23.380
<v Speaker 5>You know how like people would all smoke pot and look at people smoke pot.</v>

6039
02:44:24.450 --> 02:44:25.630
<v Speaker 5>They see a hallucination.</v>

6040
02:44:26.260 --> 02:44:27.160
<v Speaker 5>They see the devil.</v>

6041
02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:28.210
<v Speaker 5>That's what I,</v>

6042
02:44:28.210 --> 02:44:30.340
<v Speaker 5>I've had some conversations with really rational people.</v>

6043
02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:30.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6044
02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:31.660
<v Speaker 5>so I've had that.</v>

6045
02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:34.180
<v Speaker 5>We tell him you smoke pot and they blow a fuse.</v>

6046
02:44:34.180 --> 02:44:35.470
<v Speaker 5>Like they don't know how to talk to you anymore.</v>

6047
02:44:35.471 --> 02:44:37.240
<v Speaker 5>You see like the hiccup in their system,</v>

6048
02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:39.560
<v Speaker 5>what smoke pot</v>

6049
02:44:41.310 --> 02:44:42.280

6056
02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:52.840
<v Speaker 5>We were fucking backyard buddies.</v>

6057
02:44:52.841 --> 02:44:53.081
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6058

02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:57.910
<v Speaker 5>we shared a backyard and I had a friend of mine who stole bicycles and he would</v>

<v Speaker 5>He was a mechanic so he took,</v>

6071
02:45:08.741 --> 02:45:09.580
<v Speaker 5>gave me this tense Pete,</v>

6072
02:45:09.581 --> 02:45:09.971

6076
02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:14.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm playing and we was a bunch of kids.</v>

6077
02:45:15.010 --> 02:45:16.960
<v Speaker 5>I was in the seventh grade cause I got left back.</v>

6078
02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:18.490
<v Speaker 5>She was now in the eighth grade.</v>

6079
02:45:18.491 --> 02:45:20.560
<v Speaker 5>I was the eighth grade and she was a freshman.</v>

6080
02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:21.453
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was.</v>

6081
02:45:21.730 --> 02:45:23.890
<v Speaker 5>And we were all playing on the same block and uh,</v>

6082
02:45:24.310 --> 02:45:25.180
<v Speaker 5>she took the bike.</v>

6083
02:45:25.870 --> 02:45:26.381
<v Speaker 5>Somebody said,</v>

6084
02:45:26.381 --> 02:45:27.011
<v Speaker 5>go to the store.</v>

6085
02:45:27.011 --> 02:45:27.850
<v Speaker 5>She threw the pack and I go,</v>

6086
02:45:27.851 --> 02:45:28.684
<v Speaker 5>where's the bag?</v>

6087
02:45:28.810 --> 02:45:29.680
<v Speaker 5>And they sit in New York.</v>

6088
02:45:29.681 --> 02:45:30.041
<v Speaker 5>It took it,</v>

6089
02:45:30.041 --> 02:45:31.060
<v Speaker 5>she's going to the store.</v>

6090
02:45:31.330 --> 02:45:33.100
<v Speaker 5>This was a block that was circular.</v>

6091
02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:34.030
<v Speaker 5>What do you call those blocks?</v>

6092
02:45:34.090 --> 02:45:35.470
<v Speaker 5>Culta sacs called the sex.</v>

6093
02:45:35.471 --> 02:45:36.880
<v Speaker 5>And the middle has like an island.</v>

6094
02:45:36.970 --> 02:45:37.770
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

6095
02:45:37.770 --> 02:45:41.650
<v Speaker 5>So I was on one side of the street playing to win football and she was riding a</v>

6096
02:45:41.651 --> 02:45:42.484
<v Speaker 5>bike this way.</v>

6097
02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:46.060
<v Speaker 5>So me and my friends started running at her bro.</v>

6098
02:45:46.090 --> 02:45:47.500
<v Speaker 5>The steering is loose,</v>

6099
02:45:47.980 --> 02:45:50.140
<v Speaker 5>but she thought we were going to fucking chase her.</v>

6100
02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:51.101
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

6101
02:45:51.101 --> 02:45:52.840
<v Speaker 5>Like we were chasing and take the bike away from.</v>

6102
02:45:52.860 --> 02:45:53.111
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

6103
02:45:53.111 --> 02:45:53.271
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

6104
02:45:53.271 --> 02:45:54.130
<v Speaker 5>I'll take the bike.</v>

6105
02:45:54.430 --> 02:45:55.540
<v Speaker 5>But the student was loose,</v>

6106
02:45:55.541 --> 02:45:56.374
<v Speaker 5>don't make a turn.</v>

6107
02:45:56.430 --> 02:45:57.310
<v Speaker 5>But she's giggling,</v>

6108
02:45:57.400 --> 02:45:58.233
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

6109
02:45:59.450 --> 02:45:59.790
<v Speaker 5>The fuck.</v>

6110
02:45:59.790 --> 02:46:01.150
<v Speaker 5>And she went to make the turn.</v>

6111
02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:02.020
<v Speaker 5>She flew over,</v>

6112
02:46:02.021 --> 02:46:03.100
<v Speaker 5>it landed,</v>

6113
02:46:03.101 --> 02:46:04.000
<v Speaker 5>we got up,</v>

6114
02:46:04.330 --> 02:46:05.163
<v Speaker 5>she went home.</v>

6115
02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:07.720
<v Speaker 5>The next day I walked to school and they're like,</v>

6116
02:46:07.721 --> 02:46:08.510
<v Speaker 5>come in for a second.</v>

6117
02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:09.360
<v Speaker 5>Remember your girlfriend?</v>

6118
02:46:09.361 --> 02:46:10.400
<v Speaker 5>She's in critical condition.</v>

6119
02:46:10.910 --> 02:46:13.460
<v Speaker 4>She landed on her head and got a blood clot in the middle of five note.</v>

6120
02:46:13.610 --> 02:46:14.210
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

6121
02:46:14.210 --> 02:46:15.260
<v Speaker 4>she had a shave her head.</v>

6122
02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:16.940
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you how good looking this girl was.</v>

6123
02:46:17.450 --> 02:46:20.540
<v Speaker 4>She still won homecoming queen with the ball fucking handle.</v>

6124
02:46:20.930 --> 02:46:21.591
<v Speaker 4>So what'd they do?</v>

6125
02:46:21.591 --> 02:46:23.370
<v Speaker 4>They have to open our open the skull.</v>

6126
02:46:23.390 --> 02:46:26.570
<v Speaker 4>And the weird thing was that she was always flat chest and after I bumped her</v>

6127
02:46:26.571 --> 02:46:26.980
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>

6128
02:46:26.980 --> 02:46:29.600
<v Speaker 4>her kids got gigantic.</v>

6129
02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:31.100
<v Speaker 4>I bumped to the head,</v>

6130
02:46:31.101 --> 02:46:31.934
<v Speaker 4>made her tick,</v>

6131
02:46:32.090 --> 02:46:35.120
<v Speaker 4>but it was really bad because our families were mad at each other.</v>

6132
02:46:35.180 --> 02:46:37.500
<v Speaker 4>And I remember one day her brother was like a dick.</v>

6133
02:46:37.501 --> 02:46:39.900
<v Speaker 4>He didn't like me and him and his father came home.</v>

6134
02:46:39.901 --> 02:46:41.390
<v Speaker 4>My house like to talk to me,</v>

6135
02:46:41.660 --> 02:46:43.100
<v Speaker 4>but my stepfather was in the yard.</v>

6136
02:46:43.101 --> 02:46:46.550
<v Speaker 4>That's the first time I seen him pull a gun on somebody in Jersey.</v>

6137
02:46:46.551 --> 02:46:48.800
<v Speaker 4>Like I never seen him pull a gun on somebody in Jersey.</v>

6138
02:46:49.220 --> 02:46:50.600
<v Speaker 4>That's the time he went out there and he goes,</v>

6139
02:46:50.601 --> 02:46:55.130
<v Speaker 4>check with that 45 these motherfuckers got back and they called back and they</v>

6140
02:46:55.131 --> 02:46:58.910
<v Speaker 4>turned around cause they knew my dad had a reputation but not jersey.</v>

6141
02:46:58.911 --> 02:47:00.070
<v Speaker 4>He was like nine jerseys.</v>

6142
02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:00.621
<v Speaker 4>His house,</v>

6143
02:47:00.621 --> 02:47:01.610
<v Speaker 4>he didn't want any problems.</v>

6144
02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:04.940
<v Speaker 4>He would hide his guns in his yard so they wouldn't be in his house.</v>

6145
02:47:05.210 --> 02:47:09.500
<v Speaker 4>We were out there mowed the lawn and also we've seen the white corvette bro.</v>

6146
02:47:09.501 --> 02:47:10.131
<v Speaker 4>And I go dad,</v>

<v Speaker 4>even hesitate.</v>

6152
02:47:14.631 --> 02:47:15.680
<v Speaker 4>He just went right over.</v>

6153
02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:17.540
<v Speaker 4>He lived a Martin Scorsese movie.</v>

6199
02:48:35.961 --> 02:48:37.100
<v Speaker 4>They didn't like me in the beginning.</v>

6200
02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:37.640
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

6201
02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.630
<v Speaker 4>They weren't our regular people really.</v>

6202
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:42.590
<v Speaker 4>That clubs kind of uncomfortable for me.</v>

6203
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:43.783
<v Speaker 4>I always do.</v>

6204
02:48:46.190 --> 02:48:47.023
<v Speaker 4>That's so cool.</v>

6205
02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:48.711
<v Speaker 4>You know what it is?</v>

6206
02:48:48.711 --> 02:48:48.981
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

6207
02:48:48.981 --> 02:48:49.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6208
02:48:49.300 --> 02:48:49.531
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

6209
02:48:49.531 --> 02:48:50.600
<v Speaker 4>you start off first.</v>

6210
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:52.070
<v Speaker 4>So going up first is always harder.</v>

6211
02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:53.510
<v Speaker 4>Going up first is a weird thing.</v>

6212
02:48:53.511 --> 02:48:55.280
<v Speaker 4>You gotta gotta get them in the groove.</v>

6213
02:48:55.281 --> 02:48:57.230
<v Speaker 4>They're not asked me.</v>

6214
02:48:57.500 --> 02:48:58.550
<v Speaker 4>I went up there to fight.</v>

6215
02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:00.230
<v Speaker 4>He was sick and he was sick.</v>

6216
02:49:00.231 --> 02:49:03.860
<v Speaker 4>Then I will get too fast and try to be thinking about the last set you had</v>

6217
02:49:03.861 --> 02:49:04.280
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

6218
02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:04.551
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

6219
02:49:04.551 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 4>I have my news because of that club and because of my last set there.</v>

6220
02:49:08.251 --> 02:49:08.641
<v Speaker 4>I have it.</v>

6221
02:49:08.641 --> 02:49:10.140
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes of clean material now.</v>

6222
02:49:10.710 --> 02:49:11.390
<v Speaker 4>Well that's good.</v>

6223
02:49:11.390 --> 02:49:11.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6224
02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:13.470
<v Speaker 4>You should always have just tools.</v>

6225
02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:13.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6226
02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:15.360
<v Speaker 4>You can just whip out there that in the back.</v>

6227
02:49:15.930 --> 02:49:16.920
<v Speaker 4>It's not even just,</v>

6228
02:49:16.921 --> 02:49:17.940
<v Speaker 4>there's still no you,</v>

6229
02:49:17.941 --> 02:49:18.241
<v Speaker 4>you like,</v>

6230
02:49:18.241 --> 02:49:22.140
<v Speaker 4>your comedy is so weird and if someone knows you then it makes sense.</v>

6231
02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:24.960
<v Speaker 4>But it's like there's so many comics that that's the case.</v>

6232
02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Like when someone like,</v>

6233
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:27.930
<v Speaker 4>not that you're Mitch Hedberg,</v>

6234
02:49:28.110 --> 02:49:30.210
<v Speaker 4>Mitch Hedberg used to bomb all the fucking time.</v>

6235
02:49:30.211 --> 02:49:31.044
<v Speaker 4>If people didn't know him,</v>

6236
02:49:31.050 --> 02:49:33.780
<v Speaker 4>then once they knew him then people would come to see it.</v>

6237
02:49:34.050 --> 02:49:34.411
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

6238
02:49:34.411 --> 02:49:35.910
<v Speaker 4>But you're a fucking Weirdo dude.</v>

6239
02:49:35.911 --> 02:49:38.810
<v Speaker 4>And people don't know why you're throwing calm on the wall and a hotel room like</v>

6240
02:49:38.820 --> 02:49:40.110
<v Speaker 4>the fuck is this idiot doing.</v>

6241
02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:41.340
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

6242
02:49:41.370 --> 02:49:41.581
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6243
02:49:41.581 --> 02:49:42.480
<v Speaker 4>you're a grown man.</v>

6244
02:49:42.481 --> 02:49:44.120
<v Speaker 4>You're not 12 years old and you know,</v>

6245
02:49:44.130 --> 02:49:45.690
<v Speaker 4>like saying some cutesy Shit,</v>

6246
02:49:45.691 --> 02:49:48.780
<v Speaker 4>you're almost 40 and you're talking about throwing loads like Spiderman on the</v>

6247
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:50.430
<v Speaker 4>wall and people are like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6250
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:54.840
<v Speaker 4>So until they know you from the podcast,</v>

6251
02:49:54.841 --> 02:49:55.950
<v Speaker 4>that's a tough pill to swallow,</v>

6252

<v Speaker 4>son.</v>

6253

<v Speaker 4>Once they know you,</v>

6254
02:49:57.481 --> 02:49:57.960

02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:05.190
<v Speaker 4>And also tonight we have the icehouse chronicles that goes off about tenish.</v>

6260
02:50:05.670 --> 02:50:08.760
<v Speaker 4>We usually do it about a half an hour before the podcast and if you want to tune</v>

6261
02:50:08.761 --> 02:50:09.240
<v Speaker 4>into that,</v>

6262
02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:13.180
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be right here on this motherfucker right here on this Ustream</v>

6263
02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:13.561
<v Speaker 4>channel,</v>

6264
02:50:13.561 --> 02:50:14.550
<v Speaker 4>bitches or Brian.</v>

6266
02:50:16.921 --> 02:50:18.300
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were going to go back and rename me.</v>

6267
02:50:18.301 --> 02:50:19.680
<v Speaker 4>So that would take forever.</v>

6268
02:50:19.710 --> 02:50:19.981
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6269
02:50:19.981 --> 02:50:20.701

02:50:20.970 --> 02:50:21.560
<v Speaker 4>You got to do that,</v>

6272
02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:21.711
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6273
02:50:21.711 --> 02:50:26.520
<v Speaker 4>I can't just have Joe Rogan live and not know these is used stream.</v>

6274
02:50:26.850 --> 02:50:30.100
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people do these Vimeo or youtube,</v>

6275
02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:31.020
<v Speaker 4>they use this too.</v>

6276
02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:31.241
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6277
02:50:31.241 --> 02:50:32.100
<v Speaker 4>I know what I'm saying,</v>

6278
02:50:32.101 --> 02:50:32.780
<v Speaker 4>but do you know,</v>

6279
02:50:32.780 --> 02:50:37.780
<v Speaker 4>they may not know why the amount of people that rewatch it on Ustream instead of</v>

6280
02:50:37.801 --> 02:50:42.801
<v Speaker 4>youtube or Vimeo is like 1.0007% that's not true.</v>

6281
02:50:43.410 --> 02:50:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Not only,</v>

6282
02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:44.850
<v Speaker 4>not only is that not true,</v>

6283
02:50:44.851 --> 02:50:45.511
<v Speaker 4>you don't know.</v>

6284
02:50:45.511 --> 02:50:48.420
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of people that take clips off of these things.</v>

6285
02:50:49.020 --> 02:50:50.510
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for them to find what the,</v>

6286
02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:51.353
<v Speaker 4>what the um,</v>

6287
02:50:51.630 --> 02:50:51.841
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6288
02:50:51.841 --> 02:50:52.650
<v Speaker 4>it's not off youtube.</v>

6289
02:50:52.650 --> 02:50:53.011
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>

6290
02:50:53.011 --> 02:50:54.030
<v Speaker 4>it's also when you stream,</v>

6291
02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:55.410
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them have a lot of use,</v>

6292
02:50:55.411 --> 02:50:56.050
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

6293
02:50:56.050 --> 02:50:57.270
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these have a lot of views.</v>

6294
02:50:57.360 --> 02:50:57.631
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

6295
02:50:57.631 --> 02:51:00.150
<v Speaker 4>And it happens before it goes up on Vimeo.</v>

6296
02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:01.110
<v Speaker 4>Once it's on Vimeo,</v>

6297
02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:02.190
<v Speaker 4>that the amount of people,</v>

6298
02:51:02.250 --> 02:51:03.750
<v Speaker 4>once it's on Vimeo and Youtube,</v>

6299
02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:05.130
<v Speaker 4>like 0.0,</v>

6300
02:51:05.470 --> 02:51:05.911
<v Speaker 4>that's all good.</v>

6301
02:51:05.911 --> 02:51:07.260
<v Speaker 4>But it's still has thousands of views.</v>

6302
02:51:07.410 --> 02:51:07.621
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6303
02:51:07.621 --> 02:51:08.820
<v Speaker 4>because it happens before.</v>

6304
02:51:08.850 --> 02:51:09.331
<v Speaker 4>But Brian,</v>

6305
02:51:09.331 --> 02:51:10.120
<v Speaker 4>that's happening right now.</v>

6306
02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:11.100
<v Speaker 4>Still need to be labeled.</v>

6307
02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:12.053
<v Speaker 4>They need to be late.</v>

6308
02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:13.740
<v Speaker 4>We talked about this before.</v>

6309
02:51:13.741 --> 02:51:15.210
<v Speaker 4>You can't just not label them.</v>

6310
02:51:15.300 --> 02:51:16.200
<v Speaker 4>That's just crazy.</v>

6311
02:51:16.890 --> 02:51:17.270
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

6312
02:51:17.270 --> 02:51:18.091
<v Speaker 4>What should happen is,</v>

6313
02:51:18.091 --> 02:51:20.710
<v Speaker 4>is when I label it at the end of every podcast,</v>

6314
02:51:20.711 --> 02:51:22.050
<v Speaker 4>you should save the label,</v>

6315
02:51:22.051 --> 02:51:23.550
<v Speaker 4>but for some reason it doesn't it.</v>

6316
02:51:23.610 --> 02:51:23.881
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6317
02:51:23.881 --> 02:51:24.750
<v Speaker 4>there is a glitch,</v>

6318
02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:26.670
<v Speaker 4>but we still have to label them anywhere.</v>

6319
02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:27.460
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

6320

6326
02:51:32.581 --> 02:51:34.070

6327
02:51:34.970 --> 02:51:35.850
<v Speaker 4>You fucked up pal.</v>

6328
02:51:35.910 --> 02:51:38.810
<v Speaker 4>If there's any reason to watch a on Ustream,</v>

6329
02:51:38.820 --> 02:51:39.110
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

6330
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:41.460
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason to watch it on Ustream Maynard's on Bryant.</v>

6331
02:51:41.950 --> 02:51:43.350
<v Speaker 4>If they want to watch on Ustream,</v>

6332
02:51:43.351 --> 02:51:44.700
<v Speaker 4>they should be able to watch on Ustream.</v>

6333
02:51:44.701 --> 02:51:46.200
<v Speaker 4>We just didn't needs on Ustream,</v>

6334
02:51:46.201 --> 02:51:48.090
<v Speaker 4>which just it needs to be labeled anywhere.</v>

6335
02:51:48.091 --> 02:51:48.481
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

6336
02:51:48.481 --> 02:51:49.380
<v Speaker 4>It needs to be labeled.</v>

6337
02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:52.080
<v Speaker 4>You can't just have watch it and find out who the guest is.</v>

6338
02:51:52.081 --> 02:51:52.531
<v Speaker 4>That's silly.</v>

6339
02:51:52.531 --> 02:51:53.370
<v Speaker 4>We need to label it.</v>

6340
02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:54.233
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6341
02:51:54.300 --> 02:51:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6342
02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:58.740
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody on Twitter would agree and I think majority of people probably</v>

6343
02:51:58.741 --> 02:52:00.570
<v Speaker 4>watching it on youtube or Vimeo.</v>

6344

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6345
02:52:00.750 --> 02:52:04.410
<v Speaker 4>they're watching it right now on Ustream and they might go back to it and watch</v>

6346
02:52:04.411 --> 02:52:04.810
<v Speaker 4>it again.</v>

6347
02:52:04.810 --> 02:52:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Thousands of people do.</v>

6348
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:07.120
<v Speaker 4>This is a silly conversation,</v>

02:52:07.121 --> 02:52:07.840
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>

6350

<v Speaker 4>I asked you to do it and you didn't do it.</v>

6351
02:52:09.250 --> 02:52:10.860
<v Speaker 4>It's all it is now.</v>

02:52:19.210 --> 02:52:19.841
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

6366
02:52:25.230 --> 02:52:25.901
<v Speaker 4>We're not even doing it.</v>

6367
02:52:25.901 --> 02:52:30.901
<v Speaker 4>Told me to stop recording so we have time to give you more time to give you more</v>

6368

6369
02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:34.880
<v Speaker 4>for going back and labeling to give you more time to do other shit.</v>

6370
02:52:34.881 --> 02:52:37.360
<v Speaker 4>They need to do a hired somebody to do that.</v>

6371

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6377
02:52:45.180 --> 02:52:46.570

6378
02:52:46.571 --> 02:52:47.680
<v Speaker 4>they don't know.</v>

6379
02:52:47.681 --> 02:52:51.980
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is if you go to Joe rogan.net where everyone goes to watch in an</v>

6380
02:52:52.010 --> 02:52:52.300
<v Speaker 4>overbearing,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I know your point.</v>

6383
02:52:53.591 --> 02:52:57.160
<v Speaker 4>But the bottom line is it's on the Internet on Ustream.</v>

6384
02:52:57.190 --> 02:53:00.550
<v Speaker 4>There's the channel where people watch the show live when they want to watch</v>

6385
02:53:00.570 --> 02:53:03.730
<v Speaker 4>your life and none of those things are labeled right.</v>

6386
02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:05.350
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is if you're going,</v>

<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

6399
02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:14.190
<v Speaker 4>what's he going to do?</v>

6400
02:53:14.190 --> 02:53:16.160
<v Speaker 4>St TV backslash Joe Rogan.</v>

6401
02:53:16.161 --> 02:53:16.330
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

6402
02:53:16.330 --> 02:53:18.020
<v Speaker 4>they would because that's where they watch it live.</v>

6403
02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:19.300
<v Speaker 4>You don't think they bookmark that?</v>

6404
02:53:19.330 --> 02:53:20.950
<v Speaker 4>They watch it live all the time.</v>

6405
02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:21.550
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

6406
02:53:21.550 --> 02:53:21.960
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

6407
02:53:21.960 --> 02:53:22.331
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

6408
02:53:22.331 --> 02:53:22.631
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

6409
02:53:22.631 --> 02:53:25.120
<v Speaker 4>It sucks and I know I'll have somebody do it,</v>

6410
02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:30.420
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just saying it's really ridiculous to watch it on like an inferior,</v>

6411
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:33.160
<v Speaker 4>like the version on Vimeo.</v>

6412
02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:33.940
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

6413
02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:34.930
<v Speaker 4>The version on Youtube.</v>

6414
02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:35.710
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

6415
02:53:35.710 --> 02:53:36.510
<v Speaker 4>Both of those are,</v>

6416
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:36.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6417
02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:38.050
<v Speaker 4>easily on your phones,</v>

6418
02:53:38.051 --> 02:53:39.880
<v Speaker 4>on your DVD players or new TVs.</v>

6419
02:53:40.120 --> 02:53:41.520
<v Speaker 4>Like totally understand.</v>

6420
02:53:41.610 --> 02:53:42.490
<v Speaker 4>They still watch it.</v>

6421
02:53:42.650 --> 02:53:44.740
<v Speaker 4>I told her son that however it is there,</v>

6422
02:53:44.741 --> 02:53:45.760
<v Speaker 4>and people do watch it,</v>

6423
02:53:45.761 --> 02:53:46.660
<v Speaker 4>so it needs to be labeled.</v>

6424
02:53:46.690 --> 02:53:48.020
<v Speaker 4>There's one guy somewhere in Iowa,</v>

6425
02:53:48.150 --> 02:53:49.030
<v Speaker 4>so a lot of people do.</v>

6426
02:53:49.031 --> 02:53:52.480
<v Speaker 4>There's thousands of views on all of these videos that you're watching it right</v>

6427
02:53:52.481 --> 02:53:53.314
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

6428
02:53:54.100 --> 02:53:55.930
<v Speaker 4>that maybe and a little bit in the future,</v>

6429
02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:57.250
<v Speaker 4>but they need to know what they're watching.</v>

6430
02:53:57.730 --> 02:53:58.451
<v Speaker 4>It's not that big a deal,</v>

<v Speaker 4>The Mandalay Bay one is,</v>

6456
02:54:32.081 --> 02:54:34.480
<v Speaker 4>we're doing the Wayans ladies and gentlemen,</v>

6457
02:54:34.481 --> 02:54:36.610
<v Speaker 4>where the wins are for the UFC.</v>

6458
02:54:36.611 --> 02:54:38.890
<v Speaker 4>It seats like think it's like 3000 people.</v>

6459
02:54:39.070 --> 02:54:39.903
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're doing.</v>

6460
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:40.421
<v Speaker 4>We're doing,</v>

6461
02:54:40.421 --> 02:54:42.100
<v Speaker 4>when they block it off for the wins,</v>

6462
02:54:42.250 --> 02:54:43.990
<v Speaker 4>that's the area we're going to do comedy yet.</v>

6463
02:54:43.991 --> 02:54:47.610
<v Speaker 4>And there was the idea of Mandalay bay because we used to do that theater that</v>

6464
02:54:47.620 --> 02:54:48.100
<v Speaker 4>they had.</v>

6465
02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:48.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6466
02:54:48.740 --> 02:54:49.080
<v Speaker 4>what was,</v>

6467
02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:52.060
<v Speaker 4>what was the show that things like the lion king and they,</v>

6468
02:54:52.061 --> 02:54:52.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6469
02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:53.193
<v Speaker 4>they changed that.</v>

6470
02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:57.340
<v Speaker 4>They're doing a new Michael Jackson type thing and they're building it up right</v>

6471
02:54:57.341 --> 02:54:57.551
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

6472
02:54:57.551 --> 02:54:59.050
<v Speaker 4>So that thing is closed.</v>

6473
02:54:59.051 --> 02:55:00.490
<v Speaker 4>So it was their idea to do that.</v>

6474
02:55:00.491 --> 02:55:01.990
<v Speaker 4>So this is the first time we're ever doing this.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We're going to do the Mandalay Bay theater and that's August 31st and again,</v>
