00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.290
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually beat him if you're</v>

2
00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:07.690
<v Speaker 1>going to push it all the,</v>

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.910
<v Speaker 2>what is it in your brain that makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that?</v>

4
00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Cause like we just looked at your mvps</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you burned a thousand calories.</v>

5
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Is there some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to Pat McAfee one time,</v>

6
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 2>he said it's about exclusivity.</v>

7
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It's about rape and murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my head's filled with it.</v>

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Stopping rapists and stop and murderers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and killing child molesters.</v>

9
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think about killing bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>people when you work out.</v>

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do when I get tired.</v>

11
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 1>If I get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about like saving someone I care</v>

12
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about stopping someone who's</v>

13
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>trying to murder someone I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think about.</v>

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>I love your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

15
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I think about my second wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about protecting people I care</v>

16
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you tell,</v>

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you told me one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>if it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll go a pretending someone is trying</v>

19
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:54.950
<v Speaker 1>to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're like pretending.</v>

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't have words for that.</v>

22
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's,</v>

23
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 1>that's what if you think about worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>case scenario,</v>

24
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.290
<v Speaker 1>you're tired and someone's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill someone you care about and you</v>

25
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>don't have enough energy to stop them.</v>

26
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.480
<v Speaker 2>But do you think you learned that switch</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like a tie?</v>

27
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Tuck one or not taekwondo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

28
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

30
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.230

<v Speaker 1>because that's the scariest place you</v>

33
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>could ever be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the scariest place you could be is</v>

34
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like it just putting yourself in</v>

<v Speaker 3>like me finding standup and I get so</v>

147
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 3>much cool stuff in the works and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bravo's show,</v>

148
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.291
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

149
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 3>you just can't take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>

150
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:49.324
<v Speaker 3>take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

151
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give them my family and all that.</v>

152
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after we have to figure something out</v>

153
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when I saw that I'm like,</v>

154
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome man.</v>

155
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 3>They think that it's because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>singular</v>

156
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 1>aspect of their diet and the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've eliminated everything else,</v>

157
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't do any studying of</v>

158
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>elimination diets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't do any study of the prolonged</v>

159
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>benefits of fasting and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that you're talking</v>

160
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think are v there.</v>

161
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.330
<v Speaker 1>These are all factors in this really</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated thing that's going on that</v>

162
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 1>most likely has something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their gut biome and their immune system.</v>

163
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.750
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

164
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are two major confounding factors</v>

165
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.630
<v Speaker 4>was like so major,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

166
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:31.800
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

167
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.420
<v Speaker 4>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just important to approach this</v>

168
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.710
<v Speaker 4>like a science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

169
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.570
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not like a religion,</v>

170
00:06:39.571 --> 00:06:41.190
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are you want to believe something.</v>

171
00:06:41.191 --> 00:06:42.810
<v Speaker 4>And so you just find,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

172
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this study that I also see circulating</v>

173
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.460
<v Speaker 4>lot around that why plants are really</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad to eat.</v>

174
00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:51.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're there means that the insect anti</v>

175
00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:53.820
<v Speaker 4>nutrients or pesticides or my former</v>
<v Speaker 4>mentor.</v>

176
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.400
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr. Bruce Ames who spent his entire</v>

177
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.230
<v Speaker 4>career like advocating micro nutrients</v>
<v Speaker 4>from vegetables and from me and from</v>

178
00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:01.900
<v Speaker 4>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

179
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.040
<v Speaker 4>It's like so ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you actually read the paper,</v>

180
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.990
<v Speaker 4>not only does it say it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

181
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.090
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these insect anti feed ins like</v>

182
00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:12.250
<v Speaker 4>sulforaphane don't cause cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it also goes,</v>

183
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.890
<v Speaker 4>has a whole section on Heterocyclic</v>
<v Speaker 4>aimings from cooked meat.</v>

184
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.830
<v Speaker 4>So if you really want to use that paper</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an argument,</v>

185
00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:22.800
<v Speaker 4>why to not eat plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then maybe read the paper and realize,</v>

186
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.630
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also talking about Heterocyclic</v>

187
00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:27.630
<v Speaker 4>aimings as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The point of the paper was like,</v>

188
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting a little motion him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry sir.</v>

189
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

190
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the getting out of your robot.</v>

191
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.130
<v Speaker 4>The point of the paper was basically not</v>
<v Speaker 4>to worry about like some of the amounts</v>

192
00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:40.230
<v Speaker 4>that you're being exposed to you with</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of these natural,</v>

193
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ants in sec anti feed that are found in</v>

194
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:46.230
<v Speaker 4>plants and some of the cook things and</v>
<v Speaker 4>meet and as well as some of the</v>

195
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.680
<v Speaker 4>pesticides that are found in synthetic</v>
<v Speaker 4>pesticides because it basically that</v>

196
00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:52.110
<v Speaker 4>they're in such small amounts that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that was kind of the point of the</v>

197
00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:54.270
<v Speaker 4>paper was back in the 90s.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

198
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.940
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just think that it's a little,</v>

199
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how hypocritical to use a</v>
<v Speaker 4>paper,</v>

200
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

201
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.130
<v Speaker 4>as like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and literally it's like,</v>

202
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like proliferate it</v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

203
00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:06.090
<v Speaker 4>That's a pic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this paper all the time.</v>

204
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

205
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.080
<v Speaker 4>did you read the paper?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it has a whole section on um,</v>

206
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.780
<v Speaker 4>on the insect antipodes from coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which a lot of people drink.</v>

207
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 4>And also for me,</v>

208
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.900
<v Speaker 1>like that didn't stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then some of them do stay,</v>

209
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.890
<v Speaker 1>you can't say retarded anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one sticking.</v>

210
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like and people are realizing there's</v>

211
00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:25.300
<v Speaker 1>certain things that you can do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things you can't do.</v>

212
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We accept certain things we can't accept</v>

213
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:31.120
<v Speaker 1>anymore and we're figuring it out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're figuring it out in real time,</v>

214
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.730
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a radical pace that's never existed</v>

215
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:38.731
<v Speaker 1>before in human history where something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was acceptable just 10 15 years ago</v>

216
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.580
<v Speaker 1>is completely unacceptable now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a time like that</v>

217
00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:45.610
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never been a time in the entire world</v>

218
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.780
<v Speaker 1>since people started talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a time where change</v>

219
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:54.220
<v Speaker 1>is taking place at such a radical pace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're a part of it and I'm a part</v>

220
00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>of it and everyone is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a part of it.</v>

221
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>We're all together in this and no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows where the fuck it's going.</v>

222
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

223
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 4>I love that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying that the reason all this</v>

224
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 4>is happening right now is because we are</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

225
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 4>we're just communicating at a more rapid</v>
<v Speaker 4>pace.</v>

226
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 4>That's all it boils down to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're absolutely right.</v>

227
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 4>It's the communication revolution.</v>

228
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone says,</v>

230
00:09:15.801 --> 00:09:16.634
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

231
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.503
<v Speaker 1>hey you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

232
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.920
<v Speaker 1>you said it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

233
00:09:18.921 --> 00:09:19.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

240
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.200
<v Speaker 1>it's no getting this right.</v>

241
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Being held to that standard oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all are now</v>

242
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 1>what's be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's good to that too.</v>

243
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good is you realize like what you're</v>

244
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:40.960
<v Speaker 1>responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you make a mistake and what,</v>

245
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>or you say something incorrect or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say something mean they were just trying</v>

246
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 1>to be funny to came out bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

247
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

248
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 1>the blow back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

249
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how people feel about that and</v>

250
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a disproportionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your signals disproportionate do</v>

251
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:56.530
<v Speaker 1>your ability to express yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate.</v>

252
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the blow back is going to be</v>

253
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it feels awful.</v>

254
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.970
<v Speaker 1>But that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 1>an affirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just letting you know.</v>

256
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.801
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

260
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:15.000

<v Speaker 1>I guess I have to keep changing things.</v>

261
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.640
<v Speaker 1>If it's not an absolute spectacle to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>
