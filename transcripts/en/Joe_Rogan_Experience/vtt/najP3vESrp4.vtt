00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>He's one of my best friends.</v>

10
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I would do anything for that guy.</v>

11
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>If you can get inside his head and change him.</v>

12
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Would you stop get them to stop drinking?</v>

14
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.073
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

15
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>What about after January 3rd definitely not.</v>

16
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

17
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I want them to be happy.</v>

18
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>The only way he'll be happy as if he keeps drinking.</v>

19
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

20
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe with new technology,</v>

21
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>they'll figure out a way to fix your liver maybe,</v>

22
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>but we'll have like a stem cell liver cleanse and I'll just pump that shit in</v>

23
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>there and way,</v>

24
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>way into the bird is thin future.</v>

25
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll do something like that and maybe Burt will have to drink more because</v>

26
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>his liver will be so good that the booze won't last.</v>

27
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.351
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

28
00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>So we're up in like 20 minutes fucking partying harder.</v>

29
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>He's a fun guy to party with.</v>

30
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.223
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

31
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen him do stand out with a shirt on?</v>

32
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.373
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

33
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Back in the good times.</v>

34
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I saw him for a while doing it.</v>

36
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>He used,</v>

37
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.573
<v Speaker 1>he used to do it.</v>

38
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>He only started doing that,</v>

39
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I feel like about two years ago,</v>

40
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:07.351
<v Speaker 1>maybe three.</v>

41
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's,</v>

42
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>it's fairly recent in the time that I've known him and seen him to stand up and</v>

43
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

44
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was since then.</v>

45
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen him do stand up with a shirt on?</v>

46
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

47
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I haven't either.</v>

48
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

50
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

51
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.451
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

52
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.531
<v Speaker 1>but it works.</v>

54
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like part of the persona,</v>

55
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.983
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

56
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

58
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I forget when he didn't used to.</v>

59
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.343
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

60
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Is he bigger than you or is it just me?</v>

61
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.651
<v Speaker 1>Not Man.</v>

62
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:31.861
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

63
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.694
<v Speaker 1>we're about the same.</v>

64
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>About the same size.</v>

65
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>How does his pants stay right above his dick like that?</v>

66
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>That seems impossible.</v>

67
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's a belt,</v>

68
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>this belt right there.</v>

69
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

71

<v Speaker 1>that's different photo Moshe Kasher showing his goods.</v>

72
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Tighty whities Moshe is a funny guy too,</v>

73
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:48.511
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

74
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>He's got a new show coming out on top.</v>

75
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>On comedy central.</v>

76
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:51.231
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

78
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

79
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a really cool idea.</v>

80
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it will be back to talk to very smart dude.</v>

81
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.050

89
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>But when that's a little tiny image,</v>

90
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:07.910
<v Speaker 1>it does look like Brian Keaulana.</v>

91
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Tell me,</v>

92

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

100
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.273
<v Speaker 1>that's not true at all.</v>

101
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

102
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Eddie is a crossfit shit.</v>

103
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>is he loves crossfit.</v>

105
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just got that bloated distended thing though.</v>

106
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Well that's booze.</v>

107
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.561
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

108
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

109
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he can get out of that.</v>

110
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>I think he could.</v>

111
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.161
<v Speaker 1>What's he down to now?</v>

112
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Was he claiming?</v>

113
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

114
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>cause he hasn't claimed in a minute.</v>

115
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

116
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>well here's a photo that he keeps bringing it up.</v>

117
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Have him back when he was real thin when he was real young,</v>

118
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:34.561
<v Speaker 1>like in college.</v>

119
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

120
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:36.241
<v Speaker 1>He's bringing that one out.</v>

121
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>But getting back to that bro,</v>

122
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about um,</v>

123
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the Ohio river that um,</v>

124
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

125
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>they're putting these catfish in lakes and they're taking them out of rivers are</v>

126
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>putting large cat fish in lakes but they can't survive.</v>

127
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>They can only live in these lakes for so long.</v>

128
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>But everybody wants to catch a big catfish.</v>

129
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>So they have these commercial cat fishing businesses where recreational</v>

130
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.440
<v Speaker 1>catfishing where they'll take these people and they'll have them fishing and</v>

131
00:03:01.441 --> 00:03:06.441
<v Speaker 1>these lakes and the use some sort of chemical in the lake that forces the cat</v>

132
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>fish to bite.</v>

133
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:10.601
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

135
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.560
<v Speaker 1>this chemical fish bordello yeah,</v>

136
00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>it's really gross man.</v>

137
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Cause the causes these legions on the catfish is skin.</v>

138
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>So these people catch these catfishes and they have cat fish rather sorry.</v>

139
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.520
<v Speaker 1>And they have these red sores all over their body because some chemicals have</v>

140
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>been introduced into the water,</v>

141
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>which I guess the irritant causes them to like they're biting out of</v>

142
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:32.951
<v Speaker 1>frustration.</v>

143
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe the unspeakable and pursuit of the inedible.</v>

144
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>What's is so bizarre,</v>

145
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>like what a strange choice that people have decided.</v>

146
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's take this animal out there.</v>

147
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>There's one with legions on it.</v>

148
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

149
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

150
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.411
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

151
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Another issue.</v>

152
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Rides on bigger calf fishes are introduced into pay lakes.</v>

153
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>So legs.</v>

155
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

156
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>they have these lakes.</v>

157
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't even know that.</v>

158
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know there was a paleo.</v>

159
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Like look at the all the spots on that one.</v>

160
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Look at the fucking spot on that day.</v>

161
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.143
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>

162
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>you find what it says that chemical is that they dumped into the water.</v>

163
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Just go to the Rappahannock river in Virginia.</v>

164
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:09.304
<v Speaker 1>You'll catch a nice one.</v>

165
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I've got 70 pounders.</v>

166
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.973
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

167
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.751
<v Speaker 1>in a river.</v>

168
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:14.584
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

169
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many of them are out?</v>

171
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.361
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

172
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>which fish you catch is a blue.</v>

173
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a white fish.</v>

174
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>A white cat.</v>

175
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.111
<v Speaker 1>A white cat.</v>

176
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's a big one by cats.</v>

177
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Bluecat's channel cats.</v>

178
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:22.631
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

179
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>blues and whites are usually the biggest.</v>

180
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Did you apply?</v>

181
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Heads get really big too,</v>

182
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but they don't live in Virginia.</v>

183
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's called juicing.</v>

184
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.991
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>The chemicals they put in the water make the fish bite in the pay lake industry.</v>

186
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>It's called juicing.</v>

187
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Well weird.</v>

188
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Look at the fucking lesions on that thing.</v>

189
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Scroll up a little Jamie,</v>

190
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>

191
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Look at the poor things body.</v>

192
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.983
<v Speaker 1>It's just wrong.</v>

193
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre.</v>

194
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not just wrong.</v>

195
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre.</v>

196
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.411
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>

197
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand how that ever got past people who are like accepting</v>

198
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

199
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a natural one.</v>

200
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 1>The one below that.</v>

201
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>This seems totally healthy that some got caught from a river.</v>

202
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>So these pay lakes is a,</v>

203
00:04:58.601 --> 00:04:59.021
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

204
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like a private land thing.</v>

205
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>So many owns and it just keeps dumping these fish in there and apparently they</v>

206
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>don't live there very long.</v>

207
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>They all else a fishing equivalent of a,</v>

208
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.801
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

209
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>those little teeny high fence places you see in the east.</v>

210
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Go Hunt,</v>

211
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>go hunt elk on 40 acres.</v>

212
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>How hard was it for you to get sober?</v>

213
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.673
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

214
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.410
<v Speaker 2>fear was a big motivator in that for me.</v>

215
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.603
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

216
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.610
<v Speaker 2>losing my family was,</v>

217
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.660
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

218
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 2>that was the thing that scared me so much.</v>

219
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:30.571
<v Speaker 2>That was the bottom.</v>

220
00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:35.370
<v Speaker 2>I hit that my family's going to go away because of my behaviors that I brought</v>

221
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:36.450
<v Speaker 2>home from the road.</v>

222
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I got kicked out of the house by my wife.</v>

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.130

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And then they slowly rebuild you.</v>

296
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.630
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to a,</v>

297
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

298
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

299
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 2>they call them aftercare places.</v>

300
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.263
<v Speaker 2>I went there,</v>

301
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

302
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 2>to a couple of different ones and they fined tuned stuff and get integrated back</v>

303
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:41.571
<v Speaker 2>into life.</v>

304
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Because when you were in this cocoon and you're,</v>

305
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.930
<v Speaker 2>you're frigging raw.</v>

306
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

307
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I was raw meat when I came out and you can see it in that some kind of monster</v>

308
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

309
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty raw still.</v>

310
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what I could or what I should or shouldn't do,</v>

311
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.083
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

312
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.283
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

313
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

314
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 2>the last place we went to was a place that helps relationships.</v>

315
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.190
<v Speaker 2>So they got me and my wife together and we'd see,</v>

316
00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 2>see people separately and then come together and talk about what we did and</v>

317
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 2>communication frigging saved my life saved,</v>

318
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

319

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 2>and working through that stuff.</v>

322
00:08:17.451 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 2>So very grateful for my wife.</v>

323
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 2>She's the one that didn't ask for this shit.</v>

324
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Speaker 2>She walked through fire with me and we walked out together stronger,</v>

325
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 2>way stronger than we ever would have been before.</v>

326
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.291
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

327
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 2>my kids know my story.</v>

328
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 2>My kids know my struggles and</v>

329
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 2>they respect that.</v>

330
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 2>They respect me and a different way.</v>

331
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to tell them what to do all the time or just be like,</v>

332
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:47.624
<v Speaker 2>I'm this,</v>

333
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I can say sorry.</v>

334
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I can tell them,</v>

00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:50.991

<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

338
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to preach to them.</v>

339
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>They got their own stuff,</v>

340
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 2>but now they,</v>

341
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 2>now they goof with me.</v>

342
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:03.561
<v Speaker 2>I ruined my trust with my family and now by some miracle they are goofing with</v>

343
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:06.151
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

344
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:06.720

350
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:14.250
