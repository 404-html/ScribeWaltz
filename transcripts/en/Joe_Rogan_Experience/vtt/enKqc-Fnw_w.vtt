1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.610
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.870
<v 1>the thing you posted today about the Florida headline.</v>

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.410
That was something that was like the Florida headline for sure.

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.420
That was like what you said in the caption.
That was the jet.

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.790
<v 0>Yeah.
I was um,</v>

6
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.610
writing this bit about exotic pets and uh,
when I'm in the middle of this bit,

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.510
I just decided to start researching to Florida.
What,
what inspired you to write?

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.170
I'll tell you,
I don't want to do the bit right.

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.990
It says a Florida man tries to start naked bike club at chick filet.

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.380
A Florida man was arrested after he challenged others to fight and to stare at

11
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:38.720
his genitals outside of chick filet.

12
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.540
<v 1>What did Dan Bilzerian say?
People can,
Florida just can't act right.
Trust me.</v>

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.810
That's a good jab at himself.

14
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.830
Points points to Bilzerian for at least come and correct with that.
That's funny.

15
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.870
That is a ridiculous headline.
Also.
Where can I sign up?
It sounds fun.

16
00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:59.220
It's like game of Thrones for methods.
Naked Fight Club.
Yeah.
Why not?

17
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.130
You want to go to watch from a neighboring parking lot with binoculars?

18
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.370
Hell yeah.
That's you want to do.

19
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.820
You want to know gate that you want to be far enough away.

20
00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:11.340
So if they start running at you balls out dicks way June deep,

21
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:11.860
you're like,

22
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.540
don't you know zombies do keep your car in park engine running and then use

23
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:18.990
those by knows.
Absolutely.
You know,

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I shut my Nami National Cheney's with your oven Mitt tee shirts.

25
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.020
There gotta be a video of that.
Right?

26
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.930
If someone was out at the chick filet itself,
there's not video.
That's it.

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.793
I'm very disciplined,

28
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.070
depressing fact there has to do some video video of almost any kind of

29
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:37.890
interaction with these days.

30
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.830
People create interactions so that they can videotape them.
Parents,
man,

31
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:44.770
they've got to stop putting their kids on video.
We've got to stop.
It's enough.

32
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.620
<v 0>My friend's a doctor and I was talking to him and I used to,
you know,</v>

33
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:52.250
it just popped by to say what's up and he goes,
hey man,
just to let you know,

34
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.810
the more you go to a doctor,
the faster you'll die.
And I go,
what?
Yeah.

35
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.770
He's like,
I just want to let know.
Yeah,
yeah.
He says,
the more you go to us,

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.530
you come to us,
the faster you'll die.
I was like,
what are you talking about?

37
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.210
Because a lot of doctors are crooked and they'll give you something for what you

38
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.420
think you got.
And then after that wears off,
they have to give you some else.

39
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:14.420
So now you just keep filling yourself with stuff to fix.

40
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:18.080
The other thing that was wrong and he goes,
some,

41
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:21.770
some doctors are not good people.
And he goes,
the more people go to doctors,

42
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:25.310
the fast day.
Dot.
Put it in point.
My Mom beat breast cancer twice,
right?

43
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.460
And my dad's never been to the doctor.
He's 75 years old.

44
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:30.710
Never been to the doctor wants,
because he's like,
well,

45
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:33.230
as soon as you go to the doctor,
they tell you something wrong,
you die.
You know,

46
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:36.740
literally.
But if you have cancer,
you should go to a fucking boy.

47
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:39.620
He didn't have cancer.
My mom did.
Right.
But if he had cancer,

48
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.920
he should go to a fucking dime.
I don't think he would go.
Even if he,
yeah,

49
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:46.280
he's just,
your mom beat it twice and she's still here?
Yes,
she is.
She,

50
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.230
the second time she be,
she didn't even tell me she had it.

51
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.180
It doesn't your dad want to beat it if he gets it.
It's kind of was like,

52
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.290
Hey,
I've been through a lot.
I'm fine.
Like he's,
he hates going to the doctor.

53
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.680
They'll only time we went to the doctor.
He had a back problem and that's it.

54
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.930
That's all score.
What have you met?
A good doctor.
Like a doctor that he likes,

55
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.840
like a guy he plays golf with or some shit that's like my dad.

56
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.700
My Dad is not social.
It's not,
no,
no,
no.
I'm totally weird.
You're so social.

57
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.890
I,
I'm totally opposite.
Like my dad's story is crazy.
Like he,
you know,

58
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.010
he went through segregation.
He got a phd in nuclear physics.
Oh yeah.

59
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:26.011
My Dad's a genius but shit by out there talking shit on just telling jokes,

60
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.730
I'm a failure,
but you're not because you're a success at it.

61
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:33.460
So he's got to go all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He knew.

62
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.130
He's the one that told me to drop out of college.
Really?
Yeah.

63
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:37.990
I play football for the university.
Say it though.

64
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.180
He said you need to drop out of college.
You're not smart.

65
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.370
That's not supportive.
Michael,

66
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.730
you need to drop out of college and chase your dreams.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

67
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:52.060
He was like,
my dad's whole thing is I got a phd in nuclear physics.

68
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.560
I know what wanting to be in school is and you don't want to be in school and

69
00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:00.730
you,
you,
you got a personality.
Go do that.
But you're dumb.
A long time ago,

70
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.990
my travels,
my uh,
my,

71
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.670
I was going to go do a one on butter being show down in Alabama and my parents

72
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:09.190
were like,
man,
you're going to Alabama,
man,
be safe down there,

73
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:12.220
dumpy doing all that stuff.
He do,
you know,
it's going to be different because of,

74
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.030
you know,
America American,
our history with racism.
And

75
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.910
I went down there and I was,
you know,

76
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:22.060
this is what you might even tell the story again because this is a story.

77
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.950
So I went down there.
I was,
I was at the show and,
and some,
uh,

78
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.300
cops come up and they look like the cops from,
you know,

79
00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:31.720
in the movies from the south that you're supposed to scare you.

80
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.970
And I took a picture with him and they're like,

81
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:36.250
and somebody else came to take a picture and you're like,
well,

82
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:37.890
look what we started going,
Oh man,
I'm gonna do this song.

83
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.880
This is what I'm here to do.
I mean,
you hang out with people.

84
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.170
I'm a referee fights and,
you know,
talk to people they want to talk.

85
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:46.990
So I took a lot of pictures.
They were impressed.
They are saying that,
you know,

86
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:48.820
they've seen other people,
you know,

87
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.930
tell people know about pictures and the guy on side it,
they're like,
hey,

88
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.200
we want you to come out and pull people over with us.
I'm like,
no,

89
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:02.860
no,
I don't want to do,
I have no interest in doing that.
You know,
I grew up in La,

90
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.320
you know what I mean?
Like they're like,
and they're getting pumped it like,

91
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:08.650
imagine like you're getting pulled over by herb dean pitch.
Yeah,
yeah.

92
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:12.010
And I'm like,
no,
no,
I don't want to do it.
And these,
uh,
then one guy was on,

93
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.770
he goes,
well,
we'll some do something.

94
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:18.130
I've been wanting to make this do some tase me or something hurting.
And so like,

95
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:22.210
he grabs this,
his taser gun and sticks to Taser in my hand.

96
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.740
Jesus sitting there and I'm like,
what the fuck?
So I started tasing him,
right?

97
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.560
I'm changing this,
he's in this guy.
And he's like,

98
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.510
I'm like,
ah,
I,
so then,
um,
I,
after the tasing,

99
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.603
uh,
his buddy,

100
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.380
one of the agents and one of the guys who was working with me comes up and tells

101
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:43.960
him that he has some business to talk about with me.
I go,
Hey,

102
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.070
what'd you want to talk about?
He goes,
man,

103
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.440
I could see you are so uncomfortable with what was going on that I just wanted

104
00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:52.960
to get.
I was like,
thanks.
I get back to him.
I give that to my hotel room.

105
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:56.470
And I,
I was thinking,
I was like,
man,
you know,

106
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:59.960
I'm worried people prejudging and being an intolerant.

107
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:03.440
I'm prejudging of these guys because of,
uh,
some history.

108
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.100
And these guys are really cool.
If I ever get the opportunity to seize guys,

109
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.070
I'm going to be,
you know,
man.
And I,
and I did,

110
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:12.440
they came like right there and the phone rings,
I swear.

111
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.750
And they took me to an after party and really like,
yeah,
they took it like,

112
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.130
and it was like the place looks like roadhouse and you know what I mean?

113
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:22.700
Like the hell,
everything you see like in a movie,
like,
like you know some,

114
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:25.220
you know,
hey,
your wife's not going to be happy about that and,

115
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.690
and I'm gonna catch you next week.

116
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:30.300
One of those types of things drove me to the airport with the lights on school.

117
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.000
I think.
I think I still have the picture of me tasing them.

118
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:38.260
I could show it to you.
It was like,

119
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.070
it was a pretty cool experience.
So after that I was like,
man,
whatever.

120
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:46.700
I think I know about things.
I really don't.

121
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.530
And so,
uh,
so I take things at face value.
Yeah.

122
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:54.230
I've had good times in Alabama.
I've had good times in the south.

123
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.050
I think the world's changing too.
I really do.

124
00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:01.280
I think there's parts of,
especially in this country,

125
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.930
we almost everywhere you can find cool piece.
So,
so yeah.
So I mean,
if,
uh,

126
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.650
you know,
oh my God,
that is hilarious.
So,

127
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.580
so that should put this on your Instagram.
Can you?
Yeah,
I can.

128
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:15.440
That they wouldn't mind.
I've talked to those guys about it.

129
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.570
Don't you think he's going to get in trouble though?
No,
he's not.

130
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.400
Gonna he said he's fine.
He said it'll be all right.

131
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.570
I thought he would get in trouble.
So I didn't want to,
he has,

132
00:07:21.571 --> 00:07:23.990
that's why I haven't put it on.
That's why I never did that.

133
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.760
But I've actually talked to him,
I'm pretty sure.
So anyway,
this,

134
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:33.710
um,
that,
that,
yeah,
that's a big lesson to me.
