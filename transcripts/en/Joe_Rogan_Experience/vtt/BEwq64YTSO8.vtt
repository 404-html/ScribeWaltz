24
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there'll be an occasion.</v>

25
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

26
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.400

<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

30
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 2>And it's making me think about the Denzel Washington movie.</v>

31
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

32
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 2>the equalizer,</v>

33
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.460
<v Speaker 2>the first one where it was in with those Russian guys.</v>

34
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 2>So were like messed up guys.</v>

35
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.920
<v Speaker 2>And he was trying to protect that girl and he,</v>

36
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 2>he started pointing,</v>

37
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 2>there were skulls and stuff at the guy's desk,</v>

38
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.553
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

40
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 2>he was pointing the stuff he was trying to explain to the guy,</v>

41
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

42
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 2>let this girl go,</v>

43
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

44
00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you $9,000.</v>

45
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Whatever was let her go.</v>

46
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.520
<v Speaker 2>She was like 15 years old.</v>

47
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.301
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

48
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

49
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

50
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want to listen to him.</v>

51
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.660
<v Speaker 2>And so he started the head stuff like this with the skull.</v>

52
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the people could see it,</v>

53
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.240
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

54
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 2>and he started pointing it towards him and I,</v>

55
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.960
<v Speaker 2>the guy didn't like take the hint,</v>

56
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 2>the guy.</v>

58
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Then a couple of minutes later he killed everybody in the room,</v>

59
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

60
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 2>it looks exactly like the thing from that movie to Denzel Washington where he,</v>

61
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:42.394
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

62
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 2>he also had guns and stairs right there.</v>

63
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a scene.</v>

64
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 2>This is Jamie pulled the scene.</v>

65
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

66
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.303
<v Speaker 2>He was fair.</v>

67
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I never saw that movie.</v>

68
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:49.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

69
00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:53.950
<v Speaker 2>So you see like it's a scene where he starts pointing,</v>

70
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 2>they might've taken this from here.</v>

71
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

72
00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 2>they could've gotten it from us,</v>

73
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.350
<v Speaker 2>from Mexico who props.</v>

74
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

75
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.150
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

76
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 2>they pointed,</v>

77
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 2>he pointed at all towards the guy to kind of warn the guy what was coming next.</v>

78
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:07.144
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

79
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the only good movie that ever came out of a terrible TV series.</v>

80
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>You remember the TV series?</v>

81
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:14.544
<v Speaker 1>The equalizer?</v>

82
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I remember the name,</v>

83
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know that I ever really</v>

84
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>watched it.</v>

85
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I was a fat,</v>

86
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>sloppy white guy driving a Jaguar that's supposedly kicked everybody's ass and</v>

87
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>you'd watch it and you know,</v>

88
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here with this movie.</v>

89
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.253
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch it.</v>

90
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I heard a TV show.</v>

91
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 1>It was a just a dumb TV show that didn't make any sense.</v>

92
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>And when they turned it into a movie and had Denzel Washington in it and I'm</v>

93
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:37.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

94
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

95
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>How is this possible?</v>

96
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Because he freaking out.</v>

97
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.211
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>

98
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

99
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking about that then.</v>

100
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>So listen man,</v>

101
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

102
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>you just came back from the Canelo triple g fight,</v>

103
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>which was a phenomenal fight.</v>

104
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>That was a phenomenal fight.</v>

105
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed that fight a lot.</v>

106
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.140
<v Speaker 1>We'll</v>

107
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 2>exaggerate how good fights nowadays.</v>

108
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:00.071
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

109
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:00.904
<v Speaker 2>if they're around,</v>

110
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 2>everything's great.</v>

111
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.243
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

112
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 2>If a pitcher has one good year in baseball,</v>

113
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.260
<v Speaker 2>he's great and he's,</v>

114
00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 2>he's like the next Sandy Colfax.</v>

115
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Like people don't wait to see and,</v>

116
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 2>and truly graded,</v>

117
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

118
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 2>against things that were out of their IRA because,</v>

119
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

120
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>we're human.</v>

121
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

122
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.823
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

123
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I was there.</v>

124
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I reported on it.</v>

125
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 2>It's the greatest fight ever.</v>

126
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 2>And No,</v>

127
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:26.621
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

128
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>but that's what people will do what they do.</v>

129
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a really good fight,</v>

130
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>but everything's relative,</v>

131
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.940
<v Speaker 2>and it depends on everything is influenced.</v>

133
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 2>The judgment of people is influenced,</v>

134
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.140
<v Speaker 2>at least how I see it in my field for whatever that's worth by.</v>

135
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 2>What's around and how long were they are?</v>

136
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody bought to Pacquiao,</v>

137
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Mayweather first fight because the fans were hungry.</v>

138
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Their imagination was like,</v>

139
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 2>there's no good fights.</v>

140
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a good fight.</v>

141
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 2>So they'll,</v>

142
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 2>they're anticipating it.</v>

143
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 2>So you got them at the right time.</v>

144
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>If it was the 80s and you had Lenin Duran,</v>

145
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 2>porno would've gone Hagler Hagler uh,</v>

146
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.961
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>

148
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

149
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.453
<v Speaker 2>Hearns,</v>

150
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

151
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 2>you had all these great fight.</v>

152
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.573
<v Speaker 2>Aaron Pryor,</v>

153
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 2>he had all these guys fighting each other.</v>

154
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 2>You probably couldn't have pulled off the Mayweather</v>

155
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Pacquiao thing that you pulled off and it turns out to be,</v>

156
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

157
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:27.981
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

158
00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:28.814
<v Speaker 2>a bit of a,</v>

159
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say scam,</v>

160
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 2>but it definitely wasn't what it lived up to be because back Ya'll came into the</v>

161
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:35.824
<v Speaker 2>fight injured.</v>

162
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it.</v>

163
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I never saw any listener.</v>

164
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you needed to have an injury,</v>

165
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

166
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.900
<v Speaker 2>you're in a tough position.</v>

167
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.080
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't taekwondo and all that kind of fighting stuff in Lma and whatever</v>

168
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.721
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>

169
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably not giving it a proper understanding of what it was and,</v>

170
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 2>and exactly what part of the fighting,</v>

171
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.551
<v Speaker 2>not just my,</v>

172
00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm being too broad,</v>

173
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 2>but I know you did taekwondo,</v>

174
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 2>you did kickboxing.</v>

175
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I know that you're,</v>

176
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 2>you are national champion when you were young.</v>

177
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Somebody show me some more about it.</v>

178
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.073
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

179
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

180
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.560
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

181
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 2>you do things when you're injured.</v>

182
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean like when are you not injured?</v>

183
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

184
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 2>if you're a football player,</v>

185
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:16.081
<v Speaker 2>if you're a fighter,</v>

186
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:17.190
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the contact button,</v>

187
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.740
<v Speaker 2>tell me when you're not in jail,</v>

188
00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 2>like when there's not something wrong.</v>

189
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:24.931
<v Speaker 2>So I never saw proof during that bout I was there covering it for ESPN.</v>

190
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I never saw proof where he went store or he didn't fold that hand or he threw it</v>

191
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:32.614
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

192
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.710
<v Speaker 2>in a poor way or in a,</v>

193
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>in a less than high level way.</v>

194
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Speaker 2>I never saw that.</v>

195
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 2>So listen,</v>

196
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in his body.</v>

197
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

198
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

199
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.831
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

200
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:42.664
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

201
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a mind reader,</v>

202
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't see it.</v>

203
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>But what I did see,</v>

204
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:52.741
<v Speaker 2>I saw him in his trainer in the runway was more telling to me taking selfies</v>

205
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.400
<v Speaker 2>because they had got paid a few extra dollars to promote some kind of product</v>

206
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 2>where the selfies were attached to it.</v>

207
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>So I saw that,</v>

208
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 2>to me that was more debilitating to see a guy before the biggest fight of his</v>

209
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 2>life where people were going crazy and going to break the paper view record and</v>

210
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 2>paying $100 for the freaking thing,</v>

211
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 2>to see him taking a selfie when the mentalities should be in a different place</v>

212
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 2>and normally is in a different place before you're about to walk that hundred</v>

213
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 2>yards to the ring where you might not come out of there,</v>

214
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 2>it's always possible.</v>

215
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 2>You have to have that mentality.</v>

216
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was more debilitating than anything I saw physically with what</v>

217
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 2>was supposed to be an arm injury.</v>

218
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>

219
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.611
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

220
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:41.444
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

221
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.433
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's,</v>

222
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's fair to say was a money grab,</v>

223
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 2>but obviously it was a bit of a money grab.</v>

224
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.001
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

225
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 2>they were beyond themselves.</v>

226
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

227
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 2>one guy was retired,</v>

229
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 2>he came back forward.</v>

230
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 2>They were beyond the peak of their abilities in their career.</v>

231
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

232
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't see,</v>

233
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:02.594
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

234
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

235
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that fight.</v>

236
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.543
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

237
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 2>the purpose to it.</v>

238
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.221
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

239
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 2>it happened about five,</v>

240
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 2>six years late.</v>

241
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

242
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

243
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

244
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.853
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

245
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.561
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

246
00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>

247
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.773
<v Speaker 2>I you,</v>

248
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 2>everyone who gets in the ring,</v>

249
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 2>they deserve to make as much money as they can.</v>

250
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

251
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.690
<v Speaker 2>I never say that a fighter got overpaid.</v>

252
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

253
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.963
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

254
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I never say that because I understand what it took to get to that point and,</v>

255
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

256
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.133
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

257
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 2>you can play with things and you know,</v>

258
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.253
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

259
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of lead people to things.</v>

260
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

261
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 2>where we started with this conversation,</v>

262
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

264
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 2>it's the time you are around the,</v>

265
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.503
<v Speaker 2>the environment.</v>

266
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.400
<v Speaker 2>What's not around,</v>

267
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 2>not just what's around but what's not around,</v>

268
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

269
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 2>not that many great fights to be made right now.</v>

270
00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying,</v>

271
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 2>so in triple g Canelo fight is important because there's not a lot of guys</v>

272
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 2>waiting in the wings.</v>

273
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the old days of the 1980s are the glory days of the welterweight</v>

274
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 2>in the middleweight division.</v>

275
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:09.831
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

276
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:10.664
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

277
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 2>And the people,</v>

278
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:12.601
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

280
00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 2>they have a thirst,</v>

281
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:14.594
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

282
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 2>to see something that the PR department can bring.</v>

283
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 2>It can use the right material because they,</v>

284
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 2>it has to be fighters that obviously a marquee fighters with a name that they</v>

285
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 2>can build it and get the imagination of the people to say,</v>

286
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be a great one.</v>

287
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 2>So when they see it and they pay $100 on $85 or $95,</v>

288
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:37.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever the heck they're playing,</v>

289
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

290
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.420
<v Speaker 2>for the fight and then it's a good fight,</v>

291
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 2>well becomes a great fight because of all those elements.</v>

292
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Because uh,</v>

293
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

294
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.390
<v Speaker 2>it's during your time you saw it,</v>

295
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 2>you committed to it,</v>

296
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.800
<v Speaker 2>you sacrifice to pay that money,</v>

297
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 2>you sacrifice a fly there and yeah,</v>

298
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.840
<v Speaker 2>it's a really good fight,</v>

299
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 2>becomes a iconic and,</v>

300
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think we separate that in our minds.</v>

301
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.233
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

302
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.690
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

303
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 2>who says we have to,</v>

304
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.340
<v Speaker 2>because right.</v>

305
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 2>It's about enjoyment.</v>

306
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So if that,</v>

307
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 2>if that makes people happy,</v>

308
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

309
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 2>that's part of,</v>

310
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what goes into the mix of entertainment.</v>

311
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't see it when I tried to separate that being in the business.</v>

312
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see it as,</v>

313
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 2>the Thrilla in Manila,</v>

315
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.390
<v Speaker 2>I used,</v>

316
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:35.390
<v Speaker 2>I saw it as a really good solid fight and they once again,</v>

317
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately it took away from it.</v>

318
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 2>We'd controversial with the decision.</v>

319
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Did you think that I thought the first decision was terrible.</v>

320
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I thought triple g clearly won the fight.</v>

321
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 2>I thought the second decision was arguable.</v>

322
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I started like,</v>

323
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

324
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 2>this looks like a draw to me.</v>

325
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 2>And it was an amazing fight.</v>

326
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

327
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:53.280
<v Speaker 2>I gotta be honest because I mean,</v>

328
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're supposed to be.</v>

329
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 2>And who do you think one?</v>

330
00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I added one 17 one 12 and a lot of people going to say for you had to too fall.</v>

331
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I tried to pull off all week long.</v>

332
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I picked Canelo to win on ESPN,</v>

333
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:06.651
<v Speaker 2>on sports center.</v>

334
00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:07.484
<v Speaker 2>I was working.</v>

335
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.960
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

336
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.893
<v Speaker 2>12 is big.</v>

337
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.021
<v Speaker 2>It's five rounds.</v>

338
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:14.060
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

339
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:14.461
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

340
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:14.731
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

341
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

342
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

343
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.711
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

344
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

345
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 2>you start to,</v>

346
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.041
<v Speaker 2>you're human.</v>

347
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:21.220
<v Speaker 2>You start to hear people's,</v>

348
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.760
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

349
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

350
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 2>that knows something about fighting that has had the closest.</v>

351
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

352
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't want to yell at Yaddo one 17,</v>

353
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:28.021
<v Speaker 2>one 12.</v>

354
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

355
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 2>you still got to yell at because that's what you believe.</v>

356
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:31.794
<v Speaker 2>That's what you saw.</v>

357
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 2>And I still say it,</v>

358
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I still yell at that.</v>

359
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.403
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

360
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.180
<v Speaker 2>they didn't give him credit for gems.</v>

361
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Like jabs don't count no more.</v>

362
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.633
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

363
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to pick out anybody because that's not really fair to do when you</v>

364
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 2>have a podium and they don't have a podium.</v>

365
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.013
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

366
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it is because they deserve it,</v>

367
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.960
<v Speaker 2>but not generally.</v>

368
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 2>And the judges nowadays,</v>

369
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that</v>

370
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 2>they just give it,</v>

371
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I see too often that they almost go down the easy route.</v>

372
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

373
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 2>they just give it to who's aggressive for guys walking forward.</v>

374
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:19.320
<v Speaker 2>A guy's Tom Punches,</v>

375
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:21.010
<v Speaker 2>it's like their favor now.</v>

376
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Chi.</v>

377
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's more to it than that.</v>

378
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 2>And I understand that the sport doesn't help itself.</v>

379
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 2>They don't make a clear criteria for,</v>

380
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's supposed to be clean,</v>

381
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 2>harder affective punches because the separation of professional boxing,</v>

382
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:37.080
<v Speaker 2>an amateur boxing is you have to sell it,</v>

383
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 2>you have to make money and you've got to put fannies in the seats.</v>

384
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:42.750
<v Speaker 2>So you want to see guys get hurt.</v>

385
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:44.370
<v Speaker 2>You want to see guys in pack guys.</v>

386
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.530
<v Speaker 2>So it's the cleaner who hurts the guy more.</v>

387
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:47.161
<v Speaker 2>It's the cleaner,</v>

388
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 2>more impactful punches,</v>

389
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just thrown in.</v>

390
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not just to Gretchen because the Gretchen has to lead to something</v>

391
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>affective affective aggression.</v>

392
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:02.071
<v Speaker 2>So I I saw for me to get it to that one 17 one 12 I saw Goliath skin on the</v>

393
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:08.980
<v Speaker 2>outside controlling rains,</v>

394
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 2>controlling distance.</v>

395
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 2>You want to use that silly word ring generalship cause I have to time,</v>

396
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they're talking about.</v>

397
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 2>They say ring general.</v>

398
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

399
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.611
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

400
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I just saw the way you judged it.</v>

401
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

402
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 2>where did,</v>

403
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 2>where did you fit in ring generalship into that into your thinking because I'd</v>

404
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 2>like to know but if it is ring generalship he was controlling range.</v>

405
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 2>He was controlling outside.</v>

406
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:34.120
<v Speaker 2>He was keeping the shorter man on the outside,</v>

407
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.410
<v Speaker 2>catching him with a jab,</v>

408
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 2>making him earn his way in,</v>

409
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 2>making them pay a price to get in.</v>

410
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Now was the other guy can lob and the other guy landing the hard clean body</v>

411
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 2>shots that sometimes you don't get credit for?</v>

412
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:46.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

413
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:47.704
<v Speaker 2>he was all,</v>

414
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 2>like I say on ESPN,</v>

415
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 2>he was putting water in the basement.</v>

416
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

417
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 2>he definitely was.</v>

418
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.600
<v Speaker 2>But the Jeb didn't count suddenly was suddenly in a universe where the jab of a</v>

419
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 2>guy doesn't mean anything.</v>

420
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 2>When we don't want it to mean anything.</v>

421
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 2>When we want to give it to the aggressive guy to the,</v>

422
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:06.980
<v Speaker 2>to the guy trying,</v>

423
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:07.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

424
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:08.620
<v Speaker 2>trying to get in there.</v>

425
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.500
<v Speaker 2>The question is what,</v>

426
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 2>what's more important is a jab or important or a hook to the body.</v>

427
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 2>What is more important in your rock to the body?</v>

428
00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Clean is more important,</v>

429
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:15.881
<v Speaker 2>more important.</v>

430
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:20.881
<v Speaker 2>But if the j about numbers to hook to the body through many rounds and,</v>

431
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 2>and the numbers are significant that it's greater than,</v>

432
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 2>then you have to account for that.</v>

433
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.001
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

434
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 1>So you think that people are watching,</v>

435
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.130
<v Speaker 1>they're watching a couple of jabs and then one hook to the body and they count</v>

436
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:35.160
<v Speaker 1>that one hook to the body better than the count to chat.</v>

437
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

438
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 2>And I don't have a problem with that because our counted that way till if it's a</v>

439
00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 2>good shot because again,</v>

440
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.423
<v Speaker 2>a power shot.</v>

441
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

442
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Because that is what's going to drive people to the event,</v>

443
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.370
<v Speaker 2>right to the sport is a harder punches.</v>

444
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:49.630
<v Speaker 2>So I have no problem with that.</v>

445
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.840
<v Speaker 2>But if the jabs or 20 jabs and it's two body punches,</v>

446
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.530
<v Speaker 2>well then I'm starting to save.</v>

447
00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:01.770
<v Speaker 2>We can't forget the jabs because the body punches got your attention and,</v>

448
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

449
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

450
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 2>move Johnny his seat a little bit.</v>

451
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because for whatever reason.</v>

452
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:13.741
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just saying that the criteria is not clean enough,</v>

453
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

454
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:15.800
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

455
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.130
<v Speaker 2>for the judges sometimes</v>

456
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>well to be even bigger mass and MMA and it's a lot of the same judges.</v>

457
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

458
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.341
<v Speaker 1>you mean,</v>

459
00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem with judging is it the same in both sports.</v>

460
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.010
<v Speaker 1>You should have someone who has experienced in the sport.</v>

461
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

462
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.700
<v Speaker 1>they have to have a deep understanding of what they're actually watching.</v>

463
00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the case.</v>

464
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not the case in boxing because I know a lot of the same judges from</v>

465
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 1>boxing also judge MMA.</v>

466
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what they're talking about in MMA.</v>

467
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:41.110
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think they know what they're talking about unboxing either.</v>

468
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real travesty.</v>

469
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge disservice to these professional athletes who literally are,</v>

470
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:48.124
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

471
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 1>risking everything.</v>

472
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>As they step in there,</v>

473
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a real good chance that they might not come out.</v>

474
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:53.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

475
00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>it happens every so many fights,</v>

476
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 1>a guy dies.</v>

477
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Speaker 1>This is just a fact.</v>

478
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.950
<v Speaker 1>And boxing and football too.</v>

479
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

480
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.420
<v Speaker 1>And MMA as well.</v>

481
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:02.601
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

482
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 1>MMA has plenty of problems.</v>

483
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.061
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

484
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

485
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 1>there's less deaths in MMA,</v>

486
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:09.040
<v Speaker 1>but we're getting deaths from Wayans.</v>

487
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

488
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:12.260
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of extreme weight cutting issues and some of the small</v>

489
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 1>organizations in particular,</v>

490
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.690
<v Speaker 2>all of that stuff is legitimate.</v>

491
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.753
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem.</v>

492
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Something that should be looked at.</v>

493
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just a shame that the judging is so poor and it's been this way for so</v>

494
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:22.900
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

495
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.733
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

496
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:24.820
<v Speaker 2>to the boxing,</v>

497
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:25.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

498
00:15:25.901 --> 00:15:26.734
<v Speaker 2>you have a,</v>

499
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:27.311
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

500
00:15:27.311 --> 00:15:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying this in a derogatory way.</v>

501
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.970
<v Speaker 2>In some ways it's a good way,</v>

502
00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:32.590
<v Speaker 2>but you have a dictator running,</v>

503
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.890
<v Speaker 2>UFC and no,</v>

505
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.141
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

506
00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:40.141
<v Speaker 2>but it's okay to have a dictator sometimes because at least you have rules that</v>

507
00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

508
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.530
<v Speaker 2>he had to have structure and uh,</v>

509
00:15:44.531 --> 00:15:44.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

510
00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:47.730
<v Speaker 2>as long as they're not taking people out and killing them.</v>

511
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

512
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:53.790
<v Speaker 2>And so boxing has boxing.</v>

513
00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:55.780
<v Speaker 2>He has no real</v>

514
00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:57.941
<v Speaker 2>accountability,</v>

515
00:15:57.941 --> 00:15:59.380
<v Speaker 2>no structure across the board.</v>

516
00:15:59.381 --> 00:15:59.681
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

517
00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:00.514
<v Speaker 2>you don't real,</v>

518
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

519
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.410
<v Speaker 2>lateral structure and conformity,</v>

520
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.330
<v Speaker 2>not done unilateral because you have different states that have different</v>

521
00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:11.680
<v Speaker 2>commissions and you know,</v>

522
00:16:11.681 --> 00:16:13.090
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to be tied together,</v>

523
00:16:13.091 --> 00:16:16.720
<v Speaker 2>but they all act differently and there's no national commission.</v>

524
00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:17.471
<v Speaker 2>There's no body,</v>

525
00:16:17.471 --> 00:16:18.610
<v Speaker 2>there's no dictated.</v>

526
00:16:18.611 --> 00:16:19.421
<v Speaker 2>There's no czar,</v>

527
00:16:19.421 --> 00:16:20.680
<v Speaker 2>there's no it,</v>

528
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.270
<v Speaker 2>there's no NBA commissioner,</v>

529
00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:23.650
<v Speaker 2>there's no NFL commissioner,</v>

530
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:27.910
<v Speaker 2>there's no MLB commissioner that overlooks and polices the whole sport.</v>

531
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.253
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

532
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.170
<v Speaker 2>there's those separation of</v>

533
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.570
<v Speaker 2>church and state,</v>

534
00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:35.171
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

535
00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:39.100
<v Speaker 2>where the people making the money in the sport are separated,</v>

536
00:16:39.101 --> 00:16:42.640
<v Speaker 2>truly separated from the people supposedly administrating this.</v>

537
00:16:42.641 --> 00:16:44.460
<v Speaker 2>But there's no separation there.</v>

538
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

539
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:50.130
<v Speaker 2>promoters actually that are making the money and have obviously a horse that</v>

540
00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:51.581
<v Speaker 2>running in the game,</v>

541
00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:52.630
<v Speaker 2>so to speak that night,</v>

542
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.743
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

543
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:54.520
<v Speaker 2>that they won,</v>

544
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.540
<v Speaker 2>that fight it to when they pay the judges.</v>

545
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.970
<v Speaker 2>And there's no,</v>

546
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.050
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

547
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.471
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

548
00:17:02.471 --> 00:17:03.251
<v Speaker 2>there's no buffer.</v>

549
00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:08.251
<v Speaker 2>There's no separation where you can have promoters and managers that can</v>

550
00:17:08.591 --> 00:17:10.930
<v Speaker 2>actually go to the commission and say,</v>

551
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.000
<v Speaker 2>we don't want these judges to judge.</v>

552
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:13.661
<v Speaker 2>They can't say,</v>

553
00:17:13.661 --> 00:17:14.650
<v Speaker 2>put this judge and,</v>

554
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.770
<v Speaker 2>but they can knock judge his out and in commissions.</v>

555
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:18.604
<v Speaker 2>We'll listen to them.</v>

556
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

557
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.220
<v Speaker 2>the alphabet organizations,</v>

558
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.083
<v Speaker 2>they're corrupt.</v>

559
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:23.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

560
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.430
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>

561
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

562
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not teddy atlas saying it.</v>

563
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.170
<v Speaker 2>It's everybody saying that there's very few people who are going to say they're</v>

564
00:17:29.171 --> 00:17:30.004
<v Speaker 2>not corrupt,</v>

565
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 2>corrupt.</v>

566
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:30.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

567
00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:32.140
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to be honest about it and you're not,</v>

568
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.170
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have an agenda where you're afraid to say it because you have an</v>

569
00:17:35.171 --> 00:17:35.770
<v Speaker 2>agenda,</v>

570
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.600
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people do in my business,</v>

571
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.411
<v Speaker 2>they have agenda.</v>

572
00:17:38.411 --> 00:17:39.210
<v Speaker 2>So then I'm going to say,</v>

573
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:39.640
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

574
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.570
<v Speaker 2>because they're part of it.</v>

575
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.920
<v Speaker 2>If they're not part of it,</v>

576
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

577
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:43.723
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

578
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.970
<v Speaker 2>they're friendly with people that are part of it.</v>

579
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:46.540
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

580
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

581
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.010
<v Speaker 2>they want to have access,</v>

582
00:17:48.011 --> 00:17:49.180
<v Speaker 2>they want to have relationships,</v>

583
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 2>they say away from it.</v>

584
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

585
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 2>and they understand how the culture should work so they understand,</v>

586
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.021
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

587
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:55.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

588
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

589
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.680
<v Speaker 2>is it a smoky room with cigars like the old days?</v>

590
00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.071
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

591
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Frankie Carbo was one of the things,</v>

592
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:01.890
<v Speaker 2>and you put an anvil,</v>

593
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

594
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:03.234
<v Speaker 2>it's not that,</v>

595
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:08.360
<v Speaker 2>but you might be paying $30,000 for an ad and,</v>

596
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:08.740
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

597
00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.321
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

598
00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:14.321
<v Speaker 2>at a convention for the WBA or the WBC or the w IBM for Wbl,</v>

599
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 2>whatever the heck they are.</v>

600
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.060
<v Speaker 2>And you might be paying 30,000 foot and what,</v>

601
00:18:19.061 --> 00:18:20.310
<v Speaker 2>what you,</v>

602
00:18:20.311 --> 00:18:20.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

603
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.080
<v Speaker 2>why you paid the 30,000 for that?</v>

604
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you just like to see,</v>

605
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

606
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.750
<v Speaker 2>your name and add in a,</v>

607
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.630
<v Speaker 2>in a brochure.</v>

608
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

609
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.550
<v Speaker 2>there was a purpose behind paying that had.</v>

610
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.823
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

611
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>so there's no,</v>

612
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.153
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

613
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.530
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

614
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:41.530
<v Speaker 2>you have the administrators have to sport the commissions and then you have to</v>

615
00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:47.231
<v Speaker 2>alphabet organizations that get paid a sanction and free from the champion.</v>

616
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.090
<v Speaker 2>So they want that champion to win.</v>

617
00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.310
<v Speaker 2>And so they get to sanction fee.</v>

618
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.460
<v Speaker 2>And especially if he's a popular champion.</v>

619
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.840
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

620
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.100
<v Speaker 2>so now you have</v>

621
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.790
<v Speaker 2>no body saying,</v>

622
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 2>well the manager can't talk to the sanction organization for modern can't.</v>

623
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Of course they can talk to them and say,</v>

624
00:19:07.671 --> 00:19:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I want my guys rated high.</v>

625
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Of course they have access.</v>

626
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So they have access to talking to somebody,</v>

627
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.590
<v Speaker 2>influencing somebody to move their guy up in the ratings,</v>

628
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.130
<v Speaker 2>these honest ratings and they have access to telling an organization,</v>

629
00:19:25.041 --> 00:19:25.460
<v Speaker 2>well I,</v>

630
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:25.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

631
00:19:25.761 --> 00:19:28.460
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to push a mandatory,</v>

632
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>I like to push my guy to get the mandatory,</v>

633
00:19:31.101 --> 00:19:31.970
<v Speaker 2>which means of course,</v>

634
00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:34.730
<v Speaker 2>that he's got to fight them within a certain period of time.</v>

635
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:35.990
<v Speaker 2>He's got to fight to champion.</v>

636
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.400
<v Speaker 2>That was missing in MMA.</v>

637
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

638
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>that's absolutely missing.</v>

639
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.880
<v Speaker 2>So you have all that stuff going on</v>

640
00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.150
<v Speaker 2>and where,</v>

641
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.063
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

642
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:46.880
<v Speaker 2>where's the,</v>

643
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.673
<v Speaker 2>where's the,</v>

644
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.850
<v Speaker 2>where's the oversight?</v>

645
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

646
00:19:50.091 --> 00:19:50.671
<v Speaker 2>Where's all of us?</v>

647
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:51.950
<v Speaker 2>I was the police in wisdom.</v>

648
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

649
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Where's the line where,</v>

650
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.601
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>

651
00:19:56.601 --> 00:19:57.650
<v Speaker 2>people making money,</v>

652
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.360
<v Speaker 2>people running the sport,</v>

653
00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:00.290
<v Speaker 2>people making money,</v>

654
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.970
<v Speaker 2>people administrating the sport.</v>

655
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not supposed to blur a,</v>

656
00:20:03.951 --> 00:20:08.951
<v Speaker 2>there's supposed to be a separation now if you know where to go in Europe or</v>

657
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.590
<v Speaker 2>America or United States too,</v>

658
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.610
<v Speaker 2>but all to Europe where there's a lot of big fights too.</v>

659
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.240
<v Speaker 2>It's just a big fight with Joshua,</v>

660
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:17.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

661
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:18.561
<v Speaker 2>in London,</v>

662
00:20:18.561 --> 00:20:20.060
<v Speaker 2>knee drew 90,000 people,</v>

663
00:20:20.061 --> 00:20:21.410
<v Speaker 2>which is good for the sport and it's,</v>

664
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:21.891
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

665
00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:22.760
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

666
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

667
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.780
<v Speaker 2>but if you know what restaurant to go to tonight before big fight,</v>

668
00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.640
<v Speaker 2>you will walk in a restaurant.</v>

669
00:20:31.641 --> 00:20:32.474
<v Speaker 2>I've been there,</v>

670
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.700
<v Speaker 2>you will walk in a restaurant.</v>

671
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:40.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say something and if I can't stand behind it and you will see</v>

672
00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:41.600
<v Speaker 2>at the restaurant,</v>

673
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.030
<v Speaker 2>it's all big table kind of like,</v>

674
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

675
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.650
<v Speaker 2>not the last supper,</v>

676
00:20:45.651 --> 00:20:46.111
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

677
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:51.111
<v Speaker 2>it's a big table and you will see all the officials at that table that are going</v>

678
00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 2>to work to fight the next night.</v>

679
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 2>And you will see the organizational heads,</v>

680
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.920
<v Speaker 2>the heads of that sanctioning body.</v>

681
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

682
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.950
<v Speaker 2>and the guys are in charge.</v>

683
00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.561
<v Speaker 2>The presidents,</v>

684
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 2>vice presidents,</v>

685
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

686
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.550
<v Speaker 2>supervisors are judges,</v>

687
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:06.730
<v Speaker 2>referees and guess who the host of the dinners,</v>

688
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.013
<v Speaker 2>the promoter.</v>

689
00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Some more with that.</v>

690
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:10.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

691
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 2>is something greatly wrong with that?</v>

692
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.400
<v Speaker 2>So the host of the dead end,</v>

693
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.910
<v Speaker 2>it's a big bill obviously.</v>

694
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a lot of people.</v>

695
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:17.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a good restaurant.</v>

696
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 2>The eating all the best of drinking,</v>

697
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.040
<v Speaker 2>the best wines and everything else.</v>

698
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's a big bill and it's being picked up by the promoter who wants a specific</v>

699
00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:30.910
<v Speaker 2>fight to win that night and he's got all,</v>

700
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:35.911
<v Speaker 2>he's got access to all the judges or the officials or the organizational heads</v>

701
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:37.931
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

702
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:42.400
<v Speaker 2>So I would say to the people that are listening out there that,</v>

703
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.120
<v Speaker 2>just to make the analogy dead really I think would hit home the New York Yankees</v>

704
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.490
<v Speaker 2>there obviously your universally known,</v>

705
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Our Name and brand sort of organization maybe the biggest of all time.</v>

706
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 2>So how about in New York?</v>

707
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.880
<v Speaker 2>You go to the best restaurant and a night before a world series game,</v>

708
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:15.010
<v Speaker 2>you walked into the restaurant and you saw all the umpiring cruel,</v>

709
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 2>all the officials that are in charge of the umpiring for the world series game,</v>

710
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.380
<v Speaker 2>sitting at a dinner hosted by the Steinbrenner's</v>

711
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.500
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

712
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.131
<v Speaker 1>Problem,</v>

713
00:22:25.131 --> 00:22:25.761
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

714
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:26.594
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

715
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Giant problem.</v>

716
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:28.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.600
<v Speaker 2>And it can't happen because there's a commission would never let that happen</v>

718
00:22:33.601 --> 00:22:34.800
<v Speaker 2>because the integrity,</v>

719
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.700
<v Speaker 2>the credibility of Dysport would be down the tubes in one moment before you</v>

720
00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:40.350
<v Speaker 2>could finish his shrimp cocktail.</v>

721
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.290
<v Speaker 2>And so it can't happen.</v>

722
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.860
<v Speaker 1>It happens on checked in box</v>

723
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.530
<v Speaker 2>thins all the time in boxing.</v>

724
00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 2>And just the look of impropriety is wrong.</v>

725
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.220
<v Speaker 2>It should be wrong.</v>

726
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:54.441
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

727
00:22:54.441 --> 00:22:55.151
<v Speaker 2>it should be wrong.</v>

728
00:22:55.151 --> 00:22:55.984
<v Speaker 2>A baseball,</v>

729
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 2>it should be wrong and football should be wrong in MB,</v>

730
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.800
<v Speaker 2>but it should be even more wrong in a sport where you risked so much.</v>

731
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

732
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.951
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

733
00:23:03.951 --> 00:23:04.784
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

734
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:05.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

735
00:23:05.241 --> 00:23:05.661
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

736
00:23:05.661 --> 00:23:06.494
<v Speaker 1>very good point.</v>

737
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.300
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how you would ever fix that.</v>

738
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

739
00:23:08.541 --> 00:23:12.770
<v Speaker 1>how would you have some universal oversight of the entire sport and how would</v>

740
00:23:12.771 --> 00:23:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you get everybody from the Wbo w you know,</v>

741
00:23:15.591 --> 00:23:16.424
<v Speaker 1>WBC,</v>

742
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.780
<v Speaker 1>cause they wouldn't,</v>

743
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.961
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

744
00:23:17.961 --> 00:23:18.081
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

745
00:23:18.081 --> 00:23:18.441
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

746
00:23:18.441 --> 00:23:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Can have because the president of the United States started Karen when there was</v>

747
00:23:22.251 --> 00:23:23.330
<v Speaker 1>a problem with baseball.</v>

748
00:23:23.331 --> 00:23:23.810
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

749
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.643
<v Speaker 1>he got involved.</v>

750
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.120
<v Speaker 1>That was about steroids though,</v>

751
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

752
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:26.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

753
00:23:26.841 --> 00:23:27.770
<v Speaker 1>But it was a problem.</v>

754
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.120
<v Speaker 1>But wasn't that a horseshit problem?</v>

755
00:23:29.121 --> 00:23:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a real problem.</v>

756
00:23:30.081 --> 00:23:33.650
<v Speaker 1>But it was more of a problem of they wanted to clean up the image because it's</v>

757
00:23:33.651 --> 00:23:38.651
<v Speaker 1>America's sport and they had these people that were the fence.</v>

758
00:23:38.661 --> 00:23:40.550
<v Speaker 1>We're going to leave the game a little bit.</v>

759
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:41.960
<v Speaker 1>So it was a problem.</v>

760
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.001
<v Speaker 1>This is a problem.</v>

761
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:44.330
<v Speaker 1>It was impacting them.</v>

762
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It was impacting,</v>

763
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 1>loosen</v>

764
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:50.180
<v Speaker 2>w it was impacting the perception of the game,</v>

765
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.700
<v Speaker 2>which impacted the,</v>

766
00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.813
<v Speaker 2>the gates,</v>

767
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 2>what they're gonna make.</v>

768
00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.660
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately the fan base,</v>

769
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.900
<v Speaker 2>which of course impacts them financially or it impacts the country because of</v>

770
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 2>less people care about this sport.</v>

771
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

772
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see it less and if you care about it,</v>

773
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be one of the people that are left out.</v>

774
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:19.030
<v Speaker 2>So it was a problem and they can't,</v>

775
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

776
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be careful saying this,</v>

777
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:23.090
<v Speaker 2>but not that careful,</v>

778
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.330
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

779
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 2>because you have to say it,</v>

780
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that they care as much about the people in boxing.</v>

781
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they do there.</v>

782
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.113
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

783
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:32.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

784
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 2>it's more of a dangerous,</v>

785
00:24:34.131 --> 00:24:35.510
<v Speaker 2>dirty sport in their eyes.</v>

786
00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

787
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:36.691
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

788
00:24:36.691 --> 00:24:36.911
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

789
00:24:36.911 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 2>and the people that come into it and everything else.</v>

790
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:41.690
<v Speaker 2>How am I going to get into all the other stuff that you could get into that,</v>

791
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.960
<v Speaker 2>so popular to get into in some ways nowadays?</v>

793
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.020
<v Speaker 2>You mean like racism?</v>

794
00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

795
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get into that because</v>

796
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to and I don't have,</v>

797
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

798
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.030
<v Speaker 2>definitive things to show for that.</v>

799
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I just know how I,</v>

800
00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.171
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

801
00:24:58.171 --> 00:24:59.004
<v Speaker 2>the precise,</v>

802
00:24:59.420 --> 00:24:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

803
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.500
<v Speaker 1>she supports,</v>

804
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.333
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

805
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not cherished the way baseball's cherish.</v>

806
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.340
<v Speaker 1>When is a big fight like Canelo and triple g people get excited and a lot of</v>

807
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:08.174
<v Speaker 1>people buy it,</v>

808
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's not necessarily thought of as something that represents America.</v>

809
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 1>And in particularly in Canelo triple g,</v>

810
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about two people that aren't American to begin with.</v>

811
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.613
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

812
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

813
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.780
<v Speaker 2>And there's a history to boxing.</v>

814
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:20.981
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

815
00:25:20.981 --> 00:25:22.810
<v Speaker 2>that unfortunately,</v>

816
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:25:23.051 --> 00:25:24.790
<v Speaker 2>because I care about this positive for my whole life.</v>

818
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.953
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

819
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.133
<v Speaker 2>that it's kind of,</v>

820
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.170
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

821
00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 2>it's got a reputation as being corrupt and,</v>

822
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.680
<v Speaker 2>and unfortunately,</v>

823
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.480
<v Speaker 2>fortunately and unfortunately,</v>

824
00:25:34.481 --> 00:25:36.820
<v Speaker 2>like there's a pod,</v>

825
00:25:36.821 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 2>the good part where the history goes back longer,</v>

826
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.290
<v Speaker 2>farther than any other sport,</v>

827
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.393
<v Speaker 2>any other sport.</v>

828
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:43.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

829
00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:44.800
<v Speaker 2>it was the first sport in the Olympics.</v>

830
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.690
<v Speaker 2>It goes back further.</v>

831
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.970
<v Speaker 2>And it was the biggest sport in this country,</v>

832
00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.320
<v Speaker 2>bigger than baseball.</v>

833
00:25:50.321 --> 00:25:52.150
<v Speaker 2>At one time it was that big.</v>

834
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

835
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:53.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

836
00:25:53.621 --> 00:25:57.160
<v Speaker 2>so and now it's,</v>

837
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:57.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

838
00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.580
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

839
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.230
<v Speaker 2>it's too bad because,</v>

840
00:26:02.231 --> 00:26:04.570
<v Speaker 2>and it's too bad that the kids,</v>

841
00:26:04.571 --> 00:26:05.920
<v Speaker 2>that the younger people,</v>

842
00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:11.490
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the ability to learn about those fighters,</v>

843
00:26:12.631 --> 00:26:13.870
<v Speaker 2>those special fighters.</v>

844
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:14.651
<v Speaker 2>That was special.</v>

845
00:26:14.651 --> 00:26:15.484
<v Speaker 2>They really want,</v>

846
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.200
<v Speaker 2>and it was special for different reasons.</v>

847
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:17.591
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

848
00:26:17.591 --> 00:26:19.060
<v Speaker 2>like Jackie Robinson was special.</v>

849
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:19.451
<v Speaker 2>We know,</v>

850
00:26:19.451 --> 00:26:21.340
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to go into why he was special,</v>

851
00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.890
<v Speaker 2>but nobody knows that Joe Lewis,</v>

852
00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.960
<v Speaker 2>who's quiet and everything,</v>

853
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.140
<v Speaker 2>but when he was in the army and it was,</v>

854
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

855
00:26:29.591 --> 00:26:31.630
<v Speaker 2>segregation and all that crap going on,</v>

856
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.873
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

857
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.120
<v Speaker 2>he quietly used his position as heavyweight champ of the world to make sure that</v>

858
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.060
<v Speaker 2>when he went to movies and they,</v>

859
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 2>him in the front row and he saw that blacks weren't allowed to come in.</v>

860
00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:47.341
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

861
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:49.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going in there and let's blacks can come in there.</v>

862
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.800
<v Speaker 2>When he went to other sort of events where the same kind of junk was going on,</v>

863
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 2>he very quietly but powerfully</v>

864
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.730
<v Speaker 2>integrated things and said,</v>

865
00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:02.821
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

866
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a change here.</v>

867
00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:04.530
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

868
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:05.520
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to have me.</v>

869
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:08.550
<v Speaker 2>And I'd have people that look like me,</v>

870
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

871
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:10.434
<v Speaker 2>kept out.</v>

872
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.060
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

873
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.900
<v Speaker 2>and there were people I've read about it because I like reading about those</v>

874
00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

875
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.513
<v Speaker 2>but history,</v>

876
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

877
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.670
<v Speaker 2>to see how we could be better and then,</v>

878
00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

879
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 2>where we've come from.</v>

880
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.550
<v Speaker 2>And there were history of black families,</v>

881
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

882
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:27.921
<v Speaker 2>poor black family,</v>

883
00:27:27.921 --> 00:27:28.754
<v Speaker 2>he said would,</v>

884
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 2>would get hope from just saying,</v>

885
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:31.381
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

886
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:32.214
<v Speaker 2>Louis did it.</v>

887
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.390
<v Speaker 2>They would tell their kids,</v>

888
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:34.224
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

889
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:34.981
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

890
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear this.</v>

891
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.901
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear that.</v>

892
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:37.800
<v Speaker 2>You can't do this.</v>

893
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Joe Louis did it.</v>

894
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 2>And then so he was that important.</v>

895
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:41.761
<v Speaker 2>That's all,</v>

896
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:43.170
<v Speaker 2>that's the only point I'm making here.</v>

897
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.500
<v Speaker 2>He was that freaking important that that history and the history of other</v>

898
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 2>fighters like him.</v>

899
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.080
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be black fighters,</v>

900
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.040
<v Speaker 2>but that what they fought for,</v>

901
00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:55.861
<v Speaker 2>what they did,</v>

902
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:56.730
<v Speaker 2>what they overcame,</v>

903
00:27:56.731 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 2>where they came from,</v>

904
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.890
<v Speaker 2>who Benny Lennon.</v>

905
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

906
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest Jewish fighters of all time.</v>

907
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 2>It was a time when,</v>

908
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

909
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:03.971
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

910
00:28:03.971 --> 00:28:04.870
<v Speaker 2>and it's still around,</v>

911
00:28:04.871 --> 00:28:07.110
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately there's a lot of antisemitism,</v>

912
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:09.480
<v Speaker 2>but there was a time where it,</v>

913
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:09.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

914
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:11.760
<v Speaker 2>it was tough being a Jew and,</v>

915
00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

916
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 2>you're growing up and he get caught or cake.</v>

917
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm pronouncing right,</v>

918
00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:19.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it was right and you get caught all those kinds of,</v>

919
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what the hell it means.</v>

920
00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:22.800
<v Speaker 2>I just know it's a bad name to call Joe.</v>

921
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.053
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

922
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.100
<v Speaker 2>and you had all that stuff going on and Jews,</v>

923
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:33.260
<v Speaker 2>woman thought of being there were thought of moving towards banking and then</v>

924
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.020
<v Speaker 2>they're moving towards things will make them money.</v>

925
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.110
<v Speaker 2>And then later on they started doing that.</v>

926
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:41.460
<v Speaker 2>But they were the ghettos and they were trying to pull themselves out.</v>

927
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.200
<v Speaker 2>And so at that era,</v>

928
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 2>during that time to twenties to thirties,</v>

929
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.200
<v Speaker 2>the truth was some of the best fighters because that was their way of getting</v>

930
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:49.740
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

931
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.110
<v Speaker 2>But there was other,</v>

932
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:57.170
<v Speaker 2>there was another significance to be in a Jewish fighter that a lot of the kids,</v>

933
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.570
<v Speaker 2>their own thought of is bringing Tufts.</v>

934
00:29:01.571 --> 00:29:03.170
<v Speaker 2>So they got picked on and,</v>

935
00:29:03.171 --> 00:29:07.050
<v Speaker 2>and thought of that they're going to go more towards academic and other stuff.</v>

936
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.880
<v Speaker 2>So there was a weakness.</v>

937
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Perceived not true.</v>

938
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.370
<v Speaker 2>None of this stuff is used for.</v>

939
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

940
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 2>So now all of a sudden Benny Leonard comes along when a sports,</v>

941
00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:22.890
<v Speaker 2>the biggest sport in the country and he's the best freaking fighter in the game.</v>

942
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.880
<v Speaker 2>And he calmed his hair before he got in the ring and he would come out without</v>

943
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:31.380
<v Speaker 2>it being mast.</v>

944
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 2>And this was,</v>

945
00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:34.050
<v Speaker 2>this guy was,</v>

946
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:34.913
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was,</v>

947
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.240
<v Speaker 2>he was Michael Jordan.</v>

948
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean before that stuff,</v>

949
00:29:37.981 --> 00:29:38.910
<v Speaker 2>before Michael joined,</v>

950
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 2>before Air Jordan,</v>

951
00:29:40.081 --> 00:29:40.914
<v Speaker 2>Bill pointed,</v>

952
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean this guy was nine only toffees zone,</v>

953
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:48.420
<v Speaker 2>only a champion puts obviously connected to be in tough by itself.</v>

954
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.200
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

955
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 2>he was smart.</v>

956
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

957
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:52.690
<v Speaker 2>he was cool.</v>

958
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.520
<v Speaker 2>He had Pazazz,</v>

959
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 2>he was a man and there were Jewish families.</v>

960
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:00.220
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear about these stories,</v>

961
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:05.221
<v Speaker 2>but there were Jewish families I've read and I've heard from people where say,</v>

962
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.713
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

963
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 2>don't let nobody pick on you.</v>

964
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Benny Leonard is the best fighter in the world.</v>

965
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Choose a tough where we're not just smart but tough.</v>

966
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Betty Leonard shows that.</v>

967
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.160
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of history,</v>

968
00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:29.161
<v Speaker 2>that kind of pulling of people up in many different ways,</v>

969
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.310
<v Speaker 2>not just economically I out of poverty,</v>

970
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:33.880
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

971
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 2>but emotionally,</v>

972
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:36.933
<v Speaker 2>mentally,</v>

973
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 2>because you can be in poverty mentally,</v>

974
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 2>you can be in the low place mentally.</v>

975
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:43.060
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be,</v>

976
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:43.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:45.160
<v Speaker 2>financially all the time.</v>

978
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.110
<v Speaker 2>You know where you have holes in your shoes and you didn't,</v>

979
00:30:48.111 --> 00:30:50.350
<v Speaker 2>and you're wearing shirts that don't fit.</v>

980
00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:50.990
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

981
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.470
<v Speaker 2>It can be the way you feel about yourself.</v>

982
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 2>That is without,</v>

983
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.480
<v Speaker 2>without pro parity,</v>

984
00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 2>with with without value.</v>

985
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 2>You'll have no value for yourself as a person.</v>

986
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.100
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst poverty in the freaking world.</v>

987
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 2>There's not the lower than that.</v>

988
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 2>And Joe Lewis and Benny Leonard,</v>

989
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:11.381
<v Speaker 2>they were fighters.</v>

990
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 2>They won't baseball players.</v>

991
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.580
<v Speaker 2>They pulled people out of those places.</v>

992
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.220
<v Speaker 2>They let people know they had value,</v>

993
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.650
<v Speaker 2>that their rates had value.</v>

994
00:31:19.651 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Their people add value,</v>

995
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.160
<v Speaker 2>they had value and that should be known and you can go anywhere and,</v>

996
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.710
<v Speaker 2>and I'm glad you can because I love all sports.</v>

997
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.590
<v Speaker 2>You can go anywhere and you can read about the greatness of the baseball players</v>

998
00:31:33.591 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 2>in the greatness of,</v>

999
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:36.460
<v Speaker 2>of course NFL hasn't been around that long,</v>

1000
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.600
<v Speaker 2>but the greatness of those players and the greatness of the NBA players.</v>

1001
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:45.900
<v Speaker 2>But where did the kids have a get to read and to hear and to see about the</v>

1002
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:48.160
<v Speaker 2>greatness of these people,</v>

1003
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.270
<v Speaker 2>these fighters?</v>

1004
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.620
<v Speaker 2>V Nowhere,</v>

1005
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.210
<v Speaker 2>very little.</v>

1006
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.201
<v Speaker 2>Very little.</v>

1007
00:31:53.201 --> 00:31:54.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not there.</v>

1008
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.653
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1009
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Because again,</v>

1010
00:31:57.701 --> 00:31:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get into craziness,</v>

1011
00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:00.304
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1012
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.150
<v Speaker 2>the powers that be the listener,</v>

1013
00:32:03.151 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not marketed properly.</v>

1014
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:05.261
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1015
00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:06.250
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have a commission,</v>

1016
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.650
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't take care of itself the way the UFC,</v>

1017
00:32:08.651 --> 00:32:12.820
<v Speaker 2>the greatness about to why the UFC grew so much as they marketing themselves in</v>

1018
00:32:12.821 --> 00:32:13.750
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous way.</v>

1019
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.220
<v Speaker 2>So there's nobody,</v>

1020
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.690
<v Speaker 2>boxing is just dead.</v>

1021
00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:17.740
<v Speaker 2>It takes care of itself.</v>

1022
00:32:17.741 --> 00:32:20.260
<v Speaker 2>It exists because it's man against man.</v>

1023
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's always going to be there,</v>

1024
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.220
<v Speaker 2>but nobody's building it.</v>

1025
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's marketing in.</v>

1026
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 2>No one's feeding the monster to make it bigger and it's a plant that's in the</v>

1027
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:31.270
<v Speaker 2>corner of,</v>

1028
00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:31.650
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1029
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.450
<v Speaker 2>of your office that doesn't get sun,</v>

1030
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:35.780
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get warranted,</v>

1031
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's still there.</v>

1032
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:37.901
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1033
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:38.230
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1034
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:39.063
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>

1035
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:41.810
<v Speaker 2>and what I'm saying is that</v>

1036
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.060
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] I didn't want to yell because now probably happy but,</v>

1037
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.653
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1038
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Speaker 2>but it should be fed a little bit.</v>

1039
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 2>It should be watered a little bit because of what I just described.</v>

1040
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.943
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>

1041
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.650
<v Speaker 1>guys like you guys who have a deep appreciation for the history of the sport</v>

1042
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:05.370
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

1043
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:09.000
<v Speaker 1>guys who have a deep appreciation of what it meant when Joe Louis,</v>

1044
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Max Schmeling guys,</v>

1045
00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.490
<v Speaker 1>guys who understand what it meant when sugar ray Robinson was the best fighter</v>

1046
00:33:14.491 --> 00:33:18.330
<v Speaker 1>in the world and everybody knew and he pulled up in a fucking pink Cadillac with</v>

1047
00:33:18.331 --> 00:33:19.200
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful suit on</v>

1048
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:19.860
<v Speaker 2>and any,</v>

1049
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.480
<v Speaker 2>any made elevated.</v>

1050
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.040
<v Speaker 2>He elevated people in Harlem everywhere,</v>

1051
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.141
<v Speaker 2>but Harlem,</v>

1052
00:33:25.141 --> 00:33:25.590
<v Speaker 2>he had,</v>

1053
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.850
<v Speaker 2>he owned have a Harlem,</v>

1054
00:33:26.851 --> 00:33:30.880
<v Speaker 2>he owned restaurants and stores and barber shops and,</v>

1055
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.130
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

1056
00:33:32.131 --> 00:33:32.640
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1057
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.210
<v Speaker 2>and you want it to be there because that's where sugar ray Robinson came from.</v>

1058
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1059
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.093
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

1060
00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1062
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a rich part of history that really does get ignored.</v>

1063
00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you what I was smelling.</v>

1064
00:33:43.771 --> 00:33:44.311
<v Speaker 2>You brought up,</v>

1065
00:33:44.311 --> 00:33:44.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1066
00:33:44.611 --> 00:33:49.611
<v Speaker 2>a lot of his stuff and that's why it's nice to talk about which</v>

1067
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.990
<v Speaker 2>smelling was a hell of a fighter.</v>

1068
00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Joe Lewis was the brown bomber was coming up.</v>

1069
00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 2>He was undefeated and um,</v>

1070
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Schmoley had to Greg quote before the fight.</v>

1071
00:34:02.821 --> 00:34:03.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1072
00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:06.720
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like the Babe Ruth thing that did it really happen where he pointed</v>

1073
00:34:06.721 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 2>out and then he hit the,</v>

1074
00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:08.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:34:08.311 --> 00:34:08.640
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1076
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.570
<v Speaker 2>those are great stories.</v>

1077
00:34:09.571 --> 00:34:09.781
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1078
00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:10.614
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>

1079
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.140
<v Speaker 2>what's the real truth behind them?</v>

1080
00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:13.471
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1081
00:34:13.471 --> 00:34:14.010
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>

1082
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:14.910
<v Speaker 2>We don't care.</v>

1083
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.680
<v Speaker 2>We don't care to certain point.</v>

1084
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.543
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

1085
00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Because they let us feel good.</v>

1086
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:24.150
<v Speaker 2>They let us dream about possibilities and we should all have possibilities to</v>

1087
00:34:24.151 --> 00:34:24.984
<v Speaker 2>dream about.</v>

1088
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.670
<v Speaker 2>And they make somebody feel good because you know,</v>

1089
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.010
<v Speaker 2>the Babe Ruth one was connected to a sick kid.</v>

1090
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:34.350
<v Speaker 2>So it's a nice thing.</v>

1091
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.920
<v Speaker 2>It's where sports can be better than just sports than just somebody</v>

1092
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.320
<v Speaker 2>participating in it.</v>

1093
00:34:43.321 --> 00:34:44.610
<v Speaker 2>It can go beyond that.</v>

1094
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.620
<v Speaker 2>He agreed stronger than that.</v>

1095
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's some of the good stuff about it.</v>

1096
00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:52.650
<v Speaker 2>And so smelling the great story,</v>

1097
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.900
<v Speaker 2>he didn't point to,</v>

1098
00:34:54.901 --> 00:34:55.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:34:55.241 --> 00:34:55.890
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1100
00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:56.521
<v Speaker 2>to the fence,</v>

1101
00:34:56.521 --> 00:34:59.370
<v Speaker 2>but he said before the fight,</v>

1102
00:34:59.371 --> 00:35:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I see something that's my,</v>

1103
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:03.750
<v Speaker 2>my ag,</v>

1104
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.610
<v Speaker 2>my trying to be an accent for the German,</v>

1105
00:35:05.611 --> 00:35:06.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1106
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.420
<v Speaker 2>but I sound more like Sholtz from Hogan's heroes.</v>

1107
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.701
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

1108
00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Every time you try to do something like with certain ethnic,</v>

1109
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:15.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:35:15.901 --> 00:35:16.770
<v Speaker 2>pronunciations,</v>

1111
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.933
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1112
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:18.381
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1113
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:21.090
<v Speaker 2>you sound like you go to one of those sitcoms,</v>

1114
00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:22.350
<v Speaker 2>you go to one of those places,</v>

1115
00:35:22.351 --> 00:35:22.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1116
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.210
<v Speaker 2>and when I say somebody,</v>

1117
00:35:24.211 --> 00:35:24.901
<v Speaker 2>I think my kid,</v>

1118
00:35:24.901 --> 00:35:25.734
<v Speaker 2>I think my son said,</v>

1119
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.863
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1120
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:27.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1121
00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 2>he had watched one of them and I think he said he sounded like Sergeant Schultz,</v>

1122
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.160
<v Speaker 2>like from Hogan's heroes,</v>

1123
00:35:35.161 --> 00:35:35.994
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1124
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:36.841
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

1125
00:35:36.841 --> 00:35:37.674
<v Speaker 2>I see something.</v>

1126
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:43.230
<v Speaker 2>And what he saw was that Louis would jab and he would leave.</v>

1127
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 2>You should never leave your head on a,</v>

1128
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.610
<v Speaker 2>on the right side because if you leave your head,</v>

1129
00:35:47.611 --> 00:35:47.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1130
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:49.320
<v Speaker 2>you move your head to the right side,</v>

1131
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 2>you're in a path to the right hand.</v>

1132
00:35:51.151 --> 00:35:54.420
<v Speaker 2>You should actually finish on the left side because then you're outside the</v>

1133
00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:55.254
<v Speaker 2>right hand,</v>

1134
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:56.143
<v Speaker 2>your follower,</v>

1135
00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 2>that was the right hand over here.</v>

1136
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.860
<v Speaker 2>It can hit you on the outside.</v>

1137
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 2>So he had a habit of,</v>

1138
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 2>and he had a great trainer.</v>

1139
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.970
<v Speaker 2>He had a habit though at that point of leaving his head off and a right.</v>

1140
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:14.190
<v Speaker 2>So smelling saw something as he said that he could hit and we're right in.</v>

1141
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.560
<v Speaker 2>He could time it over the gym.</v>

1142
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Now smelling was of the ilk of the level of the caliber wasn't just about Talon.</v>

1143
00:36:23.771 --> 00:36:24.604
<v Speaker 2>He could punch.</v>

1144
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.553
<v Speaker 2>It was a good fighter,</v>

1145
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.240
<v Speaker 2>but it was a pro.</v>

1146
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.440
<v Speaker 2>What do I mean by that?</v>

1147
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys would hesitate a little bit,</v>

1148
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.300
<v Speaker 2>same opening.</v>

1149
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.093
<v Speaker 2>They might see it,</v>

1150
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.040
<v Speaker 2>but it was the brown bomber who was not going everyone out.</v>

1151
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.330
<v Speaker 2>So they hesitate.</v>

1152
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>

1153
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.793
<v Speaker 2>They were afraid.</v>

1154
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.713
<v Speaker 2>Normal.</v>

1155
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:44.310
<v Speaker 2>But people afraid of that word.</v>

1156
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's there.</v>

1157
00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:47.791
<v Speaker 2>I mean without it,</v>

1158
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:48.624
<v Speaker 2>we're not alive.</v>

1159
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.750
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

1160
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.820
<v Speaker 2>they might see the same thing,</v>

1161
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.680
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't going at a pro level.</v>

1162
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Pro Level is a guy that can do what he has to do.</v>

1163
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.360
<v Speaker 2>And no emotions interfere with doing it.</v>

1164
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's my simplest way of Webster's might not say that,</v>

1165
00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:05.310
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I would say.</v>

1166
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.250
<v Speaker 2>So they might've seen the opening,</v>

1167
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:13.170
<v Speaker 2>but they would hesitate just enough and be gone the door close.</v>

1168
00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's,</v>

1169
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.830
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1170
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:15.960
<v Speaker 2>it's like life.</v>

1171
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.880
<v Speaker 2>It's moments captured moment,</v>

1172
00:37:17.881 --> 00:37:18.714
<v Speaker 2>lose a moment.</v>

1173
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:19.500
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1174
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.760
<v Speaker 2>but this guy was a pro.</v>

1175
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:21.990
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1176
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.900
<v Speaker 2>he didn't let that come in there and make them hesitate that,</v>

1177
00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.773
<v Speaker 2>that fear,</v>

1178
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:27.683
<v Speaker 2>he controlled it.</v>

1179
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.340
<v Speaker 2>And if a Doberman was there,</v>

1180
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1181
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:30.930
<v Speaker 2>he was going to throw the punch.</v>

1182
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.720
<v Speaker 2>So he did and he dropped lose a few times.</v>

1183
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1184
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:35.181
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1185
00:37:35.181 --> 00:37:38.980
<v Speaker 2>he won that fight and was around and stop,</v>

1186
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:39.300
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1187
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I can't even remember.</v>

1188
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

1189
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.910
<v Speaker 2>maybe the ninth,</v>

1190
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.170
<v Speaker 2>but it was late in a fight,</v>

1191
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.440
<v Speaker 2>but he had heard them and you know,</v>

1192
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Louis was taken a beating.</v>

1193
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.610
<v Speaker 2>So Louis Lou went on,</v>

1194
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.630
<v Speaker 2>he won a world title and um,</v>

1195
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.260
<v Speaker 2>he'd be Bradick for the title,</v>

1196
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Cinderella Man,</v>

1197
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.030
<v Speaker 2>great movie.</v>

1198
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.863
<v Speaker 2>It was made,</v>

1199
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1200
00:38:04.711 --> 00:38:07.290
<v Speaker 2>he came from welfare to be in a world champion.</v>

1201
00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:09.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the product story without getting into it too much.</v>

1202
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 2>So he lose beach Braddock.</v>

1203
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 2>And had to give a percentage,</v>

1204
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1205
00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1206
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Don King and Ara might not been around then,</v>

1207
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:20.220
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1208
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.300
<v Speaker 2>but the people that taught him what to do around taught them how to take</v>

1209
00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:25.230
<v Speaker 2>advantage of fighters,</v>

1210
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:26.161
<v Speaker 2>told them of how,</v>

1211
00:38:26.161 --> 00:38:29.010
<v Speaker 2>of what options were for four options where ever known,</v>

1212
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1213
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1214
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1215
00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 2>the Vladik I think,</v>

1216
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name,</v>

1217
00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:40.730
<v Speaker 2>but products manager basically made Lewis and his people agree to give them a</v>

1218
00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 2>percentage of his purse for the rest of his career to get the fight.</v>

1219
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1220
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.633
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1221
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:47.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1222
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.041
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

1223
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:51.020
<v Speaker 2>you could obviously research it and look into it presents.</v>

1224
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:51.921
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

1225
00:38:51.921 --> 00:38:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I listen,</v>

1226
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I could say 10%,</v>

1227
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to say definitively because I'm not positive,</v>

1228
00:38:58.500 --> 00:38:59.320
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1229
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 2>but there was an understanding that,</v>

1230
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1231
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:01.811
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1232
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting a fight otherwise.</v>

1233
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Like you want to get the fight now and listen to,</v>

1234
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:07.563
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1235
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:08.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1236
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 2>not great guys,</v>

1237
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:12.270
<v Speaker 2>but king and Iram,</v>

1238
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.143
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1239
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1240
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 2>they had other guys before them that taught them some of these moves,</v>

1241
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:18.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1242
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 2>that warm and so nice.</v>

1243
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.050
<v Speaker 2>But there's always a history of good and bad.</v>

1244
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Sure always.</v>

1245
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.143
<v Speaker 2>Who's good?</v>

1246
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1247
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.730
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1248
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:27.723
<v Speaker 2>we get to that.</v>

1249
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 2>If there's a shining star promoter out there,</v>

1250
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I try to think about it.</v>

1251
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 2>But so we,</v>

1252
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.350
<v Speaker 2>so they go and they are,</v>

1253
00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Speaker 2>he witnessed the title and of course the biggest sport in the country.</v>

1254
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.650
<v Speaker 2>So all the presses there and there,</v>

1255
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Joe Champion was not yet.</v>

1256
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.233
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>

1257
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.033
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean not yet?</v>

1258
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.363
<v Speaker 2>Just one of the title.</v>

1259
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.733
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>

1260
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:54.101
<v Speaker 2>Not Too.</v>

1261
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:54.934
<v Speaker 2>I beat that man.</v>

1262
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.920
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even have to say his name.</v>

1263
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Not Too,</v>

1264
00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I beat that man.</v>

1265
00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 2>That's how much pride he had.</v>

1266
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.630
<v Speaker 2>And listen,</v>

1267
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 2>he's the real deal because in his mind,</v>

1268
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:07.540
<v Speaker 2>how can I be champion if a guy knocked me out?</v>

1269
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1270
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.750
<v Speaker 2>So when that fight took place,</v>

1271
00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:15.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean you talk about setting a stage,</v>

1272
00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:16.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1273
00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.620
<v Speaker 2>the nowadays people say,</v>

1274
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.180
<v Speaker 2>oh I'm on the stage is a lot of pressure,</v>

1275
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:19.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1276
00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:20.201
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1277
00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's not,</v>

1278
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it,</v>

1279
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of pressure,</v>

1280
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.840
<v Speaker 2>you'd almost done a lot of people look in,</v>

1281
00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:26.674
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people,</v>

1282
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1283
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 2>dependent on I I lot of stuff going on,</v>

1284
00:40:29.801 --> 00:40:30.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1285
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1286
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.900
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1287
00:40:31.901 --> 00:40:32.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1288
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.330
<v Speaker 2>maybe I got a headache,</v>

1289
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:39.810
<v Speaker 2>but Cho Lewis had world war two on horizon,</v>

1290
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.680
<v Speaker 2>the president of the United States call them up and you had Nazi Germany,</v>

1291
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 2>he had a guy named Hitler that that is saying that he's got,</v>

1292
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.880
<v Speaker 2>the master race it's going to take over the world.</v>

1294
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Just starting that stuff was not too far away from World War Two and you've got</v>

1295
00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:05.221
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff permeating in the air and you got Louis fighting a guy who of</v>

1296
00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:07.804
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

1297
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:08.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1298
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.800
<v Speaker 2>propaganda was started by the Germans,</v>

1299
00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:12.341
<v Speaker 2>if you want.</v>

1300
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Almost to me almost invented that word because you had to propaganda minister</v>

1301
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:20.940
<v Speaker 2>and you had all these terrible people with Hitler that we're putting out to dare</v>

1302
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:24.360
<v Speaker 2>the master race to this day that you had to judge you all win situation</v>

1303
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Olympics.</v>

1304
00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:30.420
<v Speaker 2>And now you had the biggest sport in the biggest country and the champion of</v>

1306
00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:36.841
<v Speaker 2>that sport to heavyweight Joe Lewis and he's fighting the German fighter</v>

1307
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Speaker 2>swelling the second time now for the title and of course you had</v>

1308
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Hitler and all his psycho fence or these people that were,</v>

1309
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:55.090
<v Speaker 2>their job was to promote it so to speak and they'd come and as saying,</v>

1310
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
<v Speaker 2>we will show the world that we're superior and there's no better way to show it</v>

1311
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.613
<v Speaker 2>then in a ring.</v>

1312
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 2>And so Lewis has to,</v>

1313
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:08.523
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1314
00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.453
<v Speaker 2>he's got it,</v>

1315
00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.350
<v Speaker 2>he's got to carry all this stuff.</v>

1316
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean take about it and he's a black guy in a catchy that,</v>

1317
00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.880
<v Speaker 2>that he still can't go to certain places,</v>

1318
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.690
<v Speaker 2>teat and he's got to carry the whole,</v>

1319
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:29.680
<v Speaker 2>he's got to carry the whole country and not let them down in the president</v>

1320
00:42:29.681 --> 00:42:30.560
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't get,</v>

1321
00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.320
<v Speaker 2>we don't know if there's a legendary story,</v>

1322
00:42:32.321 --> 00:42:33.640
<v Speaker 2>we don't know if it's completely true,</v>

1323
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:35.860
<v Speaker 2>but supposedly the president called him and said,</v>

1324
00:42:35.861 --> 00:42:36.041
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1325
00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:38.820
<v Speaker 2>you got to witness one for the good guys that that's,</v>

1326
00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:39.970
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the legends.</v>

1327
00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true,</v>

1328
00:42:41.471 --> 00:42:42.251
<v Speaker 2>but I know that,</v>

1329
00:42:42.251 --> 00:42:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he corner,</v>

1330
00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we called them and Louis has to go into,</v>

1331
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:55.070
<v Speaker 2>is kind of going to Yankee Stadium outdoors and in Times Square in New York,</v>

1332
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.710
<v Speaker 2>they used to have it set up where they would the radio because all the fight one</v>

1333
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.870
<v Speaker 2>radio back then and some of them on fights on TV on.</v>

1334
00:43:05.871 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 2>She'll lead cavalcade of sports and all that stuff.</v>

1335
00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Friday night fights but was coming along,</v>

1336
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.440
<v Speaker 2>to come along.</v>

1338
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 2>But radio was the thing.</v>

1339
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:19.970
<v Speaker 2>And so in Times Square you had the radio speakers outdoors,</v>

1340
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:22.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1341
00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:23.620
<v Speaker 2>playing a fight,</v>

1342
00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.120
<v Speaker 2>podcasts in the fight.</v>

1343
00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:26.620
<v Speaker 2>So people are out on the streets,</v>

1344
00:43:26.621 --> 00:43:29.230
<v Speaker 2>they hear the radio and they hear,</v>

1345
00:43:29.231 --> 00:43:29.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1346
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Joe Loses walking into the ring and you know,</v>

1347
00:43:33.341 --> 00:43:34.990
<v Speaker 2>and you got Yankee Stadium,</v>

1348
00:43:34.991 --> 00:43:39.991
<v Speaker 2>you've got to place four and you've got the whole world of everything I just</v>

1349
00:43:40.301 --> 00:43:41.134
<v Speaker 2>described.</v>

1350
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:42.941
<v Speaker 2>The good,</v>

1351
00:43:42.941 --> 00:43:43.511
<v Speaker 2>the bad,</v>

1352
00:43:43.511 --> 00:43:44.021
<v Speaker 2>the evil,</v>

1353
00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:44.560
<v Speaker 2>the ugly,</v>

1354
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.030
<v Speaker 2>every thing.</v>

1355
00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not a movie,</v>

1356
00:43:47.111 --> 00:43:48.220
<v Speaker 2>it's real life.</v>

1357
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:54.300
<v Speaker 2>And you got Joe Lewis and he gets in that ring and he annihilates with all this</v>

1358
00:43:55.301 --> 00:43:58.510
<v Speaker 2>pressure would said that he's got to save the,</v>

1359
00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.420
<v Speaker 2>basically the United States in a world from,</v>

1360
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:05.110
<v Speaker 2>from looking like this ugly</v>

1361
00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.180
<v Speaker 2>scorge and,</v>

1362
00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:08.451
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1363
00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:12.200
<v Speaker 2>and disease of the Nazi party is,</v>

1364
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:13.490
<v Speaker 2>is going to take over.</v>

1365
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:18.491
<v Speaker 2>The world is greater than us and he and he single handedly has to prove that.</v>

1366
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:21.323
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

1367
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.130
<v Speaker 2>he goes in and he annihilates the Chi in one round with all that stuff hanging</v>

1368
00:44:26.131 --> 00:44:26.730
<v Speaker 2>over them.</v>

1369
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the greatest single event in the history of world.</v>

1370
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.023
<v Speaker 5>Pull that fighter,</v>

1371
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.631
<v Speaker 5>pull out,</v>

1372
00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:35.010
<v Speaker 5>fight up and put it in the background.</v>

1373
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.990
<v Speaker 5>And I think that diet,</v>

1374
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.000
<v Speaker 5>when you talk about all the things,</v>

1375
00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:40.290
<v Speaker 5>the way here to talk about,</v>

1376
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:42.270
<v Speaker 5>about character,</v>

1377
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:43.920
<v Speaker 5>about talent,</v>

1378
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 5>about perseverance,</v>

1379
00:44:46.381 --> 00:44:47.460
<v Speaker 5>about resiliency,</v>

1380
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:48.120
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

1381
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.590
<v Speaker 5>about caring,</v>

1382
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:51.120
<v Speaker 5>about more than yourself,</v>

1383
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 5>about selflessness,</v>

1384
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:55.800
<v Speaker 5>about strength,</v>

1385
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:01.700
<v Speaker 5>when you talk about all those things that we try to say that we care about and</v>

1386
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:04.410
<v Speaker 5>that we sometimes look to,</v>

1387
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:05.573
<v Speaker 5>to be,</v>

1388
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:06.211
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1389
00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:07.800
<v Speaker 5>very rarely can we be that</v>

1390
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.260
<v Speaker 5>he was all that he was all of that.</v>

1391
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.750
<v Speaker 5>And there it is right there.</v>

1392
00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:15.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1393
00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.370
<v Speaker 5>how great is that?</v>

1394
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.500
<v Speaker 5>And he stalked the guy,</v>

1395
00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:23.980
<v Speaker 5>he's talked to guy and his punches were short and powerful and he was the</v>

1396
00:45:25.461 --> 00:45:30.020
<v Speaker 5>greatest finisher in the history of heavyweight bouncing because when he hurts</v>

1397
00:45:30.021 --> 00:45:30.854
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1398
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.330
<v Speaker 5>you didn't survive.</v>

1399
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.470
<v Speaker 5>He got rid of you.</v>

1400
00:45:33.471 --> 00:45:37.160
<v Speaker 5>He put punches together and it was short and he was always in position.</v>

1401
00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:38.420
<v Speaker 5>Look at his legs.</v>

1402
00:45:38.421 --> 00:45:39.590
<v Speaker 5>He's always a position.</v>

1403
00:45:39.591 --> 00:45:40.281
<v Speaker 5>You move forward.</v>

1404
00:45:40.281 --> 00:45:44.780
<v Speaker 5>It takes a little stub fall back to get yourself all those punches is absolutely</v>

1405
00:45:44.781 --> 00:45:45.381
<v Speaker 5>beautiful.</v>

1406
00:45:45.381 --> 00:45:48.260
<v Speaker 5>If you wanted to teach a young fighter how to punch correctly,</v>

1407
00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:49.340
<v Speaker 5>Joe Louis,</v>

1408
00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:50.690
<v Speaker 5>there's no better guy to Washington.</v>

1409
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:51.563
<v Speaker 5>Cholos.</v>

1410
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:53.270
<v Speaker 5>Did you see Joe,</v>

1411
00:45:53.271 --> 00:45:55.570
<v Speaker 5>what he did a minute ago?</v>

1412
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.270
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1413
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:57.110
<v Speaker 5>a minute ago.</v>

1414
00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.011
<v Speaker 5>Smelling.</v>

1415
00:45:58.011 --> 00:45:59.840
<v Speaker 5>Tried to catch him with that same right hand.</v>

1416
00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:01.540
<v Speaker 5>He had knocked him out two years earlier.</v>

1417
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:02.330
<v Speaker 5>Go back.</v>

1418
00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:03.320
<v Speaker 5>They just missed it,</v>

1419
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.880
<v Speaker 5>but he changed.</v>

1420
00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:05.990
<v Speaker 5>He stepped out.</v>

1421
00:46:05.991 --> 00:46:10.991
<v Speaker 5>He changed his distance this time because jaggy Blackburn who's a great fighter,</v>

1422
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:12.770
<v Speaker 5>a black fighter.</v>

1423
00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.550
<v Speaker 5>He was a trainee who was a great train and nobody hears about Jackie Blackburn</v>

1424
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:20.900
<v Speaker 5>what a great fighter he was and what a great trainee was and how he wasn't</v>

1425
00:46:20.901 --> 00:46:24.020
<v Speaker 5>allowed to fight white fighters and he beat everybody.</v>

1426
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:24.860
<v Speaker 5>Look at it.</v>

1427
00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:25.790
<v Speaker 5>Cattle love talk.</v>

1428
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:29.030
<v Speaker 5>Instead of laying his head on the right like he did the first fight,</v>

1429
00:46:29.031 --> 00:46:31.910
<v Speaker 5>he changed his range and he made that right hand mess.</v>

1430
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.070
<v Speaker 5>I look how calm he is.</v>

1431
00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.420
<v Speaker 5>Look how calm he is.</v>

1432
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:37.220
<v Speaker 5>Look how focused he is.</v>

1433
00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:39.740
<v Speaker 5>It's beautiful.</v>

1434
00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.720
<v Speaker 5>Watch shortness of those punches.</v>

1435
00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:43.760
<v Speaker 5>Phenomenal watches legs,</v>

1436
00:46:43.761 --> 00:46:44.870
<v Speaker 5>Jo wide swaths.</v>

1437
00:46:44.871 --> 00:46:46.310
<v Speaker 5>How he's always in position.</v>

1438
00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.173
<v Speaker 5>Look at Atlanta.</v>

1439
00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.250
<v Speaker 5>What did we miss?</v>

1440
00:46:49.251 --> 00:46:50.090
<v Speaker 5>What didn't you see?</v>

1441
00:46:50.091 --> 00:46:50.720
<v Speaker 5>Go back.</v>

1442
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.440
<v Speaker 5>The sides don't.</v>

1443
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.070
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1444
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.290
<v Speaker 5>the blinding jab that that sets it up.</v>

1445
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.850
<v Speaker 5>We don't see what the gem is.</v>

1446
00:46:55.851 --> 00:46:56.690
<v Speaker 5>Just a dick boy,</v>

1447
00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.440
<v Speaker 5>just so we can hit it with the right so you don't see it.</v>

1448
00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.313
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1449
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:03.080
<v Speaker 5>What a beautiful sidestep to right after he lands the right hand.</v>

1450
00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:03.710
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful.</v>

1451
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:04.500
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

1452
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.590
<v Speaker 5>Well that's why he's the greatest finish of all time.</v>

1453
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.671
<v Speaker 5>Watch,</v>

1454
00:47:07.671 --> 00:47:09.290
<v Speaker 5>watch way finishes this guy.</v>

1455
00:47:09.291 --> 00:47:11.560
<v Speaker 5>What it's going to go to the body and in the head,</v>

1456
00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.190
<v Speaker 5>right head to the body.</v>

1457
00:47:13.191 --> 00:47:14.240
<v Speaker 5>Right ahead to the head.</v>

1458
00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:15.403
<v Speaker 5>Ha.</v>

1459
00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.180
<v Speaker 5>That is so short.</v>

1460
00:47:17.181 --> 00:47:18.530
<v Speaker 5>And even when he's got the guy hurt,</v>

1461
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.370
<v Speaker 5>look at the guy.</v>

1462
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.881
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

1463
00:47:19.881 --> 00:47:20.714
<v Speaker 5>Phenomenal,</v>

1464
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:22.400
<v Speaker 5>phenomenal.</v>

1465
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.270
<v Speaker 5>And he did all of that with everything we just talked about for the last 20</v>

1466
00:47:26.271 --> 00:47:26.990
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>

1467
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:28.010
<v Speaker 5>Hanging over him.</v>

1468
00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:28.873
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1469
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1470
00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.630
<v Speaker 5>it's a giant piece of history that people don't talk about it.</v>

1471
00:47:33.631 --> 00:47:35.190
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't that make you think a little bit,</v>

1472
00:47:35.191 --> 00:47:37.710
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it make you feel something about us?</v>

1473
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.370
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1474
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:38.641
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1475
00:47:38.641 --> 00:47:41.010
<v Speaker 5>Well it's one of the reasons why I'm a giants fan of the sport.</v>

1476
00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:41.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1477
00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.060
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1478
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:42.331
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1479
00:47:42.331 --> 00:47:42.840
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>

1480
00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.380
<v Speaker 5>that alone is in terms of like historical impact.</v>

1481
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.041
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you.</v>

1482
00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:51.060
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the biggest moments in all of sports ever in life.</v>

1483
00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:51.923
<v Speaker 5>In life.</v>

1484
00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:53.310
<v Speaker 5>You know what I like about boxing?</v>

1485
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:56.660
<v Speaker 6>I like a lot of things at all.</v>

1486
00:47:56.661 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't like the administrators.</v>

1487
00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.293
<v Speaker 6>I hate them.</v>

1488
00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.700
<v Speaker 6>I know there's a powerful word,</v>

1489
00:48:01.701 --> 00:48:02.900
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

1490
00:48:02.901 --> 00:48:04.070
<v Speaker 6>not every single one of them,</v>

1491
00:48:04.071 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 6>but I'm just saying I,</v>

1492
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.063
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1493
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.490
<v Speaker 6>I hate their weakness.</v>

1494
00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.170
<v Speaker 6>I hate that cowardice.</v>

1495
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.113
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

1496
00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:12.020
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

1497
00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.430
<v Speaker 6>Because they sit outside the ring.</v>

1498
00:48:13.431 --> 00:48:14.030
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them,</v>

1499
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:15.200
<v Speaker 6>you brought up a point,</v>

1500
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.980
<v Speaker 6>they should have had an experience one way or the other and they've never ever</v>

1501
00:48:18.981 --> 00:48:19.460
<v Speaker 6>had any,</v>

1502
00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.091
<v Speaker 6>he punched him.</v>

1503
00:48:20.091 --> 00:48:21.950
<v Speaker 6>And I'm not saying you to be a man,</v>

1504
00:48:21.951 --> 00:48:22.761
<v Speaker 6>you got to get punched.</v>

1505
00:48:22.761 --> 00:48:24.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying any of that stuff.</v>

1506
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.510
<v Speaker 6>It's being a man as a lot more than that.</v>

1507
00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:27.920
<v Speaker 6>A lot more know.</v>

1508
00:48:27.921 --> 00:48:29.960
<v Speaker 6>Plenty of people get punched and then I met.</v>

1509
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:35.650
<v Speaker 6>But what I'm saying is that you should understand what it feels to a person to</v>

1510
00:48:38.301 --> 00:48:43.220
<v Speaker 6>put themselves on the line and to risk so much and to risk everything</v>

1511
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:47.750
<v Speaker 6>to try to get their family in a better place.</v>

1512
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.280
<v Speaker 6>I think there's also,</v>

1513
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:50.540
<v Speaker 6>they should be a fan.</v>

1514
00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:53.030
<v Speaker 6>And I don't think some of them are even fans.</v>

1515
00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:53.181
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1516
00:48:53.181 --> 00:48:53.900
<v Speaker 6>they're not.</v>

1517
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:54.621
<v Speaker 6>And some of my,</v>

1518
00:48:54.621 --> 00:48:55.490
<v Speaker 6>not even like it,</v>

1519
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.510
<v Speaker 6>they wouldn't tell you that.</v>

1520
00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:57.140
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1521
00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.310
<v Speaker 6>But they just do it for a job.</v>

1522
00:48:58.460 --> 00:48:59.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1523
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.330
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1524
00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:00.860
<v Speaker 6>and what I'm saying is that</v>

1525
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.770
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>

1526
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:07.490
<v Speaker 6>when I see these people that haven't put them spending that place and not</v>

1527
00:49:07.491 --> 00:49:08.630
<v Speaker 6>everyone can be in that place.</v>

1528
00:49:08.631 --> 00:49:09.171
<v Speaker 6>So again,</v>

1529
00:49:09.171 --> 00:49:11.510
<v Speaker 6>I gotta be careful with that if I'm going to be fair,</v>

1530
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:17.720
<v Speaker 6>but for them so easily to take something away from somebody,</v>

1531
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:19.760
<v Speaker 6>see what's different for me,</v>

1532
00:49:19.761 --> 00:49:21.410
<v Speaker 6>why I get passionate.</v>

1533
00:49:21.411 --> 00:49:22.430
<v Speaker 6>And if you want to use that word,</v>

1534
00:49:22.431 --> 00:49:23.181
<v Speaker 6>people say Teddy,</v>

1535
00:49:23.181 --> 00:49:24.410
<v Speaker 6>you can get a little crazy</v>

1536
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:31.710
<v Speaker 6>if it happens in baseball and the guy beats out to 12 now you have cameras.</v>

1537
00:49:31.851 --> 00:49:33.110
<v Speaker 6>So you didn't use half that.</v>

1538
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:37.100
<v Speaker 6>But if a guy you didn't have replay back in the day,</v>

1539
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:38.240
<v Speaker 6>the guy,</v>

1540
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.260
<v Speaker 6>it happened a lot of times,</v>

1541
00:49:39.261 --> 00:49:40.100
<v Speaker 6>guy was safe and,</v>

1542
00:49:40.101 --> 00:49:40.934
<v Speaker 6>and call them out.</v>

1543
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:42.080
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

1544
00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 6>Too Bad.</v>

1545
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:42.900
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

1546
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.733
<v Speaker 6>it's a shame,</v>

1547
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.781
<v Speaker 6>but you know what?</v>

1548
00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:48.890
<v Speaker 6>The next day he's going to play the game again and he's going to be able to make</v>

1549
00:49:48.891 --> 00:49:49.724
<v Speaker 6>amends for that.</v>

1550
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:52.670
<v Speaker 6>He and his family and he's got guaranteed contracts.</v>

1551
00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.130
<v Speaker 6>And you know what it's going to be okay.</v>

1552
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.730
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1553
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:56.563
<v Speaker 6>was it right?</v>

1554
00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.980
<v Speaker 6>Wrong is never right.</v>

1555
00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.113
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1556
00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:00.770
<v Speaker 6>but you know what?</v>

1557
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.700
<v Speaker 6>In the mix of things we could overcome that.</v>

1558
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.410
<v Speaker 6>But now you take a fighter,</v>

1559
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:11.960
<v Speaker 6>same thing and the judge judges make a mistake maybe on purpose,</v>

1560
00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:12.770
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

1561
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.810
<v Speaker 6>but they make a bad mistake.</v>

1562
00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.011
<v Speaker 6>The fight,</v>

1563
00:50:16.011 --> 00:50:19.130
<v Speaker 6>it can't go back the next day and rectify that to fight it doesn't have a</v>

1564
00:50:19.131 --> 00:50:20.150
<v Speaker 6>guaranteed contract.</v>

1565
00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:22.820
<v Speaker 6>He only has what he can make if he gets to that fight,</v>

1566
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.720
<v Speaker 6>that's it for that night because where that fight goes,</v>

1567
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 6>he go back to the</v>

1568
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.980
<v Speaker 2>dug out and then come out the next day and play again with a new uniform on.</v>

1569
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Now he goes to the back of the line and boxing and has to take hundreds,</v>

1570
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:42.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe thousands of punches to get back to that place.</v>

1571
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:47.471
<v Speaker 2>He was to earn the right to get closer to the exit in a business because</v>

1572
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 2>everyone's trying to get to the exit to try and again what they can gain,</v>

1573
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 2>but their legacy for their families,</v>

1574
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:59.510
<v Speaker 2>for themselves in many ways financially,</v>

1575
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1576
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:01.070
<v Speaker 2>and and,</v>

1577
00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 2>but also what's inside them that they,</v>

1578
00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:07.640
<v Speaker 2>that they have to prove something,</v>

1579
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 2>that they have to make it for old different personal reasons.</v>

1580
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:16.870
<v Speaker 2>And they're close to doing that and now they're forced because of some crock.</v>

1581
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's incompetence.</v>

1582
00:51:19.521 --> 00:51:21.230
<v Speaker 2>It either corruption and incompetence.</v>

1583
00:51:21.231 --> 00:51:22.064
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1584
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:26.660
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes it's corruption and they have to go all the way to the back of the</v>

1585
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:27.623
<v Speaker 2>liner.</v>

1586
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm playing a football game the next Sunday.</v>

1587
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Then I played in an NBA game two days later and they got to take all those</v>

1588
00:51:36.591 --> 00:51:37.940
<v Speaker 2>punches and hope,</v>

1589
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.493
<v Speaker 2>hope</v>

1590
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.320
<v Speaker 2>they get back to that place.</v>

1591
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:43.520
<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>

1592
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I seen it.</v>

1593
00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 2>I did 22 years of ESPN boxing.</v>

1594
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I've been with ESPN about 22 years,</v>

1595
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.410
<v Speaker 2>but I did like 18 years,</v>

1596
00:51:51.411 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Speaker 2>whatever was a Friday night fights.</v>

1597
00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 2>We did a lot of title fights.</v>

1598
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Not to big names,</v>

1599
00:51:56.901 --> 00:51:58.070
<v Speaker 2>not to Canelo's,</v>

1600
00:51:58.071 --> 00:52:00.050
<v Speaker 2>not not to go off gins,</v>

1601
00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:01.220
<v Speaker 2>not the Mayweathers,</v>

1602
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.480
<v Speaker 2>what guys that had mentors as much to even more because they didn't have</v>

1603
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:10.481
<v Speaker 2>millions of Dallas and they got this shot and I watched them get robbed</v>

1604
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:14.240
<v Speaker 2>and I saw that they never got back there.</v>

1605
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:16.790
<v Speaker 2>That night was the right night for them.</v>

1606
00:52:16.791 --> 00:52:18.260
<v Speaker 2>That particular night,</v>

1607
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:19.370
<v Speaker 2>everything worked.</v>

1608
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Everything was perfect,</v>

1609
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 2>all that training,</v>

1610
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:26.690
<v Speaker 2>everything came together and they were beautiful.</v>

1611
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:31.640
<v Speaker 2>They were magnificent and they were freaking robbed and it's wrong.</v>

1612
00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.110
<v Speaker 2>It's really wrong.</v>

1613
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:35.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they do when they do that.</v>

1614
00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.480
<v Speaker 2>But the glorious thing of if that's not too</v>

1615
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:42.290
<v Speaker 2>made up of a word,</v>

1616
00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:43.310
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like Gloria,</v>

1617
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:48.670
<v Speaker 2>but the beautiful thing about boxing is that with everything warm in the world,</v>

1618
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.040
<v Speaker 2>and I hate to use this cliche,</v>

1619
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:55.880
<v Speaker 2>this terminology,</v>

1620
00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:58.550
<v Speaker 2>but you know with life being unfair,</v>

1621
00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:00.500
<v Speaker 2>because I don't like to use that because,</v>

1622
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.440
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes people nowadays for me,</v>

1623
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.370
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1624
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:05.840
<v Speaker 2>there's too many excuses out there.</v>

1625
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:06.650
<v Speaker 2>There really are.</v>

1626
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:08.240
<v Speaker 2>There's too many damn excuses.</v>

1627
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:09.321
<v Speaker 2>You're in this country,</v>

1628
00:53:09.321 --> 00:53:13.010
<v Speaker 2>you got a chance to do something where you don't have in other places.</v>

1629
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:16.220
<v Speaker 2>But having said that,</v>

1630
00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.710
<v Speaker 2>he can feel like life's not fair sometimes,</v>

1631
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.000
<v Speaker 2>especially when you think about some of the things we just talked about in a day</v>

1632
00:53:23.001 --> 00:53:23.811
<v Speaker 2>that's gone now.</v>

1633
00:53:23.811 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not there no more,</v>

1634
00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:25.380
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1635
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:25.621
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1636
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Dave Lewis</v>

1637
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 6>and all those kind of people,</v>

1638
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 6>life wasn't fair.</v>

1639
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.181
<v Speaker 6>That really,</v>

1640
00:53:30.181 --> 00:53:31.920
<v Speaker 6>they really had a right to use that say,</v>

1641
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:33.031
<v Speaker 6>nowadays,</v>

1642
00:53:33.031 --> 00:53:34.980
<v Speaker 6>I don't think people have of white,</v>

1643
00:53:34.981 --> 00:53:35.401
<v Speaker 6>black,</v>

1644
00:53:35.401 --> 00:53:36.234
<v Speaker 6>purple,</v>

1645
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.930
<v Speaker 6>they don't have a right to say that to the extent that they did back then.</v>

1646
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.730
<v Speaker 6>Not to the extent,</v>

1647
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:40.960
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1648
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.160
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1649
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 6>they don't.</v>

1650
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.130
<v Speaker 6>They really lose all the things wrong or they're messed up.</v>

1651
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 6>People still out there.</v>

1652
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1653
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:45.991
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1654
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:46.411
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1655
00:53:46.411 --> 00:53:46.771
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1656
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:47.604
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1657
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 6>But sometimes it's too easy to use that.</v>

1658
00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:51.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1659
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:52.230
<v Speaker 6>It's just too easy.</v>

1660
00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:52.980
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>

1661
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.813
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1662
00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:57.420
<v Speaker 6>but there was a time when life too often was unfair.</v>

1663
00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:58.520
<v Speaker 6>Ruthlessly on unfair.</v>

1664
00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.580
<v Speaker 6>Really unfair.</v>

1665
00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.480
<v Speaker 6>Ruthlessly.</v>

1666
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:01.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1667
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:01.913
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1668
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:02.803
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1669
00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:05.490
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1670
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:08.460
<v Speaker 6>And when life was unfair,</v>

1671
00:54:08.461 --> 00:54:10.740
<v Speaker 6>boxing was around to make it fair,</v>

1672
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:11.693
<v Speaker 6>and I'll tell you how.</v>

1673
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.883
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1674
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:15.170
<v Speaker 6>On one given night.</v>

1675
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:18.230
<v Speaker 6>If you worked hard enough,</v>

1676
00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:21.470
<v Speaker 6>if you dream big enough,</v>

1677
00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.810
<v Speaker 6>if you were tough enough and you made yourself tough enough,</v>

1678
00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:27.640
<v Speaker 6>you sacrificed enough,</v>

1679
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:34.610
<v Speaker 6>you became polished and savvy enough and and technically</v>

1680
00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:42.240
<v Speaker 6>equipped to do things that you had and you learn those things and you just work</v>

1681
00:54:42.331 --> 00:54:43.510
<v Speaker 6>yourself to the ball,</v>

1682
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.320
<v Speaker 4>okay?</v>

1683
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.520
<v Speaker 6>No matter where you came from,</v>

1684
00:54:46.521 --> 00:54:48.410
<v Speaker 6>no matter what part of the world,</v>

1685
00:54:48.411 --> 00:54:48.811
<v Speaker 6>no matter what,</v>

1686
00:54:48.811 --> 00:54:49.730
<v Speaker 6>who your parents were,</v>

1687
00:54:49.731 --> 00:54:52.180
<v Speaker 6>no matter what your poverty level may have been made,</v>

1688
00:54:52.181 --> 00:54:53.014
<v Speaker 6>not of bed,</v>

1689
00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.920
<v Speaker 6>no matter what you had,</v>

1690
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.371
<v Speaker 6>would,</v>

1691
00:54:55.371 --> 00:54:56.210
<v Speaker 6>you didn't have,</v>

1692
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:58.990
<v Speaker 6>no matter what people had told you,</v>

1693
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.890
<v Speaker 6>didn't tell you</v>

1694
00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:03.643
<v Speaker 6>all of that.</v>

1695
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.080
<v Speaker 6>If you made yourself and took advantage of that opportunity and get yourself</v>

1696
00:55:09.081 --> 00:55:09.914
<v Speaker 6>ready</v>

1697
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:15.160
<v Speaker 6>and you were ready to behave like a champion,</v>

1698
00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:22.020
<v Speaker 6>you could get in that ring on one given night and make the world fair and have</v>

1699
00:55:23.621 --> 00:55:24.460
<v Speaker 6>your hand lifted,</v>

1700
00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.920
<v Speaker 6>heavy call champion of the world.</v>

1701
00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:29.740
<v Speaker 6>That makes boxes special.</v>

1702
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:32.950
<v Speaker 6>And that's what these judges don't get.</v>

1703
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:34.990
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1704
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:39.790
<v Speaker 6>That kids are waiting to hear that and they give everything,</v>

1705
00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:41.541

1707
00:55:42.851 --> 00:55:46.420
<v Speaker 6>Where I would dive for those people that would die for that.</v>

1708
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:49.090
<v Speaker 6>So we have people in our times,</v>

1709

1718
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:06.520
<v Speaker 6>because of the reality of the actions attached to that world word.</v>

1719
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:08.803
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1720

1726
00:56:16.601 --> 00:56:17.830
<v Speaker 6>your hand will be lifted.</v>

1727
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:19.930
<v Speaker 6>You will be called champion of the world.</v>

1728
00:56:19.931 --> 00:56:24.931
<v Speaker 6>All your people will see it and the people you want see it and yourself,</v>

1729
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 6>but your die afterwards I would give you that.</v>

1730
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 6>People would sign on.</v>

1731
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:33.130
<v Speaker 6>That's how important that was.</v>

1732
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:38.550
<v Speaker 6>That's what that stood for and then you get judges that have no conception of</v>

1733
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:40.204
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

1734
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:42.640
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean to laugh,</v>

1735
00:56:42.641 --> 00:56:43.460
<v Speaker 6>but no,</v>

1736
00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 6>I learned saying they have to have a complete conception of it,</v>

1737
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 6>but no feeling of what we're talking about.</v>

1738
00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:51.700
<v Speaker 6>I think they're like DMV workers.</v>

1739
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:52.581
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

1740
00:56:52.581 --> 00:56:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of them that are real good,</v>

1741
00:56:54.291 --> 00:56:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them are just like people that had just taken a government job.</v>

1742
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:58.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

1743
00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a travesty that they're not removed.</v>

1744
00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:04.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think when whenever I go to a UFC and it,</v>

1745
00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:05.330
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1746
00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:05.811
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it,</v>

1747
00:57:05.811 --> 00:57:06.644
<v Speaker 1>the same judges,</v>

1748
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:08.360
<v Speaker 1>and I see some of these,</v>

1749
00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.313
<v Speaker 1>these scores,</v>

1750
00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to take my fucking headset off and throw it into the cage and scream and</v>

1751
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:18.260
<v Speaker 1>flip over the table and you just kind of take a deep breath and calm yourself</v>

1752
00:57:18.261 --> 00:57:20.210
<v Speaker 1>down because there's nothing you can do.</v>

1753
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.100
<v Speaker 1>And these athletic commissions have kept,</v>

1754
00:57:22.101 --> 00:57:23.990
<v Speaker 1>kept these people on for whatever reason.</v>

1755
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:25.580
<v Speaker 1>And you're watching a bad decision.</v>

1756
00:57:25.581 --> 00:57:27.740
<v Speaker 1>You watch the someone who trained for eight,</v>

1757
00:57:27.741 --> 00:57:30.860
<v Speaker 1>10 weeks for this one particular fight and years and years to get to that</v>

1758
00:57:30.861 --> 00:57:34.040
<v Speaker 1>position and they're getting fucked and the getting fucked because someone just</v>

1759
00:57:34.041 --> 00:57:36.020
<v Speaker 1>sucks at their job and they don't care.</v>

1760
00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:36.853
<v Speaker 1>And this person,</v>

1761
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.411
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1762
00:57:37.411 --> 00:57:37.640
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1763
00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.280
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be there two months from now at another fight.</v>

1764
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.200
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing you could do about it.</v>

1765
00:57:42.201 --> 00:57:43.220
<v Speaker 1>And I don't understand it.</v>

1766
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how the commissions let this slide.</v>

1767
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how difficult it is to fire these people would approve they're</v>

1768
00:57:48.141 --> 00:57:48.974
<v Speaker 1>incompetent.</v>

1769
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:52.310
<v Speaker 1>But I do know that especially with with,</v>

1770
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:53.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1771
00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's probably true with both boxing and MMA,</v>

1772
00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.650
<v Speaker 1>there are countless fans out there.</v>

1773
00:57:57.651 --> 00:57:59.120
<v Speaker 1>They would do a far better job,</v>

1774
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.313
<v Speaker 1>countless,</v>

1775
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:05.240
<v Speaker 1>countless people that have experienced in fighting countless people that have a</v>

1776
00:58:05.241 --> 00:58:08.480
<v Speaker 1>deep appreciation and understanding of what's actually going on inside the</v>

1777
00:58:08.481 --> 00:58:09.314
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1778
00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And these people don't get those jobs.</v>

1779
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:16.540
<v Speaker 1>And instead the same fools continue to give piss poor decisions or corrupt</v>

1780
00:58:17.271 --> 00:58:18.104
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

1781
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1782
00:58:18.501 --> 00:58:19.520
<v Speaker 1>whoever that woman was,</v>

1783
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1784
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:22.070
<v Speaker 1>there's even mention people's names,</v>

1785
00:58:22.071 --> 00:58:23.480
<v Speaker 1>but there's been some decisions.</v>

1786
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:25.040
<v Speaker 1>There's been some horrific</v>

1787
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:27.260
<v Speaker 6>with the Mayweather.</v>

1788
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.090
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1797
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.860
<v Speaker 1>her name either because she was also involved in,</v>

1798
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:40.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1799

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1805
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.720
<v Speaker 6>She was involved in a couple.</v>

1806
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:47.613
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>a couple.</v>

1808
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:49.953
<v Speaker 6>At least to,</v>

1809
00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:51.460
<v Speaker 6>I think we're being,</v>

1810
00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.260
<v Speaker 6>we're being responsible.</v>

1811
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:54.731
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1812
00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 6>why was she still there?</v>

1813
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:56.703
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1814
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:57.310
<v Speaker 6>Seriously.</v>

1815
00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:57.880
<v Speaker 6>Why was she,</v>

1816
00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.050
<v Speaker 6>why was she still that?</v>

1817
00:58:59.080 --> 00:58:59.530
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

1818
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:00.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1819
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.311
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

1820
00:59:00.311 --> 00:59:01.450
<v Speaker 6>Why was she still there?</v>

1821
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.313
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1822
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:06.150
<v Speaker 6>we're not talking about neurosurgeon said really,</v>

1823
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.261
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1824
00:59:07.261 --> 00:59:08.220
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a job.</v>

1825
00:59:08.221 --> 00:59:09.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that could do it.</v>

1826
00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's an easy job,</v>

1827
00:59:11.761 --> 00:59:13.620
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying there's a lot of people that are,</v>

1828
00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:15.390
<v Speaker 1>have a real understanding of boxing.</v>

1829
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:17.070
<v Speaker 1>They would have done a way better job.</v>

1830
00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:17.411
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1831
00:59:17.411 --> 00:59:18.400
<v Speaker 6>somebody robs a bank.</v>

1832
00:59:18.401 --> 00:59:20.020
<v Speaker 6>They're not your bank teller the next week.</v>

1833
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.093
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1834
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.263
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1835
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:24.350

<v Speaker 5>The best.</v>

1838
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:27.321
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1839
00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 5>at least Oscar de la Hoya,</v>

1840
00:59:28.641 --> 00:59:29.540
<v Speaker 5>Bernard Hopkins,</v>

1841
00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 5>they're legit world champion fighters.</v>

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 5>They got to strengthen and got a weakness.</v>

1845
00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:42.350
<v Speaker 5>Their weakness is they attached really attached at the hip to one.</v>

1846
00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:43.020
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1847
00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 5>there are solar system,</v>

1848
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:44.931

1850
00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:51.160
<v Speaker 5>Canelo disappears tomorrow and they're fucked.</v>

1851
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1852
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.193
<v Speaker 5>they're not happy.</v>

1853
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:55.220
<v Speaker 5>They got some problems.</v>

1854
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:57.470
<v Speaker 5>But listen now Hayman's out there,</v>

1855
00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.311
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

00:59:58.641 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 5>he's PBC.</v>

00:59:59.720 --> 00:59:59.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1859
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.823

1862
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.293
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1863
01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:09.320
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm saying the numbers right where Fox gave him $50 million for a four</v>

1864
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:14.321
<v Speaker 5>year deal to put fights out there and he's probably got the best stable of</v>

1865
01:00:14.421 --> 01:00:14.841
<v Speaker 5>fighters.</v>

1866
01:00:14.841 --> 01:00:15.021

1925

1927
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:38.280

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:44.000
<v Speaker 5>I say it a lot of times he had that eraser,</v>

1933
01:01:44.001 --> 01:01:44.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1934
01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.313
<v Speaker 5>I remember,</v>

1935
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:48.410
<v Speaker 5>I remember I was not a great memory,</v>

1936
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:49.580
<v Speaker 5>but as a kid,</v>

1937
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.750
<v Speaker 5>somehow I wound up in a Catholic school for a minute.</v>

1938
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.640
<v Speaker 5>And those nuns,</v>

1939
01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:57.820
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1940
01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:58.970
<v Speaker 5>they should have been fighters.</v>

1941
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.083
<v Speaker 5>They were mean.</v>

1942
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.710
<v Speaker 5>They were mean.</v>

1943
01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.240
<v Speaker 5>I think they were a little twisted,</v>

1944
01:02:05.241 --> 01:02:05.691
<v Speaker 5>some of them.</v>

1945
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:07.190
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not going to go to,</v>

1946
01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:08.090
<v Speaker 5>but they were little,</v>

1947
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:09.163
<v Speaker 5>they would mean,</v>

1948
01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:12.680
<v Speaker 5>but they had no problem hitting you in the head with that black racer.</v>

1949
01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:14.420
<v Speaker 5>Like you won't Pay Bang.</v>

1950
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:15.170
<v Speaker 5>It was just like,</v>

1951
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.951
<v Speaker 5>and it was hard.</v>

1952
01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:16.431
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

1953
01:02:16.431 --> 01:02:17.264
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1954
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:18.790
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

1955
01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.273
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

1956
01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:22.830
<v Speaker 5>And he has that eraser.</v>

1957
01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:23.913
<v Speaker 5>That's the point on.</v>

1958
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 5>He has done a razor where bank put his technique,</v>

1959
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:31.620
<v Speaker 5>his feet come up on the tone,</v>

1960
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.540
<v Speaker 5>take the bear lands technique,</v>

1961
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:34.440
<v Speaker 5>bed power,</v>

1962
01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.430

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.441
<v Speaker 5>He lands.</v>

1966
01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:38.390
<v Speaker 5>People go flying.</v>

1967
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:41.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean giant heavyweight either in terms of his smell,</v>

1968
01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.760
<v Speaker 5>but you know what he is.</v>

1969
01:02:42.761 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 5>So he's long and he's tall and he looked at those arms.</v>

1970
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 5>He was long.</v>

1971
01:02:47.821 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean he could hear,</v>

1972
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.480
<v Speaker 5>he could hit you across the room.</v>

1973
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 5>Well sows,</v>

1974
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.650
<v Speaker 5>Tyson fury.</v>

1975
01:02:52.651 --> 01:02:54.840
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the things that makes this fight very,</v>

1976
01:02:54.841 --> 01:02:56.190
<v Speaker 5>very interesting.</v>

1977
01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:59.760
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the times where that's saying styles make fights.</v>

1978
01:02:59.761 --> 01:03:00.270
<v Speaker 5>That's going up.</v>

1979
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:01.350
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be this fight.</v>

1980
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:02.940
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be the whole thing.</v>

1981
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.680
<v Speaker 5>Tyson fury as a motherfucker.</v>

1982
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:04.921
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1983
01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:05.620
<v Speaker 5>he could move.</v>

1984
01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:05.831
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1985
01:03:05.831 --> 01:03:06.661
<v Speaker 5>It's not only six,</v>

1986
01:03:06.661 --> 01:03:07.860
<v Speaker 5>seven or whatever the hell he is,</v>

1987
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:09.601
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>

1988
01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:10.434
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>

1989
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:10.891
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>

1990
01:03:10.891 --> 01:03:11.790
<v Speaker 5>nine long.</v>

1991
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.740
<v Speaker 5>But he can move each had legs.</v>

1992
01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:14.510
<v Speaker 5>Phenomenal.</v>

1993
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:15.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:17.550
<v Speaker 5>Somebody forgot to tell me he's a heavy because he moves around like a</v>

1995
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:21.200
<v Speaker 5>lightweight and that could be a problem until he gets,</v>

1996
01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:23.790
<v Speaker 5>it also talks tremendous shit until he gets it.</v>

1997
01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:24.911
<v Speaker 5>Well then,</v>

1998
01:03:24.911 --> 01:03:26.080
<v Speaker 5>then things change.</v>

1999
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.290
<v Speaker 5>But I always used to say when I was doing a broadcast,</v>

2000
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:30.710
<v Speaker 5>so if I,</v>

2001
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:31.660
<v Speaker 5>I would always say,</v>

2002
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.000
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

2003
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.421
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

2004
01:03:34.421 --> 01:03:37.190
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say it if I didn't have a belief in us and,</v>

2005
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.560
<v Speaker 5>and the proof of it,</v>

2006
01:03:38.561 --> 01:03:43.561
<v Speaker 5>in my mind at least that punches are born then I made you're born when you're</v>

2007
01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:46.720
<v Speaker 5>not born to be a punch of that level.</v>

2008
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.850
<v Speaker 5>And I'll tell you something funny that,</v>

2009
01:03:48.851 --> 01:03:51.340
<v Speaker 5>because you brought it up about him being,</v>

2010
01:03:51.341 --> 01:03:51.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2011
01:03:51.581 --> 01:03:52.240
<v Speaker 5>he's not a big,</v>

2012
01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:52.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2013
01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:55.990
<v Speaker 5>he's not that prototypical big Husky,</v>

2014
01:03:55.991 --> 01:03:56.824
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2015
01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:57.843
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2016
01:03:57.970 --> 01:03:58.271
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2017
01:03:58.271 --> 01:03:59.104
<v Speaker 5>wedged out.</v>

2018
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2019
01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.450
<v Speaker 5>He's not that right.</v>

2020
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:04.900
<v Speaker 5>But I'll tell you when I was training fighters,</v>

2021
01:04:04.901 --> 01:04:08.740
<v Speaker 5>when I was young and I was taking them to smokers in the Bronx to get experience</v>

2022
01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:10.443
<v Speaker 5>every week,</v>

2023
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.460
<v Speaker 5>tough places in the South Bronx,</v>

2024
01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:15.010
<v Speaker 5>and we were taking them to these unsanctioned fights just to get them</v>

2025
01:04:15.011 --> 01:04:15.844
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

2026
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:18.180
<v Speaker 5>And if I didn't know the fight,</v>

2027
01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:18.790
<v Speaker 5>I say I had,</v>

2028
01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:21.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm responsible for these kids back then.</v>

2029
01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm like their parent and their trust me,</v>

2030
01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.240
<v Speaker 5>some of them didn't have parents,</v>

2031
01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:26.080
<v Speaker 5>but the ones that did,</v>

2032
01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:27.640
<v Speaker 5>they would trust me to take care of this kid.</v>

2033
01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:29.560
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know what was going to the South Bronx where,</v>

2034
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:30.251
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

2035
01:04:30.251 --> 01:04:31.210
<v Speaker 5>I remember one time,</v>

2036
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:31.680
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2037
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.210
<v Speaker 5>I bought a car from somebody,</v>

2038
01:04:33.211 --> 01:04:34.630
<v Speaker 5>they didn't have to cook enough car.</v>

2039
01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.400
<v Speaker 5>It was the publisher of the newspaper,</v>

2040
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.340
<v Speaker 5>the Catskill Daily Mail.</v>

2041
01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.473
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2042
01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:44.470
<v Speaker 5>and I've gone through his name of the publisher and I bought his station wagon.</v>

2043
01:04:44.471 --> 01:04:46.450
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have a car big enough to take the kids.</v>

2044
01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.613
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

2045
01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:48.911
<v Speaker 5>as I'm leaving,</v>

2046
01:04:48.911 --> 01:04:49.740
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

2047
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.031
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2048
01:04:50.031 --> 01:04:52.930
<v Speaker 5>you're not taking a real bad place where they'd like rob hubcaps.</v>

2049
01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:53.540
<v Speaker 5>So something.</v>

2050
01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:54.281
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2051
01:04:54.281 --> 01:04:54.820
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2052
01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:57.760
<v Speaker 5>because I didn't think I was lying because to me they brought the whole car.</v>

2053
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.673
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2054
01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.490
<v Speaker 5>so I said no because he left it at hubcaps.</v>

2055
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:05.830
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2056
01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:06.680
<v Speaker 5>So I said no.</v>

2057
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:10.390
<v Speaker 5>So I get there in the first thing I did,</v>

2058
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.450
<v Speaker 5>I do is I pull the,</v>

2059
01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:11.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2060
01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:15.800
<v Speaker 5>underneath the l you know for people don't know is to train subway in the train</v>

2061
01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.680
<v Speaker 5>and I underneath and,</v>

2062
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.963
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2063
01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:19.451
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

2064
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:20.950
<v Speaker 2>you talk about life grown up quick.</v>

2065
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 2>You in one night it was like live reading chapters of a book to you went through</v>

2066
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:30.790
<v Speaker 2>different things and you learn different things about yourself and about what's</v>

2067
01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:31.540
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2068
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.570
<v Speaker 2>what you don't see a and you haven't been around,</v>

2069
01:05:34.571 --> 01:05:39.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's there and it's good to know it's there a different life to different</v>

2070
01:05:39.521 --> 01:05:40.354
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2071
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 2>And I'm down in the South Bronx and,</v>

2072
01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.720
<v Speaker 2>and our first thing I did,</v>

2073
01:05:43.721 --> 01:05:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I went to Mrs. Santos who was the father,</v>

2074
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:46.534
<v Speaker 2>one of my kids.</v>

2075
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I went to his ball,</v>

2076
01:05:47.521 --> 01:05:48.261
<v Speaker 2>cross the street,</v>

2077
01:05:48.261 --> 01:05:49.080
<v Speaker 2>said Mrs Central,</v>

2078
01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.050
<v Speaker 2>my cars over there.</v>

2079
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.273
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

2080
01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:52.990
<v Speaker 2>And why come out?</v>

2081
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:55.390
<v Speaker 2>And all the batteries of the cars were client except mine</v>

2082
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:57.933
<v Speaker 2>quite often.</v>

2083
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:59.223
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2084
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:00.520
<v Speaker 2>but my car was good.</v>

2085
01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:04.810
<v Speaker 2>It's the Santos and his crew made sure that nobody took my battery.</v>

2086
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.120
<v Speaker 2>And so we were good.</v>

2087
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:10.390
<v Speaker 2>So I was looking out for the kids because I did what I had to do,</v>

2088
01:06:10.391 --> 01:06:11.500
<v Speaker 2>but it was a scary place.</v>

2089
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.400
<v Speaker 2>It was a tough place.</v>

2090
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.773
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2091
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.840
<v Speaker 2>the kids grew up fast.</v>

2092
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:19.480
<v Speaker 2>It was three flights and it was often thought that it was meant to be three</v>

2093
01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:22.060
<v Speaker 2>flights because she had time to think during those flights.</v>

2094
01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:22.841
<v Speaker 2>The first flight,</v>

2095
01:06:22.841 --> 01:06:23.674
<v Speaker 2>quite frankly,</v>

2096
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.080
<v Speaker 2>are you saw syringes,</v>

2097
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:29.110
<v Speaker 2>sometimes kids didn't or non bad.</v>

2098
01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.460
<v Speaker 2>These kids will Catskill New York,</v>

2099
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:32.980
<v Speaker 2>they really syringes</v>

2100
01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:35.711
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

2101
01:06:35.711 --> 01:06:36.491
<v Speaker 2>Then the next flight,</v>

2102
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:36.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2103
01:06:36.911 --> 01:06:39.490
<v Speaker 2>you smelled urine because people were there.</v>

2104
01:06:39.491 --> 01:06:40.660
<v Speaker 2>They went up there and they were,</v>

2105
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2106
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.160
<v Speaker 2>going to bathroom,</v>

2107
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:46.120
<v Speaker 2>doing whatever and shooting up or whatever and you smell.</v>

2108
01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:48.850
<v Speaker 2>But then by the time you get to dirt flight,</v>

2109
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.010
<v Speaker 2>you've started to hear noise,</v>

2110
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Speaker 2>started to hear salsa music</v>

2111
01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:55.950
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

2112
01:06:55.951 --> 01:06:56.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2113
01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:57.580
<v Speaker 2>you could smell some.</v>

2114
01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:58.661
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

2115
01:06:58.661 --> 01:07:00.850
<v Speaker 2>they were cooking all the Spanish specialties,</v>

2116
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:04.240
<v Speaker 2>the A to five bananas,</v>

2117
01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:06.093
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

2118
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:07.810
<v Speaker 2>the meat with the,</v>

2119
01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.970
<v Speaker 2>with the potato in the middle plantaris and all that.</v>

2120
01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

2121
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2122
01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the names,</v>

2123
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:15.660
<v Speaker 2>but all the different inn,</v>

2124
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:16.503
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

2125
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:17.343
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Rome,</v>

2126
01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:18.893
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

2127
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:20.043
<v Speaker 2>there was a bar,</v>

2128
01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.730
<v Speaker 2>but that's how they kept,</v>

2129
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:25.480
<v Speaker 2>that's how they paid the rent for the gym because they would do these smokers</v>

2130
01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:26.373
<v Speaker 2>twice a month.</v>

2131
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:27.101
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2132
01:07:27.101 --> 01:07:28.930
<v Speaker 2>there was a smoke every week in New York.</v>

2133
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:29.741
<v Speaker 2>Every week.</v>

2134
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:30.970
<v Speaker 2>People had to know where they were,</v>

2135
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:32.830
<v Speaker 2>but they were every week.</v>

2136
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:33.851
<v Speaker 2>And Leah,</v>

2137
01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:34.720
<v Speaker 2>they won't sanction.</v>

2138
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:35.800
<v Speaker 2>There was no doctrine.</v>

2139
01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:36.371
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

2140
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:37.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm going out there and saying,</v>

2141

2145
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2146
01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:45.131
<v Speaker 2>we made it good.</v>

2147
01:07:45.131 --> 01:07:46.370
<v Speaker 2>We made sure we took care of,</v>

2148
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:46.790
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

2149
01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:47.560
<v Speaker 2>we've made it.</v>

2150
01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I know it was still dangerous.</v>

2151
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:49.600
<v Speaker 2>It was stolen,</v>

2152
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.040
<v Speaker 2>but you want to know something?</v>

2153
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.370
<v Speaker 2>A kid drinking a bottle of vodka a day was pretty freaking dangerous.</v>

2154
01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:55.623
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2155
01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I had some idiot one time.</v>

2156
01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to get money from my foundation and I was explaining to him and he</v>

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to talk to him and I'm saying,</v>

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:26.103
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2170
01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.530
<v Speaker 2>do you get brain damage from being out in the street and getting hit with a pipe</v>

2171
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>to get by deed because there's the people I'm helping.</v>

2172
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you get brain damage arm from doing crack?</v>

2173
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you get brain damage?</v>

2174
01:08:37.821 --> 01:08:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I did have a kid who drank a bottle of vodka now when he gave to him to my</v>

2175
01:08:41.481 --> 01:08:43.310
<v Speaker 2>program and the foundation that we run,</v>

2176
01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:44.503
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2177
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>for two years,</v>

2178
01:08:45.981 --> 01:08:47.510
<v Speaker 2>he's been announced three years,</v>

2179
01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:50.030
<v Speaker 2>he's been clean or his back was family.</v>

2180
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:51.230
<v Speaker 2>He was living on the streets.</v>

2181
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:56.410
<v Speaker 2>He was with gangs and when he got into boxing in one of our programs,</v>

2182
01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:57.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2183
01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:57.790
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2184
01:08:57.790 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 2>he stopped all that,</v>

2185
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.040
<v Speaker 2>but he was drinking a bottle of vodka years.</v>

2186
01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:01.400
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

2187
01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.001
<v Speaker 2>15 year.</v>

2188
01:09:02.001 --> 01:09:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2189
01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:02.781
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people say,</v>

2190
01:09:02.781 --> 01:09:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Teddy,</v>

2191
01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:03.913
<v Speaker 2>how do you drink?</v>

2192
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2193
01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:05.683
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>

2194
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.011
<v Speaker 2>how do you do it?</v>

2195
01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Because you have a lot of pain maybe or whatever,</v>

2196
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.033
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2197
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:10.791
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2198
01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:11.624
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2199
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:12.830
<v Speaker 2>and so I was,</v>

2200
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I said to the guy who was trying,</v>

2201
01:09:14.001 --> 01:09:15.110
<v Speaker 2>not to get into an argument,</v>

2202
01:09:15.111 --> 01:09:15.944
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

2203
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 2>boxing causes brain damage,</v>

2204
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.780
<v Speaker 2>but I'm taking guys away.</v>

2205
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Kids said the alternative is to bottle of vodka to crack the needle,</v>

2206
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:31.550
<v Speaker 2>the pipe on the head or maybe the pipe on someone else's head where they caused</v>

2207
01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:33.020
<v Speaker 2>brain damage to someone else.</v>

2208
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2209
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:34.161
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2210
01:09:34.161 --> 01:09:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately you'll one day walking out of your house.</v>

2211
01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:40.070
<v Speaker 2>What about that brain damage?</v>

2212
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:45.050
<v Speaker 2>That's your way of telling me know that your way of not giving me what I'm</v>

2213
01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:46.940
<v Speaker 2>asking for to say that.</v>

2214
01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you think it out a little bit more?</v>

2215
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you think it out a little more and give me a better excuse?</v>

2216
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you at least understand what we're doing.</v>

2217
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:57.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why we're doing this.</v>

2219
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.491
<v Speaker 2>So these kids,</v>

2220
01:10:01.491 --> 01:10:02.324
<v Speaker 2>we would go,</v>

2221
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:07.820
<v Speaker 2>we would go to the south Bronx and these kids would,</v>

2222
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.673
<v Speaker 2>they'd walk up,</v>

2223
01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:10.551
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2224
01:10:10.551 --> 01:10:13.590
<v Speaker 2>they've woke up to steps by time that door opened up and,</v>

2225
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:18.610
<v Speaker 2>and again this is how they paid the rent by selling liquor,</v>

2226
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:20.421
<v Speaker 2>by charging,</v>

2227
01:10:20.421 --> 01:10:24.470
<v Speaker 2>treat hours to get in and selling that food.</v>

2228
01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 2>And a place would be packed,</v>

2229
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:27.973
<v Speaker 2>packed.</v>

2230
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:29.720
<v Speaker 2>And when the l went by,</v>

2231
01:10:29.721 --> 01:10:30.554
<v Speaker 2>you talk about,</v>

2232
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:31.201
<v Speaker 2>you told me,</v>

2233
01:10:31.201 --> 01:10:33.530
<v Speaker 2>we talked a little bit about pressure and about,</v>

2234
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2235
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:35.930
<v Speaker 2>what pressure does to you.</v>

2236
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:37.010
<v Speaker 2>It can form,</v>

2237
01:10:37.011 --> 01:10:38.390
<v Speaker 2>you could destroy,</v>

2238
01:10:38.391 --> 01:10:40.460
<v Speaker 2>you could form,</v>

2239
01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:43.160
<v Speaker 2>you can make you realize what you're capable of.</v>

2240
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:44.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2241
01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.730
<v Speaker 2>the greatest thing about what [inaudible] and does for somebody who makes them</v>

2242
01:10:46.731 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2243
01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:47.451
<v Speaker 2>Teddy,</v>

2244
01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:48.620
<v Speaker 2>what is box and do for you?</v>

2245
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh those are your jabs.</v>

2246
01:10:49.811 --> 01:10:51.320
<v Speaker 2>You do know your condition,</v>

2247
01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:52.430
<v Speaker 2>you take care of your temple,</v>

2248
01:10:52.431 --> 01:10:52.911
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>

2249
01:10:52.911 --> 01:10:53.570
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

2250
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:53.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2251
01:10:53.781 --> 01:10:54.614
<v Speaker 2>it sounds good.</v>

2252
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:55.731
<v Speaker 2>Teddy,</v>

2253
01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:57.540
<v Speaker 2>give us one thing that box and does forever.</v>

2254
01:10:57.730 --> 01:10:59.750
<v Speaker 2>It lets you know you could depend on yourself.</v>

2255
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Lets a kid know that he can like himself.</v>

2256
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:05.431
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

2257
01:11:05.431 --> 01:11:07.470
<v Speaker 2>He can like himself and depend on himself.</v>

2258
01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:08.363
<v Speaker 2>These kids.</v>

2259
01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:09.983
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2260
01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:12.251
<v Speaker 2>was it rough?</v>

2261
01:11:12.251 --> 01:11:12.831
<v Speaker 2>He was rough.</v>

2262
01:11:12.831 --> 01:11:17.520
<v Speaker 2>So we're in a place and there's is no doctor here.</v>

2263
01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:19.560
<v Speaker 2>We had no sanction and organization.</v>

2264
01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.850
<v Speaker 2>We made own fights,</v>

2265
01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.240
<v Speaker 2>but there was a danger.</v>

2266
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.250
<v Speaker 2>But I just told you the other dangers,</v>

2267
01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:31.110
<v Speaker 2>this was taken them and replacing those other dangers too is taking them away</v>

2268
01:11:31.111 --> 01:11:31.620
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>

2269
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.011
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2270
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:35.580
<v Speaker 2>It was the only positive thing in the neighborhood for these kids.</v>

2271
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.593
<v Speaker 2>It really was,</v>

2272
01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.320
<v Speaker 2>was a rough,</v>

2273
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.153
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2274
01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:39.523
<v Speaker 2>suboxone.</v>

2275
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 2>But I just talked about life is rough,</v>

2276
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.420
<v Speaker 2>especially for these people refer.</v>

2277
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:49.310
<v Speaker 2>So it was an alternative to violence.</v>

2278
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.831
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>

2279
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:50.131
<v Speaker 2>Teddy,</v>

2280
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:50.810
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

2281
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Bhags no,</v>

2282
01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:54.540
<v Speaker 2>because if you're angry,</v>

2283
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.890
<v Speaker 2>which these kids are,</v>

2284
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.500
<v Speaker 2>if they don't learn to lose that anger,</v>

2285
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:02.850
<v Speaker 2>they never become anything in boxing because they walk in and get head.</v>

2286
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.340
<v Speaker 2>They learned that they can control that anger.</v>

2287
01:12:05.341 --> 01:12:06.390
<v Speaker 2>They could put it somewhere.</v>

2288
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.200
<v Speaker 2>They learned that they can control themselves.</v>

2289
01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:14.130
<v Speaker 2>They can depend on themselves to be something positive.</v>

2290
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:19.740
<v Speaker 2>So I would take these kids and we would go there and we were the only white kids</v>

2291
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:20.574
<v Speaker 2>in the place.</v>

2292
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:23.730
<v Speaker 2>And they loved us.</v>

2293
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.711
<v Speaker 2>They were funny.</v>

2294
01:12:25.711 --> 01:12:26.131
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2295
01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:26.821
<v Speaker 2>the guy who ran it,</v>

2296
01:12:26.821 --> 01:12:27.654
<v Speaker 2>Nelson quavers,</v>

2297
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:28.201
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

2298
01:12:28.201 --> 01:12:28.891
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy,</v>

2299
01:12:28.891 --> 01:12:29.221
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

2300
01:12:29.221 --> 01:12:30.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2301
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:30.601
<v Speaker 2>I would look,</v>

2302
01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:35.601
<v Speaker 2>he carried a gun in his holster and it's in his belt felt because he knew it</v>

2303
01:12:35.611 --> 01:12:36.444
<v Speaker 2>could be rough.</v>

2304
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:37.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2305
01:12:37.621 --> 01:12:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

2306
01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I leave that part out to the parents when I was taking him that the proprietor</v>

2307
01:12:42.721 --> 01:12:43.554
<v Speaker 2>of the place,</v>

2308
01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:43.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2309
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:46.020
<v Speaker 2>has a gun and every once in a while he opens his jacket,</v>

2310
01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:49.680
<v Speaker 2>make sure that the people remember that he has.</v>

2311
01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.053
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

2313
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:53.190
<v Speaker 2>But they looked out for you.</v>

2314
01:12:53.191 --> 01:12:54.024
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2315
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:55.103
<v Speaker 2>the kids.</v>

2316
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2317
01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:57.270
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds contrary.</v>

2318
01:12:57.271 --> 01:12:58.860
<v Speaker 2>I get it contradictory,</v>

2319
01:12:58.861 --> 01:13:00.210
<v Speaker 2>but it was a,</v>

2320
01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.530
<v Speaker 2>these kids,</v>

2321
01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:04.860
<v Speaker 2>they learned so much about themselves and we protect,</v>

2322
01:13:04.861 --> 01:13:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I looked at,</v>

2323
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.293
<v Speaker 2>we'd looked out for,</v>

2324
01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:10.530
<v Speaker 2>and when it came time to make the matches to point,</v>

2325
01:13:10.531 --> 01:13:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I was making about Walden.</v>

2326
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.790
<v Speaker 2>And you talked about being long and about you.</v>

2327
01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I jump all over the place.</v>

2328
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:16.723
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2329
01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2330
01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:18.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2331
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:18.933
<v Speaker 2>I learned,</v>

2332
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.300
<v Speaker 2>cause taught me this.</v>

2333
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.920
<v Speaker 2>But you have to learn it yourself.</v>

2334
01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:24.443
<v Speaker 2>You have to see it.</v>

2335
01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:26.970
<v Speaker 2>You have to be in it because told me about it.</v>

2336
01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 2>But that's only part of it.</v>

2337
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:30.631
<v Speaker 2>He always told me,</v>

2338
01:13:30.631 --> 01:13:31.350
<v Speaker 2>teddy,</v>

2339
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:33.500
<v Speaker 2>be careful with skinny wirey guys.</v>

2340
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:35.910
<v Speaker 2>They had the greatest punches.</v>

2341
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:38.251
<v Speaker 2>Think I was thinking,</v>

2342
01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:39.240
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>

2343
01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.520
<v Speaker 2>they're the greatest punches.</v>

2344
01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.860
<v Speaker 2>He never told me why he let me figure it out.</v>

2345
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:45.023
<v Speaker 2>I saw it.</v>

2346
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I saw when he get him out.</v>

2347
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2348
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.371
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2349
01:13:50.371 --> 01:13:51.204
<v Speaker 2>Hearns here,</v>

2350
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:53.910
<v Speaker 2>but I know why now leverage.</v>

2351
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2352
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:55.620
<v Speaker 2>talk,</v>

2353
01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:56.071
<v Speaker 2>talk,</v>

2354
01:13:56.071 --> 01:13:56.904
<v Speaker 2>whatever you call that.</v>

2355
01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.290
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>

2356
01:13:58.291 --> 01:13:59.310
<v Speaker 2>so here we are.</v>

2357
01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.220
<v Speaker 2>And if you saw the guy you knew who to match with,</v>

2358
01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:03.900
<v Speaker 2>but if you didn't see the guy,</v>

2359
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:07.440
<v Speaker 2>you had to depend on other things.</v>

2360
01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:09.173
<v Speaker 2>Who's the coach?</v>

2361
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Certain coaches had no good fighters.</v>

2362
01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:11.511
<v Speaker 2>Certain coaches,</v>

2363
01:14:11.511 --> 01:14:12.344
<v Speaker 2>they're good fighters.</v>

2364
01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.073
<v Speaker 2>Another coach.</v>

2365
01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Does he have a good realize he honest sea lion.</v>

2366
01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Does he have,</v>

2367
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:25.890
<v Speaker 2>does he have an opinion that is good or does he just say things?</v>

2368
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.010
<v Speaker 2>So I'd have to go to all that if I didn't know the guy,</v>

2369
01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't put my kid in with the guy unless I was sure what he was.</v>

2370
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.373
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2371
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 2>And it was hard because everyone was lying though.</v>

2372
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:39.910
<v Speaker 2>There was like a cold.</v>

2373
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>It was all connected to lion unfortunately.</v>

2374
01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:43.883
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2375
01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.640
<v Speaker 2>but everyone looking out for their kid,</v>

2376
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>like if you'd said it,</v>

2377
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:50.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example because we guess who the matchmaker was.</v>

2378
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:53.970
<v Speaker 2>I became the matchmaker with,</v>

2379
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2380
01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:55.930
<v Speaker 2>in a place where all Spanish black,</v>

2381
01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:56.470
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>

2382
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:58.360
<v Speaker 2>but Nelson made me the matchmaker.</v>

2383
01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 2>You be the matchmaker and a lot of the people didn't speak English.</v>

2384
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:02.680
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2385
01:15:02.681 --> 01:15:02.911
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

2386
01:15:02.911 --> 01:15:04.330
<v Speaker 2>we figured out we get there.</v>

2387
01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:06.470
<v Speaker 2>So I'd be the,</v>

2388
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.440
<v Speaker 2>so you make a column,</v>

2389
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 2>the name of the fighter.</v>

2390
01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:10.653
<v Speaker 2>The weight.</v>

2391
01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:10.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:15:10.961 --> 01:15:12.250
<v Speaker 2>He saw you your way him,</v>

2393
01:15:12.251 --> 01:15:12.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2394
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:13.181
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing.</v>

2395
01:15:13.181 --> 01:15:13.780
<v Speaker 2>You see it.</v>

2396
01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2397
01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the only truth.</v>

2398
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.220
<v Speaker 2>The rest of it got dicey.</v>

2399
01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:18.911
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2400
01:15:18.911 --> 01:15:20.710
<v Speaker 2>How many fights most important thing?</v>

2401
01:15:20.711 --> 01:15:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Most important thing.</v>

2402
01:15:22.031 --> 01:15:22.864
<v Speaker 2>How many fights?</v>

2403
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:24.363
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

2404
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in this place got zero fights</v>

2405
01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:31.060
<v Speaker 2>and Al Said nobody got fights in its place.</v>

2406
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Even doing this for years.</v>

2407
01:15:33.690 --> 01:15:35.260
<v Speaker 2>It's all okay,</v>

2408
01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.213
<v Speaker 2>here's the code.</v>

2409
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Zero fights means two or three.</v>

2410
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:40.841
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

2411
01:15:40.841 --> 01:15:44.140
<v Speaker 2>two or three fights meant six to 10</v>

2412
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:48.880
<v Speaker 2>God forbid anyone ever said they had five,</v>

2413
01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:49.750
<v Speaker 2>six fights,</v>

2414
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:53.440
<v Speaker 2>anywhere from 25 to a hundred</v>

2415
01:15:59.320 --> 01:15:59.920
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

2416
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

2417
01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:02.080
<v Speaker 2>This is the world that I lived in for five,</v>

2418
01:16:02.081 --> 01:16:02.914
<v Speaker 2>six years.</v>

2419
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Took them every Friday,</v>

2420
01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:10.050
<v Speaker 2>every drove down to the Bronx and got them a smoker every week.</v>

2421
01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:14.020
<v Speaker 2>And so you figured out to code after awhile,</v>

2422
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:20.040
<v Speaker 2>but you're responsible for these kids who you wanted every tangible thing you</v>

2423
01:16:20.141 --> 01:16:20.974
<v Speaker 2>could have.</v>

2424
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

2425
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:26.110
<v Speaker 2>if I wasn't sure how much the guy was lying that he was lying a little extra,</v>

2426
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:27.183
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

2427
01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 2>I'd go to Nelson.</v>

2428
01:16:28.481 --> 01:16:29.290
<v Speaker 2>You know this guy?</v>

2429
01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:29.501
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2430
01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:30.700
<v Speaker 2>but talk to Pablo.</v>

2431
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:32.291
<v Speaker 2>Talk down.</v>

2432
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:33.124
<v Speaker 2>Hell,</v>

2433
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:34.443
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

2434
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:35.703
<v Speaker 2>You know the guy?</v>

2435
01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:36.970
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2436
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2437
01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.120
<v Speaker 2>he's stay away from no fight.</v>

2438
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2439
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:41.980
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not taking the chair.</v>

2440
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:45.160
<v Speaker 2>But then when you get to the point where you don't really know,</v>

2441
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:48.220
<v Speaker 2>then I would just,</v>

2442
01:16:48.221 --> 01:16:49.330
<v Speaker 2>your instincts come alive.</v>

2443
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:51.310
<v Speaker 2>You're protecting your kid.</v>

2444
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.090
<v Speaker 2>It's your kid,</v>

2445
01:16:52.090 --> 01:16:52.901
<v Speaker 2>it's your kid.</v>

2446
01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:55.060
<v Speaker 2>As much as it's paternally your kid,</v>

2447
01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:56.140
<v Speaker 2>it's your kid.</v>

2448
01:16:57.610 --> 01:16:59.440
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time I went up to the guy,</v>

2449
01:16:59.441 --> 01:17:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get enough info.</v>

2450
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I went up to the guy</v>

2451
01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.890
<v Speaker 2>bought Nelson as an interpreter because he didn't speak English and I said</v>

2452
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.000
<v Speaker 6>I know what we do here.</v>

2453
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.430
<v Speaker 6>Well I'm telling you is I'm not putting my kid in to get beat up.</v>

2454
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:17.631
<v Speaker 6>If it's fair,</v>

2455
01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:20.900
<v Speaker 6>it's fair by not putting them in with a kid that's got 30 40 fights.</v>

2456
01:17:20.901 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 6>My kid legitimate legitimately has two fights.</v>

2457
01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:25.993
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you,</v>

2458
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:27.890
<v Speaker 6>I know we don't do that here.</v>

2459
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:30.290
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you that's what he's got.</v>

2460
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.240
<v Speaker 6>If your kid's got 40 foot,</v>

2461
01:17:32.241 --> 01:17:33.074
<v Speaker 6>tell me,</v>

2462
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:35.690
<v Speaker 6>just tell me and say no fight and,</v>

2463
01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:38.390
<v Speaker 6>and I'll shake your hand and that's it.</v>

2464
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:39.703
<v Speaker 6>We're good.</v>

2465
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.170
<v Speaker 6>So he kept,</v>

2466
01:17:42.171 --> 01:17:43.490
<v Speaker 6>he stood to his story.</v>

2467
01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:45.253
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

2468
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.770
<v Speaker 6>so we get close in.</v>

2469
01:17:47.771 --> 01:17:48.431
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm thinking,</v>

2470
01:17:48.431 --> 01:17:48.941
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking,</v>

2471
01:17:48.941 --> 01:17:52.060
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking and I'm watching a guy warmup cause always told me,</v>

2472
01:17:52.061 --> 01:17:53.290
<v Speaker 6>watch the Guy Walmart,</v>

2473
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.150
<v Speaker 6>watch them warm up.</v>

2474
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:58.620
<v Speaker 6>I want you to more more pop pop pop by</v>

2475
01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.050
<v Speaker 6>bap.</v>

2476
01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:01.320
<v Speaker 6>Bap,</v>

2477
01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.153
<v Speaker 6>bap.</v>

2478
01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.540
<v Speaker 6>I said this guy didn't have to fight.</v>

2479
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.951
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2480
01:18:05.951 --> 01:18:10.060
<v Speaker 6>I'm a pretty good trainer and even with our fights,</v>

2481
01:18:10.061 --> 01:18:13.120
<v Speaker 6>I think I teach them technically what they need to know before they get to</v>

2482
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:13.750
<v Speaker 6>explore.</v>

2483
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:16.360
<v Speaker 6>But this guy was beyond that.</v>

2484
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:18.070
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2485
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:19.780
<v Speaker 6>you know this was sugar ray Robinson.</v>

2486
01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:22.780
<v Speaker 6>So I go back to Nelson.</v>

2487
01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:23.021
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2488
01:18:23.021 --> 01:18:25.630
<v Speaker 6>bring him over here again 10 minutes before the fight.</v>

2489
01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:28.090
<v Speaker 6>So bring them over here again.</v>

2490
01:18:29.050 --> 01:18:29.883
<v Speaker 6>Comes on,</v>

2491
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:33.100
<v Speaker 6>or a little bit of an attitude so bad.</v>

2492
01:18:33.101 --> 01:18:34.720
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's got attitudes in this business.</v>

2493
01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:36.191
<v Speaker 6>Is it?</v>

2494
01:18:36.191 --> 01:18:37.024
<v Speaker 6>Hey</v>

2495
01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.093

2497
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.620

01:18:59.111 --> 01:18:59.944

2509
01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:03.953
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to know it.</v>

2530
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:45.980
<v Speaker 6>Nelson came back to me four minutes,</v>

2557
01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 2>My kids,</v>

2558
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean like when,</v>

2559
01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:28.750
<v Speaker 2>when we first started fighting,</v>

2560
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.810
<v Speaker 2>they had bungled Trumpsters hi.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean my kids had never seen bound.</v>

2563
01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:36.390
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see Bongo drums.</v>

2564
01:20:36.391 --> 01:20:36.571

<v Speaker 2>what am I saying?</v>

2566

<v Speaker 2>But they were this high,</v>

2567
01:20:40.051 --> 01:20:41.790
<v Speaker 2>they were bundle and they were in the ring.</v>

2568
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.020
<v Speaker 2>They only came out when,</v>

2569
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.670
<v Speaker 2>when we,</v>

2575
01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:57.530
<v Speaker 2>when you're hearing that bungle music and you're in the ring and you're talking</v>

2576
01:20:58.021 --> 01:21:01.520
<v Speaker 2>to the kid in the corner and they're outside now with the bangles and they're</v>

2577
01:21:01.521 --> 01:21:02.990
<v Speaker 2>playing the bongos and you're talking,</v>

2578
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:05.280

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not taught in the classroom.</v>

2589
01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.160
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2590
01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.640
<v Speaker 2>and my kids have to six years of that because that's about how long we did know</v>

2591
01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I was up to seven years train of photos for cost.</v>

2592
01:21:21.841 --> 01:21:22.674
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2593
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:23.813
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2594
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.411
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

2595
01:21:25.411 --> 01:21:26.520
<v Speaker 2>my kids grew up,</v>

2596
01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:27.211
<v Speaker 2>they go to,</v>

2597
01:21:27.211 --> 01:21:30.780
<v Speaker 2>they will go on to be pros and did they go on to be Olympic chair now?</v>

2598
01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:36.290
<v Speaker 2>But they took that and they used it to be better at what they did into,</v>

2599
01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:42.060
<v Speaker 2>to have the confidence to do things they might not have had the confidence to do</v>

2600
01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.920
<v Speaker 2>without that experience.</v>

2601
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I got a couple of them that have state troopers.</v>

2602
01:21:45.751 --> 01:21:48.270
<v Speaker 2>I got a couple of them that are teachers in high school.</v>

2603
01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I got to cook,</v>

2604
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2605
01:21:49.261 --> 01:21:50.520
<v Speaker 2>all different things.</v>

2606
01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Who coupled of one per college that,</v>

2607
01:21:52.801 --> 01:21:54.600
<v Speaker 2>that the nobody in their,</v>

2608
01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.110
<v Speaker 2>in their history of their family ever went beyond high school and,</v>

2609
01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:01.850
<v Speaker 2>but they went to college and they were kind of told them,</v>

2610
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.640
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to go to college.</v>

2611
01:22:03.690 --> 01:22:05.670
<v Speaker 2>They went to college and I,</v>

2612
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.770
<v Speaker 2>I would like to believe it had something to do with that,</v>

2613
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:09.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2614
01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:10.223
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2615
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I lot of people ask me,</v>

2616
01:22:12.321 --> 01:22:12.391
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2617
01:22:12.391 --> 01:22:14.790
<v Speaker 2>whom was you greatly because I had Tyson to there,</v>

2618
01:22:14.791 --> 01:22:15.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2619
01:22:15.061 --> 01:22:15.360
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2620
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.193
<v Speaker 2>he became one of them.</v>

2621
01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.013
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2622
01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I remember it was funny because when I would put it down,</v>

2623
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:22.981
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2624
01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:24.270
<v Speaker 2>everyone lied about the experience,</v>

2625
01:22:24.271 --> 01:22:25.240
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2626
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:26.760
<v Speaker 2>they lied about everything.</v>

2627
01:22:26.761 --> 01:22:28.020
<v Speaker 2>But I would put down,</v>

2628
01:22:28.021 --> 01:22:28.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2629
01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:28.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2630
01:22:28.651 --> 01:22:28.880

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.390
<v Speaker 2>the age and everything else,</v>

2632
01:22:30.391 --> 01:22:31.950
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff for what it was worth,</v>

2633
01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.390
<v Speaker 2>you had to have something to try to believe in if I didn't have to figure it out</v>

2634
01:22:36.391 --> 01:22:37.224
<v Speaker 2>from there.</v>

2635
01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:39.140
<v Speaker 2>So Tyson,</v>

2636
01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:39.931
<v Speaker 2>when I first had him,</v>

2637
01:22:39.931 --> 01:22:41.490
<v Speaker 2>he was 190 pounds,</v>

2638
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.081
<v Speaker 2>not a bum.</v>

2639
01:22:42.081 --> 01:22:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Also 12 years old.</v>

2640
01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:43.831
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2641
01:22:43.831 --> 01:22:44.664
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

2642
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:45.900
<v Speaker 2>But that's what he was,</v>

2643
01:22:45.901 --> 01:22:46.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2644
01:22:46.201 --> 01:22:47.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what God made it.</v>

2645
01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:48.440
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2646
01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.490
<v Speaker 2>so I go down and I put the first fight.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nobody seen Tyson.</v>

2648

2649
01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:55.620

2687
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Now you tell the truth.</v>

2688
01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.470
<v Speaker 8>Jay's not 17,</v>

2689
01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:50.660
<v Speaker 2>but I knew what I have.</v>

2690
01:23:50.670 --> 01:23:50.941
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2691
01:23:50.941 --> 01:23:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2692
01:23:51.570 --> 01:23:52.403
<v Speaker 2>I knew what I had.</v>

2693
01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.850
<v Speaker 2>So I bought a 17 year old.</v>

2694
01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.501
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't going to fight.</v>

2695
01:23:55.501 --> 01:23:57.120
<v Speaker 2>No 12 year old that was going to happen.</v>

2696
01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2697
01:23:57.930 --> 01:23:59.340
<v Speaker 2>And plus I get arrested for murder.</v>

2698
01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:00.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2699
01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:00.811
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2700
01:24:00.811 --> 01:24:02.640
<v Speaker 2>what was he like at 12 years old?</v>

2701
01:24:02.641 --> 01:24:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Physically,</v>

2702
01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.290
<v Speaker 2>mentally weak.</v>

2703
01:24:04.530 --> 01:24:05.610
<v Speaker 2>But physically,</v>

2704
01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.040
<v Speaker 2>what do I mean mentally weak,</v>

2705
01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.750
<v Speaker 2>not weak for the average guy,</v>

2706
01:24:09.751 --> 01:24:11.130
<v Speaker 2>but before fighter,</v>

2707
01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:12.373
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2708
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:18.950
<v Speaker 2>he's still have remanence he still had residual</v>

2709
01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.680
<v Speaker 2>stuff from his upbringing.</v>

2710
01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:23.251
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

2711
01:24:23.251 --> 01:24:24.520
<v Speaker 2>you want to know the truth about the guy?</v>

2712
01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:24.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2713
01:24:24.751 --> 01:24:24.990
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2714
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.740
<v Speaker 2>he oldest,</v>

2715
01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:30.730
<v Speaker 2>but he used to hide in between abandoned building walls in Brownsville.</v>

2716
01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:31.564
<v Speaker 2>It was a rough place,</v>

2717
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:32.423
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it.</v>

2718
01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Did have a fall or whatever,</v>

2719
01:24:33.781 --> 01:24:35.010
<v Speaker 2>the model of whatever.</v>

2720
01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:36.293
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2721
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.193
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2722
01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.880
<v Speaker 2>he used to hide between walls to not get picked on.</v>

2723
01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.650
<v Speaker 2>And I believe when you do that,</v>

2724
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:46.980
<v Speaker 2>you never get outside of that wall to a certain extent.</v>

2725
01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:51.210
<v Speaker 2>You're always hiding in a wall for the rest of your life as this is my belief</v>

2726
01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:52.800
<v Speaker 2>that teddy,</v>

2727
01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:53.611
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

2728
01:24:53.611 --> 01:24:54.600
<v Speaker 2>It became heavyweight champ.</v>

2729
01:24:54.601 --> 01:24:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Some people think he's the greatest.</v>

2730
01:24:55.801 --> 01:24:56.634
<v Speaker 2>I'll bet.</v>

2731
01:24:56.730 --> 01:24:57.563
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2732
01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't have his record in front of me and this is going to blow some people</v>

2733
01:25:03.121 --> 01:25:03.954
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

2734
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:05.010
<v Speaker 2>but what are you going to do?</v>

2735
01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.553
<v Speaker 2>I don't have his record.</v>

2736
01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say we're going to make an arbitrary number because your man's going</v>

2737
01:25:11.391 --> 01:25:12.180
<v Speaker 2>to pull it up,</v>

2738
01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:16.090
<v Speaker 2>but let's just say it's 50 and six all right,</v>

2739
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:19.110
<v Speaker 2>we'll we'll say five 15 five but whatever.</v>

2740
01:25:20.610 --> 01:25:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I think his record</v>

2741
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:24.481
<v Speaker 2>is truly,</v>

2742
01:25:24.481 --> 01:25:25.201
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to be this,</v>

2743
01:25:25.201 --> 01:25:26.940
<v Speaker 2>and we're not truly in life with anything,</v>

2744
01:25:26.970 --> 01:25:28.200
<v Speaker 2>but if we're truly,</v>

2745
01:25:28.201 --> 01:25:30.900
<v Speaker 2>truly in an Absolut world,</v>

2746
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:32.310
<v Speaker 2>which we don't live in,</v>

2747
01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:37.830
<v Speaker 2>but I would say he's all in five high now.</v>

2748
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Everybody says,</v>

2749
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:40.500
<v Speaker 2>everyone who's listening to you think is just like,</v>

2750
01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.300
<v Speaker 2>let me get with Teddy's drinking,</v>

2751
01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.570
<v Speaker 2>like I don't see them drinking nothing,</v>

2752
01:25:44.571 --> 01:25:46.290
<v Speaker 2>but he probably had some before he came in.</v>

2753
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:48.833
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

2754
01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:53.610
<v Speaker 2>a fight is not a fight into this resistance to there's something to overcome,</v>

2755
01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:56.310
<v Speaker 2>something to overcome.</v>

2756
01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:57.961
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

2757
01:25:57.961 --> 01:25:59.250
<v Speaker 2>it's just an athletic venture.</v>

2758
01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:00.510
<v Speaker 2>It's an exhibition.</v>

2759
01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:03.320
<v Speaker 2>I think life is that,</v>

2760
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:05.030
<v Speaker 6>I think the,</v>

2761
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:08.300
<v Speaker 6>you don't know of a lawyer is a lawyer and to into the some,</v>

2762
01:26:08.301 --> 01:26:09.340
<v Speaker 6>the overcoming the courtroom.</v>

2763
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.340
<v Speaker 6>Something goes for,</v>

2764
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.473
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2765
01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:12.950
<v Speaker 6>I know he's a lawyer.</v>

2766
01:26:12.951 --> 01:26:13.251
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

2767
01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:13.830
<v Speaker 6>He went to see,</v>

2768
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:14.510
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

2769
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:15.830
<v Speaker 6>Nobody has to tell me that,</v>

2770
01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 6>but he ain't a lawyer.</v>

2771
01:26:17.690 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 6>He Ain't dad until everything goes wrong.</v>

2772
01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:24.730
<v Speaker 6>The judge throws all this crap out and,</v>

2773
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:25.783
<v Speaker 6>and he's,</v>

2774
01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.380
<v Speaker 6>he is aft,</v>

2775
01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:28.930
<v Speaker 6>so to speak and,</v>

2776
01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:31.130
<v Speaker 6>and he figures and he's still handles it.</v>

2777
01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:32.503
<v Speaker 6>Then he's a lawyer.</v>

2778
01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.970
<v Speaker 6>A doctor is not a doctor.</v>

2779
01:26:33.971 --> 01:26:34.460
<v Speaker 6>And two,</v>

2780
01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:35.690
<v Speaker 6>he opens up this kid,</v>

2781
01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:40.840
<v Speaker 6>a kid just like he's got it home and arteries are bleeding all over the place</v>

2782
01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:41.510
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2783
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:42.200
<v Speaker 6>and it,</v>

2784
01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.910
<v Speaker 6>it's not in a textbook.</v>

2785
01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.040
<v Speaker 6>It's not in a brick and textbook.</v>

2786
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:47.390
<v Speaker 6>And he got to do it.</v>

2787
01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.400
<v Speaker 6>He got to figure it out and he got,</v>

2788
01:26:49.401 --> 01:26:52.550
<v Speaker 6>then he's a doctor that he's a surgeon at that level.</v>

2789
01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:55.653
<v Speaker 6>You're not,</v>

2790
01:26:57.610 --> 01:26:59.030
<v Speaker 6>you are not in a fight.</v>

2791
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.410
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2792
01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:00.020
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2793
01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:00.380
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2794
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.370
<v Speaker 6>I admitted.</v>

2795
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:02.840
<v Speaker 6>I equate life to a fight.</v>

2796
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:03.703
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

2797
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.330
<v Speaker 6>You're not in a fight.</v>

2798
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:10.730
<v Speaker 6>And so there's pressure resistance overcoming something.</v>

2799
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:12.590
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise it shows an exhibition.</v>

2800
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:15.230
<v Speaker 6>Tyson's talent was so great,</v>

2801
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:16.940
<v Speaker 6>his physical ability,</v>

2802
01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.520
<v Speaker 6>his talent was so overwhelming,</v>

2803
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 6>just like somebody intellect to some bodies,</v>

2804
01:27:24.081 --> 01:27:24.914
<v Speaker 6>charisma,</v>

2805
01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:30.230
<v Speaker 6>whatever beauty until it came to something else.</v>

2806
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:35.500
<v Speaker 6>But his talent was so superior that the other stuff never got tested.</v>

2807
01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:39.320
<v Speaker 6>He was blown guys out and he had never got tested.</v>

2808
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:41.540
<v Speaker 6>If there was anything in the warehouse,</v>

2809
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:45.230
<v Speaker 6>so to speak of is anything inside you never knew.</v>

2810
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:46.880
<v Speaker 6>And then five times,</v>

2811
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:48.110
<v Speaker 6>whatever the real record is,</v>

2812
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.300
<v Speaker 6>five times there was resistance.</v>

2813
01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.970
<v Speaker 6>Five times it became a real fight.</v>

2814
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:54.440
<v Speaker 6>Five Times.</v>

2815
01:27:54.441 --> 01:27:59.441
<v Speaker 6>There was something to overcome and he fell in all five times who only in five</v>

2816
01:28:00.221 --> 01:28:01.100
<v Speaker 6>fights in his life.</v>

2817
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:02.990
<v Speaker 6>And he's all in five.</v>

2818
01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:05.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry sal graves,</v>

2819
01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:06.870
<v Speaker 6>because we know my history with them.</v>

2820
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:07.723
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2821
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:08.810
<v Speaker 6>Am I,</v>

2822
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:09.643
<v Speaker 6>am I,</v>

2823
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:11.980
<v Speaker 6>am I capable of died?</v>

2824
01:28:11.981 --> 01:28:12.711
<v Speaker 6>Yam Newman.</v>

2825
01:28:12.711 --> 01:28:13.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2826
01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.020
<v Speaker 6>But I can honestly tell you,</v>

2827
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:17.220
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2828
01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:18.720
<v Speaker 6>that I,</v>

2829
01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:20.640
<v Speaker 6>I took,</v>

2830
01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.120
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2831
01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.350
<v Speaker 6>I try to be better than that,</v>

2832
01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:23.310
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2833
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:26.150
<v Speaker 6>that I've called many fights where the people in corner,</v>

2834
01:28:26.151 --> 01:28:26.984
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't stand him.</v>

2835
01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:28.290
<v Speaker 6>I had no respect for them.</v>

2836
01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:29.341
<v Speaker 6>But if they,</v>

2837
01:28:29.341 --> 01:28:31.200
<v Speaker 6>if they did a good job in a corner to fight,</v>

2838
01:28:31.201 --> 01:28:31.860
<v Speaker 6>it did a job.</v>

2839
01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 6>I talked to bat like they were Ray Arcel like they were Angelo Dundee because</v>

2840
01:28:38.161 --> 01:28:39.450
<v Speaker 6>that's what it was supposed to be.</v>

2841
01:28:39.810 --> 01:28:40.643
<v Speaker 6>That's all.</v>

2842
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.520
<v Speaker 6>And it's selfish because I told want I wanna have,</v>

2843
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:49.340
<v Speaker 6>I wanna know and I want my kids to know that I can be better than that.</v>

2844
01:28:49.341 --> 01:28:49.830
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>

2845
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:51.210
<v Speaker 6>that it's,</v>

2846
01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.130
<v Speaker 6>it's about right.</v>

2847
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:54.040
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2848
01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.410
<v Speaker 6>It's about the code of,</v>

2849
01:28:55.411 --> 01:28:56.320
<v Speaker 6>of the profession.</v>

2850
01:28:56.321 --> 01:28:56.570
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

2851
01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:57.401
<v Speaker 6>it's about you.</v>

2852
01:28:57.401 --> 01:28:57.881
<v Speaker 6>It's about,</v>

2853
01:28:57.881 --> 01:28:59.380
<v Speaker 6>you believe in that.</v>

2854
01:28:59.381 --> 01:29:01.190
<v Speaker 6>Would you say is</v>

2855
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:03.600
<v Speaker 2>she'll be honest.</v>

2856
01:29:03.601 --> 01:29:04.980
<v Speaker 2>It should be what you believe.</v>

2857
01:29:05.370 --> 01:29:06.890
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be tainted or,</v>

2858
01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:07.551
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2859
01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:11.660
<v Speaker 2>or influenced by lesser things that,</v>

2860
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:12.860
<v Speaker 2>that it does represent you.</v>

2861
01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:14.280
<v Speaker 2>Does represent your family.</v>

2862
01:29:14.281 --> 01:29:15.840
<v Speaker 2>It does represent where you came from.</v>

2863
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:17.400
<v Speaker 2>It does stay.</v>

2864
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you know your blurted out for those five minutes or maybe two hours on ESPN,</v>

2865
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:27.720
<v Speaker 2>but it stays somewhat can go back to it.</v>

2866
01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.460
<v Speaker 2>You could go back to it.</v>

2867
01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:31.080
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about it?</v>

2868
01:29:31.081 --> 01:29:31.681
<v Speaker 2>It does mean,</v>

2869
01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:33.290
<v Speaker 2>so it really does it.</v>

2870
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:38.990
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm only saying it because I would say it about somebody else.</v>

2871
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:43.290
<v Speaker 2>In a way that I calibrate things,</v>

2872
01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:48.300
<v Speaker 2>the way that I evaluate things that I don't think that you know crap about</v>

2873
01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:50.520
<v Speaker 2>somebody until they're tested.</v>

2874
01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:52.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't know the friend.</v>

2875
01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if they're good wife.</v>

2876
01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:56.010
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if the good girlfriend,</v>

2877
01:29:56.670 --> 01:29:59.460
<v Speaker 2>you don't know crap you think you do,</v>

2878
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:01.590
<v Speaker 2>but until they really tested,</v>

2879
01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't really know.</v>

2880
01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:05.190
<v Speaker 2>And Tyson,</v>

2881
01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:06.060
<v Speaker 2>when he got tested,</v>

2882
01:30:06.061 --> 01:30:07.200
<v Speaker 2>when he had to overcome some,</v>

2883
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:08.960
<v Speaker 2>when when he didn't run him over,</v>

2884
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:09.281
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2885
01:30:09.281 --> 01:30:12.810
<v Speaker 2>like one of those big monster trucks running over a Volkswagen because he was a</v>

2886
01:30:12.811 --> 01:30:14.250
<v Speaker 2>monster truck for Volkswagens.</v>

2887
01:30:14.251 --> 01:30:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2888
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:15.383
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

2889
01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2890
01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.593
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

2891
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:18.900
<v Speaker 2>And was he wanted the greatest punches or don't?</v>

2892
01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:19.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2893
01:30:19.351 --> 01:30:20.184
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2894
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Could he punched from either side of the plate like Mickey Mann or the greatest</v>

2895
01:30:23.371 --> 01:30:24.030
<v Speaker 2>switch hitter?</v>

2896
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Was He that in by,</v>

2897
01:30:24.901 --> 01:30:25.734
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2898
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Could he could punch evenly.</v>

2899
01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:29.400
<v Speaker 2>Great with either hand from either side.</v>

2900
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Was he all those things?</v>

2901
01:30:31.501 --> 01:30:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2902
01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Was he as great intimidators Sonny Liston?</v>

2903
01:30:34.681 --> 01:30:35.514
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2904
01:30:36.930 --> 01:30:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Was he a great finisher like Joe Louis?</v>

2905
01:30:39.151 --> 01:30:39.960
<v Speaker 2>To a certain extent,</v>

2906
01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.793
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2907
01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.980
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't a great fighter</v>

2908
01:30:46.210 --> 01:30:48.340
<v Speaker 2>because great fighters won.</v>

2909
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:49.690
<v Speaker 2>The fight came to them.</v>

2910
01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:54.310
<v Speaker 2>They found a way to do what they had to do.</v>

2911
01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.700
<v Speaker 2>He found a way to disappear.</v>

2912
01:30:59.150 --> 01:31:00.470
<v Speaker 2>They found a way to show up.</v>

2913
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:01.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2914
01:31:01.851 --> 01:31:02.684
<v Speaker 2>show up.</v>

2915
01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:07.850
<v Speaker 2>He found the way to go and not show up and look.</v>

2916
01:31:07.851 --> 01:31:11.840
<v Speaker 2>You could go talk to psychiatrists and you could go to all the reasons why.</v>

2917
01:31:13.130 --> 01:31:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Hiding between a war when he was a kid.</v>

2918
01:31:15.710 --> 01:31:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2919
01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:17.300
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it.</v>

2920
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:19.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you another part of it.</v>

2921
01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:21.770
<v Speaker 2>To be that,</v>

2922
01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:23.570
<v Speaker 2>not to be the power puncher,</v>

2923
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:25.610
<v Speaker 2>not to be the aggressor,</v>

2924
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:26.391
<v Speaker 2>not to be.</v>

2925
01:31:26.391 --> 01:31:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Just those things.</v>

2926
01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:29.960
<v Speaker 2>To be the Titan,</v>

2927
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:31.040
<v Speaker 2>to be the Viking,</v>

2928
01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:33.860
<v Speaker 2>to be the Samurai,</v>

2929
01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:35.000
<v Speaker 2>to be the warrior,</v>

2930
01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:38.450
<v Speaker 2>to be those things has to be inside you.</v>

2931
01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:39.933
<v Speaker 2>You have to believe it.</v>

2932
01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:41.310
<v Speaker 2>It all.</v>

2933
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:42.950
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times people will lie in life.</v>

2934
01:31:43.170 --> 01:31:44.060
<v Speaker 2>This is Fullerton plays.</v>

2935
01:31:44.061 --> 01:31:44.894
<v Speaker 2>You can't lie.</v>

2936
01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:46.410
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2937
01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:46.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2938
01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:49.530
<v Speaker 2>sometimes we'd say that the ring is the Chamber of truth.</v>

2939
01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:49.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2940
01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:50.940
<v Speaker 2>it sounds good and all that,</v>

2941
01:31:50.941 --> 01:31:52.740
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>

2942
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:57.210
<v Speaker 2>It is because just like in other places in life,</v>

2943
01:31:57.211 --> 01:32:00.550
<v Speaker 2>so when moment comes</v>

2944
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:03.640
<v Speaker 6>for those kinds of serious things,</v>

2945
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:06.700
<v Speaker 6>you have to feel like that.</v>

2946
01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:09.310
<v Speaker 6>You say that you're the conqueror,</v>

2947
01:32:09.311 --> 01:32:10.550
<v Speaker 6>you Alexander the great you,</v>

2948
01:32:10.551 --> 01:32:11.321
<v Speaker 6>all those things,</v>

2949
01:32:11.321 --> 01:32:11.591
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2950
01:32:11.591 --> 01:32:11.951
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2951
01:32:11.951 --> 01:32:13.030
<v Speaker 6>Words sounds great.</v>

2952
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 6>Makes good soundbites.</v>

2953
01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.440
<v Speaker 6>Probably bring more people to the TV,</v>

2954
01:32:18.010 --> 01:32:21.820
<v Speaker 6>but when the moment comes and you didn't intimidate a guy that didn't work.</v>

2955
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:22.900
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2956
01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.490
<v Speaker 6>We all try it to a certain extent,</v>

2957
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:24.790
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2958
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:25.181
<v Speaker 6>Probably.</v>

2959
01:32:25.181 --> 01:32:26.014
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2960
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.550
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure you've looked at guys certain ways when you were younger and and you'd</v>

2961
01:32:30.551 --> 01:32:34.510
<v Speaker 6>purposely looked at them in a way to invoke a certain</v>

2962
01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:37.360
<v Speaker 6>kind of action,</v>

2963
01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:39.730
<v Speaker 6>a certain kind of result,</v>

2964
01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:40.780
<v Speaker 6>fund them.</v>

2965
01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:41.081
<v Speaker 6>Just,</v>

2966
01:32:41.081 --> 01:32:45.030
<v Speaker 6>just look at Adam and a real serious way that you hope that it weakened them.</v>

2967
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:46.263
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2968
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:48.550
<v Speaker 6>And but because I know your background,</v>

2969
01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.800
<v Speaker 6>you were prepared to do what came after that,</v>

2970
01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:52.900
<v Speaker 6>but some people aren't.</v>

2971
01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.000
<v Speaker 6>Some people aren't.</v>

2972
01:32:56.230 --> 01:32:58.090
<v Speaker 6>And Tyson was in</v>

2973
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:59.780
<v Speaker 5>as great as he was.</v>

2974
01:32:59.781 --> 01:33:00.614
<v Speaker 5>I just said it.</v>

2975
01:33:00.650 --> 01:33:03.200
<v Speaker 5>He's great guys that hate me for this today,</v>

2976
01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.460
<v Speaker 5>your hero or whatever,</v>

2977
01:33:04.461 --> 01:33:05.390
<v Speaker 5>your favorite guy,</v>

2978
01:33:05.391 --> 01:33:06.680
<v Speaker 5>when he's great,</v>

2979
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:08.690
<v Speaker 6>just not great.</v>

2980
01:33:08.691 --> 01:33:13.691
<v Speaker 6>And in his area and when that moment comes,</v>

2981
01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:17.290
<v Speaker 6>you have to,</v>

2982
01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:18.880
<v Speaker 6>that's where the truth matters.</v>

2983
01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.900
<v Speaker 6>You have to believe that you really,</v>

2984
01:33:22.901 --> 01:33:23.734
<v Speaker 6>that guy.</v>

2985
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:25.500
<v Speaker 6>And if your guide that</v>

2986
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:26.591
<v Speaker 5>he listened,</v>

2987
01:33:26.591 --> 01:33:27.251
<v Speaker 5>he was convicted.</v>

2988
01:33:27.251 --> 01:33:29.470
<v Speaker 5>So I think it's fair that rape somebody.</v>

2989
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.040
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2990
01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:30.581
<v Speaker 5>now listen,</v>

2991
01:33:30.581 --> 01:33:32.440
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't in an AV Rome and I don't know,</v>

2992
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:35.140
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people don't take okay but he was convicted or,</v>

2993
01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.220
<v Speaker 5>but I know enough people in the business that there was a lot of other bad</v>

2994
01:33:39.221 --> 01:33:43.210
<v Speaker 5>things that he did that are just not things that that you would probably want to</v>

2995
01:33:43.211 --> 01:33:44.950
<v Speaker 5>hang around with somebody if you know,</v>

2996
01:33:44.951 --> 01:33:48.820
<v Speaker 5>if you're a halfway decent human being that he did devil week things.</v>

2997
01:33:48.821 --> 01:33:49.151
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2998
01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:49.451
<v Speaker 5>Week.</v>

2999

<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>

3000
01:33:49.681 --> 01:33:53.410
<v Speaker 5>So when you do read things and you know you did though and I don't know what,</v>

3001
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:58.480
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just saying you do week things and you know they will week things and</v>

3002
01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:00.190
<v Speaker 5>now you got to do a strong thing.</v>

3003
01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:04.090
<v Speaker 5>How do you become strong when you know that you did those weak things and you</v>

3004
01:34:04.091 --> 01:34:05.830
<v Speaker 5>know that's really you and you got a guy,</v>

3005
01:34:05.831 --> 01:34:07.300
<v Speaker 5>a course way from your name,</v>

3006
01:34:07.301 --> 01:34:11.110
<v Speaker 5>Nevada Holyfield that doesn't give a shit about how hard you punch.</v>

3007
01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.700
<v Speaker 5>Does it give a crap about what a finisher yard does?</v>

3008
01:34:13.730 --> 01:34:16.600
<v Speaker 5>It give a crap about how fair is you put your punches together.</v>

3009
01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 5>He wants to find,</v>

3010
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:22.240
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to make him a believer by doing it and doing it in a</v>

3011
01:34:22.241 --> 01:34:25.840
<v Speaker 5>difficult place because he's gonna make it difficult because he ain't got to</v>

3012
01:34:25.841 --> 01:34:26.680
<v Speaker 5>cooperate.</v>

3013
01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.270
<v Speaker 6>When that happens,</v>

3014
01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:34.090
<v Speaker 6>you got to feel like that person.</v>

3015
01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:37.180
<v Speaker 6>And when you don't feel like that person,</v>

3016
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:40.223
<v Speaker 6>you got a problem.</v>

3017
01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:45.510
<v Speaker 6>And as what happened wasn't a matter when he bit his ear,</v>

3018
01:34:46.110 --> 01:34:48.930
<v Speaker 5>it was a matter that he was hungry and he was a savage and he was from the</v>

3019
01:34:48.931 --> 01:34:50.220
<v Speaker 5>should stop the crap.</v>

3020
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:52.920
<v Speaker 6>It was a way to get out</v>

3021
01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.490
<v Speaker 6>cause he knew he wasn't that guy.</v>

3022
01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:57.981
<v Speaker 6>And when you're not,</v>

3023
01:34:57.981 --> 01:34:58.641
<v Speaker 6>that guy goes,</v>

3024
01:34:58.641 --> 01:35:00.080
<v Speaker 6>what do you have a great talent off?</v>

3025
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:05.630
<v Speaker 6>Recognize when somebody is there as your greatest talent,</v>

3026
01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:08.390
<v Speaker 6>he can recognize when somebody is,</v>

3027
01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 6>and he recognized that Evander Holyfield was and I was his way to get out</v>

3028
01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.680
<v Speaker 6>and he did.</v>

3029
01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.300
<v Speaker 6>So that's why again,</v>

3030
01:35:19.301 --> 01:35:20.320
<v Speaker 6>it's not sour grapes.</v>

3031
01:35:20.321 --> 01:35:22.360
<v Speaker 6>It's really not because I'm more selfish than that.</v>

3032
01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:23.950
<v Speaker 6>I really do care about</v>

3033
01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:28.900
<v Speaker 6>what well my reputation is and whether or not,</v>

3034
01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:29.650
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3035
01:35:29.650 --> 01:35:31.020
<v Speaker 6>I've been honest about things.</v>

3036
01:35:31.021 --> 01:35:31.854
<v Speaker 6>I say,</v>

3037
01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:33.700
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't mean I'm right per means.</v>

3038
01:35:33.701 --> 01:35:34.534
<v Speaker 6>I believe it.</v>

3039
01:35:34.930 --> 01:35:35.890
<v Speaker 6>I do care about that.</v>

3040
01:35:37.630 --> 01:35:38.463
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

3041
01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:45.070
<v Speaker 6>And so it's not that it doesn't mean I'm right,</v>

3042
01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:49.750
<v Speaker 6>but it means I have a reason to believe on right from the way of live,</v>

3043
01:35:49.751 --> 01:35:50.590
<v Speaker 6>from what I've seen,</v>

3044
01:35:50.591 --> 01:35:53.140
<v Speaker 6>what I've experienced in the business,</v>

3045
01:35:53.770 --> 01:35:54.790
<v Speaker 6>the human condition,</v>

3046
01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.550
<v Speaker 6>how strong it can be and how we could can be.</v>

3047
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:02.803
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3048
01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.870
<v Speaker 6>he was a stronger guys.</v>

3049
01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:06.681
<v Speaker 6>Are you ever going to see,</v>

3050
01:36:06.681 --> 01:36:10.130
<v Speaker 6>but he was his week of person as you ever going to find.</v>

3051
01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:14.220
<v Speaker 6>That's intense.</v>

3052
01:36:14.610 --> 01:36:19.440
<v Speaker 6>But I see what you're saying in terms of you are judging it by the highest</v>

3053
01:36:19.441 --> 01:36:20.430
<v Speaker 6>standards possible.</v>

3054
01:36:20.431 --> 01:36:24.090
<v Speaker 6>You're judging it in comparison to other champions.</v>

3055
01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:25.381
<v Speaker 6>You're judging it.</v>

3056
01:36:25.381 --> 01:36:25.541
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

3057
01:36:25.541 --> 01:36:25.721
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3058
01:36:25.721 --> 01:36:25.880
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3059
01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.380
<v Speaker 6>what else you got to jump through with Joe,</v>

3060
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:28.703
<v Speaker 6>of course.</v>

3061
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:29.160
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3062
01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:34.140
<v Speaker 6>you look at guys who are known for incredible heart and their ability to come</v>

3063
01:36:34.141 --> 01:36:35.390
<v Speaker 6>back like Diego corrals,</v>

3064
01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:37.600
<v Speaker 6>David Carlson,</v>

3065
01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:41.040
<v Speaker 6>some of those wars when you would say could steal.</v>

3066
01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:41.610
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3067
01:36:41.610 --> 01:36:43.200
<v Speaker 6>That was one of the greatest fights of all time.</v>

3068
01:36:43.201 --> 01:36:44.190
<v Speaker 6>The forest of credible,</v>

3069
01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:45.930
<v Speaker 6>greatest fight of all Micky ward.</v>

3070
01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:46.460
<v Speaker 6>Arturo.</v>

3071
01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:46.770
<v Speaker 6>Gary,</v>

01:36:46.770 --> 01:36:47.371
<v Speaker 6>the first one,</v>

3073
01:36:47.371 --> 01:36:47.700
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3074
01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.760
<v Speaker 6>Not the second door.</v>

3075
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:49.471
<v Speaker 6>The first,</v>

3076
01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:50.220
<v Speaker 6>the first.</v>

3077
01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:51.053
<v Speaker 6>Unbelievable.</v>

3078
01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:51.953
<v Speaker 6>Unbelievable.</v>

3079
01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.220
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3080
01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:53.430
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3081
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:54.300
<v Speaker 6>if you want to go back,</v>

3082
01:36:54.301 --> 01:36:55.330
<v Speaker 6>if you want to go back farther,</v>

3083
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:56.640
<v Speaker 6>most a lot of people will know this,</v>

3084
01:36:56.641 --> 01:37:00.000
<v Speaker 6>but you should call him was involved in a lot and unfortunately he paid the</v>

3085
01:37:00.001 --> 01:37:00.600
<v Speaker 6>price.</v>

3086
01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:00.990
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3087
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.590
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3088
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:03.180
<v Speaker 6>But Bobby should call in in the 70s,</v>

3089
01:37:03.181 --> 01:37:03.780
<v Speaker 6>eighties.</v>

3090
01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:06.030
<v Speaker 6>He was involved in those fights every other day.</v>

3091
01:37:06.330 --> 01:37:06.691
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3092
01:37:06.691 --> 01:37:07.321
<v Speaker 6>I'm just kidding.</v>

3093
01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:09.930
<v Speaker 6>But he was invited to many of those fights.</v>

3094
01:37:09.931 --> 01:37:10.764
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3095
01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.700
<v Speaker 6>And unfortunately you don't know about Bobby should call and you talk to</v>

3096
01:37:14.701 --> 01:37:15.534
<v Speaker 6>somebody again,</v>

3097
01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:16.890
<v Speaker 6>like the baseball thing,</v>

3098
01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:18.480
<v Speaker 6>you talk about the average guy,</v>

3099
01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:20.250
<v Speaker 6>Bobby Chicago and who the hell's that?</v>

3100
01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.090
<v Speaker 6>Who the hell is that affords is a guy that would know his name anymore.</v>

3101
01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:30.340
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

3102
01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.340
<v Speaker 6>he was a pretty special guy and everything.</v>

3103
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:33.530
<v Speaker 6>He was pretty damn tough.</v>

3104
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 6>Tougher than most people.</v>

3105
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:41.290
<v Speaker 6>There's guys that unfortunately relied on that toughness.</v>

3106
01:37:41.291 --> 01:37:41.860
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3107
01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.250
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3108
01:37:42.250 --> 01:37:43.450
<v Speaker 6>Like when you,</v>

3109
01:37:43.451 --> 01:37:46.180
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to guys known for incredible Chins,</v>

3110
01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.740
<v Speaker 6>that can be a detriment.</v>

3111
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.820
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3112
01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:50.470
<v Speaker 6>And it can be if that's all you have.</v>

3113
01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:51.820
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that's what you have?</v>

3114
01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:55.000
<v Speaker 6>Cause she used to put it this way cause she used to that because he wanted me to</v>

3115
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:55.973
<v Speaker 6>a great trainer.</v>

3116
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.600
<v Speaker 6>So cause she used to always be with me.</v>

3117
01:37:57.601 --> 01:37:58.230
<v Speaker 6>All the tools,</v>

3118
01:37:58.230 --> 01:37:58.630
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3119
01:37:58.630 --> 01:38:00.770
<v Speaker 6>scientists and cuss would say day</v>

3120
01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.050
<v Speaker 6>got two tough guys.</v>

3121
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:04.850
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3122
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:05.683
<v Speaker 6>Gotcha.</v>

3123
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.923
<v Speaker 7>Now</v>

3124
01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:10.293
<v Speaker 6>well it's tough.</v>

3125
01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:13.240
<v Speaker 6>It's a prerequisite to be in a fighter.</v>

3126
01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:14.920
<v Speaker 6>You better be tough.</v>

3127
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:16.060
<v Speaker 6>But one level.</v>

3128
01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:19.240
<v Speaker 6>So all levels the greys and I got you.</v>

3129
01:38:19.810 --> 01:38:22.870
<v Speaker 6>But how special is being tough?</v>

3130
01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:25.120
<v Speaker 6>Because if you're a fighter you should be tough.</v>

3131
01:38:25.150 --> 01:38:25.983
<v Speaker 6>I gotcha.</v>

3132
01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.153
<v Speaker 6>Homelessness.</v>

3133
01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.230
<v Speaker 6>So you've got two tough guys,</v>

3134
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:32.110
<v Speaker 7>but one of them is smart.</v>

3135
01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.353
<v Speaker 7>Taught,</v>

3136
01:38:35.230 --> 01:38:36.063
<v Speaker 7>developed.</v>

3137
01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:40.713
<v Speaker 7>That's him.</v>

3138
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:43.090
<v Speaker 6>He's tough one now.</v>

3139
01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:44.871
<v Speaker 6>That's how he explained it.</v>

3140
01:38:44.871 --> 01:38:46.120
<v Speaker 6>Tougher because he's smart.</v>

3141
01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:46.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3142
01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:48.100
<v Speaker 6>Tough and smart.</v>

3143
01:38:48.101 --> 01:38:48.461
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3144
01:38:48.461 --> 01:38:49.570
<v Speaker 6>he goes from here,</v>

3145
01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:54.130
<v Speaker 6>he's here because he's not just dependent only on toughness.</v>

3146
01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:55.840
<v Speaker 6>So He's tougher than this guy.</v>

3147
01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:56.410
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3148
01:38:56.410 --> 01:38:58.120
<v Speaker 6>Cause he don't have to depend on just that.</v>

3149
01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:00.130
<v Speaker 6>You might not even have to get to it.</v>

3150
01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.710
<v Speaker 6>It's there as a reserve.</v>

3151
01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:06.040
<v Speaker 6>It's always there to call on like an army.</v>

3152
01:39:06.041 --> 01:39:06.701
<v Speaker 6>You call on,</v>

3153
01:39:06.701 --> 01:39:07.210
<v Speaker 6>you need it.</v>

3154
01:39:07.210 --> 01:39:07.990
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3155
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:10.600
<v Speaker 6>But he's not dependent just on that.</v>

3156
01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that the balance though,</v>

3157
01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.240
<v Speaker 6>is knowing that you have it.</v>

3158
01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:14.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3159
01:39:14.050 --> 01:39:15.270
<v Speaker 6>Knowing that you have it.</v>

3160
01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:16.601
<v Speaker 6>There it is.</v>

3161
01:39:16.601 --> 01:39:17.500
<v Speaker 6>See what you just said.</v>

3162
01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:19.490
<v Speaker 6>You have to know that are it.</v>

3163
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.370
<v Speaker 6>Tyson didn't know he was it.</v>

3164
01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.320
<v Speaker 6>We ever admit that.</v>

3165
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.440
<v Speaker 6>He probably knocked me and say dessert,</v>

3166
01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:25.901
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3167
01:39:25.901 --> 01:39:26.440
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

3168
01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.370
<v Speaker 6>it's okay.</v>

3169
01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:28.660
<v Speaker 6>And so I get I,</v>

3170
01:39:28.661 --> 01:39:29.494
<v Speaker 6>it's okay.</v>

3171
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:32.710
<v Speaker 6>Well there's certain people that you can't question and Aranda Holyfield's one</v>

3172
01:39:32.711 --> 01:39:33.280
<v Speaker 6>of those people.</v>

3173
01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.240
<v Speaker 6>That's why that fight was so fascinating because it was Phil was,</v>

3174
01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.210
<v Speaker 6>he is a 100% warrior.</v>

3175
01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.260
<v Speaker 6>Well he had to write nickname.</v>

3176
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:42.580
<v Speaker 6>Most of them don't.</v>

3177
01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:45.850
<v Speaker 6>Most of them don't have to write fight nickname and whatever they do.</v>

3178
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:46.210
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3179
01:39:46.210 --> 01:39:46.840
<v Speaker 6>But the real,</v>

3180
01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.620
<v Speaker 6>the real deal,</v>

3181
01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.640
<v Speaker 6>he was the real deal.</v>

3182
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3183
01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:51.340
<v Speaker 6>And why small heavyweights?</v>

3184
01:39:51.341 --> 01:39:52.174
<v Speaker 6>You want to know why?</v>

3185
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:53.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean trace it back,</v>

3186
01:39:53.981 --> 01:39:55.030
<v Speaker 6>cause always told me this,</v>

3187
01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:57.490
<v Speaker 6>but I learned it innately on my own too.</v>

3188
01:39:58.090 --> 01:39:59.800
<v Speaker 6>But trace it back to the parents,</v>

3189
01:39:59.801 --> 01:40:01.450
<v Speaker 6>trace it back to the background traitor,</v>

3190
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:03.400
<v Speaker 6>trace it back to all that stuff,</v>

3191
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:04.900
<v Speaker 6>trace it back.</v>

3192
01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.200
<v Speaker 6>He did.</v>

3193
01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.510
<v Speaker 6>He didn't live up to something.</v>

3194
01:40:07.511 --> 01:40:08.590
<v Speaker 6>He didn't face something.</v>

3195
01:40:08.591 --> 01:40:09.101
<v Speaker 6>He didn't do.</v>

3196
01:40:09.101 --> 01:40:10.470
<v Speaker 6>Whatever it was there was about,</v>

3197
01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:14.850
<v Speaker 6>he had a mother that he talked about a few times and I,</v>

3198
01:40:14.851 --> 01:40:15.441

01:40:15.911 --> 01:40:17.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying exact but,</v>

3201
01:40:17.530 --> 01:40:18.790
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

3202
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:19.743

<v Speaker 6>the crop and Georgia tech,</v>

3207

<v Speaker 6>it was Atlanta pub,</v>

3208
01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:31.200
<v Speaker 6>whatever suburb of Georgia</v>

3209
01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:33.301
<v Speaker 6>and she,</v>

3210

<v Speaker 6>you have definite age and on different time down south and all that,</v>

3211
01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.221
<v Speaker 6>had a little,</v>

3212
01:40:38.221 --> 01:40:42.390
<v Speaker 6>I guess a little shack in the back with a thing called twitches switch.</v>

3213
01:40:42.391 --> 01:40:42.961
<v Speaker 6>It switches.</v>

3214
01:40:42.961 --> 01:40:43.794
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry,</v>

3215
01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:45.173
<v Speaker 6>I'm twitching</v>

3216
01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:49.643
<v Speaker 6>switches.</v>

3217
01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:52.133
<v Speaker 6>And</v>

3218
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.870
<v Speaker 6>she basically had different size switches,</v>

3219
01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:56.733
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3220
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:57.521
<v Speaker 6>short ones,</v>

3221
01:40:57.521 --> 01:40:58.091
<v Speaker 6>long ones,</v>

3222
01:40:58.091 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 6>medium ones depending on the occasion.</v>

3223
01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:05.830
<v Speaker 6>And when he didn't live up to what he had to tell the truth,</v>

3224
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:06.521
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

3225
01:41:06.521 --> 01:41:07.390
<v Speaker 6>be accountable.</v>

3226
01:41:07.391 --> 01:41:08.224
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3227
01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:11.170
<v Speaker 6>Face what he had to face,</v>

3228
01:41:11.171 --> 01:41:12.004
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3229
01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:13.030
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3230
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:18.010
<v Speaker 6>she had a switch for him and you know what,</v>

3231
01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:20.593
<v Speaker 6>it um,</v>

3232
01:41:21.250 --> 01:41:24.280
<v Speaker 6>informed him because he faced things.</v>

3233
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:27.310
<v Speaker 6>Tyson Tyson on the other hand and listen,</v>

3234
01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:28.300
<v Speaker 6>did he asked for it?</v>

3235
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:29.143
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3236
01:41:29.530 --> 01:41:29.741
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3237
01:41:29.741 --> 01:41:30.521
<v Speaker 6>he didn't ask for that.</v>

3238
01:41:30.521 --> 01:41:31.210
<v Speaker 6>Oh brilliant.</v>

3239
01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:32.043
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

3240
01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:35.950
<v Speaker 6>But I know people have that upbringing and they get to a point they can,</v>

3241
01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:38.400
<v Speaker 6>they can make a left turn instead.</v>

3242
01:41:38.401 --> 01:41:38.711
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

3243
01:41:38.711 --> 01:41:40.950
<v Speaker 6>Turn is your ability to make,</v>

3244
01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:42.610
<v Speaker 6>I think there was also the,</v>

3245
01:41:42.611 --> 01:41:47.350
<v Speaker 6>the overwhelming hype and celebrity involved in Mike Tyson in his prime,</v>

3246
01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:50.020
<v Speaker 6>it was probably so difficult for him to even understand himself.</v>

3247
01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:50.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3248
01:41:50.890 --> 01:41:51.131
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

3249
01:41:51.131 --> 01:41:52.570
<v Speaker 6>but what he did understand,</v>

3250
01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:54.040
<v Speaker 6>and I'm glad you said that</v>

3251
01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.720
<v Speaker 6>right backwards,</v>

3252
01:41:58.020 --> 01:42:00.870
<v Speaker 6>what he did and what he did understand</v>

3253
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:05.970
<v Speaker 6>it was there was a way out of van learn,</v>

3254
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:06.860
<v Speaker 6>there was no way out,</v>

3255
01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:08.950
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3256
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:09.770
<v Speaker 6>oppose away,</v>

3257
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:10.431
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

3258
01:42:10.431 --> 01:42:10.611
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3259
01:42:10.611 --> 01:42:10.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3260
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:12.710
<v Speaker 6>Like somebody would come and pay.</v>

3261
01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:13.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3262
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:17.750
<v Speaker 6>And he did a lot of things before he became champion and somebody was always</v>

3263
01:42:17.751 --> 01:42:19.910
<v Speaker 6>there with a check or cash or whatever.</v>

3264
01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:20.611
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3265
01:42:20.611 --> 01:42:22.550
<v Speaker 6>and w would absolve them from,</v>

3266
01:42:22.551 --> 01:42:23.150
<v Speaker 6>it would,</v>

3267
01:42:23.150 --> 01:42:24.620
<v Speaker 6>would not have to face what he did.</v>

3268
01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:25.200
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3269
01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:25.550
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3270
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.880
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3271
01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:27.730
<v Speaker 6>but there was a switch that a van,</v>

3272
01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:30.380
<v Speaker 6>the hat of face and that's what made him,</v>

3273
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:31.423
<v Speaker 6>what made him,</v>

3274
01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.300
<v Speaker 6>and that's what allowed Tyson part of would move out.</v>

3275
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:35.030
<v Speaker 6>Tyson,</v>

3276
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.900
<v Speaker 6>you look,</v>

3277
01:42:35.901 --> 01:42:37.700
<v Speaker 6>you make your own choice at a certain point life.</v>

3278
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:39.410
<v Speaker 6>So there's not make too many excuses,</v>

3279
01:42:39.411 --> 01:42:41.930
<v Speaker 6>but it is part of it that,</v>

3280
01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:47.180
<v Speaker 6>that he was formed by what he was allowed to do when he shouldn't have been</v>

3281
01:42:47.931 --> 01:42:48.980
<v Speaker 6>allowed to do those things.</v>

3282
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.810
<v Speaker 6>So that was one of the issues that you had with costs,</v>

3283
01:42:50.811 --> 01:42:51.140
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3284
01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:51.973
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3285
01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:57.620
<v Speaker 6>That you felt like costs was ignoring his own principles and teaching because</v>

3286
01:42:57.621 --> 01:42:58.880
<v Speaker 6>this guy was so special.</v>

3287
01:42:58.970 --> 01:42:59.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3288
01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:03.200
<v Speaker 6>And cause was getting older and cost recognize you didn't have much time left in</v>

3289
01:43:03.201 --> 01:43:05.980
<v Speaker 6>this guy had a legitimate shot at being a world champion and for cause heavy</v>

3290
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.750
<v Speaker 6>thing in his June.</v>

3291
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:09.680
<v Speaker 6>Everything in the world of boxing success and everything.</v>

3292
01:43:09.681 --> 01:43:10.191
<v Speaker 6>He was great.</v>

3293
01:43:10.191 --> 01:43:14.300
<v Speaker 6>He was special because his whole life he didn't get married for a reason because</v>

3294
01:43:14.301 --> 01:43:15.081
<v Speaker 6>he was married to box.</v>

3295
01:43:15.081 --> 01:43:16.970
<v Speaker 6>And as he said that it wouldn't been fair.</v>

3296
01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:17.391
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3297
01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:21.150
<v Speaker 6>this was a different guy that it was boxing his whole lot,</v>

3298
01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.033
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

3299
01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:26.780
<v Speaker 6>Life was boxing and lessons were connected to boxing,</v>

3300
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:29.480
<v Speaker 6>everything and um,</v>

3301
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:31.460
<v Speaker 6>principals boxing.</v>

3302
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:33.583
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3303
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:35.420
<v Speaker 6>so there's,</v>

3304
01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:35.660
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3305
01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:36.493
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3306
01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.050
<v Speaker 6>there's a guy that his whole,</v>

3307
01:43:39.330 --> 01:43:39.621
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3308
01:43:39.621 --> 01:43:41.120
<v Speaker 6>you use that word legacy,</v>

3309
01:43:41.690 --> 01:43:45.380
<v Speaker 6>but really his whole existence was boxing.</v>

3310
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:47.930
<v Speaker 6>And for him it was heavyweight champion.</v>

3311
01:43:47.931 --> 01:43:49.070
<v Speaker 6>He had Floyd Patterson,</v>

3312
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:50.850
<v Speaker 6>youngest heavyweight champ ever.</v>

3313
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:51.763
<v Speaker 6>That was cost.</v>

3314
01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:52.753
<v Speaker 6>That was cost.</v>

3315
01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:54.500
<v Speaker 6>It was about lightweights.</v>

3316
01:43:54.501 --> 01:43:54.891
<v Speaker 6>Lizard.</v>

3317
01:43:54.891 --> 01:43:55.641
<v Speaker 6>He had lightweights.</v>

3318
01:43:55.641 --> 01:43:56.500
<v Speaker 6>He had welterweights,</v>

3319
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:57.343
<v Speaker 6>Jose Torres,</v>

3320
01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:58.191
<v Speaker 6>Jose toys,</v>

3321
01:43:58.191 --> 01:43:59.240
<v Speaker 6>light heavyweight champion.</v>

3322
01:43:59.241 --> 01:44:00.080
<v Speaker 6>Exactly right.</v>

3323
01:44:00.081 --> 01:44:00.950
<v Speaker 6>He had other guys too.</v>

3324
01:44:01.190 --> 01:44:04.700
<v Speaker 6>But it was the heavyweight champion of the world because it was around where we</v>

3325
01:44:04.701 --> 01:44:07.400
<v Speaker 6>talked about before when box was the biggest sport,</v>

3326
01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:08.330
<v Speaker 6>bigger than baseball.</v>

3327
01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:12.500
<v Speaker 6>And it was the heavyweight champ of the world was Babe Ruth [inaudible],</v>

3328
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:14.930
<v Speaker 6>Seattle and that,</v>

3329
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:18.620
<v Speaker 6>and you're going to say that before you leave this earth,</v>

3330
01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.720
<v Speaker 6>that you have a chance to have another heavyweight champ that might be the best,</v>

3331
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.710
<v Speaker 6>could be one of the best ever and could break Patterson's record,</v>

3332
01:44:27.711 --> 01:44:28.970
<v Speaker 6>which was part of the plan,</v>

3333
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:31.280
<v Speaker 6>part of the plan when costs was alive.</v>

3334
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:32.930
<v Speaker 6>You're going to break Patterson's reg.</v>

3335
01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:33.793
<v Speaker 6>He broke it.</v>

3336
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:35.930
<v Speaker 6>He became the youngest heavyweight champion.</v>

3337
01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.430
<v Speaker 6>And so when you float that out there,</v>

3338
01:44:40.670 --> 01:44:41.503
<v Speaker 6>if you will,</v>

3339
01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.280
<v Speaker 6>and tempt the guy with that,</v>

3340
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.500
<v Speaker 6>even a great guy like costs,</v>

3341
01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:48.980
<v Speaker 6>some things are going to be a push to the side.</v>

3342
01:44:49.130 --> 01:44:49.820
<v Speaker 6>And Ethan,</v>

3343
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:50.031
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3344
01:44:50.031 --> 01:44:50.690
<v Speaker 6>compromised.</v>

3345
01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:51.523
<v Speaker 6>And he did.</v>

3346
01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:55.880
<v Speaker 6>Do you think if he didn't do that the Tyson would have been a different person?</v>

3347
01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:03.040
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to use his words that was told to me by a great promoter.</v>

3348
01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:04.700
<v Speaker 6>Mickey toppy passed away.</v>

3349
01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:10.280
<v Speaker 6>It was close to Jim Jacobs who was close to cause and he was up there sometimes</v>

3350
01:45:10.281 --> 01:45:11.420
<v Speaker 6>after I left and all that.</v>

3351
01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:15.440
<v Speaker 6>And Mickey wanted me to train all his fighters and he was a great promoter.</v>

3352
01:45:15.441 --> 01:45:16.274
<v Speaker 6>Mickey,</v>

3353
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:17.720
<v Speaker 6>he had great sayings.</v>

3354
01:45:17.721 --> 01:45:18.710
<v Speaker 6>He was a very witty guy,</v>

3355
01:45:18.711 --> 01:45:20.000
<v Speaker 6>but he was a sharp guy.</v>

3356
01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:21.620
<v Speaker 6>Boxing was his life too.</v>

3357
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:24.710
<v Speaker 6>And he ran everything in London with three partners.</v>

3358
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:27.980
<v Speaker 6>One of them was Java sustain who owned Wembley Stadium.</v>

3359
01:45:27.981 --> 01:45:28.940
<v Speaker 6>So they were powerful.</v>

3360
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:30.350
<v Speaker 6>They ran everything.</v>

3361
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:34.700
<v Speaker 6>They were the cartel in London back in those days.</v>

3362
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:41.050
<v Speaker 6>He told me that before Carlos died that cause had said some nice things about</v>

3363
01:45:44.091 --> 01:45:44.924
<v Speaker 6>teddy atlas,</v>

3364
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:47.840
<v Speaker 6>but he said,</v>

3365
01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:48.860
<v Speaker 6>and La's,</v>

3366
01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:51.230
<v Speaker 6>I know there's a danger that this can be convenient.</v>

3367
01:45:51.710 --> 01:45:52.351
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

3368
01:45:52.351 --> 01:45:53.540
<v Speaker 6>Self serving crap.</v>

3369
01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:57.260
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you got to trust whatever.</v>

3370
01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:02.150
<v Speaker 6>I was told by Mickey that he said that</v>

3371
01:46:03.370 --> 01:46:03.930
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3372
01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:06.210
<v Speaker 6>Teddy Atlas was right by the way,</v>

3373
01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:11.220
<v Speaker 6>was wrong was who's going to get in a way of the possibility of making a great</v>

3374
01:46:12.181 --> 01:46:13.014
<v Speaker 6>fighter.</v>

3375
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:15.143
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

3376
01:46:15.690 --> 01:46:16.523
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3377
01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:20.940
<v Speaker 6>if he did things his way as far as the disciplining in the in or whatever,</v>

3378
01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:21.950
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3379
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:22.620
<v Speaker 6>eve,</v>

3380
01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:23.453
<v Speaker 6>in other words,</v>

3381
01:46:23.490 --> 01:46:25.110
<v Speaker 6>whether he left it like that,</v>

3382
01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.273
<v Speaker 6>so I don't know.</v>

3383
01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:31.400
<v Speaker 6>So I know what I think it meant that Thaisa wouldn't have been around if you</v>

3384
01:46:31.621 --> 01:46:32.040
<v Speaker 6>did,</v>

3385
01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.630
<v Speaker 6>if you discipline that he would have laughed.</v>

3386
01:46:33.631 --> 01:46:34.464
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

3387
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:37.950
<v Speaker 6>cause I don't know that he had those options because he was a ward of the state</v>

3388
01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:38.731
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3389
01:46:38.731 --> 01:46:39.060
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3390
01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:39.301
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3391
01:46:39.301 --> 01:46:44.301
<v Speaker 6>it was coming out of obviously a criminal situation who's coming out of a</v>

3392
01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:48.180
<v Speaker 6>juvenile detention center called Trion up outside of old,</v>

3393
01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 6>30 miles outside Albany.</v>

3394
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:50.993
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3395
01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:51.661
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3396
01:46:51.661 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 6>so I don't know that he had,</v>

3397
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:56.400
<v Speaker 6>but basically that if teddy did it his way,</v>

3398
01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:57.660
<v Speaker 6>he was right.</v>

3399
01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:00.930
<v Speaker 6>But he was wrong because it would have ruined the possibility of a great fighter</v>

3400
01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.480
<v Speaker 6>and I couldn't let that happen.</v>

3401
01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:06.480
<v Speaker 6>So I don't think that it's,</v>

3402
01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:07.980
<v Speaker 6>I dunno if it's true,</v>

3403
01:47:07.981 --> 01:47:08.431
<v Speaker 6>actually.</v>

3404
01:47:08.431 --> 01:47:09.264
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3405
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:10.770
<v Speaker 6>You know what I was about to say?</v>

3406
01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:14.430
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that's true because of course it's me,</v>

3407
01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:15.120
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3408
01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.620
<v Speaker 6>I want to make myself feel good.</v>

3409
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:19.530
<v Speaker 6>So I want to say you could have the best of both worlds.</v>

3410
01:47:19.531 --> 01:47:19.771
<v Speaker 6>So good.</v>

3411
01:47:19.771 --> 01:47:24.030
<v Speaker 6>We had maybe a better person or within the realm of a better person,</v>

3412
01:47:24.031 --> 01:47:24.271
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3413
01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:24.811
<v Speaker 6>Boundaries,</v>

3414
01:47:24.811 --> 01:47:25.021
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3415
01:47:25.021 --> 01:47:25.920
<v Speaker 6>There were no boundaries.</v>

3416
01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.530
<v Speaker 6>Maybe there would have those boundaries would have made a difference.</v>

3417
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:29.160
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3418
01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.540
<v Speaker 6>And you still would have had the talent.</v>

3419
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:31.330
<v Speaker 6>He was so absent.</v>

3420
01:47:31.330 --> 01:47:34.560
<v Speaker 6>The talent wasn't going to dissipate because I have to discipline,</v>

3421
01:47:34.850 --> 01:47:35.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3422
01:47:35.131 --> 01:47:36.900
<v Speaker 6>that you put on them as a human being.</v>

3423
01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.030
<v Speaker 6>That wasn't going to change.</v>

3424
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:41.240
<v Speaker 6>But because,</v>

3425
01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:42.720
<v Speaker 6>because we're saying that,</v>

3426
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:43.603
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3427
01:47:43.610 --> 01:47:44.460
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't going to happen.</v>

3428
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:45.960
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you'll lose them.</v>

3429
01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:48.990
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it goes to someone else at a certain point in his development.</v>

3430
01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:49.831
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's what he meant.</v>

3431
01:47:49.831 --> 01:47:52.410
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what you had that with Shannon kitchen.</v>

3432
01:47:52.411 --> 01:47:53.244
<v Speaker 6>Shannon Briggs.</v>

3433
01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:54.151
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3434
01:47:54.151 --> 01:47:54.721
<v Speaker 6>Shannon brings,</v>

3435
01:47:54.721 --> 01:47:56.130
<v Speaker 6>came from Brownsville and he was,</v>

3436
01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:57.780
<v Speaker 6>I had him as a young,</v>

3437
01:47:57.930 --> 01:47:58.763
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3438
01:47:59.010 --> 01:47:59.960
<v Speaker 6>developing program.</v>

3439
01:47:59.970 --> 01:48:01.020
<v Speaker 6>We got to a certain point.</v>

3440
01:48:01.110 --> 01:48:05.070
<v Speaker 1>But you also had that situation with him where you felt like he wasn't 100% in,</v>

3441
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:08.460
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't doing the things you wanted him to do.</v>

3442
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:09.570
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

3443
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:13.770
<v Speaker 1>he was lacking in a certain amount of discipline or he was distracted in a</v>

3444
01:48:13.771 --> 01:48:17.160
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of ways that bothered you to the point where you didn't want to</v>

3445
01:48:17.161 --> 01:48:17.994
<v Speaker 1>work with them anymore.</v>

3446
01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:20.371
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't committed,</v>

3447
01:48:20.371 --> 01:48:21.510
<v Speaker 6>I didn't think completely.</v>

3448
01:48:21.511 --> 01:48:21.990
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

3449
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.620
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3450
01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:23.610
<v Speaker 6>he was a smart kid.</v>

3451
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:24.750
<v Speaker 6>Take your kid.</v>

3452
01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:25.980
<v Speaker 6>Talented,</v>

3453
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:26.581
<v Speaker 6>talented,</v>

3454
01:48:26.581 --> 01:48:27.414
<v Speaker 6>very talented,</v>

3455
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:28.351
<v Speaker 6>smart,</v>

3456
01:48:28.351 --> 01:48:28.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3457
01:48:28.591 --> 01:48:29.850
<v Speaker 6>he knew how to market himself.</v>

3458
01:48:29.851 --> 01:48:32.910
<v Speaker 6>He had to dreadlocks and he made them orange and you know,</v>

3459
01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:37.940
<v Speaker 6>nobody was doing that back then and he could punch it was talented and he looked</v>

3460
01:48:38.641 --> 01:48:38.851
<v Speaker 6>good,</v>

3461
01:48:38.851 --> 01:48:39.270
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3462
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:40.103
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3463
01:48:40.690 --> 01:48:41.523
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3464
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:44.930
<v Speaker 6>but it's real commitment.</v>

3465
01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.060
<v Speaker 6>I didn't think because then,</v>

3466
01:48:46.061 --> 01:48:48.770
<v Speaker 6>and maybe in the two to his credit,</v>

3467
01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:49.753
<v Speaker 6>he had others,</v>

3468
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:51.530
<v Speaker 6>he was smart and he thought of other things,</v>

3469
01:48:51.531 --> 01:48:52.364
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

3470
01:48:53.630 --> 01:48:55.220
<v Speaker 6>he never really bought in.</v>

3471
01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:00.200
<v Speaker 6>That is the end all was boxing that,</v>

3472
01:49:00.201 --> 01:49:00.800
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3473
01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.600
<v Speaker 6>that was the complete,</v>

3474
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:05.930
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to use just as average,</v>

3475
01:49:05.931 --> 01:49:08.000
<v Speaker 6>same standard word.</v>

3476
01:49:08.150 --> 01:49:08.983
<v Speaker 6>Commitment,</v>

3477
01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:09.560
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3478
01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:12.020
<v Speaker 6>Like what the figures that sometimes like commitment,</v>

3479
01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.033
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

3480
01:49:14.630 --> 01:49:15.710
<v Speaker 6>more than commitment.</v>

3481
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:20.930
<v Speaker 6>He said all the right things because they had investors and they had different</v>

3482
01:49:20.931 --> 01:49:21.221
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

3483
01:49:21.221 --> 01:49:22.160
<v Speaker 6>It's their bad thing.</v>

3484
01:49:22.161 --> 01:49:22.840
<v Speaker 6>Everyone does.</v>

3485
01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:23.390
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

3486
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:24.380
<v Speaker 6>if you're talented enough,</v>

3487
01:49:24.381 --> 01:49:25.850
<v Speaker 6>you draw those kinds of things.</v>

3488
01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:27.020
<v Speaker 6>To his credit,</v>

3489
01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:29.000
<v Speaker 6>he deserved it.</v>

3490
01:49:29.130 --> 01:49:29.400
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3491
01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:34.190
<v Speaker 6>he did something to bring investors and people to back them,</v>

3492
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:37.850
<v Speaker 6>but he got so used to saying what they needed to hear</v>

3493
01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:42.010
<v Speaker 6>that he never knew what he needed to hear.</v>

3494
01:49:42.011 --> 01:49:42.844
<v Speaker 6>He never,</v>

3495
01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:47.970
<v Speaker 6>he and what he needed to hear and believe was that I'm really going to do</v>

3496
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:48.110
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3497
01:49:48.110 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 2>He got so good at selling it that he never got good at buying it.</v>

3498
01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:55.420
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3499
01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:56.410
<v Speaker 2>he never really,</v>

3500
01:49:56.950 --> 01:50:00.550
<v Speaker 2>he just thought that I ride this train and to</v>

3501
01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:02.273
<v Speaker 4>hm.</v>

3502
01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:03.630
<v Speaker 2>I write is trained to,</v>

3503
01:50:03.631 --> 01:50:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I fall off or toe comes off the track or to comes to a stop,</v>

3504
01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:09.420
<v Speaker 2>but it is going to come to a stop.</v>

3505
01:50:10.050 --> 01:50:11.940
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying everyone can have that confidence.</v>

3506
01:50:11.941 --> 01:50:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Everyone can have that belief.</v>

3507
01:50:12.961 --> 01:50:13.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>

3508
01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:15.390
<v Speaker 2>but you have to get it somewhere.</v>

3509
01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Sometime he didn't believe that the train was really going on here.</v>

3510
01:50:19.230 --> 01:50:22.980
<v Speaker 2>He believed that it was just going to go to a place where it was going to be</v>

3511
01:50:22.981 --> 01:50:27.210
<v Speaker 2>better than where he was and that that he'll ride it as long,</v>

3512
01:50:27.211 --> 01:50:27.600
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

3513
01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:30.070
<v Speaker 2>he's not committed to staying on it.</v>

3514
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:31.703
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

3515
01:50:31.890 --> 01:50:32.191
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3516
01:50:32.191 --> 01:50:32.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3517
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:34.740
<v Speaker 2>when it turns come up and,</v>

3518
01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.810
<v Speaker 2>and it gets a little fast,</v>

3519
01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:39.660
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't believe that he's really going to get there.</v>

3520
01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:41.640
<v Speaker 2>He believes that we're not first turn,</v>

3521
01:50:41.641 --> 01:50:42.391
<v Speaker 2>second turn,</v>

3522
01:50:42.391 --> 01:50:43.224
<v Speaker 2>third turn,</v>

3523
01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:46.410
<v Speaker 2>whatever on a rails coms that that's going to be it,</v>

3524
01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:47.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be,</v>

3525
01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:50.430
<v Speaker 2>it took a better place than he was at it earned him some money.</v>

3526
01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:52.410
<v Speaker 2>It got him some things and,</v>

3527
01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:53.310
<v Speaker 2>and it was good,</v>

3528
01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.020
<v Speaker 2>but he never really,</v>

3529
01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:56.370
<v Speaker 2>there's that word committed,</v>

3530
01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.710
<v Speaker 2>but he never really believed.</v>

3531
01:50:59.430 --> 01:51:00.630
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people don't.</v>

3532
01:51:00.631 --> 01:51:02.160
<v Speaker 2>They find their way along the way,</v>

3533
01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.760
<v Speaker 2>but he never believed that what he told to people around them that he was going</v>

3534
01:51:09.991 --> 01:51:10.824
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

3535
01:51:10.890 --> 01:51:15.030
<v Speaker 2>he never believed that his personality was too good.</v>

3536
01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:17.070
<v Speaker 2>His personality was too sharp.</v>

3537
01:51:17.550 --> 01:51:18.240
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3538
01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:18.960
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3539
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:23.250
<v Speaker 2>he could say all the right things and became easier to say the right things tend</v>

3540
01:51:23.251 --> 01:51:24.570
<v Speaker 2>to believe the right thing.</v>

3541
01:51:24.571 --> 01:51:25.404
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

3542
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:26.320
<v Speaker 1>It does make sense.</v>

3543
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:31.210
<v Speaker 1>This uncompromising psychology of combat sports is uncompromising philosophy.</v>

3544
01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Is this something that you got from costs as is something that you inherently</v>

3545
01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:38.920
<v Speaker 1>understood from working closely with these guys and taking them to these smokers</v>

3546
01:51:38.921 --> 01:51:39.940
<v Speaker 1>in the South Bronx?</v>

3547
01:51:40.170 --> 01:51:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Where does this come from?</v>

3548
01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Just raw honesty.</v>

3549
01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:45.453
<v Speaker 1>Seen it all.</v>

3550
01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

3551
01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:47.381
<v Speaker 2>the calm,</v>

3552
01:51:47.381 --> 01:51:48.214
<v Speaker 2>the form,</v>

3553
01:51:48.250 --> 01:51:48.581
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3554
01:51:48.581 --> 01:51:49.990
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be Corny,</v>

3555
01:51:49.991 --> 01:51:52.210
<v Speaker 2>but it comes from living a certain way.</v>

3556
01:51:52.211 --> 01:51:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Life was seeing things traveling to thing as part of it definitely,</v>

3557
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

3558
01:51:59.830 --> 01:52:01.120
<v Speaker 2>the articulation of it,</v>

3559
01:52:02.970 --> 01:52:04.530
<v Speaker 2>the blueprint or map of it,</v>

3560
01:52:04.531 --> 01:52:05.390
<v Speaker 2>the seeing of it,</v>

3561
01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:09.060
<v Speaker 2>the visualization of it on paper comes from costs.</v>

3562
01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:10.951
<v Speaker 2>He was a genius.</v>

3563
01:52:10.951 --> 01:52:12.060
<v Speaker 2>He was devastated world.</v>

3564
01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:13.231
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3565
01:52:13.231 --> 01:52:14.310
<v Speaker 2>the theory of it,</v>

3566
01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:15.420
<v Speaker 2>that's the better way.</v>

3567
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:19.560
<v Speaker 2>The theory of it comes from costs to living.</v>

3568
01:52:19.561 --> 01:52:21.180
<v Speaker 2>The doing of it comes from my father.</v>

3569
01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:26.610
<v Speaker 2>I had a father that most parks and people don't come from,</v>

3570
01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.160
<v Speaker 2>although polarity,</v>

3571
01:52:28.230 --> 01:52:29.190
<v Speaker 2>great Mexican fighter,</v>

3572
01:52:29.191 --> 01:52:31.920
<v Speaker 2>but he came from something like Davis who's,</v>

3573
01:52:32.190 --> 01:52:33.540
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to be a lawyer actually.</v>

3574
01:52:33.541 --> 01:52:34.081
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

3575
01:52:34.081 --> 01:52:34.980
<v Speaker 2>and you'd think Mexico,</v>

3576
01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:36.240
<v Speaker 2>you'd think why he came from the,</v>

3577
01:52:36.570 --> 01:52:36.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3578
01:52:36.841 --> 01:52:37.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3579
01:52:37.110 --> 01:52:37.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3580
01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.300
<v Speaker 2>the dirt floors and stuff,</v>

3581
01:52:39.301 --> 01:52:41.250
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of guys come from and you know,</v>

3582
01:52:41.251 --> 01:52:43.560
<v Speaker 2>they pull themselves out and that's part of the,</v>

3583
01:52:43.650 --> 01:52:45.000
<v Speaker 2>obviously the motivation.</v>

3584
01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.213
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

3585
01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:50.810
<v Speaker 6>my father was a doctor,</v>

3586
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:52.850
<v Speaker 6>it was a GP practice,</v>

3587
01:52:52.851 --> 01:52:57.430
<v Speaker 6>55 years stand out in New York again from the Bronx Santa.</v>

3588
01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:00.800
<v Speaker 6>He found the two hospitals.</v>

3589
01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:03.980
<v Speaker 6>He built a house for 22 beds in,</v>

3590
01:53:03.981 --> 01:53:05.270
<v Speaker 6>it was called sunny side some,</v>

3591
01:53:05.271 --> 01:53:07.880
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if that stuff even existed in Google back then,</v>

3592
01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:08.720
<v Speaker 6>but anyway,</v>

3593
01:53:08.721 --> 01:53:12.890
<v Speaker 6>with Sunnyside hospital and he built it so that</v>

3594
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.890
<v Speaker 6>all people,</v>

3595
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:17.040
<v Speaker 6>I listen,</v>

3596
01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:17.801
<v Speaker 6>whether he builds a,</v>

3597
01:53:17.801 --> 01:53:18.890
<v Speaker 6>so poor people,</v>

3598
01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:19.781
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

3599
01:53:19.781 --> 01:53:21.080
<v Speaker 6>he grew up very poor.</v>

3600
01:53:22.610 --> 01:53:23.420
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3601
01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:24.253
<v Speaker 6>he just,</v>

3602
01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:25.860
<v Speaker 6>he was an that kind of allow his,</v>

3603
01:53:25.861 --> 01:53:27.230
<v Speaker 6>because he just,</v>

3604
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:33.250
<v Speaker 6>he built his hospital so that the less of people with less could get hospital</v>

3605
01:53:36.141 --> 01:53:38.660
<v Speaker 6>care because back in those days there were no h or moles.</v>

3606
01:53:38.661 --> 01:53:39.780
<v Speaker 6>There was no Obamacare.</v>

3607
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:40.663
<v Speaker 6>There was no,</v>

3608
01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:41.001
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3609
01:53:41.001 --> 01:53:41.870
<v Speaker 6>whether you think it's good,</v>

3610
01:53:41.871 --> 01:53:42.381
<v Speaker 6>it's bad,</v>

3611
01:53:42.381 --> 01:53:42.621
<v Speaker 6>it's there,</v>

3612
01:53:42.621 --> 01:53:43.281
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't matter.</v>

3613
01:53:43.281 --> 01:53:44.150
<v Speaker 6>There was nothing.</v>

3614
01:53:44.690 --> 01:53:45.800
<v Speaker 6>He wound up in a clinic.</v>

3615
01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:46.780
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you got all,</v>

3616
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:51.200
<v Speaker 6>unless she had a doctor that took care of me and he was,</v>

3617
01:53:51.201 --> 01:53:52.160
<v Speaker 6>and who are the doctors?</v>

3618
01:53:52.161 --> 01:53:53.210
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't the only one,</v>

3619
01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:56.090
<v Speaker 6>but he was the only one I knew.</v>

3620
01:53:57.020 --> 01:54:02.020
<v Speaker 6>And he founded Sunnyside hospital for 22 beds in her last about 25 years until</v>

3621
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:04.760
<v Speaker 6>the Verrazano Bridge was built.</v>

3622
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:08.000
<v Speaker 6>The city put the highway in there.</v>

3623
01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:09.051
<v Speaker 6>It changed,</v>

3624
01:54:09.051 --> 01:54:09.590
<v Speaker 6>sat down,</v>

3625
01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:10.490
<v Speaker 6>obviously fit,</v>

3626
01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:13.490
<v Speaker 6>connected pro-Clinton stand out and you didn't have to take a ferry boat.</v>

3627
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:15.980
<v Speaker 6>And He,</v>

3628
01:54:15.981 --> 01:54:16.814
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3629
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:22.870
<v Speaker 6>the city border farmer and then he went and found a doctor's hospital with 60</v>

3630
01:54:23.511 --> 01:54:24.171
<v Speaker 6>other doctors.</v>

3631
01:54:24.171 --> 01:54:25.520
<v Speaker 6>But he was the original founder,</v>

3632
01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:27.890
<v Speaker 6>him and a guy named doctor Tim Pawn Sr.</v>

3633
01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:30.140
<v Speaker 6>He founded doctors,</v>

3634
01:54:30.141 --> 01:54:31.190
<v Speaker 6>which was a big hospital.</v>

3635
01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:31.581
<v Speaker 6>Like I said,</v>

3636
01:54:31.581 --> 01:54:32.181
<v Speaker 6>30 years,</v>

3637
01:54:32.181 --> 01:54:33.350
<v Speaker 6>there was a big hospital,</v>

3638
01:54:33.650 --> 01:54:38.650
<v Speaker 6>but so he was a guy that he didn't waste time telling me how to live and how all</v>

3639
01:54:42.621 --> 01:54:43.454
<v Speaker 6>that stuff.</v>

3640
01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:45.910
<v Speaker 6>The only thing I remember was you say some do.</v>

3641
01:54:45.911 --> 01:54:46.744
<v Speaker 6>It</v>

3642
01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:48.411
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

3643
01:54:48.411 --> 01:54:49.244
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3644
01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:52.220
<v Speaker 6>and then I watched him as a kid.</v>

3645
01:54:52.221 --> 01:54:53.090
<v Speaker 6>He was my hero.</v>

3646
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:54.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean I liked Mickey Mann.</v>

3647
01:54:54.981 --> 01:54:55.121
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>

3648
01:54:55.121 --> 01:54:56.500
<v Speaker 6>And I liked Joe is,</v>

3649
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.841
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3650
01:54:56.841 --> 01:55:00.200
<v Speaker 6>all those things and it's like any other kid.</v>

3651
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:02.200
<v Speaker 6>But if I had a hero,</v>

3652
01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:03.650
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know what a hero was.</v>

3653
01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:05.240
<v Speaker 6>Am I going to make believe I knew,</v>

3654
01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.490
<v Speaker 6>but I know now what it's supposed to mean.</v>

3655
01:55:07.491 --> 01:55:08.324
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3656
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:13.310
<v Speaker 6>So he was my hero and I just,</v>

3657
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:15.770
<v Speaker 6>I watched him,</v>

3658
01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:17.901
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3659
01:55:17.901 --> 01:55:21.620
<v Speaker 6>when I went in his room one time,</v>

3660
01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:24.620
<v Speaker 6>when he graduated Nyu,</v>

3661
01:55:24.621 --> 01:55:25.401
<v Speaker 6>they didn't have money,</v>

3662
01:55:25.401 --> 01:55:26.570
<v Speaker 6>so he had to get scholarship.</v>

3663
01:55:26.571 --> 01:55:27.860
<v Speaker 6>He had to get help from different teams,</v>

3664
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:29.030
<v Speaker 6>whatever they had to do.</v>

3665
01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:31.160
<v Speaker 6>But he got,</v>

3666
01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:33.350
<v Speaker 6>he went to Nyu medical school,</v>

3667
01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:34.580
<v Speaker 6>Nyu Undergrad,</v>

3668
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:36.830
<v Speaker 6>and then he interned at Bellevue,</v>

3669
01:55:36.831 --> 01:55:37.664
<v Speaker 6>which that's,</v>

3670
01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:39.170
<v Speaker 6>he wasn't a big talker,</v>

3671
01:55:39.171 --> 01:55:40.004
<v Speaker 6>but he told me,</v>

3672
01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:42.530
<v Speaker 6>he did tell me when you graduated Bellevue,</v>

3673
01:55:42.531 --> 01:55:43.530
<v Speaker 6>you ready for anything?</v>

3674
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:45.540
<v Speaker 6>So of later in my life,</v>

3675
01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:47.700
<v Speaker 6>I took that as the South Bronx.</v>

3676
01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:50.700
<v Speaker 6>You graduated to South Bronx to smoke smokers.</v>

3677
01:55:50.701 --> 01:55:51.690
<v Speaker 6>You were very funny thing.</v>

3678
01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:54.120
<v Speaker 6>You learned that you're ready for anything.</v>

3679
01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.140
<v Speaker 6>You learn how to match,</v>

3680
01:55:55.141 --> 01:55:55.974
<v Speaker 6>make you ready.</v>

3681
01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:58.290
<v Speaker 6>You'll learn how to be a trainee that you're ready fairy thing.</v>

3682
01:55:58.680 --> 01:55:59.760
<v Speaker 6>So he,</v>

3683
01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:01.881
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3684
01:56:01.881 --> 01:56:02.170
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3685
01:56:02.170 --> 01:56:03.003
<v Speaker 6>he came,</v>

3686
01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:04.653
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3687
01:56:04.670 --> 01:56:06.560
<v Speaker 6>I did knock on his door when he was,</v>

3688
01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:09.200
<v Speaker 6>what it was in turning of Bellevue of young guy.</v>

3689
01:56:09.201 --> 01:56:10.034
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3690
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:15.170
<v Speaker 6>apparently he saved some obese woman's life that had a heart attack in a street.</v>

3691
01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:16.761
<v Speaker 6>He dragged,</v>

3692
01:56:16.761 --> 01:56:17.810
<v Speaker 6>dragged her off the street,</v>

3693
01:56:17.811 --> 01:56:18.261
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

3694
01:56:18.261 --> 01:56:18.830
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3695
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:20.030
<v Speaker 6>you never get the whole story,</v>

3696
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:23.780
<v Speaker 6>but he saved a life and</v>

3697
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.090
<v Speaker 6>he developed a hernia at a grown to a double hernia.</v>

3698
01:56:29.091 --> 01:56:30.500
<v Speaker 6>And my father was the kind of guy,</v>

3699
01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:33.200
<v Speaker 6>he didn't let anything interfere with his patients,</v>

3700
01:56:33.201 --> 01:56:34.034
<v Speaker 6>his work,</v>

3701
01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.390
<v Speaker 6>he didn't take time to get it.</v>

3702
01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:38.000
<v Speaker 6>So he carried it for 30 years and he finally got it,</v>

3703
01:56:38.210 --> 01:56:38.870
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3704
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:40.490
<v Speaker 6>and so it become a double hernia.</v>

3705
01:56:40.610 --> 01:56:41.720
<v Speaker 6>I know hernia is now,</v>

3706
01:56:41.721 --> 01:56:43.790
<v Speaker 6>they do the Mesh and they two ladies in there.</v>

3707
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:46.250
<v Speaker 6>But in those days it was a more serious thing.</v>

3708
01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:48.110
<v Speaker 6>He was evasive surgery.</v>

3709
01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:49.363
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3710
01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:50.450
<v Speaker 6>it was different.</v>

3711
01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:52.250
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

3712
01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:53.660
<v Speaker 6>and it was painful apparently.</v>

3713
01:56:55.130 --> 01:56:55.910
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3714
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:56.743
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3715
01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:59.510
<v Speaker 6>I did knock on a door as a young kid,</v>

3716
01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:00.673
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3717
01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:01.510
<v Speaker 6>very young,</v>

3718
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:02.420
<v Speaker 6>but I still remember,</v>

3719
01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:08.200
<v Speaker 6>and there was a mirror here and he was over there near his bed when the mirror</v>

3720
01:57:08.871 --> 01:57:09.470
<v Speaker 6>was here.</v>

3721
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:13.040
<v Speaker 6>So I opened the door and in the huck should have knocked obviously.</v>

3722
01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:14.293
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3723
01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:16.730
<v Speaker 6>I saw he was bent over in pain.</v>

3724
01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:17.211
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3725
01:57:17.211 --> 01:57:19.610
<v Speaker 6>I could recognize and he was wearing the thing.</v>

3726
01:57:19.611 --> 01:57:20.520
<v Speaker 6>I had no idea.</v>

3727
01:57:20.521 --> 01:57:21.354
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>

3728
01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:23.840
<v Speaker 6>I know what the figures that,</v>

3729
01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.300
<v Speaker 6>but it was probably not as,</v>

3730
01:57:26.301 --> 01:57:29.930
<v Speaker 6>you probably need you again to give me the proper pronounciation.</v>

3731
01:57:29.931 --> 01:57:30.764
<v Speaker 6>Thank you for,</v>

01:58:20.490 --> 01:58:22.730
<v Speaker 6>he took the patients that other doctors didn't take,</v>

<v Speaker 6>whatever it was,</v>

3765
01:58:25.281 --> 01:58:27.920
<v Speaker 6>whatever the right one is basically welfare.</v>

3766
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:31.730
<v Speaker 6>He took all of them and you know,</v>

3767
01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:33.290
<v Speaker 6>he made the,</v>

3768
01:58:34.130 --> 01:58:35.960
<v Speaker 6>he had the biggest practice on Stan arm,</v>

3769
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:37.310
<v Speaker 6>maybe the biggest in New York.</v>

3770
01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:38.593
<v Speaker 6>So all the,</v>

3771
01:58:38.630 --> 01:58:39.463
<v Speaker 6>all the,</v>

3772
01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.730
<v Speaker 6>all the drug salesman,</v>

3773
01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:44.610
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3774
01:58:44.610 --> 01:58:46.750
<v Speaker 6>they all migrated to his place.</v>

3775
01:58:46.990 --> 01:58:51.130
<v Speaker 6>You want to get his account Dot Dallas to sell the new stuff,</v>

3776
01:58:51.131 --> 01:58:51.941
<v Speaker 6>to sell the drugs,</v>

3777
01:58:51.941 --> 01:58:52.810
<v Speaker 6>to sell the pills.</v>

3778
01:58:53.710 --> 01:58:56.170
<v Speaker 6>And he used them.</v>

3779
01:58:56.590 --> 01:58:57.640
<v Speaker 6>He didn't hide it,</v>

3780
01:58:58.810 --> 01:58:59.643
<v Speaker 6>but he made them,</v>

3781
01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:03.760
<v Speaker 6>he made them give them huge amount of samples.</v>

3782
01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:04.653
<v Speaker 6>You know why?</v>

3783
01:59:05.050 --> 01:59:08.290
<v Speaker 6>Because his patients couldn't afford to fill the prescriptions.</v>

3784
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:10.300
<v Speaker 6>So we would give him the free samples.</v>

3785
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:14.400
<v Speaker 6>I used to always wonder what the freak all,</v>

3786
01:59:14.401 --> 01:59:14.731
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

3787
01:59:14.731 --> 01:59:16.400
<v Speaker 6>I know how to open up a closet.</v>

3788
01:59:16.401 --> 01:59:17.990
<v Speaker 6>There was like things falling on you,</v>

3789
01:59:17.991 --> 01:59:18.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3790
01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:21.510
<v Speaker 6>like pills and stuff as like what is hot and,</v>

3791
01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:24.920
<v Speaker 6>but it was so he could give it to them.</v>

3792
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:27.290
<v Speaker 6>So they didn't have to fill a prescription because they didn't.</v>

3793
01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:27.770
<v Speaker 6>There was,</v>

3794
01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:28.131
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

3795
01:59:28.131 --> 01:59:31.490
<v Speaker 6>there was none of those things that pay for your prescriptions that they do</v>

3796
01:59:31.491 --> 01:59:32.324
<v Speaker 6>today.</v>

3797
01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:33.890
<v Speaker 6>And they couldn't afford it.</v>

3798
01:59:34.190 --> 01:59:35.600
<v Speaker 6>They couldn't afford to go to him,</v>

3799
01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:37.820
<v Speaker 6>but he charged them $3,</v>

3800
01:59:37.850 --> 01:59:38.720
<v Speaker 6>$5,</v>

3801
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:40.460
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

3802
01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:42.200
<v Speaker 6>whatever it was that they could afford.</v>

3803
01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:43.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3804
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:44.830
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

3805
01:59:44.831 --> 01:59:45.670
<v Speaker 6>he made money.</v>

3806
01:59:45.970 --> 01:59:46.301
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3807
01:59:46.301 --> 01:59:47.200
<v Speaker 6>he was a doctor,</v>

3808
01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:49.760
<v Speaker 6>but he didn't make the money that other doctors will make it.</v>

3809
01:59:50.710 --> 01:59:52.120
<v Speaker 6>But he was a real,</v>

3810
01:59:52.121 --> 01:59:54.190
<v Speaker 6>docked a right for me at least.</v>

3811
01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:55.533
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3812
01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:57.070
<v Speaker 6>but more importantly,</v>

3813
01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:59.470
<v Speaker 6>he didn't talk about it.</v>

3814
01:59:59.471 --> 02:00:00.304
<v Speaker 6>He did it.</v>

3815
02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:01.953
<v Speaker 6>And he,</v>

3816
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:03.460
<v Speaker 6>every day he was in pain.</v>

3817
02:00:03.850 --> 02:00:04.683
<v Speaker 6>Later on,</v>

3818
02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:05.560
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3819
02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:06.400
<v Speaker 6>I was a little older,</v>

3820
02:00:06.401 --> 02:00:07.900
<v Speaker 6>but I was still young teenager.</v>

3821
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.060
<v Speaker 6>I saw him put a white pill onto his tongue.</v>

3822
02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:11.530
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know what the freak that was.</v>

3823
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:15.570
<v Speaker 6>I later on I found out it was nitrile that has hardwoods,</v>

3824
02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:16.660
<v Speaker 6>puts skipped beats,</v>

3825
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:19.810
<v Speaker 6>but he still didn't say a word.</v>

3826
02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:22.360
<v Speaker 6>Didn't talk about it in all.</v>

3827
02:00:22.630 --> 02:00:24.970
<v Speaker 6>If he didn't have his son who thought it was his hero,</v>

3828
02:00:24.971 --> 02:00:25.804
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3829
02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:28.540
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't have known because I looked at everything he did</v>

3830
02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:31.300
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

3831
02:00:31.301 --> 02:00:32.134
<v Speaker 6>he um,</v>

3832
02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:34.240
<v Speaker 6>he did house calls.</v>

3833
02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:35.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3834
02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:35.651
<v Speaker 6>he did.</v>

3835
02:00:35.651 --> 02:00:36.351
<v Speaker 6>House caused,</v>

3836
02:00:36.351 --> 02:00:37.510
<v Speaker 6>who is 80 years old,</v>

3837
02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:39.550
<v Speaker 6>charging $5,</v>

3838
02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:40.420
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3839
02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:41.253
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>

3840
02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:44.860
<v Speaker 6>He had patients that could not get to an emergency role.</v>

3841
02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:46.960
<v Speaker 6>They didn't have the ability to get there.</v>

3842
02:00:46.961 --> 02:00:47.890
<v Speaker 6>They didn't have a car.</v>

3843
02:00:48.490 --> 02:00:49.870
<v Speaker 6>They wouldn't shape where they couldn't get,</v>

3844
02:00:49.871 --> 02:00:50.830
<v Speaker 6>they couldn't take a bus,</v>

3845
02:00:50.831 --> 02:00:51.664
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3846
02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:55.090
<v Speaker 6>But so he did house calls and a patients when he died,</v>

3847
02:00:55.091 --> 02:00:55.924
<v Speaker 6>they all said,</v>

3848
02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:56.561

3850
02:00:58.631 --> 02:00:59.530
<v Speaker 6>But he got there.</v>

3851
02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:01.631
<v Speaker 6>That was the thing.</v>

3852
02:01:01.631 --> 02:01:02.530
<v Speaker 6>He always got there.</v>

3853
02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:04.300
<v Speaker 6>He always delivered.</v>

3854
02:01:05.650 --> 02:01:07.900
<v Speaker 6>And with all those things that I knew was,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3859
02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:11.510
<v Speaker 6>He never used it.</v>

3860
02:01:11.511 --> 02:01:12.500
<v Speaker 6>Made an excuse.</v>

3861
02:01:14.210 --> 02:01:15.710
<v Speaker 6>And he was a fighter,</v>

3862
02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:18.751
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3863

02:01:18.961 --> 02:01:19.771
<v Speaker 6>in their own way.</v>

3865
02:01:19.771 --> 02:01:20.604
<v Speaker 6>He was to,</v>

3866

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3867
02:01:22.230 --> 02:01:26.130
<v Speaker 6>he was the best fighter of his soul and he didn't talk about it.</v>

3868
02:01:26.131 --> 02:01:27.330
<v Speaker 6>He didn't articulate it,</v>

3869
02:01:28.170 --> 02:01:28.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3870
02:01:28.591 --> 02:01:30.330
<v Speaker 6>he didn't wax poetic about it,</v>

3871
02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:32.250
<v Speaker 6>like cause state and cause it was a great man,</v>

3872
02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:36.660
<v Speaker 6>but he did it that he did right in front of my face.</v>

3873
02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.113
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3874
02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:43.170
<v Speaker 6>and it stayed with me.</v>

3875
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:44.790
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3876
02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:46.170
<v Speaker 6>I didn't understand a lot of it too.</v>

3877
02:01:46.171 --> 02:01:47.004
<v Speaker 6>I got older</v>

3878
02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:51.050
<v Speaker 6>but then suddenly I understood all of it.</v>

3879
02:01:52.730 --> 02:01:53.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3880
02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:54.143
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3881
02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:56.460
<v Speaker 6>so if somebody says,</v>

3882
02:01:56.461 --> 02:01:57.294
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

3883
02:01:58.680 --> 02:01:59.071
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3884
02:01:59.071 --> 02:02:00.300
<v Speaker 6>I can't do this because,</v>

3885
02:02:00.301 --> 02:02:01.134
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3886
02:02:01.290 --> 02:02:02.570
<v Speaker 6>last night my girlfriend,</v>

3887
02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:05.030
<v Speaker 6>my wife yelled at me and she caught me with a girl.</v>

3888
02:02:05.090 --> 02:02:05.923
<v Speaker 6>She did.</v>

3889
02:02:05.970 --> 02:02:06.331
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3890
02:02:06.331 --> 02:02:07.164
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to hear it.</v>

3891
02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.033
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to eat,</v>

3892
02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:13.020
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to hear it.</v>

3893
02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:15.121
<v Speaker 6>And listen,</v>

3894
02:02:15.121 --> 02:02:16.170
<v Speaker 6>it was of course to me too,</v>

3895
02:02:16.171 --> 02:02:19.080
<v Speaker 6>in some ways it's not perfect because when my father died,</v>

3896
02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:20.161
<v Speaker 6>I went to the,</v>

3897
02:02:20.161 --> 02:02:24.060
<v Speaker 6>I went to the funeral and then I went to the gym and I didn't tell nobody.</v>

3898
02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:25.021
<v Speaker 6>And listen,</v>

3899
02:02:25.021 --> 02:02:25.854
<v Speaker 6>I probably shouldn't.</v>

3900
02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:31.320
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people would probably say he can't live your life to way by what people</v>

3901
02:02:31.321 --> 02:02:31.561
<v Speaker 6>say.</v>

3902
02:02:31.561 --> 02:02:32.394
<v Speaker 6>I get it,</v>

3903
02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.050
<v Speaker 6>but I'm just saying I'm aware of it.</v>

3904
02:02:34.051 --> 02:02:34.860
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

3905
02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:36.720
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people who say you shouldn't have went to the gym.</v>

3906
02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.190
<v Speaker 6>My father,</v>

3907
02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:41.150
<v Speaker 6>we lost a kid.</v>

3908
02:02:41.151 --> 02:02:45.080
<v Speaker 6>He was five years old and I wasn't going to say this because I don't know how</v>

3909
02:02:45.081 --> 02:02:45.914
<v Speaker 6>some people say,</v>

3910
02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:47.240
<v Speaker 6>but if it is,</v>

3911
02:02:47.241 --> 02:02:47.631
<v Speaker 6>it is.</v>

3912
02:02:47.631 --> 02:02:48.464
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3913
02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:50.810
<v Speaker 6>So you could take it the way you want to take it.</v>

3914
02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 6>I know the kind of man he was,</v>

3915
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:54.703
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

3916
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:57.050
<v Speaker 6>you talked about commitment,</v>

3917
02:02:57.051 --> 02:02:57.840
<v Speaker 6>absolute limits.</v>

3918
02:02:57.840 --> 02:02:59.120
<v Speaker 6>You'd talked about certain things,</v>

3919
02:02:59.121 --> 02:02:59.954
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3920
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:02.540
<v Speaker 6>Maybe just to explain some of it.</v>

3921
02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:04.040
<v Speaker 6>We had little Todd,</v>

3922
02:03:04.041 --> 02:03:04.874
<v Speaker 6>he was all product.</v>

3923
02:03:05.410 --> 02:03:07.370
<v Speaker 6>He was born with problems.</v>

3924
02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:08.233
<v Speaker 6>Who's retarded?</v>

3925
02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:09.830
<v Speaker 6>You don't use that word anymore.</v>

3926
02:03:09.831 --> 02:03:11.900
<v Speaker 6>But in those days it was okay to use that word.</v>

3927
02:03:11.901 --> 02:03:12.620
<v Speaker 6>That's what he was.</v>

3928
02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:13.453
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3929
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:15.560
<v Speaker 6>Now of course you say that it was impaired,</v>

3930
02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:16.910
<v Speaker 6>mentally impaired,</v>

3931
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.863
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3932
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:18.470
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3933
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:19.460
<v Speaker 6>He's a beautiful kid.</v>

3934
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:20.323
<v Speaker 6>I remember him.</v>

3935
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:23.060
<v Speaker 6>I was older,</v>

3936
02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:23.893
<v Speaker 6>I was the oldest.</v>

3937
02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.700
<v Speaker 6>He was very loving.</v>

3938
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:28.940
<v Speaker 6>I remember used to jump into my arms when I come home.</v>

3939
02:03:28.941 --> 02:03:33.320
<v Speaker 6>So I know he was very trusting because I would walk up the steps and he would</v>

3940
02:03:33.321 --> 02:03:35.210
<v Speaker 6>jump from the steps if I didn't catch them,</v>

3941
02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:36.440
<v Speaker 6>obviously would have fell.</v>

3942
02:03:36.650 --> 02:03:38.090
<v Speaker 6>So it was part of his condition,</v>

3943
02:03:38.091 --> 02:03:40.970
<v Speaker 6>but it was part of his lovingness and has his trust.</v>

3944
02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:44.730
<v Speaker 6>So when he was five years old,</v>

3945
02:03:44.731 --> 02:03:45.690
<v Speaker 6>he had to get surgery.</v>

3946
02:03:45.691 --> 02:03:46.360
<v Speaker 6>He had a problem,</v>

3947
02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:47.010
<v Speaker 6>was hot,</v>

3948
02:03:47.010 --> 02:03:47.970
<v Speaker 6>it was open heart surgery,</v>

3949
02:03:47.971 --> 02:03:51.060
<v Speaker 6>open heart surgery is all different story back then.</v>

3950
02:03:51.061 --> 02:03:51.894
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3951
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:53.580
<v Speaker 6>And where did he get out of probation?</v>

3952
02:03:53.581 --> 02:03:53.761
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3953
02:03:53.761 --> 02:03:54.240
<v Speaker 6>he did.</v>

3954
02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:55.380
<v Speaker 6>And my father's hospital,</v>

3955
02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:57.450
<v Speaker 6>but father did not perform the surgery.</v>

3956
02:03:57.451 --> 02:03:59.550
<v Speaker 6>Of course you're not going to do that.</v>

3957
02:03:59.850 --> 02:04:00.683
<v Speaker 6>But it was there.</v>

3958
02:04:01.150 --> 02:04:02.430
<v Speaker 6>There was a few surgeons,</v>

3959
02:04:02.431 --> 02:04:03.360
<v Speaker 6>it might've been five,</v>

3960
02:04:03.361 --> 02:04:04.194
<v Speaker 6>whatever it was.</v>

3961
02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:08.093
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3962
02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:12.760
<v Speaker 6>my mother was the opposite of him.</v>

3963
02:04:12.850 --> 02:04:15.220
<v Speaker 6>My father was a Hungarian Jewish background,</v>

3964
02:04:15.610 --> 02:04:16.170
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3965
02:04:16.170 --> 02:04:16.540
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3966
02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:16.711
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3967
02:04:16.711 --> 02:04:17.620
<v Speaker 6>he had no father.</v>

3968
02:04:17.621 --> 02:04:18.460
<v Speaker 6>He died young.</v>

3969
02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:19.261
<v Speaker 6>His mother,</v>

3970
02:04:19.261 --> 02:04:20.200
<v Speaker 6>they were very poor.</v>

3971
02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:21.940
<v Speaker 6>My mother grew up poor too.</v>

3972
02:04:21.941 --> 02:04:22.240
<v Speaker 6>Shoes,</v>

3973
02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:22.930
<v Speaker 6>Irish,</v>

3974
02:04:22.930 --> 02:04:23.291
<v Speaker 6>Irish,</v>

3975
02:04:23.291 --> 02:04:24.124
<v Speaker 6>Catholic,</v>

02:04:25.210 --> 02:04:26.050
<v Speaker 6>different makes.</v>

3977
02:04:26.410 --> 02:04:28.690
<v Speaker 6>And my father didn't have time for religion.</v>

3978
02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:30.430
<v Speaker 6>My time for that time for living.</v>

3979
02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:32.980
<v Speaker 6>And for healing people.</v>

3980
02:04:33.670 --> 02:04:35.770
<v Speaker 6>So he let us be brought up Catholic.</v>

3981
02:04:35.850 --> 02:04:36.790
<v Speaker 6>That was up to my mother</v>

3982
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:39.143
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

3983

<v Speaker 6>They would the opposites.</v>

3988
02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:46.710
<v Speaker 6>When mother was beautiful,</v>

3989
02:04:46.711 --> 02:04:47.481
<v Speaker 6>she was Ms. Dot.</v>

3990
02:04:47.481 --> 02:04:48.900
<v Speaker 6>Nowlin uh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>she,</v>

3997
02:04:59.131 --> 02:05:02.040
<v Speaker 6>she did not allow her from winning.</v>

3998
02:05:02.041 --> 02:05:02.500
<v Speaker 6>Ms. Dot.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Now that's for those people told them no.</v>

4023
02:05:30.330 --> 02:05:35.330
<v Speaker 6>So she was beautiful and she had a great personality and she's,</v>

4024
02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:37.560
<v Speaker 6>she love social life.</v>

4025
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:42.540
<v Speaker 6>And two is the antithesis of my father and a lot of ways,</v>

4026
02:05:42.541 --> 02:05:47.370
<v Speaker 6>and I guess opposites attract and if you want to make a movie out of it,</v>

4027
02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:48.660
<v Speaker 6>she was sick,</v>

4028
02:05:52.650 --> 02:05:53.700
<v Speaker 6>she wasn't getting better.</v>

4029
02:05:54.090 --> 02:05:55.890
<v Speaker 6>And my father was in the hospital,</v>

4030
02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:57.480
<v Speaker 6>he was in,</v>

4031
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:59.700
<v Speaker 6>I guess his patient was in the tool room,</v>

4032
02:06:00.150 --> 02:06:00.691
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

4033
02:06:00.691 --> 02:06:01.270
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

4034
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:05.460
<v Speaker 6>Then he became a doctor and a help to get better.</v>

4035
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:08.430
<v Speaker 6>She had a form of hepatitis,</v>

4036
02:06:09.210 --> 02:06:10.043
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4037
02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:14.010
<v Speaker 6>back in the days when you didn't get it from needles only he could get it from</v>

4038
02:06:14.011 --> 02:06:15.420
<v Speaker 6>eating a bad clam,</v>

4039
02:06:16.530 --> 02:06:17.363
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

4040
02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:18.990
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it was c,</v>

4041
02:06:18.991 --> 02:06:19.830
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is,</v>

4042
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:22.380
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to tell you because I don't know for sure,</v>

4043
02:06:22.381 --> 02:06:23.214
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

4044
02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:27.330
<v Speaker 6>and she was very sick and anyway,</v>

4045
02:06:27.331 --> 02:06:27.780
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

4046
02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:30.060
<v Speaker 6>he took care of her and they got married.</v>

4047
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:32.880
<v Speaker 6>They fell in love and in all of that stuff.</v>

4048
02:06:34.650 --> 02:06:35.483
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4049
02:06:36.090 --> 02:06:36.923
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4050
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.761
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

4051
02:06:38.761 --> 02:06:39.594
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4052
02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:41.490
<v Speaker 6>my father was a</v>

4053
02:06:42.890 --> 02:06:43.630
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

4054
02:06:43.630 --> 02:06:44.141
<v Speaker 6>Like I said,</v>

4055
02:06:44.141 --> 02:06:45.070
<v Speaker 6>my father was,</v>

4056
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:46.663
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

4057
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:48.640
<v Speaker 6>he was dedicated to,</v>

4058
02:06:48.641 --> 02:06:49.474
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4059
02:06:49.570 --> 02:06:50.403
<v Speaker 6>to that life.</v>

4060
02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:51.753
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4061
02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:54.220
<v Speaker 6>but the thing that he did that I started to say,</v>

4062
02:06:55.390 --> 02:06:57.130
<v Speaker 6>and I don't want to give that background I guess,</v>

4063
02:06:57.131 --> 02:06:57.964
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

4064
02:07:00.730 --> 02:07:01.240
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

4065
02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:01.910
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

4066
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:03.620
<v Speaker 6>my mother was very emotional.</v>

4067
02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:04.820
<v Speaker 6>My father's a doctor.</v>

4068
02:07:04.821 --> 02:07:05.990
<v Speaker 6>He hid his emotions.</v>

4069
02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:07.530
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

4070
02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:09.570
<v Speaker 6>And when Todd one for surgery,</v>

4071
02:07:09.571 --> 02:07:11.070
<v Speaker 6>he died on the operating table.</v>

4072
02:07:12.210 --> 02:07:13.380
<v Speaker 6>He had told my mother,</v>

4073
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:15.120
<v Speaker 6>my father never lied.</v>

4074
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:16.880
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4075
02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.080
<v Speaker 6>he told her the risk.</v>

4076
02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:20.750
<v Speaker 6>But my mother want to believe what you want to believe.</v>

4077
02:07:21.050 --> 02:07:21.771
<v Speaker 6>My mother said,</v>

4078
02:07:21.771 --> 02:07:23.150
<v Speaker 6>you said it would be okay.</v>

4079
02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:26.010
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4080
02:07:26.010 --> 02:07:26.821
<v Speaker 6>he didn't say that,</v>

4081
02:07:26.821 --> 02:07:27.654
<v Speaker 6>but you know.</v>

4082
02:07:28.510 --> 02:07:29.940
<v Speaker 6>But of course my mother,</v>

4083
02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.620
<v Speaker 6>my father was high level to</v>

4084
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:34.343
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4085
02:07:34.770 --> 02:07:35.603
<v Speaker 6>made her better.</v>

4086
02:07:35.670 --> 02:07:36.880
<v Speaker 6>It can make you sound better.</v>

4087
02:07:38.170 --> 02:07:39.130
<v Speaker 6>So he died,</v>

4088
02:07:40.090 --> 02:07:41.200
<v Speaker 6>we all got split up.</v>

4089
02:07:43.090 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 6>I had to live with an uncle that was single and it was a very handsome guy.</v>

4090
02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:51.610
<v Speaker 6>So he had girlfriend coming in and out all the time and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

4093
02:07:52.841 --> 02:07:53.674

02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:57.910
<v Speaker 6>good looking guy and like to go out.</v>

4095
02:07:58.330 --> 02:08:00.490
<v Speaker 6>I'd wind up sitting in a bar waiting for them.</v>

4096
02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.740
<v Speaker 6>I get a lot of bags of potato chips,</v>

4097
02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:05.200
<v Speaker 6>a lot of cokes,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4099
02:08:06.371 --> 02:08:07.540
<v Speaker 6>he could finally come back.</v>

02:08:07.541 --> 02:08:08.800
<v Speaker 6>I have eight cokes in front of me,</v>

4101
02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:11.013
<v Speaker 6>maybe 10,</v>

4102
02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:13.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4103

02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:17.140
<v Speaker 6>we got split up from my mother was sleeping in a cemetery.</v>

4105
02:08:18.250 --> 02:08:19.210
<v Speaker 6>She had a nervous breakdown,</v>

4106
02:08:20.670 --> 02:08:21.341
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

4107
02:08:21.341 --> 02:08:22.390
<v Speaker 6>she got herself together.</v>

4108
02:08:22.391 --> 02:08:23.290
<v Speaker 6>She overcame it.</v>

4109
02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:24.761
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

4110
02:08:24.761 --> 02:08:25.594
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4111
02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:29.560
<v Speaker 6>she never forgave him.</v>

4112
02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:32.110
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4113
02:08:32.110 --> 02:08:32.650

02:08:32.650 --> 02:08:33.483
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>

4115
02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:35.231
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4116
02:08:35.231 --> 02:08:38.440
<v Speaker 6>she was Irish and then the easy thing is to Irish cars and all that stuff,</v>

4117
02:08:38.441 --> 02:08:39.101
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

4118
02:08:39.101 --> 02:08:39.934
<v Speaker 6>she trying.</v>

4119
02:08:41.890 --> 02:08:42.723
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

4120
02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:44.193
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

4121
02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:45.721
<v Speaker 6>She,</v>

4122
02:08:45.721 --> 02:08:46.554
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4123
02:08:47.310 --> 02:08:52.310
<v Speaker 6>she's a great woman but you don't see was tragically hard and you know,</v>

4124
02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.220
<v Speaker 6>everyone copes with things differently and she,</v>

4125
02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:57.073
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4126
02:08:57.630 --> 02:08:58.170
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

4127
02:08:58.170 --> 02:08:59.003
<v Speaker 6>it was difficult.</v>

4128
02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:01.280
<v Speaker 6>And that day with all of the,</v>

4129
02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:02.520
<v Speaker 6>what I just described,</v>

4130
02:09:02.521 --> 02:09:02.971
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>

4131
02:09:02.971 --> 02:09:04.140
<v Speaker 6>I'm always afraid to say it,</v>

4132
02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:07.020
<v Speaker 6>but you say it because it's part of it,</v>

4133
02:09:07.050 --> 02:09:07.883
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4134
02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:09.240
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it explains,</v>

4135
02:09:09.241 --> 02:09:09.690
<v Speaker 6>maybe,</v>

4136
02:09:09.690 --> 02:09:11.970
<v Speaker 6>maybe some people hold it against him when I say this,</v>

4137
02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:17.860
<v Speaker 6>but he got a phone call that day on his answer and surface.</v>

4138
02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:19.530
<v Speaker 6>You didn't have pages in those days.</v>

4139
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:21.120
<v Speaker 6>He had an answering service.</v>

4140
02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:26.310
<v Speaker 6>He told them to call them when he had request for house calls.</v>

4141
02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:28.530
<v Speaker 6>Two in the morning as a kid,</v>

4142
02:09:28.770 --> 02:09:30.270
<v Speaker 6>I used to hear the phone ring.</v>

4143
02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:31.460
<v Speaker 6>It was two in the morning.</v>

4144
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:33.300
<v Speaker 6>I started getting dressed.</v>

4145
02:09:33.301 --> 02:09:35.680
<v Speaker 6>I came out and I was on the stairs waiting for the golf.</v>

4146
02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:37.920
<v Speaker 6>He looked at me,</v>

4147
02:09:37.921 --> 02:09:38.101

4167
02:10:16.621 --> 02:10:17.430
<v Speaker 6>That is,</v>

4168
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:18.263
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4169
02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:20.153
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

4170
02:10:20.450 --> 02:10:21.680
<v Speaker 6>That his son got Barry.</v>

4171
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.541
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4172
02:10:23.541 --> 02:10:24.374
<v Speaker 6>that's tough.</v>

4173
02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:26.030
<v Speaker 6>But that was what,</v>

4174
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.301
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4175
02:10:26.301 --> 02:10:27.330
<v Speaker 6>that's what his,</v>

4176
02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:28.251
<v Speaker 6>that's what his,</v>

4177
02:10:28.251 --> 02:10:29.084
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4178
02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:32.990
<v Speaker 6>so when people tell me that they can't keep a commitment,</v>

4179
02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.153
<v Speaker 6>this happened,</v>

4180
02:10:35.150 --> 02:10:36.320
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't go with me.</v>

4181
02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:37.933
<v Speaker 6>That's all.</v>

4182
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:40.260
<v Speaker 6>And that day after I buried my father,</v>

4183
02:10:40.261 --> 02:10:41.180
<v Speaker 6>I went to the gym</v>

4184
02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:43.970
<v Speaker 6>and I trained Michael Moore</v>

4185
02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:47.300
<v Speaker 6>because I was,</v>

4186
02:10:47.301 --> 02:10:47.541
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4187
02:10:47.541 --> 02:10:48.560
<v Speaker 6>that's what I was doing.</v>

4188
02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:49.513
<v Speaker 6>That was my job,</v>

4189
02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:54.673
<v Speaker 6>character,</v>

4190
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.870
<v Speaker 6>real character.</v>

4191
02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:57.921
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4192
02:10:57.921 --> 02:10:59.060
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is it is,</v>

4193
02:10:59.061 --> 02:11:00.050
<v Speaker 6>but whatever it is,</v>

4194
02:11:00.051 --> 02:11:00.520
<v Speaker 6>that's true.</v>

4195
02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:00.860
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4196
02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:02.720
<v Speaker 6>call it whatever name,</v>

4197
02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:03.890
<v Speaker 6>whatever noise you want to make.</v>

4198
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:06.560
<v Speaker 6>There's not a lot of people like that.</v>

4199
02:11:07.130 --> 02:11:08.120
<v Speaker 6>That explains a lot.</v>

4200
02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:14.480
<v Speaker 6>Explains a lot about your unyielding</v>

4201
02:11:16.370 --> 02:11:19.280
<v Speaker 6>understanding and appreciation of real commitment.</v>

4202
02:11:22.810 --> 02:11:23.111
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4203
02:11:23.111 --> 02:11:23.530
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4204
02:11:23.530 --> 02:11:24.363
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's,</v>

4205
02:11:24.370 --> 02:11:24.790
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

4206
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:25.001
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4207
02:11:25.001 --> 02:11:25.834
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

4208
02:11:27.130 --> 02:11:27.491
<v Speaker 6>and it's,</v>

4209
02:11:27.491 --> 02:11:28.720
<v Speaker 6>we almost don't have a choice,</v>

4210
02:11:28.721 --> 02:11:28.961
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4211
02:11:28.961 --> 02:11:31.510
<v Speaker 6>because to not</v>

4212
02:11:33.130 --> 02:11:33.431
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

4213
02:11:33.431 --> 02:11:34.264
<v Speaker 6>you just do it.</v>

4214
02:11:34.570 --> 02:11:35.890
<v Speaker 6>But to not follow that,</v>

4215
02:11:40.170 --> 02:11:41.400
<v Speaker 6>in some ways it's,</v>

4216
02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:44.280
<v Speaker 6>it's like you're not honoring your father</v>

4217
02:11:46.050 --> 02:11:49.080
<v Speaker 6>because your father's leave you certain things,</v>

4218
02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:49.621
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4219
02:11:49.621 --> 02:11:50.454
<v Speaker 6>they leave you,</v>

4220
02:11:50.490 --> 02:11:51.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4221
02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:51.571
<v Speaker 6>something in the,</v>

4222
02:11:51.571 --> 02:11:54.690
<v Speaker 6>well maybe they'd leave your whatever.</v>

4223
02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:59.100
<v Speaker 6>They might leave your special trinket of something that he always remember a</v>

4224
02:11:59.101 --> 02:11:59.621
<v Speaker 6>car,</v>

4225
02:11:59.621 --> 02:12:00.450
<v Speaker 6>a little thing,</v>

4226
02:12:00.450 --> 02:12:01.283
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

4227
02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:03.840
<v Speaker 6>but they leave you something.</v>

4228
02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:06.210
<v Speaker 6>If you're fortunate enough to have a father,</v>

4229
02:12:07.650 --> 02:12:08.700
<v Speaker 6>I know not everyone is,</v>

4230
02:12:08.730 --> 02:12:09.563
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

4231
02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:12.180
<v Speaker 6>But when they leave you that</v>

4232
02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:14.633
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

4233
02:12:15.210 --> 02:12:16.043
<v Speaker 6>you got to,</v>

4234
02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:19.260
<v Speaker 6>you got to cherish it.</v>

4235
02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:22.253
<v Speaker 6>You should.</v>

4236
02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:23.790
<v Speaker 6>And that's what he left me.</v>

4237
02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:26.280
<v Speaker 6>So to be,</v>

4238
02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:31.880
<v Speaker 6>it's not that I'm a good guy or bad guy or great guy or less or anything.</v>

4239
02:12:31.891 --> 02:12:32.460
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

4240
02:12:32.460 --> 02:12:33.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm not any of that.</v>

4241
02:12:33.570 --> 02:12:37.230
<v Speaker 6>But I'm loyal to that because</v>

4242
02:12:39.210 --> 02:12:40.380
<v Speaker 6>you should be loyal to that.</v>

4243
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:41.940
<v Speaker 6>Does that makes sense?</v>

4244
02:12:41.970 --> 02:12:42.803
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4245
02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:43.870
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4246
02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:45.630
<v Speaker 6>I'm loyal to that idea.</v>

4247
02:12:45.631 --> 02:12:46.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm loyal to that living.</v>

4248
02:12:46.891 --> 02:12:47.850
<v Speaker 6>I'm a loyal to that,</v>

4249
02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:49.493
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

4250
02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:56.840
<v Speaker 6>to start stance that he took and living his life,</v>

4251
02:12:58.190 --> 02:12:59.810
<v Speaker 6>that belief that,</v>

4252
02:13:00.170 --> 02:13:01.003
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4253
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:04.500
<v Speaker 6>principle of living,</v>

4254
02:13:04.501 --> 02:13:06.590
<v Speaker 6>whatever you want to call a code of whatever you,</v>

4255
02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:09.750
<v Speaker 6>all those words that make it sound better.</v>

4256
02:13:10.170 --> 02:13:11.003
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

4257
02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:15.050
<v Speaker 6>I would feel that I,</v>

4258
02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:16.253
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4259
02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.090
<v Speaker 6>by not doing it that way,</v>

4260
02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:23.010
<v Speaker 6>when you're lucky enough to have a man that kind of torture what he taught you</v>

4261
02:13:23.011 --> 02:13:24.360
<v Speaker 6>without talking too much.</v>

4262
02:13:25.110 --> 02:13:25.501
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4263
02:13:25.501 --> 02:13:28.290
<v Speaker 6>and I might be the greatest teacher is by seeing,</v>

4264
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:29.383
<v Speaker 6>right</v>

4265
02:13:30.630 --> 02:13:31.560
<v Speaker 6>examples it,</v>

4266
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:34.190
<v Speaker 6>but if you don't honor that,</v>

4267
02:13:36.050 --> 02:13:36.470
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4268
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:37.920
<v Speaker 6>then you're not on your father</v>

4269
02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:41.160
<v Speaker 6>what he stood for.</v>

4270
02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:43.470
<v Speaker 6>And at the end of the day I was pissed because</v>

4271
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:45.833
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4272
02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:47.720
<v Speaker 6>for everything that he did,</v>

4273
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:49.040
<v Speaker 6>there's not,</v>

4274
02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:49.873
<v Speaker 6>there's no,</v>

4275
02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:52.700
<v Speaker 6>I know that sounds foolish,</v>

4276
02:13:52.701 --> 02:13:54.230
<v Speaker 6>but there's no statue of him.</v>

4277
02:13:55.970 --> 02:13:57.080
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

4278
02:13:58.270 --> 02:14:03.270
<v Speaker 6>and for me there should be something because he did it his whole life.</v>

4279
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.541
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4280
02:14:05.541 --> 02:14:07.400
<v Speaker 6>we all have moments of,</v>

4281
02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:10.933
<v Speaker 6>of light,</v>

4282
02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:11.930
<v Speaker 6>of moments of</v>

4283
02:14:13.730 --> 02:14:15.590
<v Speaker 6>where we maybe worry about what's,</v>

4284
02:14:15.650 --> 02:14:16.191
<v Speaker 6>what's there,</v>

4285
02:14:16.191 --> 02:14:18.020
<v Speaker 6>when we're gone and where we're going.</v>

4286
02:14:18.021 --> 02:14:19.580
<v Speaker 6>And maybe we change and I've seen it,</v>

4287
02:14:19.581 --> 02:14:20.420
<v Speaker 6>I've seen it with friends,</v>

4288
02:14:20.421 --> 02:14:20.871
<v Speaker 6>I get it,</v>

4289
02:14:20.871 --> 02:14:21.591
<v Speaker 6>I understand that.</v>

4290
02:14:21.591 --> 02:14:25.750
<v Speaker 6>But where we start trying to live differently because we,</v>

4291
02:14:25.870 --> 02:14:28.490
<v Speaker 6>we start wondering about what's coming next,</v>

4292
02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:29.360
<v Speaker 6>when we're gone,</v>

4293
02:14:30.050 --> 02:14:30.651
<v Speaker 6>death,</v>

4294
02:14:30.651 --> 02:14:30.981
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

4295
02:14:30.981 --> 02:14:31.371
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4296
02:14:31.371 --> 02:14:32.780
<v Speaker 6>but what's there.</v>

4297
02:14:33.170 --> 02:14:35.180
<v Speaker 6>And so we start thinking about that a little bit.</v>

4298
02:14:35.181 --> 02:14:37.190
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I've seen people influenced by that.</v>

4299
02:14:37.191 --> 02:14:38.024
<v Speaker 6>I have,</v>

4300
02:14:38.210 --> 02:14:38.841
<v Speaker 6>you have to,</v>

4301
02:14:38.841 --> 02:14:39.674
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure.</v>

4302
02:14:40.290 --> 02:14:43.490
<v Speaker 6>And he was not influenced by that.</v>

4303
02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:46.040
<v Speaker 6>It was just what he was.</v>

4304
02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:48.740
<v Speaker 6>He was that his whole life.</v>

4305
02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:54.950
<v Speaker 6>And the only thing that I can think,</v>

4306
02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:58.580
<v Speaker 6>because I try to put pieces together a little bit of what he,</v>

4307
02:14:58.670 --> 02:15:01.460
<v Speaker 6>how he got that way and</v>

4308
02:15:03.530 --> 02:15:05.570
<v Speaker 6>all I know from people when he died,</v>

4309
02:15:05.571 --> 02:15:05.811
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4310
02:15:05.811 --> 02:15:06.830
<v Speaker 6>patients come up to you,</v>

4311
02:15:06.831 --> 02:15:08.240
<v Speaker 6>they're great and they want to tell you something,</v>

02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:44.320
<v Speaker 6>She was smarter than him.</v>

4370
02:16:44.321 --> 02:16:45.580
<v Speaker 6>She was smarter than anyone.</v>

4371
02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.530
<v Speaker 6>He was supposed to be a doctor.</v>

4372
02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:52.480
<v Speaker 6>He was one of the greatest diagnostic doctors ever.</v>

4373
02:16:52.630 --> 02:16:52.931
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

4374
02:16:52.931 --> 02:16:53.651
<v Speaker 6>It's my father.</v>

4375
02:16:53.651 --> 02:16:54.461
<v Speaker 6>I know the whole thing.</v>

4376
02:16:54.461 --> 02:16:54.911
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

4377
02:16:54.911 --> 02:16:56.050
<v Speaker 6>But he really was.</v>

4378
02:16:56.590 --> 02:16:57.251
<v Speaker 6>You walked in,</v>

4379
02:16:57.251 --> 02:16:58.360
<v Speaker 6>he knew what was wrong with you.</v>

4380
02:16:58.630 --> 02:16:59.261
<v Speaker 6>There's a great,</v>

4381
02:16:59.261 --> 02:16:59.680
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

4382
02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:01.510
<v Speaker 6>we don't know like the Babe Ruth thing.</v>

4383
02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:03.430
<v Speaker 6>We don't know the complete truth to it,</v>

4384
02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:06.160
<v Speaker 6>but there's a great legendary story that a guy walked in,</v>

4385
02:17:06.161 --> 02:17:07.540
<v Speaker 6>he had been to Mayo Clinic,</v>

4386
02:17:07.570 --> 02:17:08.890
<v Speaker 6>he had been to John Hopkins,</v>

4387
02:17:08.891 --> 02:17:09.650
<v Speaker 6>he had been everywhere.</v>

4388
02:17:09.650 --> 02:17:10.420
<v Speaker 6>It was dying.</v>

4389
02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:11.161
<v Speaker 6>That's all they know.</v>

4390
02:17:11.161 --> 02:17:11.740
<v Speaker 6>He was dying,</v>

4391
02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:13.120
<v Speaker 6>losing weight for an apart,</v>

4392
02:17:13.330 --> 02:17:15.950
<v Speaker 6>dying and nobody could diagnose him.</v>

4393
02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:19.630
<v Speaker 6>He walked into this place where you had to wait five hours to see him because</v>

4394
02:17:19.631 --> 02:17:24.631
<v Speaker 6>the line was out the door because he was had all the poor people and there were</v>

4395
02:17:24.911 --> 02:17:26.500
<v Speaker 6>cigarette burns and all the rugs,</v>

4396
02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:28.870
<v Speaker 6>and she was like,</v>

4397
02:17:28.871 --> 02:17:29.704
<v Speaker 6>where am I?</v>

4398
02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:31.630
<v Speaker 6>But when you got to them,</v>

4399
02:17:31.690 --> 02:17:32.560
<v Speaker 6>you know where you are.</v>

4400
02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:34.450
<v Speaker 6>And he went there.</v>

4401
02:17:34.451 --> 02:17:35.290
<v Speaker 6>Somebody sent them.</v>

4402
02:17:35.291 --> 02:17:36.124
<v Speaker 6>They went there,</v>

4403
02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:37.210
<v Speaker 6>and my father may,</v>

4404
02:17:37.211 --> 02:17:39.970
<v Speaker 6>all the patients leave and he gave himself an injection.</v>

4405
02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:41.800
<v Speaker 6>That's the legendary story.</v>

4406
02:17:42.910 --> 02:17:45.970
<v Speaker 6>And I asked him about it and I as it was a name,</v>

4407
02:17:45.971 --> 02:17:47.110
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't tell you the name,</v>

4408
02:17:47.111 --> 02:17:47.650
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

4409
02:17:47.650 --> 02:17:49.030
<v Speaker 6>He made it real simple.</v>

4410
02:17:49.031 --> 02:17:49.864
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

4411
02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:53.620
<v Speaker 6>because he knew I watched movies and we all watched movies and we owe her things</v>

4412
02:17:53.621 --> 02:17:54.454
<v Speaker 6>from different times.</v>

4413
02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:59.680
<v Speaker 6>And he said back in those days it would have been called leprosy was some kind</v>

4414
02:17:59.681 --> 02:18:00.514
<v Speaker 6>of cancer</v>

4415
02:18:01.930 --> 02:18:03.610
<v Speaker 6>and I guess there was a contagious portal,</v>

4416
02:18:03.670 --> 02:18:04.420
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

4417
02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:09.420
<v Speaker 6>And he got everyone out of the office and he diagnosed the guy came sofas shot.</v>

4418
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:12.220
<v Speaker 6>He would give himself a shot.</v>

4419
02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:12.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4420
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:13.330
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4421
02:18:13.330 --> 02:18:14.650
<v Speaker 6>too I guess.</v>

4422
02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:15.853
<v Speaker 6>I guess so.</v>

4423
02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:16.570
<v Speaker 6>I guess so.</v>

4424
02:18:16.570 --> 02:18:17.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's the story.</v>

4425
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:18.663
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4426
02:18:19.090 --> 02:18:19.923
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

4427
02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:22.370
<v Speaker 6>he said to me though,</v>

4428
02:18:22.510 --> 02:18:24.880
<v Speaker 6>the only definitive thing I know about that story,</v>

4429
02:18:25.570 --> 02:18:26.530
<v Speaker 6>and it was a million of them,</v>

4430
02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:27.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4431
02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:27.880
<v Speaker 6>similar,</v>

4432
02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:32.880
<v Speaker 6>but was that I bragged to my fault,</v>

4433
02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:35.440
<v Speaker 6>you're smarter than all these other doctors.</v>

4434
02:18:35.470 --> 02:18:35.880
<v Speaker 6>And he said,</v>

4435
02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:36.713
<v Speaker 6>Norma</v>

4436
02:18:38.350 --> 02:18:38.891
<v Speaker 6>and I said,</v>

4437
02:18:38.891 --> 02:18:40.470
<v Speaker 6>but you found it and these other plays,</v>

4438
02:18:41.710 --> 02:18:42.580
<v Speaker 6>big hospital,</v>

4439
02:18:42.730 --> 02:18:43.563
<v Speaker 6>big problem.</v>

4440
02:18:44.590 --> 02:18:45.760
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a big hospital.</v>

4441
02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:47.980
<v Speaker 6>Big hospitals,</v>

4442
02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:49.030
<v Speaker 6>bigger problems.</v>

4443
02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:49.271
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

4444
02:18:49.271 --> 02:18:54.271
<v Speaker 6>what do you mean they have to do things fast and with large numbers I don't.</v>

4445
02:18:55.900 --> 02:18:56.830
<v Speaker 6>So they have to,</v>

4446
02:18:57.010 --> 02:18:58.120
<v Speaker 6>it has to make sense.</v>

4447
02:18:58.200 --> 02:18:59.650
<v Speaker 6>Some things don't make sense.</v>

4448
02:19:00.490 --> 02:19:01.323
<v Speaker 6>That's what he told me.</v>

4449
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.411
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

4450
02:19:02.411 --> 02:19:03.910
<v Speaker 6>so this particular day,</v>

4451
02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.230
<v Speaker 6>they are smarter than me.</v>

4452
02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:07.870
<v Speaker 6>They knew the characteristics of the disease.</v>

4453
02:19:08.050 --> 02:19:09.100
<v Speaker 6>They knew the symptoms.</v>

4454
02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:10.930
<v Speaker 6>They knew that it fit in here,</v>

4455
02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:15.760
<v Speaker 6>but that hadn't been around for 40 years in the continental United States</v>

4456
02:19:15.761 --> 02:19:16.630
<v Speaker 6>whenever he said to me.</v>

4457
02:19:16.631 --> 02:19:17.920
<v Speaker 6>But I remember it was something like that.</v>

4458
02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:19.810
<v Speaker 6>It hadn't been around for 40,</v>

4459
02:19:19.811 --> 02:19:20.621
<v Speaker 6>maybe it was 60,</v>

4460
02:19:20.621 --> 02:19:21.370
<v Speaker 6>but whatever,</v>

4461
02:19:21.370 --> 02:19:22.270
<v Speaker 6>it hadn't been around.</v>

4462
02:19:22.390 --> 02:19:25.800
<v Speaker 6>So they move right past that because they had to go with a big hearts.</v>

4463
02:19:25.801 --> 02:19:26.634
<v Speaker 6>But Oh,</v>

4464
02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:29.450
<v Speaker 6>they got to go quick because I don't have to,</v>

4465
02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:35.900
<v Speaker 6>he says it didn't make sense to them because it was around 40 years.</v>

4466
02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:40.430
<v Speaker 6>But he says if it is almost like of walks like a duck,</v>

4467
02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:41.630
<v Speaker 6>quacks like a duck,</v>

4468
02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:43.460
<v Speaker 6>maybe it's a doc.</v>

4469
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:44.900
<v Speaker 6>So he just stayed,</v>

4470
02:19:44.901 --> 02:19:45.890
<v Speaker 6>he could stay with that.</v>

4471
02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.300
<v Speaker 6>They couldn't stay with that.</v>

4472
02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:49.220
<v Speaker 6>And he stayed with and who was right.</v>

4473
02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:51.613
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

4474
02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:54.440
<v Speaker 6>he did a lot of things like that.</v>

4475
02:19:54.470 --> 02:19:55.610
<v Speaker 6>He was famous for that.</v>

4476
02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:58.850
<v Speaker 6>He was famous for people coming from Brooklyn coming from Manhattan,</v>

4477
02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:04.060
<v Speaker 6>common over there to see this diagnose cystic genius in his little basement</v>

4478
02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:09.350
<v Speaker 6>office where people opt out the block,</v>

4479
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:12.650
<v Speaker 6>like the Wayne for Mcdonald's or pizza.</v>

4480
02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:13.881
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4481
02:20:13.881 --> 02:20:14.714
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4482
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:18.530
<v Speaker 6>and it costs less than Mcdonald's to a certain extent,</v>

4483
02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:19.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4484
02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:20.420
<v Speaker 6>because if we didn't have money,</v>

4485
02:20:20.430 --> 02:20:21.650
<v Speaker 6>didn't charge it like I said,</v>

4486
02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:22.820
<v Speaker 6>but he uh,</v>

4487
02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:23.601
<v Speaker 6>but he made money,</v>

4488
02:20:23.601 --> 02:20:24.434
<v Speaker 6>well of course,</v>

4489
02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:26.420
<v Speaker 6>but he didn't make the money of the,</v>

4490
02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:27.770
<v Speaker 6>and he was a,</v>

4491
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:31.410
<v Speaker 6>I tell you a great story to be a,</v>

4492
02:20:31.430 --> 02:20:32.690
<v Speaker 6>to have a nursing home.</v>

4493
02:20:33.410 --> 02:20:36.350
<v Speaker 6>Maybe this explains him the best to have a nursing home.</v>

4494
02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:39.080
<v Speaker 6>You had to have a open on stand on it,</v>

4495
02:20:39.081 --> 02:20:42.380
<v Speaker 6>I guess anywhere in New York he had to have a doctor was signed on as the</v>

4496
02:20:42.381 --> 02:20:43.220
<v Speaker 6>medical director.</v>

4497
02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:46.770
<v Speaker 6>The problem was they couldn't pay it because the nursing homes won't really make</v>

4498
02:20:46.771 --> 02:20:47.604
<v Speaker 6>them money.</v>

4499
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:50.360
<v Speaker 6>So you just had to have a doctor would be there.</v>

4500
02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:52.430
<v Speaker 6>None of them really wanted to do it.</v>

4501
02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:55.470
<v Speaker 6>So my father was a medical director and just,</v>

4502
02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:57.290
<v Speaker 6>just bear with me,</v>

4503
02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:00.530
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to say of eight nursing homes might have been five,</v>

4504
02:21:00.850 --> 02:21:01.820
<v Speaker 6>might have been nine.</v>

4505
02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:05.630
<v Speaker 6>So I would go with them on house calls.</v>

4506
02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:06.710
<v Speaker 6>That's how I hung out with them.</v>

4507
02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:08.840
<v Speaker 6>So I go with them or nursing homes.</v>

4508
02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:10.250
<v Speaker 6>So of course he didn't get paid.</v>

4509
02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:11.130
<v Speaker 6>He was directed,</v>

4510
02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:12.950
<v Speaker 6>but he figured if he was that,</v>

4511
02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:14.030
<v Speaker 6>he never told me this,</v>

4512
02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:18.020
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's okay to say it.</v>

4513
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:21.260
<v Speaker 6>He figured if I'm going to be there,</v>

4514
02:21:21.261 --> 02:21:22.400
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to go see the patients.</v>

4515
02:21:22.401 --> 02:21:22.701
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

4516
02:21:22.701 --> 02:21:23.660
<v Speaker 6>so he didn't have to,</v>

4517
02:21:24.470 --> 02:21:28.820
<v Speaker 6>but he went once a week and he went into each nursing home and I went with them</v>

4518
02:21:28.821 --> 02:21:31.160
<v Speaker 6>when I was with them and he saw the patients.</v>

4519
02:21:31.250 --> 02:21:33.230
<v Speaker 6>So there's one day we go in and he's like,</v>

4520
02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:37.700
<v Speaker 6>he gets treated like royalty.</v>

4521
02:21:37.701 --> 02:21:37.911
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4522
02:21:37.911 --> 02:21:38.411
<v Speaker 6>he comes in,</v>

4523
02:21:38.411 --> 02:21:40.760
<v Speaker 6>the staff comes running out from all the nurse stays.</v>

4524
02:21:40.761 --> 02:21:41.594
<v Speaker 6>They all come on,</v>

4525
02:21:42.530 --> 02:21:42.801
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4526
02:21:42.801 --> 02:21:43.820
<v Speaker 6>and it made me feel good.</v>

4527
02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:45.381
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

4528
02:21:45.381 --> 02:21:46.214
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

4529
02:21:46.470 --> 02:21:47.600
<v Speaker 6>I'm with a man.</v>

4530
02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:49.850
<v Speaker 6>So I'm following them around.</v>

4531
02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.700
<v Speaker 6>We've gone down the hallway and he's very humble.</v>

4532
02:21:52.701 --> 02:21:53.720
<v Speaker 6>He really truly is.</v>

4533
02:21:53.721 --> 02:21:54.800
<v Speaker 6>That word is overused,</v>

4534
02:21:55.130 --> 02:21:58.550
<v Speaker 6>but this guy was beyond the humble like directed thing.</v>

4535
02:21:58.551 --> 02:21:59.384
<v Speaker 6>We'll go this way.</v>

4536
02:21:59.450 --> 02:22:00.620
<v Speaker 6>The the needle,</v>

4537
02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:01.790
<v Speaker 6>it was ridiculous.</v>

4538
02:22:01.791 --> 02:22:03.440
<v Speaker 6>He get mad if you said some good about him.</v>

4539
02:22:04.460 --> 02:22:05.293
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

4540
02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:07.700
<v Speaker 6>they all colonies where he,</v>

4541
02:22:07.730 --> 02:22:08.563
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4542
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:09.480
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

4543
02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:10.370
<v Speaker 6>you have to charts.</v>

4544
02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:10.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4545
02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:11.480
<v Speaker 6>come on.</v>

4546
02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:14.360
<v Speaker 6>So he's looking at the charge to change his medicine,</v>

4547
02:22:14.361 --> 02:22:15.210
<v Speaker 6>give him 100 million,</v>

4548
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.561
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4549
02:22:15.561 --> 02:22:19.260
<v Speaker 6>the typical stuff that I know from watching to Kildare or something.</v>

4550
02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:20.263
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4551
02:22:22.490 --> 02:22:23.323
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

4552
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:25.651
<v Speaker 6>looking,</v>

4553
02:22:25.651 --> 02:22:25.921
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4554
02:22:25.921 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

4555
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.770
<v Speaker 2>he's doing his thing and he's going down.</v>

4556
02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:28.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm following him around.</v>

4557
02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:29.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

4558
02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how old I was,</v>

4559
02:22:30.721 --> 02:22:31.920
<v Speaker 2>but young 10</v>

4560
02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:39.090
<v Speaker 2>11 so I'm found more of a sudden this woman.</v>

4561
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:41.281
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see,</v>

4562
02:22:41.281 --> 02:22:41.791
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

4563
02:22:41.791 --> 02:22:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I jumped around with these things,</v>

4564
02:22:43.081 --> 02:22:45.450
<v Speaker 2>but you ever see the movie?</v>

4565
02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:50.700
<v Speaker 2>It was like comedy guy that was around back then and he did like a bride of</v>

4566
02:22:50.701 --> 02:22:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Frankenstein and he did Brooks.</v>

4567
02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4568
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:55.630
<v Speaker 2>it was one of his movies and the bride of Frankenstein,</v>

4569
02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:57.260
<v Speaker 2>the white hair who was like,</v>

4570
02:22:57.720 --> 02:22:59.640
<v Speaker 2>well this woman was the of Frankenstein.</v>

4571
02:23:00.450 --> 02:23:05.450
<v Speaker 2>She comes running out and she was the shelf and she was like half nude and Hogan</v>

4572
02:23:06.090 --> 02:23:11.010
<v Speaker 2>was falling off and she's an older lady and her white hair was like that.</v>

4573
02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:15.840
<v Speaker 2>And she comes running and she's yelling incoherent and screaming and they jump</v>

4574
02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:17.611
<v Speaker 2>and they jump.</v>

4575
02:23:17.611 --> 02:23:20.280
<v Speaker 2>When he started putting straps around the,</v>

4576
02:23:20.281 --> 02:23:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I guess like the old white coat,</v>

4577
02:23:21.991 --> 02:23:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

4578
02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:23.490
<v Speaker 2>And they got,</v>

4579
02:23:23.490 --> 02:23:26.040
<v Speaker 2>apparently she was tied up to a bed,</v>

4580
02:23:26.190 --> 02:23:26.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4581
02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:29.670
<v Speaker 2>obviously back in those days they didn't know how to deal with,</v>

4582
02:23:29.671 --> 02:23:30.840
<v Speaker 2>see now people the way,</v>

4583
02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:31.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4584
02:23:31.261 --> 02:23:32.220
<v Speaker 2>it was a whole different thing.</v>

4585
02:23:32.430 --> 02:23:32.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4586
02:23:32.701 --> 02:23:37.701
<v Speaker 2>we're talking a lot of years ago and so they had a tied up and she got loose and</v>

4587
02:23:38.161 --> 02:23:39.830
<v Speaker 2>her gown was falling off and she's,</v>

4588
02:23:40.470 --> 02:23:41.340
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

4589
02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:47.120
<v Speaker 2>so they jump up on her and they're tying her up and I'm watching this woman get</v>

4590
02:23:47.461 --> 02:23:52.461
<v Speaker 2>mugged in the nursing home that my father to the medical director of and all of</v>

4591
02:23:53.401 --> 02:23:53.911
<v Speaker 2>a sudden he said,</v>

4592
02:23:53.911 --> 02:23:54.744
<v Speaker 2>leave it alone.</v>

4593
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:57.150
<v Speaker 2>And he's still looking at his charts.</v>

4594
02:23:57.151 --> 02:23:57.890
<v Speaker 2>He's not like,</v>

4595
02:23:57.890 --> 02:23:58.071
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4596
02:23:58.071 --> 02:23:58.904
<v Speaker 2>hey Yo,</v>

4597
02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:00.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4598
02:24:01.090 --> 02:24:01.923
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

4599
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:03.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's okay.</v>

4600
02:24:03.631 --> 02:24:04.464
<v Speaker 2>She's fine.</v>

4601
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:06.320
<v Speaker 2>She'll be all right.</v>

4602
02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:08.130
<v Speaker 2>She calmed down.</v>

4603
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:11.580
<v Speaker 2>She was a little nuts,</v>

4604
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:12.623
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

4605
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>she was not spank.</v>

4606
02:24:14.451 --> 02:24:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4607
02:24:14.740 --> 02:24:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4608
02:24:14.890 --> 02:24:15.630
<v Speaker 2>That's a fair,</v>

4609
02:24:15.630 --> 02:24:16.280
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

4610
02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:17.790
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to say it's realistic.</v>

4611
02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:18.863
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

4612
02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:22.470
<v Speaker 2>she comes over to my father,</v>

4613
02:24:22.890 --> 02:24:23.251
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>

4614
02:24:23.251 --> 02:24:24.084
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4615
02:24:24.420 --> 02:24:28.320
<v Speaker 2>and he's writing and he starts walking.</v>

4616
02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:29.760
<v Speaker 2>She starts falling.</v>

4617
02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm a kid so I can figure it all out the way I could later.</v>

4618
02:24:34.170 --> 02:24:35.003
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4619
02:24:35.370 --> 02:24:38.430
<v Speaker 2>But she becomes his assistant basically.</v>

4620
02:24:38.431 --> 02:24:40.920
<v Speaker 2>She's following him around and she,</v>

4621
02:24:40.921 --> 02:24:44.520
<v Speaker 2>he's going to room to room and she's,</v>

4622
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:45.330
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

4623
02:24:45.330 --> 02:24:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I think he gave her,</v>

4624
02:24:46.441 --> 02:24:47.520
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

4625
02:24:47.521 --> 02:24:48.800
<v Speaker 2>he gave her like the,</v>

4626
02:24:48.801 --> 02:24:49.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4627
02:24:49.330 --> 02:24:52.380
<v Speaker 2>the thing that you write on a billboard,</v>

4628
02:24:52.410 --> 02:24:53.243
<v Speaker 2>you know the thing,</v>

4629
02:24:53.470 --> 02:24:54.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4630
02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:54.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4631
02:24:54.540 --> 02:24:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Clipboard to hold.</v>

4632
02:24:55.950 --> 02:25:00.260
<v Speaker 2>So she's holding a clipboard and she's looking like she's making beliefs,</v>

4633
02:25:00.261 --> 02:25:01.610
<v Speaker 2>she's reading stuff and,</v>

4634
02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:02.493
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4635
02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:04.110
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like looking at the scene,</v>

4636
02:25:04.111 --> 02:25:04.944
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4637
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:05.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4638
02:25:05.461 --> 02:25:06.181
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a kid,</v>

4639
02:25:06.181 --> 02:25:09.600
<v Speaker 2>like I haven't seen all the movies yet that I can compare it,</v>

4640
02:25:09.601 --> 02:25:10.434
<v Speaker 2>that there's,</v>

4641
02:25:10.590 --> 02:25:11.670
<v Speaker 2>this is out there,</v>

4642
02:25:11.790 --> 02:25:12.623
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

4643
02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:13.980
<v Speaker 2>This is freaking nuts.</v>

4644
02:25:14.740 --> 02:25:15.200
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4645
02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:16.530
<v Speaker 2>and she found around,</v>

4646
02:25:16.531 --> 02:25:18.750
<v Speaker 2>she's looking at the thing and I think she's like Zane.</v>

4647
02:25:18.770 --> 02:25:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4648
02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:19.983
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4649
02:25:21.090 --> 02:25:22.350
<v Speaker 2>And he's going and he's,</v>

4650
02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 2>he's basically not even</v>

4651
02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:25.301
<v Speaker 6>paying attention.</v>

4652
02:25:25.301 --> 02:25:26.134
<v Speaker 6>He's just,</v>

4653
02:25:26.410 --> 02:25:27.243
<v Speaker 6>every once in a while I said,</v>

4654
02:25:27.310 --> 02:25:28.143
<v Speaker 6>let me hit the,</v>

4655
02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:29.013
<v Speaker 6>and he's the,</v>

4656
02:25:29.290 --> 02:25:30.123
<v Speaker 6>and all of a sudden,</v>

4657
02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:32.410
<v Speaker 6>and this is the part again,</v>

4658
02:25:32.411 --> 02:25:35.050
<v Speaker 6>just like the other thing I think about leaving it out,</v>

4659
02:25:35.230 --> 02:25:36.130
<v Speaker 6>but if I leave it out,</v>

4660
02:25:36.131 --> 02:25:37.180
<v Speaker 6>it's not a story.</v>

4661
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:38.620
<v Speaker 6>It's not a story.</v>

4662
02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:40.360
<v Speaker 6>Because if I left it like that,</v>

4663
02:25:40.361 --> 02:25:41.440
<v Speaker 6>it's a beautiful story.</v>

4664
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:48.030
<v Speaker 6>But this is a beautiful story in its own way because there's is what it is.</v>

4665
02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:49.293
<v Speaker 6>It's a real,</v>

4666
02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:50.970
<v Speaker 6>he's in front of,</v>

4667
02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:52.510
<v Speaker 6>and my mother was,</v>

4668
02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:54.970
<v Speaker 6>I described as she was his gorgeous,</v>

4669
02:25:54.971 --> 02:25:57.910
<v Speaker 6>beautiful woman that like could things,</v>

4670
02:25:57.970 --> 02:25:59.710
<v Speaker 6>my father could give a crap.</v>

4671
02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:05.110
<v Speaker 6>My father had ink stains exploding in his white shirt pockets.</v>

4672
02:26:05.410 --> 02:26:07.030
<v Speaker 6>My mother would go crazy.</v>

4673
02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:09.180
<v Speaker 6>He went to Kmart and avi,</v>

4674
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:10.090
<v Speaker 6>remember Kmart,</v>

4675
02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:14.110
<v Speaker 6>he went to Kmart and borders all shoes for four 99 each,</v>

4676
02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:17.440
<v Speaker 6>maybe three 90 [inaudible] plastic shoes.</v>

4677
02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:19.570
<v Speaker 6>And my mother was buying him leather shoes.</v>

4678
02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:20.710
<v Speaker 6>He never warned them.</v>

4679
02:26:20.711 --> 02:26:23.230
<v Speaker 6>If he knew what she paid for me would have went nuts.</v>

4680
02:26:24.370 --> 02:26:27.490
<v Speaker 6>Waste waste for what?</v>

4681
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:28.750
<v Speaker 6>That was his,</v>

4682
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:29.583
<v Speaker 6>that was him.</v>

4683
02:26:29.710 --> 02:26:32.800
<v Speaker 6>So he's got these plants and shoes and you know,</v>

4684
02:26:32.801 --> 02:26:36.790
<v Speaker 6>he's got the inks blow up in his pockets and everything else.</v>

4685
02:26:37.330 --> 02:26:39.280
<v Speaker 6>And My mother would always get upset,</v>

4686
02:26:39.430 --> 02:26:40.300
<v Speaker 6>always mad.</v>

4687
02:26:40.330 --> 02:26:41.950
<v Speaker 6>Why do you wear those shoes?</v>

4688
02:26:41.951 --> 02:26:42.100
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4689
02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:42.670
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4690
02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:43.760
<v Speaker 6>but he does.</v>

4691
02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:49.300
<v Speaker 6>So he's walking in front of her and all of a sudden everything changes.</v>

4692
02:26:50.710 --> 02:26:51.700
<v Speaker 6>The woman goes,</v>

4693
02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:54.460
<v Speaker 6>he's neither doctor</v>

4694
02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:56.973
<v Speaker 6>he'd see.</v>

4695
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.940
<v Speaker 6>She flipped on him.</v>

4696
02:26:58.060 --> 02:26:59.020
<v Speaker 6>Can you imagine this?</v>

4697
02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:01.720
<v Speaker 6>She could have to be in so great to her.</v>

4698
02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:06.370
<v Speaker 6>He's not a barely gets his attention still walking.</v>

4699
02:27:07.330 --> 02:27:08.610
<v Speaker 6>He's not a doctor.</v>

4700
02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:09.453
<v Speaker 6>Everybody.</v>

4701
02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:11.170
<v Speaker 6>He's got holes in his shoes.</v>

4702
02:27:12.250 --> 02:27:13.050
<v Speaker 6>I looked down,</v>

4703
02:27:13.050 --> 02:27:13.960
<v Speaker 6>his foot goes up,</v>

4704
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.910
<v Speaker 6>he's got a whole new shoes,</v>

4705
02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:16.450
<v Speaker 6>socks to out the shoe.</v>

4706
02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:18.173
<v Speaker 6>She was right.</v>

4707
02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:21.700
<v Speaker 6>He's got a hold of those freaking show and his plastic shoe.</v>

4708
02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:23.560
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't care.</v>

4709
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:25.000
<v Speaker 6>She,</v>

4710
02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:25.780
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

4711
02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:26.800
<v Speaker 6>he can't be a doctor.</v>

4712
02:27:26.801 --> 02:27:27.970
<v Speaker 6>He's got holes in his shoes</v>

4713
02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:30.191
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

4714
02:27:30.191 --> 02:27:31.024
<v Speaker 6>He turns around,</v>

4715
02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:33.393
<v Speaker 6>he looks at her.</v>

4716
02:27:34.350 --> 02:27:35.440
<v Speaker 6>I never forget this.</v>

4717
02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:37.180
<v Speaker 6>He pats her on her head,</v>

4718
02:27:37.450 --> 02:27:37.751
<v Speaker 6>says,</v>

4719
02:27:37.751 --> 02:27:38.710
<v Speaker 6>you're not so crazy.</v>

4720
02:27:42.380 --> 02:27:46.690
<v Speaker 6>Pats her on the head just like this and neither in a demeaning way like you</v>

4721
02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:47.231
<v Speaker 6>might think.</v>

4722
02:27:47.231 --> 02:27:48.064
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

4723
02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:48.641
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

4724
02:27:48.641 --> 02:27:51.100
<v Speaker 6>He touched her on her head and said,</v>

4725
02:27:51.101 --> 02:27:51.640
<v Speaker 6>you're not,</v>

4726
02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:52.810
<v Speaker 6>you're not so crazy.</v>

4727
02:27:53.550 --> 02:27:54.470
<v Speaker 6>It turned around,</v>

4728
02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:56.020
<v Speaker 6>took the billboard and kept walking.</v>

4729
02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:57.700
<v Speaker 6>She didn't say another word.</v>

4730
02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:04.193
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

4731
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:11.070
<v Speaker 6>My mother was freaking embarrassed and mad because I told the story when I got</v>

4732
02:28:11.411 --> 02:28:14.290
<v Speaker 6>home and of course he would never tell it.</v>

4733
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:15.970
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

4734
02:28:15.971 --> 02:28:16.181
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4735

02:28:16.481 --> 02:28:16.661
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4737
02:28:16.661 --> 02:28:17.980
<v Speaker 6>I said it like a kid would say,</v>

4738
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.761
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4739
02:28:18.761 --> 02:28:19.511
<v Speaker 6>this ladies said,</v>

4740
02:28:19.511 --> 02:28:19.721
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4741
02:28:19.721 --> 02:28:20.554
<v Speaker 6>he's got a horse.</v>

4742
02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:21.920
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

4743
02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:23.420
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4744
02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:24.250
<v Speaker 6>Jesus,</v>

4745
02:28:24.250 --> 02:28:24.890
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4746
02:28:24.890 --> 02:28:25.470
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4747
02:28:25.470 --> 02:28:26.303
<v Speaker 6>Didn't meet anything.</v>

4748
02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4749
02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Well that makes just this your description,</v>

4750
02:28:32.621 --> 02:28:35.140
<v Speaker 1>your understanding of your father,</v>

4751
02:28:35.141 --> 02:28:36.670
<v Speaker 1>it just makes so much sense.</v>

4752
02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:39.460
<v Speaker 1>So much sense of who you are and why you,</v>

4753
02:28:39.461 --> 02:28:42.040
<v Speaker 1>why your principles are so rigid,</v>

4754
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:43.130
<v Speaker 1>why you're,</v>

4755
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:44.980
<v Speaker 1>you're intolerant of any bullshit.</v>

4756
02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Just makes so much sense</v>

4757
02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:53.830
<v Speaker 1>as a fight trainer and as a guy who understands fighters is a commentator and</v>

4758
02:28:53.831 --> 02:28:55.630
<v Speaker 1>makes so much sense that you,</v>

4759
02:28:55.660 --> 02:29:00.660
<v Speaker 1>you have this just unyielding need for 100% commitment.</v>

4760
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:04.281
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4761
02:29:04.281 --> 02:29:05.114
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4762
02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:07.993
<v Speaker 6>so just told her,</v>

4763
02:29:08.070 --> 02:29:08.590
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

4764
02:29:08.590 --> 02:29:11.180
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't make me a better person or anything else to say.</v>

4765
02:29:13.220 --> 02:29:15.770
<v Speaker 6>I don't have tolerance for the BS.</v>

4766
02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:16.633
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4767
02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:19.010
<v Speaker 6>Because I know it to be bs.</v>

4768
02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:19.933
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4769
02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:20.920
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4770
02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:21.120
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4771
02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:23.060
<v Speaker 6>I say to we,</v>

4772
02:29:23.230 --> 02:29:27.360
<v Speaker 6>we were running these gyms in la for the last nine.</v>

4773
02:29:27.361 --> 02:29:28.071
<v Speaker 6>You're 22 years.</v>

4774
02:29:28.071 --> 02:29:28.904
<v Speaker 6>I've listened.</v>

4775
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:29.361
<v Speaker 6>When he died,</v>

4776
02:29:29.361 --> 02:29:30.980
<v Speaker 6>I started to talk to Atlas Foundation</v>

4777
02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:33.680
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>

4778
02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:34.501
<v Speaker 6>There was no statute.</v>

4779
02:29:34.501 --> 02:29:35.270
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

4780
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:36.800
<v Speaker 6>So I really,</v>

4781
02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:41.920
<v Speaker 6>I went to a supreme court judge who was a friend on [inaudible] because I used</v>

4782
02:29:43.101 --> 02:29:46.160
<v Speaker 6>to be in front of the judge is when I was young and a bad way.</v>

4783
02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:47.040
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4784
02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:47.873
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4785
02:29:48.310 --> 02:29:49.760
<v Speaker 6>because I got myself in a little trouble,</v>

4786
02:29:50.140 --> 02:29:50.973
<v Speaker 6>stupid,</v>

4787
02:29:51.290 --> 02:29:51.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4788
02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:52.730
<v Speaker 6>but I got to the right place.</v>

4789
02:29:52.731 --> 02:29:53.564
<v Speaker 6>That's what counts,</v>

4790
02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:54.410
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4791
02:29:54.410 --> 02:29:55.243
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

4792
02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:55.701
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4793
02:29:55.701 --> 02:29:56.060
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4796
02:29:56.590 --> 02:30:00.050
<v Speaker 6>I always got a kick out of it that I could hang out with the judge and I didn't</v>

4797
02:30:00.051 --> 02:30:01.610
<v Speaker 6>have to be in a court to do it,</v>

4798
02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:02.120
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4799
02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:02.930
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4800
02:30:02.930 --> 02:30:04.930
<v Speaker 6>And I didn't have to be standing like in front of them.</v>

4801
02:30:04.931 --> 02:30:06.500
<v Speaker 6>I could be on the side of like,</v>

4810
02:30:22.011 --> 02:30:24.440
<v Speaker 6>but just a little grassroots thing,</v>

4811

02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:36.630
<v Speaker 6>we make sure it's legitimate.</v>

4858
02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:37.860
<v Speaker 6>We research it,</v>

4859
02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:38.611
<v Speaker 6>we do that.</v>

4860
02:31:38.611 --> 02:31:39.444
<v Speaker 6>We have a board.</v>

4862
02:31:44.011 --> 02:31:45.330
<v Speaker 6>people to take advantage a little bit,</v>

4863
02:31:46.050 --> 02:31:46.883
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

4864
02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:48.360
<v Speaker 6>and we do it.</v>

4865
02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:53.310
<v Speaker 6>We act on it because my father never made people feel less when they were poor</v>

4866
02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:54.690
<v Speaker 6>or when they needed something.</v>

4867
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:56.310
<v Speaker 6>That was the greatest thing he did.</v>

4868
02:31:56.311 --> 02:31:58.560
<v Speaker 6>He never made them lose more than they lost already.</v>

4869
02:31:59.040 --> 02:31:59.873
<v Speaker 6>Their integrity.</v>

4870
02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:00.420
<v Speaker 6>Never.</v>

4871
02:32:00.420 --> 02:32:00.870
<v Speaker 6>Never,</v>

4872
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:01.703
<v Speaker 6>never.</v>

4873
02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:03.480
<v Speaker 6>He never made him feel he didn't show.</v>

4874
02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:04.950
<v Speaker 6>I remember one time,</v>

4875
02:32:04.951 --> 02:32:07.470
<v Speaker 6>it was Christmas Eve when it was I hanging out and I was a kid.</v>

4876
02:32:07.471 --> 02:32:08.250
<v Speaker 6>I was in them.</v>

4877
02:32:08.250 --> 02:32:11.220
<v Speaker 6>I was at my father's office because I want her to be with them and it was</v>

4878
02:32:11.221 --> 02:32:14.550
<v Speaker 6>Christmas eve and it was late and we were still in the office and a woman,</v>

4879
02:32:14.551 --> 02:32:16.050
<v Speaker 6>I remember she was a Spanish woman.</v>

4880
02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:16.801
<v Speaker 6>She came in,</v>

4881
02:32:16.801 --> 02:32:21.801
<v Speaker 6>she has six kids and she was nervous and I remember watching how nervous she</v>

4882
02:32:22.321 --> 02:32:22.531
<v Speaker 6>was.</v>

4883
02:32:22.531 --> 02:32:23.364
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

4884
02:32:23.370 --> 02:32:24.600
<v Speaker 6>even though I was young was like,</v>

4885
02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:27.480
<v Speaker 6>she's really nervous and I found out,</v>

4886
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:28.890
<v Speaker 6>I learned about human behavior.</v>

4887
02:32:28.890 --> 02:32:33.450
<v Speaker 6>I learned about what it was and I'm watching her and sure enough,</v>

4888
02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:36.570
<v Speaker 6>she was getting ready when the last kid got taken care of.</v>

4889
02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:37.950
<v Speaker 6>She was going to dot out of there.</v>

4890
02:32:37.951 --> 02:32:40.200
<v Speaker 6>She didn't have money and the poor woman,</v>

4891
02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:41.280
<v Speaker 6>she was she,</v>

4892
02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:43.200
<v Speaker 6>she had to take care of her kids.</v>

4893
02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:44.580
<v Speaker 6>She didn't want to do that,</v>

4894
02:32:44.730 --> 02:32:49.080
<v Speaker 6>but she was going to run out of there cause she did not have money and he</v>

4895
02:32:49.081 --> 02:32:52.140
<v Speaker 6>recognized me take announced I didn't know what it was.</v>

4896
02:32:52.141 --> 02:32:53.850
<v Speaker 6>So I'm not going to say I thought I was smart,</v>

4897
02:32:54.030 --> 02:32:55.350
<v Speaker 6>but I recognize something.</v>

4898
02:32:55.620 --> 02:32:56.550
<v Speaker 6>All this motion,</v>

4899
02:32:56.551 --> 02:32:57.540
<v Speaker 6>all this nervousness,</v>

4900
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:58.800
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't normal.</v>

4901
02:32:59.310 --> 02:33:04.310
<v Speaker 6>He recognized at all and before he got to the last kid so he wouldn't embarrass</v>

4902
02:33:05.221 --> 02:33:10.110
<v Speaker 6>her so she wouldn't run out of there and do that to itself and lose something</v>

4903
02:33:10.111 --> 02:33:11.460
<v Speaker 6>more than she lost already.</v>

4904
02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:13.613
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

4905
02:33:13.770 --> 02:33:15.090
<v Speaker 6>this one's on me</v>

4906
02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:18.150
<v Speaker 6>and the nervousness went away.</v>

4907
02:33:18.270 --> 02:33:18.661
<v Speaker 6>She said,</v>

4908
02:33:18.661 --> 02:33:19.650
<v Speaker 6>there's no charge today.</v>

4909
02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:21.630
<v Speaker 6>He said there's no charge today.</v>

4910
02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:25.050
<v Speaker 6>And I don't know if she spoke English,</v>

4911
02:33:25.051 --> 02:33:29.580
<v Speaker 6>but she understood it and he made her understand it and there was no charge</v>

4912
02:33:29.581 --> 02:33:30.390
<v Speaker 6>today.</v>

4913
02:33:30.390 --> 02:33:31.830
<v Speaker 6>And soon as he said that,</v>

4914
02:33:32.310 --> 02:33:33.390
<v Speaker 6>everything changed.</v>

4915
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:34.830
<v Speaker 6>Everything changed.</v>

4916
02:33:34.831 --> 02:33:35.581
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't nervous,</v>

4917
02:33:35.581 --> 02:33:39.540
<v Speaker 6>he wasn't looking at doors and she's,</v>

4918
02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:40.943
<v Speaker 6>she cried</v>

4919
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:46.080
<v Speaker 6>and she left and when she left,</v>

4920
02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:49.200
<v Speaker 6>the place was packed because that was his office.</v>

4921
02:33:50.220 --> 02:33:52.460
<v Speaker 6>And all of a sudden he's,</v>

4922
02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:54.540
<v Speaker 6>I've talked to himself a little bit,</v>

4923
02:33:54.570 --> 02:33:54.871
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

4924
02:33:54.871 --> 02:33:55.704
<v Speaker 6>just for a second.</v>

4925
02:33:55.710 --> 02:33:55.951
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4926
02:33:55.951 --> 02:33:56.890
<v Speaker 6>he didn't do this on my,</v>

4927
02:33:56.891 --> 02:33:57.600
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4928
02:33:57.600 --> 02:33:58.830
<v Speaker 6>but he just like said,</v>

4929
02:33:58.940 --> 02:33:59.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4930
02:33:59.230 --> 02:34:00.960
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't like that,</v>

4931
02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:01.291
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4932
02:34:01.291 --> 02:34:02.124
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't thinking,</v>

4933
02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:05.430
<v Speaker 6>of course he wasn't taking it.</v>

4934
02:34:05.431 --> 02:34:06.750
<v Speaker 6>He didn't know it was Christmas Eve.</v>

4935
02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:10.170
<v Speaker 6>So he turns to me and he gives me a mission,</v>

4936
02:34:10.171 --> 02:34:11.004
<v Speaker 6>a job.</v>

4937
02:34:11.220 --> 02:34:12.340
<v Speaker 6>He opened the,</v>

4938
02:34:12.550 --> 02:34:14.790
<v Speaker 6>it takes hours and he gives me a $50 bill.</v>

4939
02:34:15.390 --> 02:34:15.751
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

4940
02:34:15.751 --> 02:34:17.530
<v Speaker 6>go find that she's probably on a bus stop.</v>

4941
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:22.350
<v Speaker 6>I ran out that door like I like,</v>

4942
02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:24.310
<v Speaker 6>I was given the greatest mission in the world.</v>

4943
02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:27.820
<v Speaker 6>High felt so proud I could,</v>

4944
02:34:27.821 --> 02:34:28.840
<v Speaker 6>I ran,</v>

4945
02:34:28.841 --> 02:34:30.130
<v Speaker 6>I knew where the bus stop was.</v>

4946
02:34:30.610 --> 02:34:31.810
<v Speaker 6>I was going to run all of them,</v>

4947
02:34:32.410 --> 02:34:35.320
<v Speaker 6>but she was at the first one down on Bay street,</v>

4948
02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:37.420
<v Speaker 6>right around the corner,</v>

4949
02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:39.010
<v Speaker 6>down block,</v>

4950
02:34:39.011 --> 02:34:39.844
<v Speaker 6>two blocks.</v>

4951
02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:41.200
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

4952
02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:42.033
<v Speaker 6>she's there.</v>

4953
02:34:42.370 --> 02:34:44.560
<v Speaker 6>And sure enough days she has done a post.</v>

4954
02:34:44.561 --> 02:34:45.191
<v Speaker 6>I went up to,</v>

4955
02:34:45.191 --> 02:34:46.024
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

4956
02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:50.110
<v Speaker 6>the doctor said it gives you this and you know,</v>

4957
02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:51.940
<v Speaker 6>she looked at it,</v>

4958
02:34:51.941 --> 02:34:52.450
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>

4959
02:34:52.450 --> 02:34:52.751
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4960
02:34:52.751 --> 02:34:53.584
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>

4961
02:34:54.190 --> 02:34:54.580
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>

4962
02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:54.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4963
02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:55.713
<v Speaker 6>she was shocked,</v>

4964
02:34:56.380 --> 02:34:57.213
<v Speaker 6>but she,</v>

4965
02:34:57.580 --> 02:34:58.840
<v Speaker 6>she started crying again.</v>

4966
02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:03.880
<v Speaker 6>But I felt so good because like I felt like I was part of it,</v>

4967
02:35:04.450 --> 02:35:05.283
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

4968
02:35:05.770 --> 02:35:06.281
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

4969
02:35:06.281 --> 02:35:09.100
<v Speaker 6>so I started this foundation and I said,</v>

4970
02:35:09.330 --> 02:35:09.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4971
02:35:09.550 --> 02:35:10.383
<v Speaker 6>I needed help.</v>

4972
02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:10.961
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

4973
02:35:10.961 --> 02:35:11.794
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

4974
02:35:12.910 --> 02:35:13.870
<v Speaker 6>we're going to do what he did.</v>

4975
02:35:14.350 --> 02:35:15.183
<v Speaker 6>No red tape.</v>

4976
02:35:15.790 --> 02:35:17.080
<v Speaker 6>No losing your pride.</v>

4977
02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:19.900
<v Speaker 6>People that fall through the cracks.</v>

4978
02:35:19.930 --> 02:35:20.741
<v Speaker 6>That's my father.</v>

4979
02:35:20.741 --> 02:35:21.101
<v Speaker 6>He was,</v>

4980
02:35:21.101 --> 02:35:21.400
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

4981
02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:22.600
<v Speaker 6>he had a phd in that.</v>

4982
02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:25.120
<v Speaker 6>All the people that fell to the cracks,</v>

4983
02:35:25.121 --> 02:35:26.080
<v Speaker 6>he took care of more.</v>

4984
02:35:26.830 --> 02:35:27.221
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

4985
02:35:27.221 --> 02:35:29.170
<v Speaker 6>we're going to take care of the ones,</v>

4986
02:35:29.171 --> 02:35:29.411
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4987
02:35:29.411 --> 02:35:30.220
<v Speaker 6>muscular dystrophy,</v>

4988
02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:31.300
<v Speaker 6>great organization.</v>

4989
02:35:31.330 --> 02:35:32.410
<v Speaker 6>But two people out there,</v>

4990
02:35:32.411 --> 02:35:33.010
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4991
02:35:33.010 --> 02:35:33.731
<v Speaker 6>not a bad way.</v>

4992
02:35:33.731 --> 02:35:38.560
<v Speaker 6>But did you know like 87% goes to administrative costs and like 4% goes to</v>

4993
02:35:38.561 --> 02:35:39.340
<v Speaker 6>research.</v>

4994
02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:41.110
<v Speaker 6>These people don't need research in their life.</v>

4995
02:35:41.111 --> 02:35:41.891
<v Speaker 6>They've told me that.</v>

4996
02:35:41.891 --> 02:35:42.431
<v Speaker 6>I know it,</v>

4997
02:35:42.431 --> 02:35:43.264
<v Speaker 6>I recognize it.</v>

4998
02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:44.193
<v Speaker 6>You know what they need.</v>

4999
02:35:44.350 --> 02:35:45.370
<v Speaker 6>They need a wheelchair.</v>

5000
02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:47.490
<v Speaker 6>You know they need a handicap ramp.</v>

5001
02:35:47.491 --> 02:35:48.324
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what they need?</v>

5002
02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:49.870
<v Speaker 6>They can't medication paid for.</v>

5003
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.411
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

5004
02:35:50.411 --> 02:35:53.980
<v Speaker 6>They need the utilities to be kept on when they're being shut off because they</v>

5005
02:35:53.981 --> 02:35:54.610
<v Speaker 6>can't afford,</v>

5006
02:35:54.610 --> 02:35:55.450
<v Speaker 6>you know what they need.</v>

5007
02:35:55.570 --> 02:35:58.750
<v Speaker 6>They need the back rent paid because someone got sick and one of the people</v>

5008
02:35:58.751 --> 02:36:02.860
<v Speaker 6>working there had to quit the job and they were going to be put into a shelter</v>

5009
02:36:02.861 --> 02:36:03.730
<v Speaker 6>with six kids.</v>

5010
02:36:04.570 --> 02:36:05.770
<v Speaker 6>So we pay the back rent,</v>

5011
02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:07.390
<v Speaker 6>we paid the utility costs,</v>

5012
02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:08.800
<v Speaker 6>we pay the cancer Medicaid,</v>

5013
02:36:08.890 --> 02:36:12.490
<v Speaker 6>we put the wheelchair ramp up and we do those.</v>

5014
02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:16.660
<v Speaker 6>That's what we do and I'm researching part of their life.</v>

5015
02:36:16.661 --> 02:36:17.290
<v Speaker 6>It's great.</v>

5016
02:36:17.290 --> 02:36:21.760
<v Speaker 6>That's hopefully comes so we could close all these places down and our close</v>

5017
02:36:21.770 --> 02:36:22.660
<v Speaker 6>mine down first,</v>

5018
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:26.620
<v Speaker 6>but right now they don't need research.</v>

5019
02:36:26.621 --> 02:36:27.820
<v Speaker 6>They need that.</v>

5020
02:36:28.390 --> 02:36:30.970
<v Speaker 6>They need help for their way of life.</v>

5021
02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.540
<v Speaker 6>Now for the quality of life for that kid now.</v>

5022
02:36:35.290 --> 02:36:36.280
<v Speaker 6>So that's what we do.</v>

5023
02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:38.440
<v Speaker 6>How could someone donate to this if they want to?</v>

5024
02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:40.360
<v Speaker 6>It's the dark that was said.</v>

5025
02:36:40.361 --> 02:36:42.310
<v Speaker 6>I'm real bad on a website.</v>

5026
02:36:42.311 --> 02:36:43.690
<v Speaker 6>Stuff on wake up caveman.</v>

5027
02:36:43.690 --> 02:36:45.050
<v Speaker 6>But it's the doctor.</v>

02:37:21.651 --> 02:37:23.060
<v Speaker 6>This is a beautiful conversation,</v>

02:37:23.061 --> 02:37:23.510
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

5051

<v Speaker 6>And not just about boxing.</v>

5052
02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:26.353
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

5053
02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:29.180
<v Speaker 6>I think this,</v>

5054

5056
02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:30.760
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

5057
02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:33.010
<v Speaker 6>it speaks so much to who you are and why you,</v>

5058
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:36.050
<v Speaker 6>who you are and why you won't tolerate any bullshit.</v>

5059
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:37.131
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5060
02:37:37.131 --> 02:37:39.290
<v Speaker 6>It's like when you've seen a guy like that,</v>

5061
02:37:39.291 --> 02:37:42.140
<v Speaker 6>it's Kinda make sense.</v>

5062
02:37:42.470 --> 02:37:44.330
<v Speaker 6>Are you still working with fighters?</v>

5063
02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:45.051
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5064
02:37:45.051 --> 02:37:45.620
<v Speaker 6>it's funny.</v>

5065
02:37:45.620 --> 02:37:46.100
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5066
02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:50.030
<v Speaker 6>no was the word and to a few minutes ago to a few minutes ago,</v>

5067
02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:51.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying a few minutes,</v>

5068
02:37:51.261 --> 02:37:52.580
<v Speaker 6>but until a week ago,</v>

5069
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:53.421
<v Speaker 6>maybe less,</v>

5070
02:37:53.421 --> 02:37:54.410
<v Speaker 6>maybe five days ago,</v>

5071
02:37:54.411 --> 02:37:54.800
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

5072
02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:56.600
<v Speaker 6>I've decided to train a fighter.</v>

5073
02:37:57.140 --> 02:38:00.890
<v Speaker 6>He's going to fight for the world light heavyweight title to sample first</v>

5074
02:38:01.250 --> 02:38:03.410
<v Speaker 6>against the second hardest puncher in boxing.</v>

5075
02:38:03.411 --> 02:38:04.190
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately,</v>

5076
02:38:04.190 --> 02:38:05.870
<v Speaker 6>when she wasn't and um,</v>

5077
02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:06.951
<v Speaker 6>it's gonna be,</v>

5078
02:38:06.951 --> 02:38:08.240
<v Speaker 6>I think it's on showtime,</v>

5079
02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:09.291
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

5080
02:38:09.291 --> 02:38:12.080
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know because I didn't even find those details out when they asked</v>

5081
02:38:12.081 --> 02:38:14.360
<v Speaker 6>me to train them first I was saying no,</v>

5082
02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:15.920
<v Speaker 6>and then my kids said,</v>

5083
02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:17.593
<v Speaker 6>dad,</v>

5084
02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:19.040
<v Speaker 6>at least give it a chance.</v>

5085
02:38:19.430 --> 02:38:22.760
<v Speaker 6>So I flew out to where he is in Oxnard,</v>

5086
02:38:22.761 --> 02:38:24.050
<v Speaker 6>California to meet him.</v>

5087
02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:26.360
<v Speaker 6>His name is Alexander.</v>

5088
02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:27.140
<v Speaker 6>He's a,</v>

5089
02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:30.550
<v Speaker 6>he's a Ukrainian Alexander Wasik.</v>

5090
02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:32.540
<v Speaker 6>I learned that you don't pronounce the G,</v>

5091
02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:33.920
<v Speaker 6>it's voltage,</v>

5092
02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:34.970
<v Speaker 6>but it starts with a g.</v>

5093
02:38:35.270 --> 02:38:36.230
<v Speaker 6>He's 15 year old,</v>

5094
02:38:36.231 --> 02:38:37.011
<v Speaker 6>12 nine galleys,</v>

5095
02:38:37.011 --> 02:38:41.420
<v Speaker 6>finding the second hardest puncher in boxing or donors to Stevenson in Montreal</v>

5096
02:38:41.421 --> 02:38:42.900
<v Speaker 6>where you call it.</v>

5097
02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:44.330
<v Speaker 6>It's a tough fight.</v>

5098
02:38:44.570 --> 02:38:45.403
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5099
02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:47.300
<v Speaker 6>they asked me if I would train them at first.</v>

5100
02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:47.781
<v Speaker 6>Like I said,</v>

5101
02:38:47.781 --> 02:38:50.120
<v Speaker 6>I would say no 20 things the hardest punch your inbox.</v>

5102
02:38:50.390 --> 02:38:51.223
<v Speaker 6>Wilder,</v>

5103
02:38:51.450 --> 02:38:52.283
<v Speaker 6>wilder,</v>

5104
02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:56.660
<v Speaker 6>the old times would say he hit you on top of the head and fractured ankles.</v>

5105
02:38:58.490 --> 02:38:59.323
<v Speaker 6>That's hard.</v>

5106
02:39:00.650 --> 02:39:00.981
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5107
02:39:00.981 --> 02:39:01.400
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5108
02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:03.240
<v Speaker 6>Donna Stevenson is a hell of a puncher,</v>

5109
02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:04.910
<v Speaker 6>is the second hardest puncher in boxing,</v>

5110
02:39:04.911 --> 02:39:06.620
<v Speaker 6>lefthand southpaw on top of it.</v>

5111
02:39:07.130 --> 02:39:07.963
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

5112
02:39:08.390 --> 02:39:09.380
<v Speaker 6>when I flew out talks,</v>

5113
02:39:09.381 --> 02:39:10.121
<v Speaker 6>not to two nights,</v>

5114
02:39:10.121 --> 02:39:10.241
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

5115
02:39:10.241 --> 02:39:13.040
<v Speaker 6>if I'm going to say I'm either going to say no,</v>

5116
02:39:13.041 --> 02:39:14.660
<v Speaker 6>which my kids asked me not to.</v>

5117
02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:15.411
<v Speaker 6>So I said,</v>

5118
02:39:15.411 --> 02:39:19.250
<v Speaker 6>then I'll get a fly out and I got to meet him and when we had lunch with him and</v>

5119
02:39:19.251 --> 02:39:20.084
<v Speaker 6>the manager to,</v>

5120
02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:21.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5121
02:39:21.050 --> 02:39:21.710
<v Speaker 6>anyway,</v>

5122
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:22.910
<v Speaker 6>I'm sitting with them.</v>

5123
02:39:22.911 --> 02:39:24.500
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what they are for sure.</v>

5124
02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:24.860
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5125
02:39:24.860 --> 02:39:26.690
<v Speaker 6>the manager I knew for a while in a business,</v>

5126
02:39:26.691 --> 02:39:28.520
<v Speaker 6>but for sure you don't know to,</v>

5127
02:39:28.521 --> 02:39:29.354
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5128
02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:30.193
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>

5129
02:39:30.350 --> 02:39:31.580
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to try to find out.</v>

5130
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:34.010
<v Speaker 6>So the thinking was like,</v>

5131
02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:34.851
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5132
02:39:34.851 --> 02:39:36.080
<v Speaker 6>you're here to find out things.</v>

5133
02:39:36.081 --> 02:39:39.140
<v Speaker 6>Probably tomorrow in the gym and post we watch tape.</v>

5134
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:40.700
<v Speaker 6>So those are the things.</v>

5135
02:39:40.701 --> 02:39:41.000
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

5136
02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.140
<v Speaker 6>so I said to him right out,</v>

5137
02:39:42.141 --> 02:39:42.411
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

5138
02:39:42.411 --> 02:39:43.190
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5139
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:45.860
<v Speaker 6>I'm here to see one thing first.</v>

5140
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:48.890
<v Speaker 6>If you're a decent person.</v>

5141
02:39:49.970 --> 02:39:50.631
<v Speaker 6>And they were,</v>

5142
02:39:50.631 --> 02:39:50.931
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5143
02:39:50.931 --> 02:39:51.764
<v Speaker 6>they were like,</v>

5144
02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:53.353
<v Speaker 6>that sounds,</v>

5145
02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:53.631
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5146
02:39:53.631 --> 02:39:54.350
<v Speaker 6>maybe different,</v>

5147
02:39:54.350 --> 02:39:54.621
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5148
02:39:54.621 --> 02:39:55.840
<v Speaker 6>because you know.</v>

5149
02:39:55.870 --> 02:39:56.620
<v Speaker 6>But I said,</v>

5150
02:39:56.620 --> 02:39:59.300
<v Speaker 6>I just want to have your decent perfect cause I don't want to be around bear</v>

5151
02:39:59.301 --> 02:40:00.134
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

5152
02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:03.260
<v Speaker 6>I just want to be around and there's bad people out there.</v>

5153
02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:04.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it's the way it is,</v>

5154
02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:07.610
<v Speaker 6>but I don't want to be around bear people.</v>

5155
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.810
<v Speaker 6>I never did.</v>

5156
02:40:08.810 --> 02:40:10.520
<v Speaker 6>But now I definitely don't.</v>

5157
02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:11.810
<v Speaker 6>I want to be,</v>

5158
02:40:11.810 --> 02:40:13.220
<v Speaker 6>if I'm going to spend two months,</v>

5159
02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:15.060
<v Speaker 6>it's not easy in camp.</v>

5160
02:40:15.390 --> 02:40:16.470
<v Speaker 6>I want to be around someone.</v>

5161
02:40:16.471 --> 02:40:17.790
<v Speaker 6>I feel good about being around.</v>

5162
02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:21.150
<v Speaker 6>And so that's the first thing.</v>

5163
02:40:21.151 --> 02:40:22.830
<v Speaker 6>The second thing is too,</v>

5164
02:40:22.831 --> 02:40:23.820
<v Speaker 6>I think I can help them.</v>

5165
02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:25.140
<v Speaker 6>That was the second thing.</v>

5166
02:40:25.810 --> 02:40:26.643
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5167
02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:27.900
<v Speaker 6>And Kenny be helped.</v>

5168
02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:30.540
<v Speaker 6>So when you go to talk to someone like that,</v>

5169
02:40:30.541 --> 02:40:31.510
<v Speaker 6>do you watch a move?</v>

5170
02:40:31.530 --> 02:40:33.000
<v Speaker 6>What he'd seen his family,</v>

5171
02:40:33.001 --> 02:40:33.641
<v Speaker 6>first thing I did,</v>

5172
02:40:33.641 --> 02:40:35.310
<v Speaker 6>I want to wind up meeting his family.</v>

5173
02:40:35.311 --> 02:40:38.070
<v Speaker 6>He's got three young kids and he's a husband.</v>

5174
02:40:38.071 --> 02:40:38.970
<v Speaker 6>And of course,</v>

5175
02:40:38.971 --> 02:40:41.550
<v Speaker 6>and I see a decent person.</v>

5176
02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:45.720
<v Speaker 6>And then now my watch film and um,</v>

5177
02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:50.850
<v Speaker 6>I see a guy that has ideas that need to be added to that.</v>

5178
02:40:50.970 --> 02:40:51.980
<v Speaker 6>I think that's the best word.</v>

5179
02:40:52.770 --> 02:40:55.110
<v Speaker 6>They've got good ideas technically,</v>

5180
02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:56.850
<v Speaker 6>but they need to be advanced.</v>

5181
02:40:57.210 --> 02:40:59.160
<v Speaker 6>They need to be added too polished,</v>

5182
02:40:59.161 --> 02:40:59.641
<v Speaker 6>polished,</v>

5183
02:40:59.641 --> 02:41:00.110
<v Speaker 6>edited.</v>

5184
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.630
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

5185
02:41:00.630 --> 02:41:01.463
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

5186
02:41:01.790 --> 02:41:02.940
<v Speaker 6>taking down the road a little bit.</v>

5187
02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:04.253
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

5188
02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:07.050
<v Speaker 6>I see a guy who behaves like a fighter.</v>

5189
02:41:07.620 --> 02:41:09.240
<v Speaker 6>That's where it starts for me.</v>

5190
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:10.830
<v Speaker 6>Besides being a decent person,</v>

5191
02:41:11.130 --> 02:41:12.180
<v Speaker 6>he behaves like a fighter.</v>

5192
02:41:12.181 --> 02:41:13.014
<v Speaker 6>He got hurt.</v>

5193
02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:15.180
<v Speaker 6>He got dropped in a fiery behave like a fighter.</v>

5194
02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:18.240
<v Speaker 6>You have to be able to a fighter to be a fighter,</v>

5195
02:41:18.241 --> 02:41:19.530
<v Speaker 6>you have to be a fighter.</v>

5196
02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:20.220
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5197
02:41:20.220 --> 02:41:20.611
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5198
02:41:20.611 --> 02:41:21.444
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5199
02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:22.950
<v Speaker 6>well you would know that better than most.</v>

5200
02:41:22.951 --> 02:41:24.030
<v Speaker 6>So he,</v>

5201
02:41:24.031 --> 02:41:24.864
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5202
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:27.301
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5203
02:41:27.301 --> 02:41:28.830
<v Speaker 6>and there's one problem.</v>

5204
02:41:29.850 --> 02:41:32.580
<v Speaker 6>Every fight he gets hit at least once really clean.</v>

5205
02:41:32.730 --> 02:41:34.140
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that with this guy.</v>

5206
02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:34.980
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5207
02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:36.090
<v Speaker 6>He gets it more than once,</v>

5208
02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:37.320
<v Speaker 6>but he gets it clean.</v>

5209
02:41:37.950 --> 02:41:38.740
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5210
02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:39.400
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

5211
02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:42.660
<v Speaker 6>one time I used to fight him when I was trying to Bradley actually was,</v>

5212
02:41:42.930 --> 02:41:43.530
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

5213
02:41:43.530 --> 02:41:44.550
<v Speaker 6>you religious.</v>

5214
02:41:44.580 --> 02:41:45.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5215
02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:45.571
<v Speaker 6>I am.</v>

5216
02:41:45.571 --> 02:41:46.291
<v Speaker 6>And my own way.</v>

5217
02:41:46.291 --> 02:41:46.591
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

5218
02:41:46.591 --> 02:41:46.921
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

5219
02:41:46.921 --> 02:41:47.790
<v Speaker 6>I'm not into that.</v>

5220
02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:48.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm say,</v>

5221
02:41:48.540 --> 02:41:50.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm just using it as an example,</v>

5222
02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:51.233
<v Speaker 6>my way of saying,</v>

5223
02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:52.800
<v Speaker 6>I said I was brought up a Catholic,</v>

5224
02:41:52.801 --> 02:41:54.600
<v Speaker 6>I forget half the things they told me,</v>

5225
02:41:54.930 --> 02:41:59.240
<v Speaker 6>but I remember about they'd use to teach you've,</v>

5226
02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:02.010
<v Speaker 6>I'm probably pronouncing her when I'm going to need your help again,</v>

5227
02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:07.190
<v Speaker 6>but venial sins and mortal since the renew or the little ones you can live with,</v>

5228
02:42:07.570 --> 02:42:10.650
<v Speaker 6>you don't go and see the guy that's read the mortal ones.</v>

5229
02:42:10.650 --> 02:42:11.483
<v Speaker 6>You've got a problem.</v>

5230
02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:12.990
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

5231
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:15.110
<v Speaker 6>the way you box you've,</v>

5232
02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:17.130
<v Speaker 6>you make it moral sense,</v>

5233
02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:20.010
<v Speaker 6>it the venial sins domain crap,</v>

5234
02:42:20.130 --> 02:42:20.380
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5235
02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:21.960
<v Speaker 6>But you're make it more than once you're getting a hit,</v>

5236
02:42:21.961 --> 02:42:22.794
<v Speaker 6>clean,</v>

5237
02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:24.373
<v Speaker 6>unblocked,</v>

5238
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:25.980
<v Speaker 6>clean,</v>

5239
02:42:26.010 --> 02:42:28.620
<v Speaker 6>solid punches that sometimes you don't even see.</v>

5240
02:42:28.650 --> 02:42:29.720
<v Speaker 6>Like the providing the crop,</v>

5241
02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:29.960
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5242
02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:30.390
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

5243
02:42:30.390 --> 02:42:30.900
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

5244
02:42:30.900 --> 02:42:31.231
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

5245
02:42:31.231 --> 02:42:31.920
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

5246
02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:33.810
<v Speaker 6>So I said that's going to be corrected,</v>

5247
02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:34.410
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5248
02:42:34.410 --> 02:42:35.290
<v Speaker 6>So we corrected.</v>

5249
02:42:35.490 --> 02:42:37.110
<v Speaker 6>So how do you correct something like that.</v>

5250
02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:38.160
<v Speaker 6>You know what it is,</v>

5251
02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:38.760
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5252
02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:39.720
<v Speaker 6>You have to know what it is.</v>

5253
02:42:39.721 --> 02:42:41.160
<v Speaker 6>You have to see why he's getting hit.</v>

5254
02:42:41.450 --> 02:42:42.540
<v Speaker 6>But you gotta change.</v>

5255
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:44.410
<v Speaker 6>You gotta change the technique of way</v>

5256
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:46.920
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

5257
02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:47.701
<v Speaker 6>There's rules.</v>

5258
02:42:47.701 --> 02:42:49.110
<v Speaker 6>You got to it's life.</v>

5259
02:42:49.170 --> 02:42:50.240
<v Speaker 6>It's when you work with a garlic,</v>

5260
02:42:50.310 --> 02:42:51.510
<v Speaker 6>then you only have two months.</v>

5261
02:42:51.540 --> 02:42:53.320
<v Speaker 6>How much change can you affect in two months?</v>

5262
02:42:53.550 --> 02:42:58.230
<v Speaker 6>I worked with Bradley for the right wheels fight and he and he couldn't stand in</v>

5263
02:42:58.231 --> 02:43:01.170
<v Speaker 6>front of the guy and he went out and he moved around the guy and you know we</v>

5264
02:43:01.171 --> 02:43:01.351
<v Speaker 6>were,</v>

5265
02:43:01.351 --> 02:43:02.250
<v Speaker 6>we were fortunate.</v>

5266
02:43:02.730 --> 02:43:03.563
<v Speaker 6>We did okay.</v>

5267
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:04.500
<v Speaker 6>We made some change,</v>

5268
02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:07.410
<v Speaker 6>but I mean little things like,</v>

5269
02:43:07.411 --> 02:43:08.250
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you an example.</v>

5270
02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:09.001
<v Speaker 6>Rules,</v>

5271
02:43:09.001 --> 02:43:09.421
<v Speaker 6>rules,</v>

5272
02:43:09.421 --> 02:43:09.751
<v Speaker 6>rules,</v>

5273
02:43:09.751 --> 02:43:11.920
<v Speaker 6>simple things like where do you 12 punch from?</v>

5274
02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:12.501
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

5275
02:43:12.501 --> 02:43:13.120

5278
02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.150
<v Speaker 5>Don't throw jab from there because if you're too close he could time you were</v>

5279
02:43:19.151 --> 02:43:20.490
<v Speaker 5>right hand and we weren't heard.</v>

5280
02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:21.880
<v Speaker 5>Jabbers to beginning of things.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5283
02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:24.910
<v Speaker 5>it leads to good things.</v>

5284
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.870
<v Speaker 5>It's a great point.</v>

5285
02:43:25.900 --> 02:43:26.111
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5286
02:43:26.111 --> 02:43:26.680
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

5287
02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:30.250
<v Speaker 5>It's a terrible punch and so it's a horrible punch of your throat.</v>

5288
02:43:30.251 --> 02:43:31.084
<v Speaker 5>The wrong distance.</v>

5289
02:43:31.210 --> 02:43:32.530
<v Speaker 5>You drove from a little too close.</v>

5290
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:33.040
<v Speaker 5>Bang.</v>

5291
02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:35.530
<v Speaker 5>You get who we're right in no way.</v>

5292
02:43:35.650 --> 02:43:38.710
<v Speaker 5>You throw punches from love talking to all he got here.</v>

5293
02:43:38.711 --> 02:43:40.570
<v Speaker 5>We're right here and we'll provide the god he didn't.</v>

5294
02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:42.010
<v Speaker 5>All he knew was he got hit,</v>

5295
02:43:42.250 --> 02:43:45.280
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't know why you through the lab took in front,</v>

5296
02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:46.600
<v Speaker 5>right hand is there.</v>

5297
02:43:46.690 --> 02:43:47.523
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:48.910
<v Speaker 5>Get on a side,</v>

5299
02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:51.220
<v Speaker 5>troll punches from certain positions,</v>

5300
02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:54.220
<v Speaker 5>not allowed to draw punches are less.</v>

5301
02:43:54.221 --> 02:43:55.990
<v Speaker 5>They're from the right position</v>

5302
02:43:57.650 --> 02:44:01.640
<v Speaker 6>now you have to cause would tell me you have to</v>

5303
02:44:01.980 --> 02:44:06.710
<v Speaker 5>coal over and over and over and over word</v>

5304
02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:09.840
<v Speaker 6>again til they can't do it wrong if they want it to.</v>

5305
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.940
<v Speaker 6>It's got to become a habit.</v>

5306
02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:12.271
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5307
02:44:12.271 --> 02:44:15.780
<v Speaker 6>But you're not thinking about it where it's a habit and that takes a lot of work</v>

5308
02:44:15.781 --> 02:44:17.400
<v Speaker 6>and that takes understanding what it is.</v>

5309
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:18.840
<v Speaker 6>And it takes a lot of work.</v>

5310
02:44:18.841 --> 02:44:19.860
<v Speaker 6>You've got to be on him every time.</v>

5311
02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:21.060
<v Speaker 6>And it takes a guy,</v>

5312
02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:23.070
<v Speaker 6>they can put his ego in a pocket.</v>

5313
02:44:23.490 --> 02:44:24.241
<v Speaker 6>It's why you want to know,</v>

5314
02:44:24.241 --> 02:44:25.290
<v Speaker 6>do I have a good guy here?</v>

5315
02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:26.490
<v Speaker 6>Do I have a decent guy?</v>

5316
02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:30.090
<v Speaker 6>Because you're telling a guy who's already made it to a certain level without</v>

5317
02:44:30.091 --> 02:44:30.510
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

5318
02:44:30.510 --> 02:44:31.343
<v Speaker 6>He has,</v>

5319
02:44:32.430 --> 02:44:35.370
<v Speaker 6>and now you're telling them this things that he don't know.</v>

5320
02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:39.120
<v Speaker 6>So he's gotta be willing to be able to accept that.</v>

5321
02:44:40.110 --> 02:44:40.943
<v Speaker 6>And I'm</v>

5322
02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:46.920
<v Speaker 6>one of the things I like people that are unselfish and look all selfish to a</v>

5323
02:44:46.921 --> 02:44:47.754
<v Speaker 6>certain degree.</v>

5324
02:44:47.850 --> 02:44:48.301
<v Speaker 6>But again,</v>

5325
02:44:48.301 --> 02:44:48.900
<v Speaker 6>it's degrees.</v>

5326
02:44:48.900 --> 02:44:50.370
<v Speaker 6>How tough are you degrees?</v>

5327
02:44:50.850 --> 02:44:51.480
<v Speaker 6>All fighters,</v>

5328
02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:52.500
<v Speaker 6>a tough degrees.</v>

5329
02:44:52.501 --> 02:44:53.190
<v Speaker 6>How does,</v>

5330
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:54.930
<v Speaker 6>how selfish are you degrees?</v>

5331
02:44:56.010 --> 02:44:56.843
<v Speaker 6>And</v>

5332
02:44:59.730 --> 02:45:02.700
<v Speaker 6>the whole understanding was I would go to Oxnard for eight weeks,</v>

5333
02:45:02.701 --> 02:45:03.330
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5334
02:45:03.330 --> 02:45:04.163
<v Speaker 6>to train them,</v>

5335
02:45:04.650 --> 02:45:06.450
<v Speaker 6>but maybe I don't want to go to oxide,</v>

5336
02:45:07.050 --> 02:45:10.080
<v Speaker 6>but I'll go wherever I take it gives to fight it.</v>

5337
02:45:10.081 --> 02:45:12.690
<v Speaker 6>The best chance to win the weather,</v>

5338
02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:14.280
<v Speaker 6>the time zone.</v>

5339
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:16.800
<v Speaker 6>But the main thing why I go there,</v>

5340
02:45:17.700 --> 02:45:18.930
<v Speaker 6>he's got three young kids.</v>

5341
02:45:19.930 --> 02:45:21.420
<v Speaker 6>I'm not in the rocky movie.</v>

5342
02:45:22.310 --> 02:45:26.490
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to take them away from those kids for those eight weeks.</v>

5343
02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:27.120
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5344
02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:27.953
<v Speaker 6>That's not good.</v>

5345
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:29.460
<v Speaker 6>So how many,</v>

5346
02:45:29.610 --> 02:45:31.890
<v Speaker 6>so I took two weeks to decide to them.</v>

5347
02:45:31.980 --> 02:45:33.330
<v Speaker 6>He kept calling to manage up.</v>

5348
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.823
<v Speaker 6>He's a good kid.</v>

5349
02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:36.953
<v Speaker 6>He is.</v>

5350
02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:38.121
<v Speaker 6>And he kept calling them,</v>

5351
02:45:38.121 --> 02:45:38.951
<v Speaker 6>manage up and saying,</v>

5352
02:45:38.951 --> 02:45:39.784
<v Speaker 6>did you hear yet?</v>

5353
02:45:40.620 --> 02:45:42.150
<v Speaker 6>And of course he had,</v>

5354
02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:45.610
<v Speaker 6>so he's thinking like a good person or like,</v>

5355
02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:46.800
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't say good part.</v>

5356
02:45:46.801 --> 02:45:48.990
<v Speaker 6>He's taken like a person that wants to get what he wants to get,</v>

5357
02:45:49.140 --> 02:45:50.400
<v Speaker 6>but at the same time,</v>

5358
02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:52.290
<v Speaker 6>here's where the good part comes in,</v>

5359
02:45:52.291 --> 02:45:53.730
<v Speaker 6>or the self less pot.</v>

5360
02:45:54.660 --> 02:45:55.493
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

5361
02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:57.990
<v Speaker 6>if I have to go to New York,</v>

5362
02:45:58.020 --> 02:45:59.010
<v Speaker 6>I'll go to New York.</v>

5363
02:45:59.730 --> 02:46:00.960
<v Speaker 6>A lot of fighters don't do that.</v>

5364
02:46:01.350 --> 02:46:02.071
<v Speaker 6>They want help,</v>

5365
02:46:02.071 --> 02:46:03.330
<v Speaker 6>but they want it on their terms.</v>

5366
02:46:03.390 --> 02:46:04.200
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5367
02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:04.501
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

5368
02:46:04.501 --> 02:46:05.520
<v Speaker 6>if I have to go to New York,</v>

5369
02:46:05.521 --> 02:46:06.311
<v Speaker 6>I go to New York.</v>

5370
02:46:06.311 --> 02:46:07.410
<v Speaker 6>If I have to go to Montreal,</v>

5371
02:46:07.411 --> 02:46:07.651
<v Speaker 6>Canada,</v>

5372
02:46:07.651 --> 02:46:08.160
<v Speaker 6>Montreal,</v>

5373
02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:09.060
<v Speaker 6>please tell them that,</v>

5374
02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:10.030
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

5375
02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:11.270
<v Speaker 2>that spoke to me,</v>

5376
02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:13.190
<v Speaker 2>that I had this kid,</v>

5377
02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:16.100
<v Speaker 2>that selfless too to that extent.</v>

5378
02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:17.690
<v Speaker 2>And I could see was training him before.</v>

5379
02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5380
02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the name,</v>

5381
02:46:19.430 --> 02:46:20.420
<v Speaker 2>but it was a</v>

5382
02:46:22.450 --> 02:46:22.970
<v Speaker 2>decent guy.</v>

5383
02:46:22.970 --> 02:46:23.810
<v Speaker 2>He's 15 at all.</v>

5384
02:46:24.470 --> 02:46:24.900
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

5385
02:46:24.900 --> 02:46:27.380
<v Speaker 2>but he felt like when,</v>

5386
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:28.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5387
02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:32.570
<v Speaker 2>when he got dropped in a fight and we went back to the gym immediately,</v>

5388
02:46:32.571 --> 02:46:34.520
<v Speaker 2>that should be dealt with,</v>

5389
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:35.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5390
02:46:35.710 --> 02:46:37.790
<v Speaker 2>but it was back to just basic training.</v>

5391
02:46:37.791 --> 02:46:38.121
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

5392
02:46:38.121 --> 02:46:39.560
<v Speaker 2>rather than that specific,</v>

5393
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:40.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5394
02:46:40.510 --> 02:46:42.080
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that the guy's not good.</v>

5395
02:46:42.081 --> 02:46:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean it just that</v>

5396
02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:46.550
<v Speaker 2>everyone deals with things.</v>

5397
02:46:46.551 --> 02:46:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

5398
02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:47.600
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

5399
02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:49.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean it doesn't make me this or that,</v>

5400
02:46:49.580 --> 02:46:52.040
<v Speaker 2>but I just can do it the way I do it.</v>

5401
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:53.090
<v Speaker 2>And I do it.</v>

5402
02:46:53.091 --> 02:46:53.811
<v Speaker 2>I look at film,</v>

5403
02:46:53.811 --> 02:46:54.740
<v Speaker 2>when I went to see him,</v>

5404
02:46:54.741 --> 02:46:59.210
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple of pages written out already on things I saw on film that he does</v>

5405
02:46:59.211 --> 02:47:01.580
<v Speaker 2>well that daddy would have to correct.</v>

5406
02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:06.260
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing that he has to correct for this fight will be good if you</v>

5407
02:47:06.261 --> 02:47:06.771
<v Speaker 2>don't get hit,</v>

5408
02:47:06.771 --> 02:47:08.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean that'd be a damn good thing.</v>

5409
02:47:08.450 --> 02:47:13.450
<v Speaker 2>But the one really thing is you can't keep coming back in front of the guy at a</v>

5410
02:47:13.581 --> 02:47:16.520
<v Speaker 2>certain distance giving them a shot at you when he can punch like that.</v>

5411
02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:21.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's one thing he always winds up localized right back in front of the guy</v>

5412
02:47:23.180 --> 02:47:25.460
<v Speaker 2>and there's gotta be other options,</v>

5413
02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:27.230
<v Speaker 2>other places to go.</v>

5414
02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:28.993
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5415
02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:29.871
<v Speaker 2>I joke around,</v>

5416
02:47:29.871 --> 02:47:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I used to fund,</v>

5417
02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:32.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5418
02:47:32.001 --> 02:47:34.400
<v Speaker 2>different examples of different analogies.</v>

5419
02:47:34.401 --> 02:47:34.701
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

5420
02:47:34.701 --> 02:47:35.534
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

5421
02:47:35.780 --> 02:47:36.660
<v Speaker 2>whether you had a mother,</v>

5422
02:47:36.690 --> 02:47:40.730
<v Speaker 2>grandmother and had somebody when you were growing up told you don't hang out on</v>

5423
02:47:40.731 --> 02:47:41.564
<v Speaker 2>the corner.</v>

5424
02:47:44.420 --> 02:47:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5425
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:45.231
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5426
02:47:45.231 --> 02:47:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5427
02:47:45.620 --> 02:47:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

5428
02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Because nothing good can happen.</v>

5429
02:47:48.860 --> 02:47:49.011
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5430
02:47:49.011 --> 02:47:50.510
<v Speaker 2>don't hang out in front of the guy.</v>

5431
02:47:50.890 --> 02:47:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Not the good can happen or can happen.</v>

5432
02:47:52.670 --> 02:47:53.990
<v Speaker 2>So we go from there.</v>

5433
02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:54.321
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5434
02:47:54.321 --> 02:47:55.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot more to it.</v>

5435
02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:56.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5436
02:47:56.061 --> 02:47:56.481
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

5437
02:47:56.481 --> 02:47:57.201
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart guy.</v>

5438
02:47:57.201 --> 02:47:58.310
<v Speaker 2>He's got a beautiful family.</v>

5439
02:47:58.311 --> 02:47:59.720
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

5440
02:47:59.721 --> 02:48:00.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

5441
02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:01.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm so when do you start?</v>

5442
02:48:01.521 --> 02:48:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Because December 1st December 1st horses to fight,</v>

5443
02:48:04.671 --> 02:48:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I have to make a decision.</v>

5444
02:48:06.290 --> 02:48:06.980
<v Speaker 2>I have to,</v>

5445
02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:09.560
<v Speaker 2>it's either going to be an eight or a seven week camp.</v>

5446
02:48:10.010 --> 02:48:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5447
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:11.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5448
02:48:11.180 --> 02:48:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to feel,</v>

5449
02:48:12.171 --> 02:48:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to find out by asking them questions,</v>

5450
02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:18.650
<v Speaker 2>how quickly his body gets in shape because I know it sounds funny to the average</v>

5451
02:48:18.651 --> 02:48:19.221
<v Speaker 2>guy out there,</v>

5452
02:48:19.221 --> 02:48:20.990
<v Speaker 2>but if it's a week too long,</v>

5453
02:48:20.991 --> 02:48:21.680
<v Speaker 2>it could be bad.</v>

5454
02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:22.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5455
02:48:23.010 --> 02:48:23.843
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5456
02:48:23.900 --> 02:48:24.733
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

5457
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:26.480
<v Speaker 2>and he's overtrained in his career.</v>

5458
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:29.420
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to try to try,</v>

5459
02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:32.910
<v Speaker 2>it's not an exact science to have a feel for sure.</v>

5460
02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Be Age of seven weeks.</v>

5461
02:48:33.891 --> 02:48:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Did you monitor their heart rate the rest of the world?</v>

5462
02:48:36.650 --> 02:48:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

5463
02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:39.970
<v Speaker 2>So we have that stuff that we do that right.</v>

5464
02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:40.521
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5465
02:48:40.521 --> 02:48:43.000
<v Speaker 2>to see if there were a ton of pain when they wake up in the yes.</v>

5466
02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:43.611
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

5467
02:48:43.611 --> 02:48:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I depend on B.</v>

5468
02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:47.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stay and be asked you.</v>

5469
02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I depend on my eye more than any three cm song down.</v>

5470
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.851
<v Speaker 2>He seemed struggle.</v>

5471
02:48:52.851 --> 02:48:54.710
<v Speaker 2>And the trick is to not get there,</v>

5472
02:48:55.100 --> 02:48:56.420
<v Speaker 2>to try not to get there.</v>

5473
02:48:57.440 --> 02:48:57.941
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

5474
02:48:57.941 --> 02:48:58.940
<v Speaker 2>You tell them to take a few days,</v>

5475
02:48:59.270 --> 02:49:04.270
<v Speaker 2>but I try to see it before I see what w what I mean is if he had a hard day of</v>

5476
02:49:04.491 --> 02:49:05.324
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

5477
02:49:05.410 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I will just automatically give him a light day or maybe</v>

5478
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:09.083
<v Speaker 5>off the next day.</v>

5479
02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:11.240
<v Speaker 5>And like a lot of people won't because they're afraid,</v>

5480
02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:11.830
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5481
02:49:11.830 --> 02:49:12.570
<v Speaker 5>You gotta work,</v>

5482
02:49:12.570 --> 02:49:13.141
<v Speaker 5>you gotta work.</v>

5483
02:49:13.141 --> 02:49:13.610
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5484
02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:13.990
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5485
02:49:13.990 --> 02:49:14.271
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

5486
02:49:14.271 --> 02:49:15.960
<v Speaker 5>but I learned not to be afraid of that.</v>

5487
02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:16.870
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5488
02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:19.530
<v Speaker 5>So if I see he had a real and he looked great,</v>

5489
02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:20.680
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

5490
02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:25.110
<v Speaker 5>take off to wall or you sure take off tomorrow so we don't get there.</v>

5491
02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:25.800
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5492
02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:29.320
<v Speaker 5>To try to kind of like my father like preventative.</v>

5493
02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:31.890
<v Speaker 5>I said this is a new way of thinking though.</v>

5494
02:49:31.891 --> 02:49:34.440
<v Speaker 5>And it's such a smart way of thinking because for the longest time,</v>

5495
02:49:34.441 --> 02:49:35.790
<v Speaker 5>everybody just wanted to be tough.</v>

5496
02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:36.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5497
02:49:36.340 --> 02:49:37.470
<v Speaker 5>They just wanted to work harder.</v>

5498
02:49:37.471 --> 02:49:38.580
<v Speaker 5>But you got to work smarter.</v>

5499
02:49:38.610 --> 02:49:38.761
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5500
02:49:38.761 --> 02:49:39.594
<v Speaker 5>you do.</v>

5501
02:49:39.690 --> 02:49:40.410
<v Speaker 5>Less is more,</v>

5502
02:49:40.410 --> 02:49:41.190
<v Speaker 5>you know that Sam,</v>

5503
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:41.371
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

5504
02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:43.380
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes it really is sometimes,</v>

5505
02:49:43.381 --> 02:49:43.801
<v Speaker 5>sometimes,</v>

5506
02:49:43.801 --> 02:49:46.830
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes not because some people are fucking lazy and they're looking for</v>

5507
02:49:46.831 --> 02:49:47.670
<v Speaker 5>that easy way out.</v>

5508
02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:49.590
<v Speaker 5>You have to gauge that Jack to see it.</v>

5509
02:49:49.591 --> 02:49:50.580
<v Speaker 5>You have to know what you got to,</v>

5510
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:51.331
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

5511
02:49:51.331 --> 02:49:54.810
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes the real discipline driven guys are their own worst enemy in that</v>

5512
02:49:54.811 --> 02:49:55.230
<v Speaker 5>regard.</v>

5513
02:49:55.230 --> 02:49:55.530
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

5514
02:49:55.530 --> 02:49:56.430
<v Speaker 5>Pushed too far.</v>

5515
02:49:56.520 --> 02:49:56.970
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

5516
02:49:56.970 --> 02:49:57.990
<v Speaker 5>And this kid has been,</v>

5517
02:49:58.200 --> 02:49:58.531
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

5518
02:49:58.531 --> 02:49:59.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm not here to say what was,</v>

5519
02:50:00.150 --> 02:50:01.770
<v Speaker 5>but the kid has been in that place.</v>

5520
02:50:01.790 --> 02:50:02.370
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5521
02:50:02.370 --> 02:50:03.750
<v Speaker 5>And that's why they're coming to me.</v>

5522
02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:04.660
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

5523
02:50:04.770 --> 02:50:06.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm no better than anyone,</v>

5524
02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:09.150
<v Speaker 5>but I will understand that.</v>

5525
02:50:09.210 --> 02:50:10.050
<v Speaker 5>So when you were,</v>

5526
02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:11.760
<v Speaker 5>when you were saying seven weeks or eight weeks,</v>

5527
02:50:11.761 --> 02:50:12.660
<v Speaker 5>so either one when you,</v>

5528
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:14.340
<v Speaker 5>it's either going to be,</v>

5529
02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:15.990
<v Speaker 5>so my first day,</v>

5530
02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:17.070
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be a Monday.</v>

5531
02:50:17.220 --> 02:50:21.450
<v Speaker 5>So the first day in camp in Oxnard will either be October 8th,</v>

5532
02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:22.770
<v Speaker 5>or October 15th.</v>

5533
02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:23.720
<v Speaker 5>October.</v>

5534
02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:24.900
<v Speaker 5>We represent eight weeks,</v>

5535
02:50:24.901 --> 02:50:25.740
<v Speaker 5>October 15,</v>

5536
02:50:25.741 --> 02:50:26.574
<v Speaker 5>seven weeks.</v>

5537
02:50:26.970 --> 02:50:29.880
<v Speaker 5>And that would mean I would fly in on a Saturday,</v>

5538
02:50:30.030 --> 02:50:31.860
<v Speaker 5>get myself settled Sunday,</v>

02:50:35.430 --> 02:50:38.310
<v Speaker 5>and then start Monday with a structured schedule,</v>

5543
02:50:38.810 --> 02:50:39.643
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5544
02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:42.120
<v Speaker 5>with the ability to change at anytime.</v>

5545
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:43.140
<v Speaker 5>Because again,</v>

5546
02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:44.160
<v Speaker 5>you see,</v>

5547
02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:44.730
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

5548
02:50:44.730 --> 02:50:45.563
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5549
02:50:45.810 --> 02:50:47.610
<v Speaker 5>I remember years ago I was training fighters.</v>

5550
02:50:47.611 --> 02:50:47.851
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5551
02:50:47.851 --> 02:50:49.170
<v Speaker 5>I've been around 40 years already.</v>

5552
02:50:49.590 --> 02:50:52.350
<v Speaker 5>I remember been Gleason's when I moved down to Gleason's,</v>

5553
02:50:52.351 --> 02:50:53.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5554
02:50:53.070 --> 02:50:53.903
<v Speaker 5>many years ago,</v>

5555
02:50:54.180 --> 02:50:54.571
<v Speaker 5>30,</v>

5556
02:50:54.571 --> 02:50:55.404
<v Speaker 5>whatever it was,</v>

5557
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:57.510
<v Speaker 5>maybe more 35.</v>

5558
02:50:58.230 --> 02:50:59.063
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5559
02:50:59.370 --> 02:51:00.720
<v Speaker 5>so Gleason's was in Manhattan,</v>

5560
02:51:00.721 --> 02:51:01.570
<v Speaker 5>it's in Brooklyn output.</v>

5561
02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:02.371
<v Speaker 5>It was a man.</v>

5562
02:51:02.371 --> 02:51:03.360
<v Speaker 5>It was the place,</v>

5563
02:51:03.361 --> 02:51:03.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5564
02:51:03.900 --> 02:51:05.520
<v Speaker 5>and it was two blocks from Madison Square Garden.</v>

5565
02:51:05.610 --> 02:51:06.330
<v Speaker 5>It was kind of cool,</v>

5566
02:51:06.330 --> 02:51:06.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5567
02:51:06.930 --> 02:51:07.763
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

5568
02:51:08.100 --> 02:51:08.540
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5569
02:51:08.540 --> 02:51:09.251
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to find it.</v>

5570
02:51:09.251 --> 02:51:13.140
<v Speaker 5>And I remember I was the first guy there and not bragging or not,</v>

5571
02:51:13.290 --> 02:51:15.070
<v Speaker 5>but I mean you just,</v>

5572
02:51:15.470 --> 02:51:18.640
<v Speaker 5>I would make my guys drink water and he old time guys,</v>

5573
02:51:18.710 --> 02:51:19.560
<v Speaker 5>10 guys,</v>

5574
02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:23.370
<v Speaker 5>not because they knew it from scientific ed visit and say other than it was</v>

5575
02:51:23.371 --> 02:51:24.300
<v Speaker 5>passed down to them.</v>

5576
02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:25.560
<v Speaker 5>It was taboo.</v>

5577
02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:27.960
<v Speaker 5>It was just passed down to the tall drink water.</v>

5578
02:51:28.670 --> 02:51:29.700
<v Speaker 5>It makes you weak,</v>

5579
02:51:30.210 --> 02:51:30.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5580
02:51:30.541 --> 02:51:31.170
<v Speaker 5>you've got to be tough.</v>

5581
02:51:31.170 --> 02:51:31.800
<v Speaker 5>Don't drink wine.</v>

5582
02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:34.380
<v Speaker 5>So I was making my guys not only drink water,</v>

5583
02:51:34.381 --> 02:51:35.430
<v Speaker 5>drink a half a gallon,</v>

5584
02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:36.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean drink a lot of water.</v>

5585
02:51:36.930 --> 02:51:38.820
<v Speaker 5>So I remember some of the old timers,</v>

5586
02:51:38.821 --> 02:51:40.350
<v Speaker 5>would they be like talking about me?</v>

5587
02:51:40.351 --> 02:51:41.184
<v Speaker 5>They'd be like,</v>

5588
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:46.080
<v Speaker 5>it's a fixed this guy don't drink or don't follow what he's doing.</v>

5589
02:51:46.230 --> 02:51:47.330
<v Speaker 5>Because some of the fighters who say,</v>

5590
02:51:47.331 --> 02:51:50.380
<v Speaker 5>can I drink some water and get loan that water and,</v>

5595
02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:54.030
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

5596
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:56.250
<v Speaker 5>Don't give you cramps if you drink a large amount.</v>

5597
02:51:56.330 --> 02:51:57.440
<v Speaker 5>Very cold and yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You could go.</v>

5601
02:51:58.740 --> 02:52:00.870
<v Speaker 5>But now if we hydrate you,</v>

5602
02:52:01.170 --> 02:52:02.640
<v Speaker 5>it allows you to stay strong.</v>

5603
02:52:03.300 --> 02:52:06.070
<v Speaker 5>Try to drive a car because the desert with no water in the radiator,</v>

5604
02:52:06.220 --> 02:52:07.300
<v Speaker 2>you might have a problem.</v>

5605
02:52:08.770 --> 02:52:09.810
<v Speaker 2>You might and,</v>

5606
02:52:09.910 --> 02:52:10.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

5607
02:52:10.260 --> 02:52:10.830
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

5608
02:52:10.830 --> 02:52:13.900
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you and I'm not so all I was afraid no,</v>

5609
02:52:13.901 --> 02:52:15.640
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying that that place,</v>

5610
02:52:16.180 --> 02:52:18.460
<v Speaker 2>the thing was nobody drank water,</v>

5611
02:52:18.461 --> 02:52:19.294
<v Speaker 2>spit it out.</v>

5612
02:52:19.780 --> 02:52:22.600
<v Speaker 2>And I was making my guys drink and right in front of me.</v>

5613
02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:23.291
<v Speaker 2>Do you know though,</v>

5614
02:52:23.291 --> 02:52:24.250
<v Speaker 2>what was the difference?</v>

5615
02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:29.170
<v Speaker 2>I knew by learning.</v>

5616
02:52:29.380 --> 02:52:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I knew my father,</v>

5617
02:52:32.170 --> 02:52:32.861
<v Speaker 2>my father,</v>

5618
02:52:32.861 --> 02:52:33.694
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5619
02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:36.220
<v Speaker 2>talked about the importance of water.</v>

5620
02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:37.601
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5621
02:52:37.601 --> 02:52:38.411
<v Speaker 2>he was proud.</v>

5622
02:52:38.411 --> 02:52:39.244
<v Speaker 2>I was training.</v>

5623
02:52:39.610 --> 02:52:41.050
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was going to be a lawyer.</v>

5624
02:52:42.060 --> 02:52:45.110
<v Speaker 2>He went a little different but a,</v>

5625
02:52:45.140 --> 02:52:46.320
<v Speaker 2>he was proud that it,</v>

5626
02:52:46.390 --> 02:52:48.520
<v Speaker 2>so he would talk to me like he was like,</v>

5627
02:52:48.521 --> 02:52:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I just got a to Osmosis,</v>

5628
02:52:50.230 --> 02:52:51.041
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>

5629
02:52:51.041 --> 02:52:51.874
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

5630
02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I knew,</v>

5631
02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I knew water was healthy.</v>

5632
02:52:54.130 --> 02:52:58.030
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was important that you had to rehydrate yourself and yet you had to,</v>

5633
02:52:58.390 --> 02:53:01.600
<v Speaker 2>my father had a thing with water to my father would make,</v>

5634
02:53:01.601 --> 02:53:03.970
<v Speaker 2>my father got involved in my training in different ways.</v>

5635
02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:04.451
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5636
02:53:04.451 --> 02:53:09.130
<v Speaker 2>if my fighter was feeling a little weak or he had a cut and he was healing from</v>

5637
02:53:09.131 --> 02:53:11.050
<v Speaker 2>the cut by father would say,</v>

5638
02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:12.730
<v Speaker 2>set them down in the ocean.</v>

5639
02:53:13.090 --> 02:53:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Why Dad?</v>

5640
02:53:14.801 --> 02:53:17.560
<v Speaker 2>We're not taking a vacation part of them in the ocean.</v>

5641
02:53:18.610 --> 02:53:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

5642
02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:20.033
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

5643
02:53:20.110 --> 02:53:20.920
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5644
02:53:20.920 --> 02:53:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Let them go in the ocean,</v>

5645
02:53:22.270 --> 02:53:24.150
<v Speaker 2>let them soak cause his scar,</v>

5646
02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:25.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever you know is called,</v>

5647
02:53:25.390 --> 02:53:28.180
<v Speaker 2>let them soak it in the ocean and uh,</v>

5648
02:53:28.210 --> 02:53:29.400
<v Speaker 2>don't go to Coney island.</v>

5649
02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Thought that might not be good,</v>

5650
02:53:32.390 --> 02:53:33.223
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

5651
02:53:34.350 --> 02:53:35.320
<v Speaker 2>that might not heal you,</v>

5652
02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:37.690
<v Speaker 2>but change it might change.</v>

5653
02:53:37.691 --> 02:53:38.980
<v Speaker 2>It might be green when you come out,</v>

5654
02:53:40.330 --> 02:53:42.050
<v Speaker 2>you got something going on with the hulk.</v>

5655
02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:42.641
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5656
02:53:42.641 --> 02:53:43.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5657
02:53:43.390 --> 02:53:43.601
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5658
02:53:43.601 --> 02:53:44.710
<v Speaker 2>but so no,</v>

5659
02:53:44.711 --> 02:53:46.700
<v Speaker 2>he would tell me in a series where he said 30,</v>

5660
02:53:47.260 --> 02:53:48.093
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5661
02:53:48.370 --> 02:53:49.360
<v Speaker 2>send you a fighter.</v>

5662
02:53:49.870 --> 02:53:51.080
<v Speaker 2>If he's a little of,</v>

5663
02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:53.050
<v Speaker 2>he needs to be revitalized a little,</v>

5664
02:53:53.110 --> 02:53:55.320
<v Speaker 2>set them to the ocean that was swimming ocean.</v>

5665
02:53:55.320 --> 02:53:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Let them be in the sun and let them soak.</v>

5666
02:53:57.981 --> 02:53:58.571
<v Speaker 2>So whatever,</v>

5667
02:53:58.571 --> 02:54:00.340
<v Speaker 2>concealing the notion and,</v>

5668
02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:03.040
<v Speaker 2>and if he happens to swallow some water,</v>

5669
02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:06.670
<v Speaker 2>it's okay because I have no one wanted to swallow the seawater and the worst</v>

5670
02:54:06.671 --> 02:54:07.450
<v Speaker 2>thing in the world.</v>

5671
02:54:07.450 --> 02:54:08.170
<v Speaker 2>My father said,</v>

5672
02:54:08.170 --> 02:54:09.003
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

5673
02:54:09.070 --> 02:54:09.903
<v Speaker 2>Not the worst thing.</v>

5674
02:54:09.940 --> 02:54:10.780
<v Speaker 2>So one day,</v>

5675
02:54:10.781 --> 02:54:15.781
<v Speaker 2>I guess I got around to asking him why he was so into sending my fighters to the</v>

5676
02:54:16.541 --> 02:54:17.290
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

5677
02:54:17.290 --> 02:54:18.123
<v Speaker 2>And he told me he was,</v>

5678
02:54:18.190 --> 02:54:18.880
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

5679
02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:20.440
<v Speaker 2>that's how my father would say things.</v>

5680
02:54:20.770 --> 02:54:22.900
<v Speaker 2>He would just tell me things and that's where I would learn.</v>

5681
02:54:23.290 --> 02:54:24.340
<v Speaker 2>And he just said to me,</v>

5682
02:54:24.940 --> 02:54:26.710
<v Speaker 2>ocean is where all life came from.</v>

5683
02:54:27.130 --> 02:54:29.830
<v Speaker 2>All Life on earth started in the ocean,</v>

5684
02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:31.450
<v Speaker 2>microcosms,</v>

5685
02:54:31.451 --> 02:54:32.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call.</v>

5686
02:54:32.321 --> 02:54:34.000
<v Speaker 2>They didn't get into all technical stuff,</v>

5687
02:54:34.001 --> 02:54:37.900
<v Speaker 2>but he said it started in the ocean and it came out onto land.</v>

5688
02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:38.711
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

5689
02:54:38.711 --> 02:54:43.711
<v Speaker 2>all percentage of salt in our blood is the exact same percentage per skew begins</v>

5690
02:54:44.190 --> 02:54:45.160
<v Speaker 2>with a cubic gains.</v>

5691
02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:45.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5692
02:54:45.371 --> 02:54:46.100
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>

5693
02:54:46.100 --> 02:54:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

5694
02:54:48.310 --> 02:54:50.150
<v Speaker 2>probably not close to what he said,</v>

5695
02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:51.190
<v Speaker 2>but close enough,</v>

5696
02:54:51.570 --> 02:54:52.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5697
02:54:52.030 --> 02:54:55.180
<v Speaker 2>is the exact amount cubic inch as it is in the ocean.</v>

5698
02:54:55.390 --> 02:54:56.500
<v Speaker 2>We come from the ocean.</v>

5699
02:54:56.501 --> 02:54:57.940
<v Speaker 2>All life comes from the ocean.</v>

5700
02:54:58.210 --> 02:54:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Go back to where life came from.</v>

5701
02:55:00.970 --> 02:55:01.930
<v Speaker 2>That was enough for me.</v>

5702
02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:03.980
<v Speaker 2>My father was telling me anything.</v>

5703
02:55:03.981 --> 02:55:05.150
<v Speaker 2>My father told me that was it.</v>

5704
02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:07.340
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

5705
02:55:07.341 --> 02:55:08.174
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

5706
02:55:08.330 --> 02:55:09.020
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5707
02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:09.853
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5708
02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:10.910
<v Speaker 2>so a matter of fact,</v>

5709
02:55:10.911 --> 02:55:11.721
<v Speaker 2>he told me his story.</v>

5710
02:55:11.721 --> 02:55:14.450
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was going out with a girl,</v>

5711
02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:15.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5712
02:55:15.950 --> 02:55:20.950
<v Speaker 2>that had a little baby that had a Bolex and he told me,</v>

5713
02:55:22.521 --> 02:55:23.354
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

5714
02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:24.920
<v Speaker 2>and he was serious,</v>

5715
02:55:24.921 --> 02:55:26.150
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't say it otherwise,</v>

5716
02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:27.860
<v Speaker 2>but he said send it down.</v>

5717
02:55:27.861 --> 02:55:31.130
<v Speaker 2>He had a condominium and they told the beach and he said,</v>

5718
02:55:31.790 --> 02:55:33.200
<v Speaker 2>sent it down to Daytona Beach,</v>

5719
02:55:33.201 --> 02:55:37.700
<v Speaker 2>let them stay there for the summer and let her boy being the ocean and the sun</v>

5720
02:55:37.790 --> 02:55:39.020
<v Speaker 2>vitamin a vitamin D.</v>

5721
02:55:39.021 --> 02:55:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5722
02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:40.153
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

5723
02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5724
02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:42.230
<v Speaker 2>and it is street and his legs out.</v>

5725
02:55:43.270 --> 02:55:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5726
02:55:43.580 --> 02:55:44.630
<v Speaker 2>his legs or get straight.</v>

5727
02:55:44.631 --> 02:55:45.650
<v Speaker 2>They won't crazy,</v>

5728
02:55:45.651 --> 02:55:45.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5729
02:55:45.951 --> 02:55:46.970
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

5730
02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:48.200
<v Speaker 2>there was a cook in this to him.</v>

5731
02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:52.940
<v Speaker 2>His legs are good straight and he was right because by being in the ocean,</v>

5732
02:55:52.941 --> 02:55:53.930
<v Speaker 2>by being in the sun,</v>

5733
02:55:53.931 --> 02:55:55.880
<v Speaker 2>vitamin A and d healthy,</v>

5734
02:55:55.881 --> 02:55:56.510
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

5735
02:55:56.510 --> 02:56:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I guess part of it was the swimming and part of it was the ocean and part of it</v>

5736
02:56:00.291 --> 02:56:01.124
<v Speaker 2>was the sun,</v>

5737
02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:02.840
<v Speaker 2>but it was straight in his legs.</v>

5738
02:56:03.140 --> 02:56:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at he need him to the point where you had to put braces.</v>

5739
02:56:06.290 --> 02:56:07.123
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5740
02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:12.370
<v Speaker 2>but was there was a slight issue was the initial it was a dramatic no,</v>

5741
02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:13.660
<v Speaker 2>but did,</v>

5742
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:14.690
<v Speaker 2>but he say work.</v>

5743
02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:15.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5744
02:56:15.740 --> 02:56:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Was it right?</v>

5745
02:56:16.370 --> 02:56:17.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5746
02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:17.961
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5747
02:56:17.961 --> 02:56:19.670
<v Speaker 2>but we just think of braces,</v>

5748
02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:19.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5749
02:56:19.971 --> 02:56:20.804
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

5750
02:56:21.020 --> 02:56:21.853
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

5751
02:56:22.130 --> 02:56:23.810
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

5752
02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:24.710
<v Speaker 2>and it would heal.</v>

5753
02:56:24.711 --> 02:56:26.200
<v Speaker 2>He would say glitter cod.</v>

5754
02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Coney Ocean is salt water.</v>

5755
02:56:28.580 --> 02:56:30.680
<v Speaker 2>He owes the cut.</v>

5756
02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:31.970
<v Speaker 2>It will heal the clot.</v>

5757
02:56:32.430 --> 02:56:34.580
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fighters used to soak their facing Brian,</v>

5758
02:56:34.581 --> 02:56:34.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5759
02:56:34.701 --> 02:56:35.091
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5760
02:56:35.091 --> 02:56:35.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5761
02:56:35.301 --> 02:56:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Well Joe Frazier did.</v>

5762
02:56:36.420 --> 02:56:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5763
02:56:36.810 --> 02:56:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Did that really keep you that your skin tough and protect you from cuts or is</v>

5764
02:56:40.771 --> 02:56:41.870
<v Speaker 1>that an old wives tale?</v>

5765
02:56:42.460 --> 02:56:44.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a little bit of that old stuff.</v>

5766
02:56:44.290 --> 02:56:44.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5767
02:56:44.740 --> 02:56:45.670
<v Speaker 2>where we don't know.</v>

5768
02:56:45.810 --> 02:56:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5769
02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:48.280
<v Speaker 2>But they believed it and so,</v>

5770
02:56:48.340 --> 02:56:49.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5771
02:56:49.680 --> 02:56:51.100
<v Speaker 2>he'd smell like a pickle when he was,</v>

5772
02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:54.340
<v Speaker 2>when he was following with you,</v>

5773
02:56:54.341 --> 02:56:56.180
<v Speaker 2>get hungry in any hit you a lot of talking.</v>

5774
02:56:59.310 --> 02:57:01.200
<v Speaker 1>But other controversial training methods,</v>

5775
02:57:01.201 --> 02:57:03.990
<v Speaker 1>like a weightlifting for the longest time was thought to taboo,</v>

5776
02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:04.470
<v Speaker 1>taboo,</v>

5777
02:57:04.470 --> 02:57:05.280
<v Speaker 1>taboo,</v>

5778
02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:06.001
<v Speaker 1>holy field.</v>

5779
02:57:06.001 --> 02:57:10.020
<v Speaker 1>The Mackie shall stone Mackey shell stones training or Holyfield and moving him</v>

5780
02:57:10.021 --> 02:57:11.790
<v Speaker 1>up from a cruiser way to a heavyweight.</v>

5781
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:12.570
<v Speaker 1>He you true.</v>

5782
02:57:12.570 --> 02:57:14.640
<v Speaker 1>And it was a very light heavy weight at the beginning,</v>

5783
02:57:14.641 --> 02:57:15.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5784
02:57:15.180 --> 02:57:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Cruiserweight yeah,</v>

5785
02:57:16.370 --> 02:57:20.130
<v Speaker 1>we really essentially was and they just pack some meat on them Michael Spinks</v>

5786
02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:20.993
<v Speaker 1>with Yup,</v>

5787
02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:21.480
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

5788
02:57:21.480 --> 02:57:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Michael Spinks was really the first,</v>

5789
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:23.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5790
02:57:23.370 --> 02:57:27.360
<v Speaker 1>When he fought Larry Holmes and Mackey shall stone worked with Holyfield after</v>

5791
02:57:27.361 --> 02:57:27.690
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

5792
02:57:27.690 --> 02:57:28.141
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

5793
02:57:28.141 --> 02:57:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5794
02:57:28.940 --> 02:57:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5795
02:57:29.390 --> 02:57:30.223
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5796
02:57:30.590 --> 02:57:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Listen and Gleason,</v>

5797
02:57:32.300 --> 02:57:34.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go back to Gleason's the epicenter,</v>

5798
02:57:34.310 --> 02:57:35.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5799
02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:35.953
<v Speaker 2>to place</v>

5800
02:57:37.100 --> 02:57:37.933
<v Speaker 2>no water,</v>

5801
02:57:38.090 --> 02:57:38.800
<v Speaker 2>no weights.</v>

5802
02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:39.633
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5803
02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

5804
02:57:40.700 --> 02:57:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I used to have my fighters to wait if I felt,</v>

5805
02:57:45.410 --> 02:57:48.380
<v Speaker 2>if I felt that a fighter wasn't physically strong enough,</v>

5806
02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:49.880
<v Speaker 2>I put them on a weight program,</v>

5807
02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:51.020
<v Speaker 2>but I do it myself.</v>

5808
02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

5809
02:57:51.600 --> 02:57:53.120
<v Speaker 2>there was no strength coaches back then.</v>

5810
02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:53.601
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5811
02:57:53.601 --> 02:57:56.480
<v Speaker 2>but just the common sense program three days a week,</v>

5812
02:57:56.810 --> 02:57:57.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5813
02:57:57.290 --> 02:57:58.101
<v Speaker 2>eat protein,</v>

5814
02:57:58.101 --> 02:58:01.620
<v Speaker 2>of course you have to replenish yourself with the proper diet and all that</v>

5815
02:58:01.621 --> 02:58:02.160
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

5816
02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:02.790
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

5817
02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:05.700
<v Speaker 5>and do it at the right time in between the training where you're not killing,</v>

5818
02:58:05.701 --> 02:58:06.790
<v Speaker 5>you say overtraining.</v>

5819
02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:07.030
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5820
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.380
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5821
02:58:07.380 --> 02:58:08.390
<v Speaker 5>go spar entire,</v>

5822
02:58:08.490 --> 02:58:09.323
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

5823
02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:11.640
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to separation of workouts.</v>

5824
02:58:11.910 --> 02:58:16.890
<v Speaker 5>But if I had a slightly built guy that I taught two things and the second one is</v>

5825
02:58:16.891 --> 02:58:21.891
<v Speaker 5>one where probably sounds a little that you wouldn't have would normally connect</v>

5826
02:58:22.471 --> 02:58:23.070
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>

5827
02:58:23.070 --> 02:58:26.130
<v Speaker 5>But the first thing was if I thought he could physically be a little stronger,</v>

5828
02:58:26.700 --> 02:58:28.800
<v Speaker 5>not that he had to be fighting inside,</v>

5829
02:58:28.830 --> 02:58:30.290
<v Speaker 5>but when he did fight inside,</v>

5830
02:58:30.300 --> 02:58:31.680
<v Speaker 5>because that's face of your fighter,</v>

5831
02:58:31.890 --> 02:58:33.330
<v Speaker 5>you're going to wind up and walk quarters.</v>

5832
02:58:33.390 --> 02:58:34.680
<v Speaker 5>You are even though you say,</v>

5833
02:58:34.681 --> 02:58:35.910
<v Speaker 5>well I'm going to live on the outside.</v>

5834
02:58:35.970 --> 02:58:36.803
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5835
02:58:36.810 --> 02:58:39.060
<v Speaker 5>Until that day that the Guy Slips Your Jab and again,</v>

5836
02:58:39.330 --> 02:58:40.830
<v Speaker 5>now you live in any inside.</v>

5837
02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:43.260
<v Speaker 5>Are you ready to live on the inside for a minute?</v>

5838
02:58:43.590 --> 02:58:45.210
<v Speaker 5>So I believe that.</v>

5839
02:58:45.390 --> 02:58:49.740
<v Speaker 5>So I would make my guys two weights if I told physically they could get help and</v>

5840
02:58:49.741 --> 02:58:50.970
<v Speaker 5>improvement in those areas.</v>

5841
02:58:50.971 --> 02:58:54.000
<v Speaker 5>But I also did it for the psychological reason.</v>

5842
02:58:54.540 --> 02:58:57.990
<v Speaker 5>I felt that it's all psychological battle.</v>

5843
02:58:58.050 --> 02:58:59.790
<v Speaker 5>It's 75% psychological,</v>

5844
02:58:59.791 --> 02:59:04.791
<v Speaker 5>mental and you have to do any gene you can to help to fight her in that area.</v>

5845
02:59:04.950 --> 02:59:05.640
<v Speaker 5>Anything,</v>

5846
02:59:05.640 --> 02:59:06.271
<v Speaker 5>anything,</v>

5847
02:59:06.271 --> 02:59:09.870
<v Speaker 5>grab anything that's if there's something floating over your head are grabbing</v>

5848
02:59:10.290 --> 02:59:13.380
<v Speaker 5>anything and the mental part.</v>

5849
02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:14.280
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

5850
02:59:14.280 --> 02:59:15.780
<v Speaker 5>if you make them feel stronger,</v>

5851
02:59:17.010 --> 02:59:17.880
<v Speaker 5>he'll be stronger.</v>

5852
02:59:18.210 --> 02:59:19.710
<v Speaker 5>If that's something that,</v>

5853
02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:24.920
<v Speaker 5>that just gives him a little I older more of confidence and belief.</v>

5854
02:59:25.380 --> 02:59:25.891
<v Speaker 5>Now listen,</v>

5855
02:59:25.891 --> 02:59:26.460
<v Speaker 5>here's the,</v>

5856
02:59:26.460 --> 02:59:30.600
<v Speaker 5>here's the catch 22 maybe you don't want the guy fighting inside.</v>

5857
02:59:30.601 --> 02:59:31.530
<v Speaker 5>Maybe his style,</v>

5858
02:59:31.531 --> 02:59:34.990
<v Speaker 5>his makeup is the fight I get to because of the smart guys out there listening.</v>

5859
02:59:35.020 --> 02:59:35.853
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there are.</v>

5860
02:59:35.970 --> 02:59:37.920
<v Speaker 5>They're going to think that before he said it.</v>

5861
02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:38.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5862
02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:40.080
<v Speaker 5>I still want them to feel strong.</v>

5863
02:59:40.081 --> 02:59:40.914
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5864
02:59:41.100 --> 02:59:41.933
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to make,</v>

5865
02:59:41.940 --> 02:59:45.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to make a guide that should box like pinel where go was your box</v>

5866
02:59:45.901 --> 02:59:46.770
<v Speaker 5>like Muhammad Ali.</v>

5867
02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:49.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to let them Mike and fight like Jake Lamata.</v>

5868
02:59:49.560 --> 02:59:50.393
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

5869
02:59:50.430 --> 02:59:51.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay with that,</v>

5870
02:59:51.690 --> 02:59:53.430
<v Speaker 5>but I want them to feel stronger.</v>

5871
02:59:53.850 --> 02:59:54.683
<v Speaker 5>I fought them.</v>

5872
02:59:54.870 --> 02:59:56.520
<v Speaker 5>What kind of weightlifting would you have them do?</v>

5873
02:59:57.060 --> 02:59:57.840
<v Speaker 5>Because you're,</v>

5874
02:59:57.840 --> 03:00:00.060
<v Speaker 5>do you have a background in lifting weights yourself?</v>

5875
03:00:00.120 --> 03:00:00.360
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

5876
03:00:00.360 --> 03:00:00.601
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

5877
03:00:00.601 --> 03:00:02.010
<v Speaker 5>Other than I played football,</v>

5878
03:00:02.011 --> 03:00:02.970
<v Speaker 5>so he was around it.</v>

5879
03:00:03.370 --> 03:00:06.540
<v Speaker 5>And I've been around Jim's my whole life and,</v>

5880
03:00:06.640 --> 03:00:08.550
<v Speaker 5>and fitness people all my life.</v>

5881
03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:11.160
<v Speaker 5>So I understand the plyometrics.</v>

5882
03:00:11.161 --> 03:00:14.190
<v Speaker 5>I understood all the advancements or the new stuff that came out,</v>

5883
03:00:14.430 --> 03:00:15.300
<v Speaker 5>the bands that,</v>

5884
03:00:15.420 --> 03:00:15.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5885
03:00:15.751 --> 03:00:16.290
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5886
03:00:16.290 --> 03:00:16.771
<v Speaker 5>hey listen,</v>

5887
03:00:16.771 --> 03:00:20.430
<v Speaker 5>you've got to remember there was a guy named Charles Atlas that started with</v>

5888
03:00:20.431 --> 03:00:21.750
<v Speaker 5>resistance training,</v>

5889
03:00:21.770 --> 03:00:22.740
<v Speaker 5>who he was,</v>

5890
03:00:22.741 --> 03:00:22.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5891
03:00:22.950 --> 03:00:25.390
<v Speaker 5>somebody kicked sand in his face and his comic book.</v>

5892
03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:26.520
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5893
03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:26.951
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5894
03:00:26.951 --> 03:00:28.020
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

5895
03:00:28.021 --> 03:00:29.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it was related or not,</v>

5896
03:00:29.610 --> 03:00:30.443
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

5897
03:00:30.750 --> 03:00:31.740
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

5898
03:00:31.790 --> 03:00:31.990
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

5899
03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:33.210
<v Speaker 5>he did isometrics.</v>

5900
03:00:33.330 --> 03:00:34.710
<v Speaker 5>I believed in Isometrix.</v>

5901
03:00:34.860 --> 03:00:38.910
<v Speaker 5>I did isometrics for the whole camp with Michael Morell for the Holyfield fight.</v>

5902
03:00:38.911 --> 03:00:39.744
<v Speaker 5>Believe it or not.</v>

5903
03:00:39.990 --> 03:00:40.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5904
03:00:40.500 --> 03:00:44.370
<v Speaker 5>I used to put my hand here and I used to make him push against my hand,</v>

5905
03:00:44.550 --> 03:00:46.260
<v Speaker 5>but ways that we can push it,</v>

5906
03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:51.440
<v Speaker 5>I would design all kinds of different exercises in ways to do it where I just</v>

5907
03:00:52.021 --> 03:00:53.700
<v Speaker 5>gave him resistance with my own body,</v>

5908
03:00:54.330 --> 03:00:56.070
<v Speaker 5>sometimes push against my shoulder,</v>

5909
03:00:57.330 --> 03:00:57.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5910
03:00:57.581 --> 03:00:58.141
<v Speaker 5>and be careful.</v>

5911
03:00:58.141 --> 03:00:59.440
<v Speaker 5>The joints you won't in the,</v>

5912
03:00:59.560 --> 03:01:00.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5913
03:01:00.130 --> 03:01:01.330
<v Speaker 6>all common sense stuff.</v>

5914
03:01:01.380 --> 03:01:01.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5915
03:01:01.870 --> 03:01:02.560
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

5916
03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:03.100
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5917
03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:03.551
<v Speaker 6>so we,</v>

5918
03:01:03.551 --> 03:01:03.820
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

5919
03:01:03.820 --> 03:01:05.830
<v Speaker 6>this is something that you thought of yourself,</v>

5920
03:01:05.831 --> 03:01:08.500
<v Speaker 6>you were trying to figure out how to do it and then you just implemented it.</v>

5921
03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:09.393
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5922
03:01:09.730 --> 03:01:09.911
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5923
03:01:09.911 --> 03:01:12.340
<v Speaker 6>This is something that a Michael Moore man,</v>

5924
03:01:12.341 --> 03:01:13.390
<v Speaker 6>when he was a light heavyweight,</v>

5925
03:01:13.391 --> 03:01:14.950
<v Speaker 6>was a murderous puncher.</v>

5926
03:01:15.310 --> 03:01:16.730
<v Speaker 6>Murder murderous boy.</v>

5927
03:01:16.731 --> 03:01:17.290
<v Speaker 6>Oh boy.</v>

5928
03:01:17.290 --> 03:01:18.123
<v Speaker 6>Woo.</v>

5929
03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:19.090
<v Speaker 6>He was dangerous.</v>

5930
03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:20.140
<v Speaker 6>He was so scary.</v>

5931
03:01:20.141 --> 03:01:22.810
<v Speaker 6>But it seemed like the weight cut was too brutal.</v>

5932
03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:23.711
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5933
03:01:23.711 --> 03:01:24.670
<v Speaker 6>It was brutal.</v>

5934
03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:25.061
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5935
03:01:25.061 --> 03:01:25.750
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5936
03:01:25.750 --> 03:01:27.580
<v Speaker 6>he was a terrifying light heavyweight.</v>

5937
03:01:27.610 --> 03:01:27.851
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5938
03:01:27.851 --> 03:01:28.490
<v Speaker 6>He was,</v>

5939
03:01:28.490 --> 03:01:29.350
<v Speaker 6>I forgot about him.</v>

5940
03:01:29.380 --> 03:01:30.990
<v Speaker 6>They forgot about him as a light heavyweight.</v>

5941
03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:31.930
<v Speaker 6>He'd knocked everyone out.</v>

5942
03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:34.870
<v Speaker 6>Just don't think he went the distance with anybody.</v>

5943
03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:35.740
<v Speaker 6>He was murdering people.</v>

5944
03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:35.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5945
03:01:35.980 --> 03:01:37.210
<v Speaker 6>He was really something.</v>

5946
03:01:37.390 --> 03:01:37.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5947
03:01:37.860 --> 03:01:39.130
<v Speaker 6>And a first heavyweight,</v>

03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:39.520

<v Speaker 6>that'd be true.</v>

5957
03:01:46.900 --> 03:01:47.700
<v Speaker 6>I've been saying,</v>

5958
03:01:47.700 --> 03:01:48.580
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it is.</v>

5959
03:01:49.210 --> 03:01:49.840
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know.</v>

5960

5975
03:02:01.181 --> 03:02:01.420
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5976
03:02:01.420 --> 03:02:01.880
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5977
03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:03.200

03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:04.450
<v Speaker 6>you want to hear crazy thing.</v>

5979
03:02:04.890 --> 03:02:05.723
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5980
03:02:06.460 --> 03:02:07.293
<v Speaker 6>some people might,</v>

5981
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:08.343
<v Speaker 6>I hope they don't.</v>

5982
03:02:09.670 --> 03:02:10.270
<v Speaker 6>Whatever.</v>

5983
03:02:10.270 --> 03:02:12.430
<v Speaker 6>I hope they don't take it the wrong way,</v>

5984
03:02:12.431 --> 03:02:13.840
<v Speaker 6>but anyway,</v>

5985
03:02:15.130 --> 03:02:16.630
<v Speaker 6>it's meant to be the good way.</v>

5986
03:02:17.380 --> 03:02:18.213
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5987
03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:20.441
<v Speaker 6>I have a friend,</v>

5988
03:02:20.441 --> 03:02:21.190
<v Speaker 6>a very close friend.</v>

5989
03:02:21.190 --> 03:02:22.240
<v Speaker 6>I hate politicians.</v>

5990
03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:23.313
<v Speaker 6>I think they're phony,</v>

5991
03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:25.420
<v Speaker 6>but I have one that's,</v>

5992
03:02:26.130 --> 03:02:27.670
<v Speaker 6>he makes a live in a politician,</v>

5993
03:02:27.671 --> 03:02:29.110
<v Speaker 6>but he don't live as a politician.</v>

5994
03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:30.113
<v Speaker 6>Does that make sense?</v>

5995
03:02:30.420 --> 03:02:32.730
<v Speaker 6>I know he saying he's took both president of stand on,</v>

5996
03:02:32.750 --> 03:02:37.120
<v Speaker 6>his name is Jimmy Hall and I'm probably go crazy if he hears this put anyway.</v>

5997
03:02:37.750 --> 03:02:38.583
<v Speaker 6>It's okay.</v>

5998
03:02:39.010 --> 03:02:39.671
<v Speaker 6>He's a little crazy.</v>

5999
03:02:39.671 --> 03:02:39.941
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>

6000
03:02:39.941 --> 03:02:40.810
<v Speaker 6>that's why we get along.</v>

6001
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.950
<v Speaker 6>But he's a good man.</v>

6002
03:02:42.460 --> 03:02:43.293
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

6003
03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:45.550
<v Speaker 6>like my father was born to be a doctor.</v>

6004
03:02:45.551 --> 03:02:46.330
<v Speaker 6>He was my,</v>

6005
03:02:46.330 --> 03:02:46.530
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

6006
03:02:46.530 --> 03:02:47.363
<v Speaker 6>his mother knew it.</v>

6007
03:02:48.100 --> 03:02:49.450
<v Speaker 6>He was born to be,</v>

6008
03:02:51.490 --> 03:02:52.323
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

6009
03:02:52.450 --> 03:02:53.870
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to use the word politician.</v>

6010
03:02:53.871 --> 03:02:55.230
<v Speaker 6>Seems like a dirty word leader.</v>

6011
03:02:55.540 --> 03:02:55.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6012

6017
03:03:00.941 --> 03:03:01.774
<v Speaker 6>maybe whatever.</v>

6018
03:03:01.780 --> 03:03:02.613
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

6019
03:03:03.070 --> 03:03:06.630
<v Speaker 6>so he's the boat president of Santa and he,</v>

6068
03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>They come and they allow me to have a successful dinner because they come and</v>

6069
03:04:11.841 --> 03:04:13.990
<v Speaker 2>they don't get a sense because nobody gets upset.</v>

6070
03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:15.500
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

6072
03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:20.360

6073
03:04:20.930 --> 03:04:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I have these things that I just say sometimes.</v>

6074
03:04:23.930 --> 03:04:25.190
<v Speaker 2>So he caught me one time,</v>

6075
03:04:25.250 --> 03:04:26.480
<v Speaker 2>but I was just saying it,</v>

6076
03:04:26.750 --> 03:04:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that it was going to register,</v>

6077
03:04:28.580 --> 03:04:28.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6078
03:04:28.821 --> 03:04:29.870
<v Speaker 2>because it's just something,</v>

6079
03:04:30.410 --> 03:04:31.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6080
03:04:31.580 --> 03:04:32.520
<v Speaker 2>so I just said</v>

03:04:34.310 --> 03:04:35.143
<v Speaker 2>people bad.</v>

6082
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.991
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>

6083
03:04:35.991 --> 03:04:36.824
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

6084
03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:38.510
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

6085
03:04:38.510 --> 03:04:39.343
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6086
03:04:39.790 --> 03:04:40.623
<v Speaker 2>because what you say?</v>

6087
03:04:41.060 --> 03:04:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

6088
03:04:41.420 --> 03:04:41.850
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

6089
03:04:41.850 --> 03:04:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

6090
03:04:42.420 --> 03:04:44.660
<v Speaker 2>you know what words to live by people bad.</v>

6091
03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:45.820
<v Speaker 2>So I've choking her.</v>

6092
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:47.000
<v Speaker 2>But he said people bad.</v>

6093
03:04:47.630 --> 03:04:49.040
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>

6094
03:04:49.041 --> 03:04:49.460
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

6095
03:04:49.460 --> 03:04:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

6096
03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

6097
03:04:50.450 --> 03:04:51.560
<v Speaker 2>people bad.</v>

6098
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:52.191
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

6099
03:04:52.191 --> 03:04:52.910
<v Speaker 2>but you help,</v>

6100
03:04:52.910 --> 03:04:53.870
<v Speaker 2>you're in a business.</v>

6101
03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

6102
03:04:54.830 --> 03:04:56.000
<v Speaker 2>there's good people too.</v>

6103
03:04:56.930 --> 03:04:57.763
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

6104
03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.970
<v Speaker 2>about a month ago,</v>

6105
03:04:59.240 --> 03:04:59.811
<v Speaker 2>two months ago,</v>

6106
03:04:59.811 --> 03:05:00.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

6107
03:05:00.350 --> 03:05:01.510
<v Speaker 2>he comes up to me and he says,</v>

6108
03:05:01.511 --> 03:05:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you've got to think I'm out of my mind.</v>

6109
03:05:03.230 --> 03:05:03.531
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

6110
03:05:03.531 --> 03:05:03.621
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6111
03:05:03.621 --> 03:05:03.771
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6112
03:05:03.771 --> 03:05:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

6113
03:05:04.450 --> 03:05:05.540
<v Speaker 2>but for what?</v>

6114
03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:06.560
<v Speaker 2>What's the matter?</v>

6115
03:05:06.950 --> 03:05:07.783
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

6116
03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:09.650
<v Speaker 2>with your permission,</v>

6117
03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I want to take a domain,</v>

6118
03:05:11.901 --> 03:05:13.400
<v Speaker 2>which I barely know what that means.</v>

6119
03:05:13.760 --> 03:05:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Copyright to the phrase people bad.</v>

6120
03:05:17.960 --> 03:05:18.793
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

6121
03:05:20.270 --> 03:05:23.720
<v Speaker 2>if I told you I wanted to start a business with you and me and the proceeds,</v>

6122
03:05:24.260 --> 03:05:26.210
<v Speaker 2>some of the proceeds will go to the foundation.</v>

6123
03:05:26.570 --> 03:05:27.710
<v Speaker 2>We sell shorts would do that.</v>

6124
03:05:28.010 --> 03:05:29.600
<v Speaker 2>And you have these different sayings.</v>

6125
03:05:29.870 --> 03:05:30.920
<v Speaker 2>So to start with people,</v>

6126
03:05:30.921 --> 03:05:31.754
<v Speaker 2>bad</v>

6127
03:05:33.050 --> 03:05:33.801
<v Speaker 2>resiliency,</v>

6128
03:05:33.801 --> 03:05:34.371
<v Speaker 2>good people,</v>

03:05:34.371 --> 03:05:36.320
<v Speaker 2>bad forgiveness,</v>

6130
03:05:36.321 --> 03:05:37.131
<v Speaker 2>good people,</v>

6131
03:05:37.131 --> 03:05:38.870
<v Speaker 2>bad be better people,</v>

6132
03:05:38.871 --> 03:05:40.730
<v Speaker 2>bad parks,</v>

6133
03:05:40.731 --> 03:05:41.564
<v Speaker 2>good</v>

6134
03:05:42.890 --> 03:05:43.281
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

6135
03:05:43.281 --> 03:05:44.114
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

6136
03:05:44.360 --> 03:05:45.193
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6137
03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:46.191
<v Speaker 2>redemption,</v>

6138
03:05:46.191 --> 03:05:48.440
<v Speaker 2>good people bad.</v>

6139
03:05:49.490 --> 03:05:50.600
<v Speaker 2>That's be bad,</v>

6140
03:05:50.630 --> 03:05:50.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6141
03:05:50.901 --> 03:05:51.321
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

6142
03:05:51.321 --> 03:05:56.321
<v Speaker 2>But the whole idea is to be unapologetic and to say we got a problem.</v>

6143
03:05:57.860 --> 03:05:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you want to say we're at a tilting point,</v>

6144
03:06:00.170 --> 03:06:01.010
<v Speaker 2>but we got a problem.</v>

6145
03:06:01.040 --> 03:06:02.360
<v Speaker 2>If my as social genius,</v>

6146
03:06:02.361 --> 03:06:03.800
<v Speaker 2>no am I is saint.</v>

6147
03:06:03.801 --> 03:06:04.634
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6148
03:06:05.240 --> 03:06:06.200
<v Speaker 2>but I got kids.</v>

6149
03:06:07.100 --> 03:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>I care about what the world is.</v>

6150
03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:11.083
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6151
03:06:11.120 --> 03:06:12.710
<v Speaker 2>maybe if I didn't have kids that still care</v>

6152
03:06:14.210 --> 03:06:15.800
<v Speaker 2>and I have grandchildren now,</v>

6153
03:06:15.801 --> 03:06:16.411
<v Speaker 2>I have two of them.</v>

6154
03:06:16.411 --> 03:06:17.244
<v Speaker 2>They're beautiful.</v>

6155
03:06:17.720 --> 03:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>

6156
03:06:21.130 --> 03:06:22.430
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of bad people out there.</v>

6157
03:06:22.910 --> 03:06:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not apologize or about saying that.</v>

6158
03:06:24.651 --> 03:06:25.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of great people,</v>

6159
03:06:26.270 --> 03:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>there's more good people,</v>

6160
03:06:28.100 --> 03:06:29.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

6161
03:06:29.550 --> 03:06:31.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like turning a battle line,</v>

6162
03:06:32.430 --> 03:06:33.770
<v Speaker 2>a line of resistance.</v>

6163
03:06:33.771 --> 03:06:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

6164
03:06:34.570 --> 03:06:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Where I want to call people out on it.</v>

6165
03:06:37.850 --> 03:06:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I want to remind us that we could be better.</v>

6166
03:06:39.920 --> 03:06:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I want to remind us that people bad selfishness,</v>

6167
03:06:44.841 --> 03:06:45.674
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

6168
03:06:46.800 --> 03:06:47.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

6169
03:06:47.120 --> 03:06:47.780
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

6170
03:06:47.780 --> 03:06:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I just want to too.</v>

6171
03:06:50.210 --> 03:06:53.570
<v Speaker 2>He brought my attention to it because I used to use that phrase so frequently</v>

6172
03:06:53.940 --> 03:06:56.880
<v Speaker 2>when I was mad and he said,</v>

6173
03:06:56.881 --> 03:06:59.100
<v Speaker 2>that's turn your med into something better,</v>

6174
03:06:59.880 --> 03:07:00.330
<v Speaker 2>teddy.</v>

6175
03:07:00.330 --> 03:07:03.140
<v Speaker 2>That's debts because I know what you stand for.</v>

6176
03:07:03.141 --> 03:07:03.630
<v Speaker 2>I know I,</v>

6177
03:07:03.630 --> 03:07:06.750
<v Speaker 2>that's why I give you what I give you 22 years.</v>

6178
03:07:07.290 --> 03:07:10.320
<v Speaker 2>So people are bad,</v>

6179
03:07:10.770 --> 03:07:11.200
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

6180
03:07:11.200 --> 03:07:12.033
<v Speaker 2>they're good.</v>

6181
03:07:12.510 --> 03:07:13.343
<v Speaker 2>They're good.</v>

6182
03:07:13.500 --> 03:07:16.830
<v Speaker 2>That's remind people that we need to be good,</v>

6183
03:07:17.070 --> 03:07:18.090
<v Speaker 2>that remind people,</v>

6184
03:07:18.091 --> 03:07:19.440
<v Speaker 2>that's called them on a crap.</v>

6185
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:21.420
<v Speaker 2>That's that we can say,</v>

6186
03:07:21.510 --> 03:07:22.343
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

6187
03:07:22.440 --> 03:07:23.370
<v Speaker 2>we gotta be better.</v>

6188
03:07:24.180 --> 03:07:26.130
<v Speaker 2>We've got to care about the right things.</v>

6189
03:07:26.600 --> 03:07:29.040
<v Speaker 2>We've got to stop getting caught up in our crap.</v>

6190
03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:30.503
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6191
03:07:30.690 --> 03:07:34.590
<v Speaker 2>and we gotta be stronger people.</v>

6192
03:07:34.591 --> 03:07:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Bed.</v>

6193
03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Don't be weak,</v>

6194
03:07:36.750 --> 03:07:37.583
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

6195
03:07:37.800 --> 03:07:39.180
<v Speaker 2>But in other words,</v>

6196
03:07:39.181 --> 03:07:40.120
<v Speaker 2>we're using it to,</v>

6197
03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:43.460
<v Speaker 2>to remind people that sometimes we'll go in,</v>

6198
03:07:43.461 --> 03:07:44.430
<v Speaker 2>in a bad direction.</v>

6199
03:07:44.910 --> 03:07:45.420
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>

6200
03:07:45.420 --> 03:07:46.171
<v Speaker 2>look at the world,</v>

6201
03:07:46.171 --> 03:07:46.650
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

6202
03:07:46.650 --> 03:07:46.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6203
03:07:46.891 --> 03:07:48.780
<v Speaker 2>when I was flying here was reading the New York Post.</v>

6204
03:07:49.050 --> 03:07:52.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how when people think of week or something,</v>

6205
03:07:52.530 --> 03:07:56.220
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want to read some of the stories about some of these kids that got</v>

6206
03:07:56.221 --> 03:07:56.660
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>

6207
03:07:56.660 --> 03:07:57.000
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

6208
03:07:57.000 --> 03:08:02.000
<v Speaker 2>there was a story about a parent that someone at a hospital in Manhattan that</v>

6209
03:08:03.811 --> 03:08:06.450
<v Speaker 2>decided to slice up a bunch of infants,</v>

6210
03:08:06.870 --> 03:08:07.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6211
03:08:07.530 --> 03:08:09.350
<v Speaker 2>just ran to the hallway of tos.</v>

6212
03:08:09.700 --> 03:08:14.700
<v Speaker 2>His place was for Chinese immigrants that they go to this place where now young</v>

6213
03:08:15.241 --> 03:08:20.241
<v Speaker 2>mothers where they think it's a safe haven for the children to be there for like</v>

6214
03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:22.050
<v Speaker 2>a month.</v>

6215
03:08:22.050 --> 03:08:23.900
<v Speaker 2>And so they infants two days old,</v>

6216
03:08:23.901 --> 03:08:24.734
<v Speaker 2>five days old,</v>

6217
03:08:25.290 --> 03:08:26.123
<v Speaker 2>10 days old,</v>

6218
03:08:26.220 --> 03:08:26.911
<v Speaker 2>and they're all in.</v>

6219
03:08:26.911 --> 03:08:29.370
<v Speaker 2>It was all Chinese immigrants and they're all in there.</v>

6220
03:08:29.880 --> 03:08:34.880
<v Speaker 2>These babies and this woman walks in there with a knife and start stabbing these</v>

6221
03:08:35.791 --> 03:08:36.624
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

6222
03:08:36.930 --> 03:08:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Now listen,</v>
