WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.530
Sure.
Okay.

2
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.570
<v 1>Grounds.
You</v>

3
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.180
shouldn't stay

4
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.613
Barrick.

5
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.750
<v 0>So what did you say?
They're saying some of the nose that every,</v>

6
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.760
what they're thumbing their nose at every victim in Hebrew victim in here coming

7
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.993
in

8
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.110
as we're saying before we were rudely cut off,
rudely cut off.
We uh,

9
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.990
we started earlier but we didn't have any sound.

10
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.100
Something was going on with the youth stream feed.

11
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:58.800
So we decided to Redo everything and uh,
you know,
saying this is,

12
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.930
this is a very strange song.
Well,

13
00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:05.240
I mean it's strange that anybody would actually record it.
There's,

14
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.720
I think that there's something sad about it.

15
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.110
I mean there's something like kind of pathetic about the passion and the guy's

16
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:14.570
voice.
You know what I mean?
Like he sounds like a,

17
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:18.460
it's like a baby was like an infant.
Like he's believes everything.

18
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.730
That guy believes everything.
And he's like,
you know,
I'm going to do my part.

19
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:23.680
I'm going to make a song.
Brian,
what the fuck are you doing?

20
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.100
I just fucked a cup of flashlights.
Brian set up.

21
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.710
That was mad complicated.
Yeah.
We fucked up folks that we had a,

22
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.910
we had a serious issue.
We couldn't get any sound.
Hmm.
It was ugly.
And uh,

23
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.760
Brian pulled it together.
Somehow or another we had to swap laptops.

24
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:43.270
I think my laptop sound port might've shit the bed fucking Max.

25
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.710
Amazing.
It's because you fucking merch queer.
Um,

26
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.750
shut that song off before it rots my brain.
Right now

27
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.130
I'm here with Duncan Trussell Patriot,
ladies and gentlemen.
A true,
true patriot.

28
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.370
A man of the people.
That's right.
And a big supporter of the fleshlight.

29
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:06.480
Is that correct?
Duncan and the tea party.
You support the tea party as well?
Yeah.

30
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.130
And the flashlight.
Yeah.
I sat down real quick.

31
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.380
So this is our sponsor is our s commercial part of the show here.

32
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.010
The fleshlight,
ladies and gentlemen,
if you've never used one,

33
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.070
I don't recommend you jump right into the butthole version.

34
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.880
Start off with a dick one.
What?
No,
don't do that.

35
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.040
But you can keep this on your refrigerator and nobody would think you're

36
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:29.190
appropriate.
It's like a little beer camp.
Who keeps it beer in the refrigerator.

37
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.940
You don't,
what are you doing?
You want to be here?
Oh,
I thought you said freezer.

38
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.920
I really heard you say freezer.
Why do weird,
I swear to God,

39
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:42.600
I heard Freezer Duncan Trussell standup comedian.
Good Pal,
former roommate.

40
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.170
He's on the show today.
Duncan,
thank you very much for coming on board.

41
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.080
Thanks for having me on.
I'm sorry we were so fucked up.
Put your headphones on.

42
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:52.860
So share what you sound like.
You'd rather not.
I want you to though.

43
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.120
Hate my voice.
Either way,
my voice sounds,
let's try it.

44
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:58.490
You can't hear it when you're a hello.

45
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.400
Hello.
Here we are.
So for people who don't know you,
Duncan,
Duncan,
Trussell,

46
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.760
t r u two SS e two L's

47
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.230
<v 2>dot com find out all kinds of shit about you.</v>

48
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.630
Sort of find out about your bio.

49
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.410
Do you ever get chicks that I've seen you online seeing some of the stuff that

50
00:03:19.411 --> 00:03:22.530
you've done and say,
I don't like send you an email?
Like,
wow,
I think,
uh,

51
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.610
I think you're really creative.

52
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.690
<v 0>Yeah.
It's the best.</v>

53
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:30.480
It happens once every equinox at the most,
but on occasion I,

54
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.810
yeah,
anytime you get really creative.
Yeah.
I really think you're cool.

55
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.250
I liked your website by the way.
It's very trippy and crazy.

56
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.740
It's really fun to get stoned and explore your website together.
Yeah,

57
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:46.030
I built the whole thing.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's cool.
I love the choice of music.
Oh,

58
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.910
Calypso John Denver.
And do you have to do,

59
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.050
have to have rights to use that music or just until anybody tells ya?

60
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.120
I'm just waiting for the cease and it says from,
fuck man,

61
00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:00.120
I'm not going to happen.
It should be free.
It's dead.

62
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.140
You should should be free like Michael Jackson.

63
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.150
We should all be able to sell and make money off of him.

64
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.430
Can I give a lot to make money off the phone?

65
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.190
But you should be able to just listen to his music.
You shouldn't have to pay.

66
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:13.150
He's dead.
He's dead.
Can I,
can I give some John Denver Trivia?
Sure.

67
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.510
Supposedly.
And you know,
I don't know where I heard this from,

68
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:18.990
but it seems like it came from a good source.
He,

69
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:23.320
his corpse when they found his corpse was being eaten by starfish.

70
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.300
Whoa.
Yeah.
So has starfish.
Yeah.
So he crashed in the ocean,

71
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:31.900
crashing the ocean,
and he was being,
I guess anyone who crashes in the ocean,

72
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:32.501
it's going to happen,

73
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.010
but somehow there's something either really beautiful about that are really,

74
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.820
really fucked up.
But starfish were devouring his corpse.

75
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.560
It wasn't he in some sort of a,
um,
it was some sort of a test plane or a,

76
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:48.730
um,
it w w it wasn't what it was like,
what was it?
What kind of plane was it?

77
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.600
I knew it was one of those planes that kills rock stars.
It's like,

78
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:55.390
what the fuck is it with rock stars that they get in the shittiest planes and

79
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.570
fly over bodies of water?
It's like,
you know,
that's how you're,
you know,

80
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:01.690
you're going to die if you're in a little plane with a band.
Oh,

81
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.740
it was like a one in four chance you're dead if you're filming videos like in

82
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:08.070
The Bahamas and shit like that.
That's just how you got a role.

83
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.700
You got to get one of those propeller planes.

84
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.090
I know that in one of those a couple of years ago when went to alumni,

85
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.570
when all your land in Honolulu and then you'd take a little puddle jumper,

86
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.740
it's fucking spooky,
man.
It's the worst.
That's some old technology son.

87
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.880
But it's like God waits for their bands to getting those little planes and then

88
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:27.880
strikes him.
You should know that that's the living Stevie Ray Vaughan.

89
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.750
How many guys went down from planes and helicopters and shit?
Yeah,

90
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.080
if you're on a puddle jumper with Depeche mode,
you're dead.

91
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.100
Forget it.
Cause you're gone.
Been very horny to think about how many fucking

92
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.190
<v 2>people,
how many people big bopper and um,
buddy Holly,
right?
Yep.</v>

93
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.340
They died.
Um,
Leonard's Kennard right.
Gone.

94
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.870
Stevie Ray Vaughan helicopter.
Yeah.
Rocky Marciano plane crash.

95
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.140
I know he's not,
but I'm throwing them there.
Anyway.
Kurt Cobain,

96
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.890
<v 0>it's the same idea.
Get off those foot.
But for real,
if you're,
if you're a,
yeah.</v>

97
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.840
What about j what?
Kurt Cobain and Courtney love?
Lisa left getting a plane.

98
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.400
No,
Courtney love killed him.
What the fuck you talking about this any more?

99
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:15.710
We're talking about.
We're talking about people dying and planes.
Dude,

100
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.550
I know Lisa Lazy.
I sent,
what was her name?
Brian.
I forgive Brian.
I,

101
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.140
I used to think there were something wrong with Brian,

102
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.960
but then Brian told me his story about how he was living in this apartment and

103
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:28.250
they were pumping carbon dioxide from the furnace into his bedroom for like two

104
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:33.140
years and it made him half retarded.
Totally.
For Real.
It's really,

105
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.970
it's totally true.
It's totally true.
Wait,

106
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:38.320
you really think you have like something happened?
It was Brandon there.
Yeah.

107
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.460
They cooked his brain with carbon monoxide.

108
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:44.630
I think it made him a superhero dioxide or monoxide?
No,
he's a superhero.

109
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:47.990
It's like the one,
the spider bit a Spiderman.

110
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.880
Is it carbon monoxide?

111
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:54.080
Why do you think I can make retarded videos outside of this?
It's been poisoned.

112
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.640
You guys it monoxide or dioxide dioxide is what you breathe out,
right?
I oxide.

113
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:02.710
You breathe out.
Monoxide is what makes you make great viral videos.
Right?
See,

114
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.970
right.
You could trace cats up.

115
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.750
Do you ever look back to the days before you lived in that place and how,
what?

116
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.370
What would have been like no,
because that was my guy.
I was tripping and stuff,

117
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.860
you know,
before that.
So.
So you just cooked your brain right from the get go?

118
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.830
Totally.
But I take,
you know,
a lot of that raise a virtual now,

119
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:25.040
so I should be fine.
Right.
Do you think that was very trials?
Really?
The Shit?
Oh,

120
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:27.260
I totally love it.
Yeah.
I believe in it so much.

121
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.740
Did you think maybe it's partly placebo effect?
Probably.
Probably.
Yeah.

122
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.510
Talk to me taking any vitamins these days.

123
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.360
<v 3>Yeah.
Can't you tell?
Yes,
I can.
No,
I have,
you know,
I,</v>

124
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.140
I took a,
I was telling you I took um,
this are Reishi and fused.

125
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.940
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Tell me about that.
These are marijuana drops,
right?
Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.930
There's never a fucking lack of creativity in these crazy weed shops.

127
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.890
They're always coming up with new things.
So tell what exactly is this?

128
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.830
<v 3>This is a,
um,
this is,
uh,
ratios and I'm probably mispronouncing it,</v>

129
00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:02.820
but it's a,
how you spell it.
R.
E.
I.
S.
H.
I.
N.

130
00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:07.410
It's apparently the super healthy fungus that when I read on Wikipedia what it

131
00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:11.790
does,
it like somehow helps you if you're having chest problems or chest pains,

132
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.710
I guess it like supposedly helps you.

133
00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:18.390
This is Chinese herbs who the fuck knows if it's real but tastes like shit.

134
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.180
Tastes like [inaudible] but the,

135
00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:23.820
the infused part of it is awesome.

136
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.100
<v 0>So the infuser with THC.
Yes.
So you get,
is it,</v>

137
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:31.240
what is the difference between that effect and the regular like THC drops effect

138
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.450
that when you take it you're like,
oh,
this fucking awful.
But yeah,

139
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.090
you feel like you've earned it.
[inaudible] you're like suffering through it.

140
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:39.720
Like you've got a mini Iowasca trip.

141
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.540
<v 3>Yeah,
exactly.
Like,
but you know,
I don't know.
I mean,
it's all placebo by the way.</v>

142
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.730
The placebo effect is underrated because placebo effect is powerful man.

143
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.410
And so when you're,
you know,
normal.
So when you eat pot,

144
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.860
anyone who's eating pot knows it's very strong and there's like a chance

145
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.460
somewhere in that trip that you can go a little dark or get a little paranoid or

146
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:03.420
things can seem weird.

147
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.780
But if you've been taking an herbal Chinese super medicine with the drop,

148
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.350
then when shit starts getting weird and you think,
no,
I'm on [inaudible],

149
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.760
I'm on a Chinese herb that's healthy,
and then it kind of vanishes.

150
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:21.780
The demons a little bit.
Really?
No,
it's not.
She worked with me.

151
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.690
Didn't help at all.
I just,
I was making,

152
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.050
I was kind of making out because I took it and went snorkeling on a reef.

153
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.600
Oh my God.
Yeah.
It was fucking awesome.

154
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.240
<v 4>Deep.
Did you go how deep,
like say if,
uh,
we at the bottom of the pool,</v>

155
00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:35.074
like how high were you?

156
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.430
<v 3>How high,
how high was fucking high?
I was,
I was out on the pool,</v>

157
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.190
the bottom of the pool charter boat.
I'm sitting there because we were like,

158
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:47.420
you know what?
We're going snorkeling.
Let's go hunter s Thompson style just,

159
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:49.700
and I was drinking.
I wasn't driving.
I was like,

160
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.440
I remember like it was streaming down my face into my beard.

161
00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:57.320
I'm drinking it and still like not,
you know that thing where you,

162
00:09:57.321 --> 00:10:01.430
when you're eating pot and you're kind of jolly and you're underestimating it's

163
00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:04.250
power,
you're like,
yeah,
fuck it,
let's go nuts.

164
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.600
And then like 45 minutes in sudden you're like,
oh,

165
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:13.370
why did I do that?
I was on a chartered boat and I started,

166
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.700
I always in everyone's happy and there's kids wander grants in Hawaii,

167
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:18.020
everything's beautiful and I'm like,

168
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.470
oh well you're going to be the first person who goes insane on this boat.

169
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.620
We,

170
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.940
the first time when you went just started raving and ranting on a boat and

171
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:32.050
there's kids around,
I'm thinking,
you're going to ruin these kids vacations.

172
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.790
I looked,
they were like,
you know,

173
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.760
Hawaii is beautiful and he's fucking red cliffs and I swear to God,

174
00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:40.550
I looked up and I thought,
I saw like,

175
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.080
you know Raiden from mortal Kombat like I thought I saw it like this,

176
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:49.180
like person wearing one of those poned hats and like kind of blown.
I'm like,

177
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.900
all you're seeing Hawaiian gods,

178
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.430
that's like some Hawaiian Guardian spirit that's aware of you and doesn't want

179
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:56.840
you to be there cause you're a Honky,

180
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.040
<v 4>we're taking mushrooms and seen like Aztec imagery seemed like Mexican,
uh,</v>

181
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.923
imagery.

182
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.640
<v 3>Uh,
I've taken LSD and have seen,
uh,
no,</v>

183
00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:12.160
I when I was real like,
um,
uh,
was Sanskrits but never asked.

184
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.680
<v 4>I've see I've taken mushrooms and seen like at like Mayan language and like,</v>

185
00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:22.540
you know,
that style of,
you know,
ancient Mexican culture,
the Mayans and you know,

186
00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:26.410
all the,
they're crazy language that was like little drawings,
images.

187
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.890
I've like seen that shit in the sky.
Sure.

188
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.140
And when I'm on mushrooms I've seen like,
you know,

189
00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:34.210
all this crazy Mayan imagery.

190
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.300
Now I don't know if that's because I had seen it before and my imagination was

191
00:11:39.581 --> 00:11:41.590
running wild and I was like,
you know,

192
00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:45.580
just creating images that I've already witnessed and creating them in the sky.

193
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.340
That's very possible.
It's very possible.
That's what was going on.

194
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:53.230
It's also very possible that they made those images because they got fucked on

195
00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:54.100
mushrooms and they saw

196
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.720
<v 0>that shit in the sky.
And then they drew it.
That seems to be even more likely.</v>

197
00:11:57.721 --> 00:12:01.670
And I throw out another possibility.
Sure.
Um,
if you,
I,

198
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.950
and whoever out there is smart and listening to this please correct me,

199
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:09.490
but I think it's a Chomsky is a linguist.

200
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.470
Noam Chomsky is a linguist and there's basically,
um,

201
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.180
theories of where language comes from,
his language,

202
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.490
something you learn or is language something encoded into your brain.
Um,

203
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.970
cause some people think that language is something that's already kind of built

204
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:26.290
into your brain.
And it's,

205
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:30.640
it's like waiting the flower according to what culture you get born into and who

206
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:34.330
you're around.
Because it's such an incredibly complex thing to learn.

207
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.310
People wonder if like,
you know,

208
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.630
is the brain of blank slate when you're born or they're already these things

209
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:42.850
sort of in there waiting to come out.

210
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.200
So the idea is that when you are hallucinating these symbols,

211
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.560
it wasn't as though you are projecting something you'd already seen.

212
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.770
And it wasn't as though the Aztecs were hallucinating or like,
oh,

213
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:57.580
we should use these symbols to,
uh,
as our,
as our language.

214
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.840
It's more like that's already deep inside your brain and when you're tripping it

215
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:05.710
kind of comes out and you're seeing like an Uber language,
you know,

216
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:09.760
or some kind of like original primal language,
like fucking Hebrew.

217
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.600
Look at Hebrew.
That's so psychic that it's such a cycle.
It is,
isn't it?
Yeah.

218
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.330
Maybe you,
maybe you're right.
I mean I don't know.

219
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:20.950
But one of the things that I've seen many,
many times in in psychedelic states,

220
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:25.090
like especially even just eating pot when I closed my eyes is cartoon,

221
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:29.800
like imagery,
like cartoon,
like strange morphing type of imagery.

222
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.320
And what,

223
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.070
what strikes me about a lot of the Mayan shit is that all these,
you know,

224
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.700
is it pictographs?
Is that how you would,
I don't know exactly what you'd call it,

225
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.260
but all these different images,
they look very cartoon like,
yeah.
You know,

226
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.730
the dragon's look very silly and cartoon.

227
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:47.890
Like everything is almost like psychedelic.

228
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.040
It's like these people were living in real danger,

229
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.630
but yet they had the peace of mind,

230
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.110
the creativity to draw the dangerous things and almost like,
uh,

231
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.430
they like lessened your,
your,
your worry about them.

232
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.320
You know,
it's,
it's a,
it's a weird thing that cultures do with,
with,

233
00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:07.810
with predators.
I mean,
we still do it today with like a polar bears.

234
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.540
Polar bears are some of the most dangerous pairs you could ever come across.

235
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.680
But we have them selling Coca Cola and Klondike bars and being all silly and

236
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.970
sliding on the snow and they're fucking vicious murderers that live in the

237
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:23.320
coldest part of the world,
you know?
So we do,

238
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.540
we do it because we have a separation from them.

239
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.810
They're not a part of our daily lives.
They're not infiltrating the cities.

240
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:31.840
If they were,
you know,
we,
we would,
we would want to kill them all.

241
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:33.760
And we wouldn't ever think of him as being a happy thing.

242
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.220
But these fucking people were living in the jungle,
man.

243
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.700
They were living in the jungle around Jaguars and snakes and all these,

244
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.810
they were doing so much drugs.
There were drawing everything in cartoons,
right.

245
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.630
These people tripping their fucking balls off.
You know,

246
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:47.640
like when people say like that,

247
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.250
the Mayans like had this answer and the Mayans had this calendar that can
predict

248
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.520
<v 4>lunar eclipses.
And I go,
you know what,
so do we,</v>

249
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.570
we can predict all that shit too.
And we don't know the fucking future.

250
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.390
You're telling these people would never invented shoes.
These,

251
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:04.160
these people figured out the future.

252
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:07.880
They figured out how that the age is going to end.
Really.
You know,
come on man.

253
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.910
More likely they were stone age people who did a fuck load of drugs and came up

254
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.820
with some really,
really cool shit.

255
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.800
<v 3>What about the cargo cult theory?
You know,
that,
what is that?</v>

256
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.630
You know what a cargo cult is?
No.
So again,
brilliant person out there,
correct me.

257
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.520
Cause like I kind of remember things and then I fuck him up in my translation of

258
00:15:27.521 --> 00:15:32.300
them.
Right.
But,
uh,
during one of the wars,
maybe it was World War II,
um,

259
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.550
uh,
in the South Pacific,

260
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.600
I guess they would like parachute supplies down,
right?

261
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.600
And so the supplies would come down and they land on these islands that had

262
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:45.470
primitive people who'd never seen this shit before.
And so what,
what,

263
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.670
what happened is a colt would emerge based on trying to figure out how to get

264
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:51.920
those supplies to fall out of the sky again.

265
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.150
So this really great shit that you'd never seen basically from an alien.

266
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:59.930
If you're a South Pacific islander and you've been slurp and coconuts eating

267
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:03.860
fish,
eating bananas,
that's the extent of what you understand.

268
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.090
And all of a sudden this giant fucking thing on a parachute comes zooming out of

269
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:12.260
the sky filled with flashlights,
maybe a radio fabric you've never,

270
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:13.220
it's Roswell.

271
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.480
It's like an alien impact and it changes your culture because it's like shit

272
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:19.910
you've never seen.
You have no way to explain it fell out of the sky.

273
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.130
So that's a co a cargo cult.

274
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.360
It's something that emerges around that event where you try to reenact whatever

275
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:29.110
you were doing at that time when the thing fell out of the sky.

276
00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:33.710
So if you are like cutting fish or do it,
so whatever,
you know,

277
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:35.740
having a certain celebration or if it happened

278
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.630
<v 4>during hunting fish,
whatever.
So that's what they do.
That's what they do.</v>

279
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:42.180
They cut do all day is a big part of the very small,
I mean the,

280
00:16:42.181 --> 00:16:45.290
the window of what they do is,
you know,
yeah.
Hunting and gathering.

281
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.930
So you look at those fucking pyramids,
right.

282
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:53.210
And you look at them like maybe they were visited by Egyptians now I think now

283
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.410
I,
this is not something,
you know,

284
00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:58.250
they do believe that Africans came to earth or came to a North America a long,

285
00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:00.380
long time ago.
The old MACs,
the Omex,

286
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.510
they don't understand much about the old mex at all.

287
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.340
They know it's a civilization that goes back,

288
00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:05.930
I think it's like thousands of years.

289
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.740
And they were the oldest civilization or they know advanced civilization North

290
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:12.410
America.
And they know nothing about their language.
They know nothing.
Right.

291
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:16.490
But they have African features.
They have these old Mac,
these carved heads.

292
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:18.710
There's giant carved heads from,

293
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.600
they don't know where they dragged the fucking stone from.

294
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:23.300
The stones are gigantic and they're perfectly carved.

295
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.680
Like really like detailed African faces,
big fix,
lit,
thick lips,

296
00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:28.630
African features.

297
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.110
<v 3>Well,
no,
I don't think it's there.
Visited.
I mean</v>

298
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.320
<v 4>that is,
I mean,
look,
the old macs,</v>

299
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:39.150
it came from Africa most likely and came to North America or South America.

300
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.040
I mean they were there,
they were there,
they were in Mexico.

301
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.420
<v 3>Me Throw my theory out and it's just a theory.
I don't really believe it,</v>

302
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:45.470
but I like thinking about it.

303
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.980
What if you FO's looked like those pyramids and fucking Ufo is landed for a

304
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:56.550
little while and gave them all their advanced technology and gave them all the

305
00:17:56.551 --> 00:18:01.551
crazy shit and then flew off and just go deep into the what if droid.

306
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.650
Yeah,
this is deep in the what if drawer.

307
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.920
This is way underneath a lot of other what ifs.
But like,

308
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.380
so if you think about it,

309
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.250
those fucking pyramids kind of look like they could be spaceships.
Like whenever,

310
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:17.160
I think it's spacious,
I think,
why wouldn't it look like a pyramid?

311
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:20.640
It could be a pyramid,
so maybe it's maybe fucking,

312
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:25.620
they were visited by advanced intelligence that looked like those pyramids,

313
00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.450
but still

314
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.810
<v 4>it's still,
the problem with the pyramids is not that,</v>

315
00:18:28.811 --> 00:18:33.811
the problem with the Pyramids is the incredible mathematical equations that are

316
00:18:34.271 --> 00:18:38.260
required to create something so perfect.
There's 2 million,

317
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.130
300,000 stones in the period of the great Giza pyramid.

318
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.090
The Great Pyramid of Giza.
Yeah.

319
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.470
That to me to think about how many fucking stones at is,

320
00:18:47.471 --> 00:18:50.620
it's the last time they weigh between two and 80 tons and some of them,

321
00:18:50.621 --> 00:18:51.700
the ones from the king's chamber,

322
00:18:51.701 --> 00:18:56.410
we're cut from a Corey that was like 500 miles away.
I mean it's amazing man.

323
00:18:56.411 --> 00:18:58.330
And they were there.
They're perfectly put in place.

324
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.960
You ever seen the king's chamber?
You know,
were they in the,
in the Great Pyramid?

325
00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:04.660
It's insane.
They don't have any idea how they built it.

326
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.430
They have no idea how they got these incredibly large stones cut so perfectly

327
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.500
and so smooth and they've found literally they found bore marks in the

328
00:19:14.501 --> 00:19:17.410
sarcophagus is from a diamond bit drill.

329
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:21.590
<v 3>Right.
So it's like shit that we have today.
Another,
what's that called?</v>

330
00:19:21.591 --> 00:19:24.920
I'm sorry to cut you off that it just because it's another fascinating aspect of

331
00:19:24.921 --> 00:19:26.990
this stuff you're talking about,
which is,
shit,

332
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.360
there's a name for this kind of archeology where people of crimes,

333
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.820
those script batteries,
you know what I mean?
Or you'll find,
yeah.

334
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.750
<v 4>Thinking of cryptozoology but yeah,
no,
yeah,
yeah.
I know what you're talking.</v>

335
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.260
<v 3>You'll find like,
uh,
uh,</v>

336
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:42.110
it's something that there's no way that it should exist back then.

337
00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:44.220
It almost indicates time travelers.
Sure.

338
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.220
<v 4>You ever will not,
I'm not Tom Travel,</v>

339
00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:48.140
but have you ever looked into Graham Hancock?

340
00:19:48.141 --> 00:19:49.540
Have you ever read any of this stuff?
No.

341
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.610
I know that I want to give you fingerprints of the gods before you leave.

342
00:19:52.611 --> 00:19:55.280
It's one of my favorite books and this guy,
Graham Hancock,

343
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:59.480
is an archeologist and he traveled all over the world looking in all these

344
00:19:59.481 --> 00:20:03.530
ancient civilizations and ancient structures and studied all the,
the different,

345
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.710
you know,
uh,
the,
um,
different,
a cataclysmic event,
um,

346
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.730
stories that every single religion seems to have that are in the eye of

347
00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:11.281
Gilgamesh.

348
00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:15.890
And in the Bible and what he believes is that somewhere around 10,000 years ago,

349
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.750
there was some event on earth and there was a super advanced civilization that

350
00:20:20.751 --> 00:20:24.650
existed before that.
And we have been around a lot longer than we think.

351
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.400
And that what,

352
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.400
what the pyramids are literally is people rediscovering some shit that a super,

353
00:20:30.411 --> 00:20:35.300
super advanced civilization that had been reset many thousands of years ago.

354
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.920
The w w what we see,

355
00:20:36.921 --> 00:20:40.670
like when you see like the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx and all these things

356
00:20:40.671 --> 00:20:42.650
that they can't explain the finks and closure.

357
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.150
What we see is the proof that there was some sort of a super advanced

358
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.700
civilization,
many,
many,

359
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:53.200
many thousands of years before worthy archeologists currently date to be,

360
00:20:53.201 --> 00:20:54.490
you know,
the time they built the pyramids.

361
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.570
And there's a guy named John Anthony West that has dedicated his entire life to

362
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.370
trying to let people a look at Egypt and a different way.
And she,

363
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.740
and he believes that the Egyptian,
uh,
the,
the,
the drawings,

364
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:10.090
the depictions of ferals,
they go back over 34,000 years.
But for whatever reason,

365
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:13.090
conventional Egyptologists are unwilling to look at that kind of evidence.

366
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.140
They don't want to look at anything that makes it seem like everything is all

367
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:17.711
fucked up.

368
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:21.400
And there was some sort of an event that hasn't been documented in the people

369
00:21:21.401 --> 00:21:24.850
that we think of as Egyptians maybe never even built us in the first place.

370
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.220
They might've been like the people that moved into all this shit.

371
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:30.490
And you know this conversation we're having about the pyramid,

372
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.020
the Egyptians were having it too,
I'm sure.

373
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.390
What the fuck is that right where this should come from.
Exactly.

374
00:21:36.391 --> 00:21:41.290
People have been saying that for exactly and we found it like second hand,

375
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:43.030
they found it first and well this guy,

376
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:46.630
Graham Hancock has traveled all over the world taking all this.

377
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.170
There's footage of these incredible structures that people have made that map

378
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:51.100
out the cosmos,

379
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.120
that match constellations all these different societies.
Yeah,
like Macho,

380
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.560
Macho Picchu that like that fucking thing like you can,
how the fuck,

381
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.390
they don't even know how anybody got anything up there.

382
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.680
Like these guys got these giant fucking stones up there where there's no air and

383
00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:09.640
they built these incredible structures many,
many,
many thousands of years ago.

384
00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:13.150
Like they have no idea when and they think that it might've even been at a time

385
00:22:13.151 --> 00:22:17.290
where water was up there.
Like it's,
it's,
it's fucking nutty,
man.
When you,

386
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:21.040
when you really find out how much of these ancient structures in ancient,

387
00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.440
ancient civilizations,
how much evidence there is for it,

388
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.210
but when they start bringing this stuff up,

389
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.760
stuff up to conventional archeologists,
they always said,
well,

390
00:22:27.761 --> 00:22:29.440
where's the evidence for these cultures?

391
00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:31.690
Like that's what they said about John Anthony West when they brought up the

392
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.950
water erosion marks on the Sphinx.
You familiar with all that?

393
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.400
The water erosion on the Sphinx is due to thousands of years of rainfall.

394
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.670
The problem with that is the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley,

395
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.590
it was like 7,000 BC.
Yeah.
So that,

396
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:50.150
that puts it like way,
way,
way out,

397
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.800
dates it way past what we think of as Egypt and civilization.

398
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.250
Egyptian civilization,
we think of around like two thousand three thousand BC.

399
00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.880
There's,
they're talking like 7,000,
4,000 years earlier than that.

400
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.840
You know what I mean?
I mean,
this is a pretty incredible shit.
So the,
these,

401
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.950
these guys have discovered all these different things that point to the fact

402
00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:12.490
that it's much more likely that there was a far older civilization that

403
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:14.710
disappeared.
And so the archeologists are all like,

404
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.770
where's the evidence for this civilization?
What does fucking right there?

405
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.450
What else is going to be left?
What else is going to be left after 10,000 years?

406
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:23.120
Man,

407
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.000
you're going to get some stone that's a car would dissolve into the earth.

408
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.550
A building we fall apart and crumble.
You all,

409
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.470
everything has to be made at a stone.

410
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.930
That's the only shift that's going to survive.
They don't what about wondering?

411
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.480
But you know,
when they first found the sphinx and the,
the,

412
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:44.470
theF and I forget which fucking pharaoh they attribute it to through the guy
who,

413
00:23:44.471 --> 00:23:48.970
uh,
supposedly they think built the Sphinx,
but it's in the,
the,

414
00:23:48.971 --> 00:23:49.880
the hieroglyphs.

415
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.290
It literally says that he was told in a dream that if he uncovered this fakes,

416
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.260
he would go on to rule Egypt,
hit an uncovered.
You know why?

417
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:01.880
Because it was covered in fucking sand.
They had actively dig it out of the sand.

418
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.930
It was up to its head in sand.
Not only that,
the head has been altered,

419
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.590
like they know that the head used to be far larger and was much more likely the

420
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:12.970
head of a lion and then some ferals like I don't want that land.

421
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.050
I'm on a mat face up there bitch.

422
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:19.850
And so that's when they put his face up there and more likely it was one of the

423
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.310
African Pharaohs because he has a face of a noob Ian,

424
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.630
the Nubians conquered Egypt in the end of the Egyptian empire when everything

425
00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:30.560
felt shit.
Yeah,
the,
the,
the Nubians conquered and they,

426
00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:34.370
they're pharaohs were much more African looking yet there's a,

427
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.620
the point is where we're both saying is there's way,
way old.
It just,

428
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.440
Graham Hancock guy's a fucking genius man.
And his,

429
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.860
his books are brilliant on this shit and he has his wife's a photographer.

430
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:49.160
So he has these incredible photographs of all these different things from all

431
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:53.120
over the world and it will absolutely convince you that they're at least this

432
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:56.060
should be considered as an option and it's not right now.
Right now,

433
00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:58.850
everybody wants to think that everything they've been taught in school and

434
00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:02.180
everything they're teaching their students right now is the information and it's

435
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:04.430
very difficult to get them to relook at shit.

436
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.860
These motherfuckers that won't look at the Sphinx,

437
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.500
I mean that there's water erosion.

438
00:25:09.501 --> 00:25:14.450
Every single geologist who looks at that says this is water erosion from

439
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:16.490
thousands of years of rainfall,

440
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.580
and then they have all these other guys that are like,
no,
it can't be.

441
00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:20.480
It's impossible.

442
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.940
It's never been a problem for me imagining that we're super or a Superbowl,

443
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.000
but for them they've been teaching this shit.

444
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.720
There've been teaching Tut Moses the third did this at this time and he built

445
00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:33.610
this pyramid and you know,
they don't know though that the fucking [inaudible].

446
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.690
They really don't know.
It's,
it's,
it's guesswork.

447
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:39.050
There's a shit load of guesswork.
Yeah.
That's always really amazing to me.

448
00:25:39.051 --> 00:25:44.051
When archeologists get very specific about something that was a really long time

449
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.850
and he said to his troops,
you know,
Blah Blah Blah.
I had to fuck.

450
00:25:46.851 --> 00:25:51.290
Do you know what he said?
Barely.
Remember what I ate yesterday.
Lunch.
Exactly.

451
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:54.830
How are you fucking day?
How are you diagnosing this shit?

452
00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:57.590
It's impossible to talk about this.
When I talk about on stage,

453
00:25:57.591 --> 00:25:59.510
when I talk about how little we know about human beings,

454
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.640
if I'm in a club that it has like 200 people in it,
I'll say,
you know,

455
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:07.490
here's 200 of us right here.
What re representative,
we lived our entire lives,

456
00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:09.230
birth to death and we added them all together.

457
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.700
We represent 20,000 years just us,

458
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.820
just the lives of 200 people.
If you add them all together,
birth to death,

459
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:19.130
that's 20 fucking thousand years.

460
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.010
That's way more than we know about human history.
Way,
way,

461
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:27.011
way more according to like conventional teaching or conventional a thought.

462
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.010
W W W like 20,000 years ago we were basically caveman,
right?

463
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.630
I mean we board animal skins and shit.
Like when they find those frozen dudes.

464
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.270
How old those dudes?
I have no idea.

465
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.400
30,000 years ago wearing skins and shit and throwing spears rock tips,

466
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:43.950
like that's as good as it got back then.

467
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.780
<v 0>20,000 years.
Just 200 people's lives.
That's incredible,
man.
Well,</v>

468
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.160
do you buy into this stuff that we came from Mars?
No.
No.

469
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.570
I don't buy into any of the Mars imagery.
I don't.
You know,

470
00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.390
I see all that Richard Hoagland documentary.

471
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.000
I see all these guys talking about it and you know what I say?

472
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.670
I see a bunch of guys who are trying to find a bunch of shit that is not

473
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:06.504
necessarily there.

474
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.660
You're making connections with this rock to that rock and you're using this

475
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:14.661
fucking really fuzzy geometry to describe the rate the regions.

476
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.190
There's some interesting structures there.

477
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.520
There's some interesting structures that may or may not have one point in time

478
00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:24.430
been been a building,
but it's up for debate.
I think it,

479
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.430
it started off as the lightning bolt hitting the plasma is storks look,

480
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:33.470
it's very possible.
The storks Brian,
we're talking about for this story.

481
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.810
It's very possible that life existed on Mars.
It's very possible.

482
00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:40.020
It's very possible that if you think about the fact that life exists has existed

483
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:44.640
on earth for billions of years,
right,
okay.
And we know that at one point in time,

484
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.600
you know there was lizards running shit and it was a tropical jungle and there's

485
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.690
dinosaurs everywhere.

486
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:51.450
And we didn't evolve until all those were wiped off the face of the planet,

487
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:52.830
right?
According to Eddie Griffin,

488
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.330
they weren't not wiped out the planet.

489
00:27:57.331 --> 00:27:59.730
They went underground and learned to shape shift.

490
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:02.460
Please tell me he didn't say that on stage.
He didn't say it on stage.

491
00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:04.920
He told it to me buying the comedies.
Has He ever told you that?

492
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:08.910
How Bruce Lee died story now Bruce Lee fun a thousand niggas

493
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:17.330
like he was standing there and he took about 900 of them out until one finally

494
00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:22.020
got the deaf touch on his ass.
Fuck and death.
He will,
he will,

495
00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:24.540
he will tell a fucking a tail.

496
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.960
Eddie Griffin would be the perfect guy to hang out with drunk and a pool hall.

497
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.830
I'm like a Friday night and he's talking shit.
That's his best kind of humor,
man.

498
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:36.330
Just crazy stories in fucking hilarious and he makes,
he says,
well,
it's funny,

499
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:37.430
right?
Talented Guy,
man.

500
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.400
He told me that was the first time I'd heard the reptilian theory when you told

501
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:45.330
it to me.
He said he was so filled with passion and the truth of it,

502
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:48.720
that it was like an eerie moment and it's not so crazy.
Always really hip,

503
00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:51.600
not he hypnotized crowds,
man.
I,
I saw him.

504
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.280
He was very charismatic even though he was crazy.

505
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.090
I saw him do like two and a half hours at the comedy store wines and at the end

506
00:28:57.091 --> 00:28:57.924
of his show,

507
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.740
the crowd got up and surge toward 10.

508
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.540
All,
we're trying to touch him like they were like,
he would,

509
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:10.680
he had hypnotize the entire series.
Yes.
Especially if you get really dumb,

510
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.490
dumb people in there.
Ooh.
He'll get,
um,
you know,
it was him.
He'll get him good.

511
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.800
You know?
He said once,
he said,

512
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:22.100
what a lot of people don't know is that the twin towers below them was Fort Knox

513
00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:27.441
where all the gold was kept and the trains kept running 24 hours a day.

514
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.340
Yeah,
like what?
What are you talking about?
That there's a gold underneath.

515
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.750
There's gold underneath the twin towers and the trains or,
Hey,
rob,

516
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.230
what do I know?
This is still shit store a lot.
I would go see him.
I don't,

517
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.340
I don't know.
I saw,
I saw him at the store once,

518
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:45.460
but I don't have a friendly guy too,
man.
I'm always always happy to see that guy.

519
00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:48.370
He's really cool.
He's a very talented guy,
man.

520
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.890
He's always been really crazy and everything,
but he's very talented.

521
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.700
He had a funny fucking joke about the dude who invented the telephone.
He goes,

522
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.610
he goes,
Alexander Graham Bell had to be on coke.

523
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.490
Who the fuck gets so high?
Do you like,

524
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.010
I want to talk to somebody who isn't even here.

525
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.930
That's a great joke.
That's one of my favorite all time jokes,

526
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.380
especially in that voice.
That's one of those jokes where you go,
damn,

527
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:18.730
I wish I thought that one.
I know,
isn't it kind of like,

528
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:22.240
there's two kinds of jokes.
There's jokes are like,
man,
that joke sucks.

529
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.470
And then there's jokes.
They're like,
man,
why didn't I think of that?
There's no,

530
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.161
well,

531
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:30.910
you know what really always like humbles me when I see a dude who can make jokes

532
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:32.710
out of shit there,
I probably would have dropped,

533
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.340
you know who impresses me with that Patton Oswald Patent.

534
00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:40.630
We'll go on this killer five minute bit about a fucking bottle of water.

535
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:43.180
You know what I'm saying?
He'll like any premise health,

536
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:48.040
find it and squeeze the funny out of it.
And I always got,
damn.
That dude is like,

537
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.720
he knows how to like really right?
Like uh,

538
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.700
even for like obscure Shit that you wouldn't think would be funny.

539
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.180
And he does the old trick where he makes it seem like the easiest fucking thing

540
00:30:58.181 --> 00:31:02.380
and the planet.
It makes it seem like it's just not comfortable.
It's comfortable,

541
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.700
easy.
It just happens that brilliant jokes are always a few people like that.

542
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.880
It's awesome to watch,
man.
Don't you still want like watching stand up?
Well,

543
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.470
I feel the most fun.
Right.
Do you ever get it?
You know,

544
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:19.471
if you ever get stuck or get stand up block and all you gotta do is watch the

545
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:24.700
great comics and then it'll give you inspiration to work on more jokes.
Yeah.

546
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.330
Yeah.
Man.
I'm mom used to have a puppet Dunkin.
Do you still do the Little Hobo?

547
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.080
I don't do it anymore.
He got stolen.
Did you hear about this Joe?

548
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:36.170
If someone stole little Hobo,
Hobo got stolen in San Jose,
who stole him?

549
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:40.710
If I knew that then somebody's stolen from like,
if I knew that I'd be in jail.

550
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.840
Well
Dunkin used to have this,

551
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:48.280
a little puppet that used to bring on stage that was like satanic and it was

552
00:31:48.281 --> 00:31:49.020
very funny,

553
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.930
the funniest bit he used to do this thing where the puppet had killed his

554
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:57.720
grandfather up.
It was channeling Satan Demon.

555
00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.110
It was crazy.
Great man.

556
00:31:59.111 --> 00:32:02.650
So did you leave little Hobo in the lobby and then somebody stole it or

557
00:32:02.651 --> 00:32:06.080
something?
What happened?
Well,
it's an interesting story.
I,
um,
it had,

558
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.590
the weird thing is I had been up in Nevada city at a Oh,

559
00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.150
a little film comedy fest and you were saying you loved it up there in Nevada

560
00:32:13.151 --> 00:32:14.980
city city's amazing.
Where is it exactly?

561
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:20.040
It's like it's north of Sacramento and I'm not really sure about how the pot

562
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.220
manufacturer and distribution works,

563
00:32:24.221 --> 00:32:28.360
but I know that Nevada city plays a pretty important role in that.

564
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.970
It's like there,
it's like a big,
it's like a big part of their economy and,

565
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.450
and how do I know this?
I'll tell ya,

566
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.320
I was buying a Burrito from a hippie and he was commenting on how he likes the

567
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:43.730
festival because it's almost the business picks up to almost the level is when

568
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:47.240
the cutters are in town.
And I was like,
Whoa,
Holy Shit.

569
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:51.620
You guys have a cycle based on the sheer harvesting the crops and stuff.

570
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.330
So in Nevada city is also the Yuba river runs through it in Nevada.

571
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.230
<v 2>Want to live there though,
man,
there's too many creeps.</v>

572
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.870
I would say especially right now with the climate,

573
00:33:01.871 --> 00:33:05.290
it's not like it's a legitimate marijuana factory that's,
you know,

574
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.990
everybody gets dental insurance and shit and they all worked.

575
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.240
Their community's happy.
That's not what's going on.

576
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.480
It's most of these guys were selling illegal shit.

577
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.640
<v 0>Well,
here's the thing.
This is,</v>

578
00:33:13.641 --> 00:33:16.880
this was the really fascinating thing that someone there said to me,

579
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.540
they said they don't want in November,

580
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:24.440
they don't want pot to get legal because it's going to crash their economy.

581
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.450
It's so crazy.
That's crazy.
Cause that saying,
you know,
I would,

582
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:32.480
I'm more important than the cost.
Yeah.
Let's just put people,
I can just,

583
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:37.280
I can't adjust.
No,
it's saying I'm okay with people going to jail every,

584
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.410
yeah.
I can buy more hummus.
That's so douchey.
That has douchey.

585
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.360
That's the most fucked up thing and I didn't think of it until I walked off.

586
00:33:44.361 --> 00:33:46.150
I would have said something,
but yeah,
it was really,

587
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.080
<v 2>yeah,
I've heard the argument,
I've heard the argument from a few people,</v>

588
00:33:49.081 --> 00:33:51.960
but there's some people that are just contrarians and they just want to argue

589
00:33:51.961 --> 00:33:53.970
about anything in a matter of what you bring up.

590
00:33:53.971 --> 00:33:55.230
If they didn't think of it first,

591
00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:57.550
they'll come up with the opposing point of view.
Oh,
I hate those people.

592
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:02.660
So those are,
those are conversation vampires.
Yeah.
There's,

593
00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.760
there's a bunch of people that every conversation they have is just some sort of

594
00:34:05.761 --> 00:34:09.000
an act where they want you to walk away impressed,
you know?
I mean,

595
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.960
there's a lot of people there.

596
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.680
<v 0>Oh yeah.
You know,
they're not listening to a God damn thing you're saying.</v>

597
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.270
They just want to argue it's a lot of Douche bags,

598
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.280
like angry at that very annoying man because it's not a real conversation.

599
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.210
You just want to throttle up.
It's like we're,

600
00:34:22.211 --> 00:34:25.410
we're only having this conversation because you're insecure and fucked up a lot

601
00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:28.950
of comics that are like that.
A lot of comics,
a lot of common,
no matter,
no,

602
00:34:28.951 --> 00:34:30.600
not most of them,
but there's quite a few.

603
00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:33.720
There's quite a few that are looking for arguments.
Yeah.
Oh God.

604
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:37.590
That year beaters where they just get in and just start.
You gave me that word.

605
00:34:37.591 --> 00:34:42.270
I used that word so fucking nice dude.
He is just Joe D.
That's a funny word.

606
00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.750
Joe is getting in their beat.
Novia mother.

607
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:50.070
He would say that Joe Diaz has the best fucking lines but everything and no

608
00:34:50.071 --> 00:34:53.860
matter what it is,
well he's the best man.
I walk on ice,
I might as well dance.

609
00:34:53.861 --> 00:34:55.210
You know what I'm saying?
If you,

610
00:34:55.211 --> 00:34:59.330
you know how you could become a fucking billionaire if you could make a joke

611
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:03.390
Diaz application where you could have Joe Diaz in her phone.
No.
You know how to

612
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.590
<v 2>billionaire is if Joe Diaz let me do him in a cartoon,</v>

620
00:35:26.351 --> 00:35:29.470
And so he deals with breakdown.

627

High School isn't really 18 college is 18 like he comes to their orientation and

Yes.</v>

There's always going to be a swirl of comedy.
Okay.

639
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:28.670
<v 5>That video you used to do a fuel TV.
Do you still do stupid face?
No.</v>

640
00:36:28.671 --> 00:36:32.660
There was one with Joey Diaz had the,
he edited Joy Diaz on top of a,

641
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.860
what was it like a,
he was like a little micro fisherman or something like,

642
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.560
<v 0>yeah,
Galaxy Galaxy cabinet is a it.
He was a,</v>

643
00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:47.110
he was a villain that lived in then it's a long weird lives in someone's head or

644
00:36:47.111 --> 00:36:50.260
something and someone's neck on a little boat and he was called the fishermen.

645
00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.901
That's the best one.

646
00:36:52.901 --> 00:36:56.890
You can find it on youtube or on your website or some best thing you've ever

647
00:36:56.891 --> 00:36:59.050
done in my opinion,
when you've done a lot of great stuff.

648
00:36:59.051 --> 00:37:00.220
But my one of my favorites,

649
00:37:00.221 --> 00:37:04.330
cause I did not know it was you until I started watching it was drunk history

650
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.940
when you talked about Nikola Tesla.
First of all,

651
00:37:06.941 --> 00:37:10.750
I loved it because you and I are both huge Tesla fans and we've talked so many

652
00:37:10.751 --> 00:37:12.430
times about how fascinating that guy was.

653
00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:14.740
But the fact that you did that video where he got super,

654
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.790
super fucking drunk or just going off,
what did you say?

655
00:37:18.791 --> 00:37:22.180
Well can we play that because it's great you played drunk history because it's

656
00:37:22.181 --> 00:37:25.300
really fucking brilliant.
It's episode two,
right?
Um,

657
00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:30.910
and if you go online,
if you want to watch it online,
look for a trunk history.

658
00:37:30.911 --> 00:37:35.170
What on Youtube?
Trust me.
Drunk history.
Tesla.

659
00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:38.440
Just look under Duncan Trussell Two d u n t a.

660
00:37:38.441 --> 00:37:43.060
N Trussell is t r U.
S.
S e l.
L.
And it's fucking hilarious.

661
00:37:43.061 --> 00:37:44.410
So we're going to play the audio of it.

662
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:48.430
But you watched watched the video of it too because John see Riley's in it and

663
00:37:48.431 --> 00:37:52.060
he plays Tesla,
right?
Sprinkle ever.
Yeah.
John C.

664
00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.210
Reilly Voice Tesla and Crispin Glover Place Edison.
It's fucking brilliant.

665
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.710
Awesome.
How cool was it to have shit you did and have fucking John C.

666
00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.560
Reilly doing your words cause I was looking at,
I was like,
wow,

667
00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.600
that's what I'd look like if I could act.

668
00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.850
You can act to acting is just about getting comfortable.

669
00:38:09.851 --> 00:38:13.510
You are very good at committing to weird shit.

670
00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.140
You remember that one time that we did this weird backstage thing or Brian was

671
00:38:17.141 --> 00:38:19.790
filming it?
We were pretending like we were going to film a documentary here.

672
00:38:19.791 --> 00:38:24.430
Remember that?
Yeah.
That was fun man.
But I'll tell you this,
acting,
it's not,

673
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.510
is this it right here?
Yeah.

674
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.030
Here's drunk history with Duncan Trussell and how drunk were you when you did

675
00:38:31.031 --> 00:38:33.460
this?
Blacked out trunk or what did you drink?

676
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:36.040
Absent and and a six

677
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.990
<v 6>pack of beer.
Oh my God.
How much absent half a bottle of it.
Oh my God.
Yeah.</v>

678
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:45.220
That stuff gets you so weird that it died.
Really?

679
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.370
Nicoletta test.
Oh my God.

680
00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.670
The father of Western technology.

681
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.030
Oh more everything we know is like modern electricity.

682
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:02.860
Tesla invented that.
You also have it in wireless technology.

683
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.420
Invented the radio.

684
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:09.870
Supposedly one day he was taking a walk in a park and he suddenly experienced

685
00:39:10.571 --> 00:39:15.571
this tremendous flood light and he saw in his mind the perfect blueprint of an

686
00:39:17.831 --> 00:39:22.210
engine that would create something called alternating current.

687
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:27.470
And that was an is like I have to go to the United States.
I mean,
listen Amit,

688
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:33.630
so Tesla sail across the ocean found that as in who at the time was like the

689
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.310
king of Electricity Edison.
It was like,
all right,

690
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.110
well I guess you,
you can work for me.

691
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.920
And his job was like,

692
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:48.760
his job was digging ditches for Edison

693
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.920
and from this guy Westing house.

694
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:58.060
It's like gave him money to start like working on his idea of alternating

695
00:39:58.061 --> 00:39:58.894
current.

696
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:04.500
So Edison didn't like the idea of alternating current because he owned all the

697
00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:05.910
patents on direct.

698
00:40:05.911 --> 00:40:10.911
Current alternating current was the only two jobs.

699
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.133
I can't do it.

700
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:24.930
I'm going to start a few things.
Did you get all the details right?

701
00:40:24.931 --> 00:40:29.931
Even though you were so won the contract to supply to all the electricity to the

702
00:40:30.661 --> 00:40:35.520
world's fair and this pissed Edison off.
He was like,
fuck this.

703
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.010
Uh,
alternating current is bad,

704
00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.850
alternating current will only caused massive debt.

705
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:46.170
And so he started this campaign to approve the alternating current was like the

706
00:40:46.171 --> 00:40:47.520
worst current you could use.

707
00:40:47.521 --> 00:40:51.450
What he did is EBN to like publicly electric cute animals.

708
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.560
Edison wasn't asshole.

709
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.530
He was like taking like sheep and mean like look what happens when the sheep

710
00:40:58.531 --> 00:41:01.260
touches the alternating current.
Oh,

711
00:41:01.261 --> 00:41:03.600
I blew it gets electrocuted.

712
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:08.490
Look what happens when a cow comes in contact with Oswald in current.
It dies.

713
00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:13.440
Tesla was horrified and he'd be like,
this is,

714
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:21.200
I am inventing electricity and you look like an ass hole because you fucking

715
00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.173
idiot

716
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:32.050
can do it.
Good night.
Thank you everyone.

717
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.290
Tesla uh,

718
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:39.830
discovered the energy to run the world's fair.

719
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.660
And at that moment Tesla became an international figure,

720
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.700
worshiped by everyone.

721
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:52.660
So Tesla has like a laboratory like mark twain and like everybody who was famous

722
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:56.840
in the world come to the laboratory.

723
00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.260
Do we like do things like make electricity shoot around his body?

724
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.710
People will be watching,
like,
look at him,
he's on fire.

725
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.950
Mark Twain will be there crying.

726
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:11.390
And then new id add was that I don't think you necessarily need to have like

727
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.040
power plants for there to be electricity.

728
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.520
I think that you can take away tricity from the air.

729
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:24.560
This was directly opposed to uh oh.

730
00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:26.120
Of Capitalist Society.

731
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.930
So he was basically ostracized from society.

732
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.460
I did
this come out of my body.

733
00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:44.800
It's their visas.
There's Tine Applebee's is okay.

734
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.470
I know I chewed it and he went crazy,
you know.

735
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:53.530
But his greatest pleasure as he was getting old was feeding pigeons and he fell

736
00:42:53.661 --> 00:42:55.850
in love with a specific patient.

737
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:59.783
<v 2>What's going on.</v>

738
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

739
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.020
<v 2>Brian Internet just stopped.
Did it?
Yeah,</v>

740
00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:05.940
it's not loading up the whole video.

741
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:10.903
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

742
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:15.720
<v 2>Oh okay.
Well they get watch.
All right.
Just go on youtube anyway.</v>

743
00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:20.160
Tesla.
Why?
Well I think that was pretty much the gist of it.
But how did,
did you,

744
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:22.490
did you have to study for that?
Yeah,

745
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:27.330
I read a book on Tesla and I watched a documentary on Tesla so I had all my

746
00:43:27.331 --> 00:43:28.380
facts straight.
But,

747
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.080
but you knew the whole story beforehand cause we've talked about it and many

748
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.770
times both.
I didn't know the extent of it until I,
until,

749
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:38.340
because I knew enough about it to know it would be a cool drunk history and I'm

750
00:43:38.341 --> 00:43:40.980
friends with the guy who does that,
Derek waters and I was like,

751
00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:42.480
you got to let me do Tesla.

752
00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:46.060
You know Tesla was another one who believed he was in communication with

753
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.870
feelings with aliens.
Yeah.
But see this is a,

754
00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.520
he believed he was receiving signals.
Right.

755
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.600
Here's an interesting point that I think we should talk about because you know,

756
00:43:54.601 --> 00:43:58.950
you can use the term aliens or whatever,
but where do your jokes come from?
Yeah,

757
00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:03.300
sure.
The ether.
I,
I've always said that at my most creative,

758
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.040
I'm merely a passenger.

759
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:09.420
I'm watching it all come out and I just keep my own bullshit from getting in the

760
00:44:09.421 --> 00:44:12.390
way of myself from getting in the way of the idea.
Like last night,

761
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.370
like I was a in the middle of the writing and this is,
you know,

762
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.940
when I'm especially like late at night,

763
00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.550
I always find like reasons to get distracted sometimes when I'm writing.

764
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.020
So I'm in the middle of writing and while I am thinking about something I think,

765
00:44:25.021 --> 00:44:27.690
wow,
look at all this crazy shit I wrote.
Wow.
Where is this all coming from?

766
00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:30.990
Like Austin,
it's me,
you know,
thinking like in,
in like this list ego way.

767
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.690
Look at all of the work you've done,
look at all those.
And then the idea,

768
00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.830
whatever I had slipped out of my head,
it was just like,
hey stupid.
You know,

769
00:44:37.831 --> 00:44:41.400
it's not about you,
not me.
It's not about you getting any accolades.

770
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:44.310
Are you patting yourself on the back for fucking sitting in front of a computer,

771
00:44:44.311 --> 00:44:47.580
punch in keyboard for five minutes or five hours it,
what did it,

772
00:44:47.581 --> 00:44:49.920
what it's about is what comes out.
That's what it's about.

773
00:44:49.921 --> 00:44:51.720
It's about the final result,
the final product.

774
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:55.200
And when that's what you're thinking about,
it's really not even you.

775
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.670
It's like it's just coming out of the air.

776
00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.310
<v 3>Yeah.
In fact,
the,
yeah,
the less you that's involved,
the better.
It's better to,</v>

777
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.061
and that's a hard,

778
00:45:02.061 --> 00:45:06.470
it's the hardest thing because it's like trying to catch those thoughts are

779
00:45:06.471 --> 00:45:09.080
trying to put yourself in the right position where those thought,

780
00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:13.050
where you're catching them in the statics gone.
It's fucking hard,
man.
In fact,

781
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:16.460
cause you can't force it.
And that's the zen thing.
Yeah.
If you try to catch it,

782
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:19.730
it runs away from you.
And if you don't try to catch it,

783
00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.740
that's when the thoughts start popping into your head.

784
00:45:21.741 --> 00:45:25.850
And usually it's like happening at times when you're not expecting it.

785
00:45:25.851 --> 00:45:30.260
You're not,
you can't,
you can't make it happen.
Do you ever read the war of art?

786
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.220
Uh,
yeah.
As a matter of fact,
yes.
Yes,
I have.
Yeah.
I love that.
Yeah.
But

787
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.950
<v 2>I give it to people.
Do you have a copy of it?
I do.
The thank you.
Yeah.</v>

788
00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:37.930
I'll give it to people.

789
00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.580
They don't have it because it's such a fucking amazing book when it comes to

790
00:45:40.581 --> 00:45:42.530
writing.
But that dude,
Steven Pressfield,

791
00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:46.940
he talks a lot very openly about the idea of a muse.
Yeah.

792
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.540
Know that like he shows up and does his work and the Muse shows up and gives

793
00:45:50.541 --> 00:45:53.900
them,
the idea is,
I mean that's like this ancient idea in ancient thought,

794
00:45:53.901 --> 00:45:58.700
but it really does feel like it's something else besides you.
Well,
you know the,

795
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.120
we were talking about this earlier.
Um,
so John Lilly,

796
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:07.100
the father of the flotation tank,
um,
he sort of breaking,

797
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:11.090
he openly says he had contact with extra dimensional beings.

798
00:46:11.091 --> 00:46:13.610
So he used to shoot ketamine and climb into the tank.

799
00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.530
He used to jab himself in the leg intramuscularly with ketamine.

800
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.820
A fucking cat tranquilizer.
Yeah.
Is that what it's for?
Cats.
What does ketamine?

801
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.790
Uh,
I thought courses,
it's for cats.
Horses.

802
00:46:25.791 --> 00:46:29.810
I always heard it was cat and he would,
uh,
he would fucking go for a trip.

803
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:34.520
They say ketamine is supposed to be one of the weirdest psychedelic experiences.

804
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:36.740
Mckenna had a very interesting way of describing it.

805
00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.450
He said Ketamine is fairly recent as far as like fairly new as far as like human

806
00:46:41.451 --> 00:46:42.860
use.
And you know,

807
00:46:42.861 --> 00:46:47.270
mushrooms are around for thousands and thousands of years document to human use.

808
00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.100
He said,
when you take a mushroom trip,

809
00:46:49.101 --> 00:46:52.850
one of the things that you're taking the trip is the idea that you're in.

810
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.660
You were embedding yourself in all the other trips that happened with all the

811
00:46:56.661 --> 00:47:01.270
other mushrooms before.
Like you,
you engage in one big,
joyous,
you know,

812
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:05.420
interconnected experience.
And it's one of the reasons why mushrooms,
you know,

813
00:47:05.421 --> 00:47:07.940
it's like,
it's such as powerful,
incredible experience.

814
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:11.330
Like you're having the experience of everyone who's ever had mushrooms,
right?

815
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:15.440
Whereas with Ketamine,
he said ketamine is like,
like an empty office building.

816
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.980
I must have not did enough fucking weird because that's not what it was for me.

817
00:47:18.981 --> 00:47:23.620
When you're talking about Special K,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.
You have to shoot it.
Oh,

818
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:27.870
well you can snort it,
but if you want to see the aliens,

819
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.070
the Eh,
to

820
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.810
<v 5>me it was the exact opposite.
It wasn't like hallucinating.
It was just like,
oh,</v>

821
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.990
I woke up to stern.
You know,

822
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:40.180
you can watch youtube videos of people on it.
I've got ketamine.

823
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.020
Ketamine is not one that went really down with,

824
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:45.670
I wouldn't really be done with trying anything.

825
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.570
I have to shoot in my fucking leg with a horse needle.
No.

826
00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:50.520
Duncan trust was going to go for a piss.

827
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.970
This is the docking weak bladder.
Trussell

828
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:59.890
that'd be right back.
Right after he urinates lucky it's in the same room.

829
00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.870
We don't,
we don't have to miss him for long.
Yes.

830
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:05.770
I've never tried ketamine,
man.

831
00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:07.660
I've never tried anything that you can get addicted to.

832
00:48:07.661 --> 00:48:11.950
And I heard you can get addicted to ketamine except alcohol.
Obviously Caffeine,

833
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:13.470
caffeine,
vitamins,

834
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:17.390
vitamins are healthy even though you're pretty addicted to them.
Um,

835
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.490
I do know that if I don't take them,
I don't feel as good.
Right.
That's,

836
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.620
that's definitely,
you're addicted to them.
You're addicted.
It makes you healthy.

837
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.700
Maybe you addicted to sleep.
Shut the fuck up.

838
00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.680
Look at that.
Oversleeping yeah.
So what have you done?

839
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.970
If you've done ketamine,
you started it.
Yeah.
How much did you do,
do you know?

840
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:41.900
Uh,
I don't remember quite a lot.
Hey,
a couple lines.
How long were the alarm?

841
00:48:41.901 --> 00:48:43.870
So I got an instinct.
She don't even know,

842
00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:50.350
like a CD size,
you know,
crazy.
Or people in drugs,
they just go snort.

843
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:52.420
And something.
They're not measuring it.
I don't know.

844
00:48:52.421 --> 00:48:54.340
The dose is stupid young kid.

845
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.850
The only reason I did it because I was on acid and I'm cause I'm thinking right.

846
00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:03.220
Oh you kidding.
Well you already know.
You kidding.
Okay,
so you've done that.

847
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:07.540
And what other like harsh stuff you tried crack,
right?
Nah He didn't.

848
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:09.160
I know this guy looks like me.
Not allegedly.

849
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:13.270
Might've done this guy that looks like you that allegedly might've small crack.

850
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:17.800
What did he say about it?
It's,
it's just like doing cocaine kind of.

851
00:49:17.801 --> 00:49:20.100
It makes you feel kind of,
I don't know.

852
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:24.430
I had to such a gross smell that to me it was just kind of like I focused,

853
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:29.200
focused my all my shit on that smell and just like being like gross,

854
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.560
gross feeling.
DMT has a funky smell to DMT.

855
00:49:32.561 --> 00:49:35.260
Sounds like it smells like something you should not be smoking.
Right.

856
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:38.800
But then the aliens come and take you away.
Yeah.

857
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:42.880
I think the coolest shit was definitely ecstasy and that was handy.

858
00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:46.270
Flipping where you do acid and ecstasy.
Dangerous man.

859
00:49:46.271 --> 00:49:48.940
When you fuck can't find drugs like that.

860
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:53.260
You don't know the exact results of the,
the,
the,
the two of them together.

861
00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:57.910
That can be funky,
man.
So we're chicken happen.
Yeah.
Makenna told the story about,

862
00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.340
uh,
doing,
uh,
I think he did

863
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.730
a lot of whippets have,
if you don't whip,
it's Joe.
Have you done whippets before?

864
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.670
Yes,
I did whip.
It's when I worked at Newport creamery,

865
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:13.960
but I found them to be quite weak.
I didn't like it.

866
00:50:13.961 --> 00:50:17.330
Did you have like silver round your lips and they found you in the freezer?
No.

867
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.620
You know,
we worked at a creamery and they had those big whip cream things.

868
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.513
It's all,

869
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.970
you could get high off those buying by the case and get the crackers with the

870
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:27.680
balloons,
you know,
and just sit there.
I only did it once.

871
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:32.420
I did it once and gave me like a head rush.
I didn't like it.
I love it.
Yeah.

872
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.550
Duncan,
you love it.
Don't,
yeah.
How do you not like women?

873
00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:37.970
I know you gotta love whippets.
It'd be correct man.
Yes,

874
00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:40.070
brother didn't like it.

875
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:48.410
They superheat Unicorns,
turn it into nitric oxide.
I remembered

876
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:54.080
there was a way to do a whippet where you attached it to a bong somehow.

877
00:50:54.081 --> 00:50:57.550
So the whip,
it was taking a bong hit,
I think it's like you pull it,

878
00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.540
you put it in and then you put it on the end about

879
00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:04.530
<v 0>combining drugs.
Before I forgot was that Mckenna told a story once of taking.</v>

880
00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:06.990
He took um,
uh,

881
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:10.890
Iowasca and he took a mushrooms at the same time.

882
00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.210
I think he took like he took an Mao inhibitor and mushrooms.

883
00:51:15.211 --> 00:51:17.770
It might've been that,
it might've been that he took an Mao and hit him.

884
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.780
Like he took harming and he took mushrooms at the same time and he said it just

885
00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:26.930
fucked him up to the point where he was watching his memory dissolve inside of

886
00:51:27.001 --> 00:51:28.440
his brain and getting chewed up.

887
00:51:28.441 --> 00:51:32.520
Like in the gears of a machine like irreplaceably he knew what he would never

888
00:51:32.521 --> 00:51:33.840
get these thoughts and ideas back.

889
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:38.010
I had just took him like the lungs time to feel safe that he was really at one

890
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:40.050
point in time the trip convinced that this is it.

891
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:44.370
You are never coming back from this like you've gone so deep you're never coming

892
00:51:44.371 --> 00:51:46.260
home.
You know what that reminds me of?
This is a,

893
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:51.060
this is fascinating cause I thought of this recently.
So the inventor of Lsd,

894
00:51:51.061 --> 00:51:54.990
Albert Hoffman,
he the first,
he was the first person to take Lsd,

895
00:51:54.991 --> 00:51:57.510
took it in the laboratory and when he took it,
you know,

896
00:51:57.511 --> 00:51:59.700
they call it bicycle date,
right.
You know that whole story.

897
00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:03.340
Do you call it bicycle day?
Yeah.
You know,
the day LSD was invented,

898
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:07.320
the bicycle day because he took anyone for riding his bike and he looked down as

899
00:52:07.321 --> 00:52:11.820
flying over the mountains and that started the 60s well it was the 40 so it was

900
00:52:11.821 --> 00:52:16.590
a little while,
but so anyway,
he,
when he took that Lsd,

901
00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:21.780
he took a huge dose and he did not know that it would stop.

902
00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:26.010
Like if you've ever taken LSD and you're having like maybe not the best trip,

903
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.980
there's always a friend nearby,
it'd be like,
don't worry,
you'll be fine.

904
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.490
A couple hours Hoffman,
he didn't have that.

905
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:36.720
He couldn't put on any pink Floyd.
There is no tie dyes to stare at.

906
00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:39.900
There was just him in bed with his wife giving him milk.

907
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.740
They were giving him milk and he said he was being attacked by demons and his

908
00:52:43.741 --> 00:52:44.574
bed.

909
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.320
The first person that ever did anything psychedelic like that or a first

910
00:52:49.321 --> 00:52:52.560
experience like that when there's no information,
must've been so terrified.

911
00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:53.880
The worst trip every time.

912
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.000
Cause someone will find a new one because this is the thing I was thinking,

913
00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.200
you know the amazing story of how Di Dmt or Iowa Ska comes from.

914
00:53:01.201 --> 00:53:01.981
Like you've told me this,

915
00:53:01.981 --> 00:53:05.010
a zillion different herbs in the jungle and how the fuck did someone figure that

916
00:53:05.011 --> 00:53:09.450
out?
This is what I think,
you know,
most of the planet is ocean.

917
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.950
So there's gotta be psychedelic starfish.

918
00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:18.270
There's gotta be some kind of crazy mix of shit that someone's going to find and

919
00:53:18.271 --> 00:53:21.150
take and there's going to be a new psychedelic drug.

920
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:24.600
I'm not saying it's going to come from the seat,
but there's going to be a new,

921
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.070
there's going to be a new

922
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.740
<v 3>drug that comes out eventually as the same impact.
The Elliot snorting Cmo?</v>

923
00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:32.530
<v 2>I really think so.
I hope so.
Give her a snort stats.
Well,</v>

924
00:53:32.531 --> 00:53:35.380
the thing is that everything that comes up,
they throw the water on it.

925
00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:38.860
Everything.
You know,
Salvia,
there's no reason to make Salvia illegal.

926
00:53:38.861 --> 00:53:42.310
No one's died of Salvia ever pulling it off the shelf.

927
00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:47.140
Any illegal why?
Yeah,
because the retarded internet videos it produces.

928
00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:51.800
Brian did one,
right?
There's just too,
man,
I'm not yours.
You're a Salvy.

929
00:53:51.801 --> 00:53:55.480
Videos are great.
I'm telling you about all the other ones.

930
00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:59.440
I just can't stand watching someone turned themselves into what someone with Ms.

931
00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:04.140
It's the worst.
It's not exciting watching co like Brittany Spears videos.

932
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:07.320
I would like TMZ.
You still like car accident when a watch?
Well sort of,

933
00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.900
but for someone,
okay,
let's just say this is,
we are,
you know,

934
00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.430
men who have lived longer than others and we have experienced more than others.

935
00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:19.240
But if you're living in fucking Indiana and you're 17 years old and you,

936
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:19.980
you know,

937
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.750
your friend just did Salvia and you're going to watch a video and he told you

938
00:54:22.751 --> 00:54:26.150
changed his fucking life and he's reexamining the way it looks at the world.
And,

939
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.810
and you watched that video.
I mean,
that can be kind of a trip.

940
00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.660
And so we're looking at it like saying like,
all these morons are doing this,

941
00:54:31.661 --> 00:54:34.810
but you know,
from your point of view,
they're more on.
She may let me just say,

942
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.030
I don't think there are,
a lot of them are morons.
Let's be real.
Okay,

943
00:54:37.031 --> 00:54:37.864
they're morons.
But

944
00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.520
<v 3>here's the thing though,
you know,
I was a moron at God.</v>

945
00:54:40.521 --> 00:54:43.520
Thank God there was no youtube when I was doing drugs for the first time,

946
00:54:43.521 --> 00:54:48.020
you know?
But,
um,
fuck yeah.
But here's the thing,
the problem with,

947
00:54:48.021 --> 00:54:50.270
when I see those videos inevitably,

948
00:54:50.271 --> 00:54:53.720
here's what you'll see in the background outside of yours.
You'll,

949
00:54:53.721 --> 00:54:58.460
what you'll see in the background is a baby crib or,
um,

950
00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:01.250
you'll hear a,
they're listening to this.
Uh,

951
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.770
the x box is on full blast.

952
00:55:03.771 --> 00:55:07.580
Or like the opposite things that you would want to have in the background is

953
00:55:07.581 --> 00:55:11.480
you're trying to access a psychedelic state are happening because these kids,

954
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.170
they don't know how to take the psychedelics.
You've got to heat the oils.

955
00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.960
<v 2>I just hate because there's,
we need to Sharmane.
Yeah,</v>

956
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:23.540
it's really a fucking a travesty that we don't have people that have experienced

957
00:55:23.541 --> 00:55:26.300
these things that are like,
like reputable,
you know,

958
00:55:26.301 --> 00:55:28.660
there'd be some sleazy Shama and they're just trying to get their deck socks,

959
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:31.850
some creepy dudes,
which there are white,
which there are now.

960
00:55:31.851 --> 00:55:34.340
There's a lot of those dudes out there now in the psychedelic community that are

961
00:55:34.341 --> 00:55:38.870
like kind of like fucking fake wise man is.
There's a lot of fake wise.
Yeah.
It,

962
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.600
there's a lot of people that are trying,
but you know,
half of them are sake.

963
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.990
You know,

964
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:45.770
how about the old when someone's telling you about some deep everything and then

965
00:55:45.771 --> 00:55:49.620
it's like cigarette.
So many of them.
Yeah.

966
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:53.060
So fucking many of them.
I swear to God,
Dude,

967
00:55:53.061 --> 00:55:56.240
I was in front of the Improv and the guy started telling me about how dangerous

968
00:55:56.241 --> 00:56:00.290
Kim trails were fucking cigarette mark.
It's like,
dude,

969
00:56:00.291 --> 00:56:03.320
you're sucking poisonous gas intentionally in your mouth.

970
00:56:03.321 --> 00:56:05.570
Why are you worried about,
can worry about chem trails for you.

971
00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:08.210
What you're doing is 10 times worse making chem trails.

972
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.200
Could you imagine if babies could smoke cigarettes if baby's had cigarette smoke

973
00:56:12.201 --> 00:56:13.220
pumped to the lungs the way this guy,

974
00:56:13.221 --> 00:56:16.790
I think he should have channel trails are bad.
If Kim Charles or really that bad.

975
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.070
There's really a bad for you.
Yeah.
What he's doing.

976
00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:22.250
I mean it's not as bad as cigarettes are.
Not as bad.
No.

977
00:56:22.251 --> 00:56:24.170
I pointed it out fucking way worse,

978
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.680
<v 3>man.
He felt bad about it.
Yeah.</v>

979
00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:28.740
<v 2>You know babies are doing fine.
Getting blasted by chem trails.
Okay.</v>

980
00:56:28.741 --> 00:56:31.110
What I'm saying is if you gave baby cigarettes they'd be fucked.

981
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:35.080
<v 3>Oh yeah.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
You don't seem a lot of fucking,
yeah,</v>

982
00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:36.700
you don't see like angry babies.

983
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:38.810
<v 2>You do though.
If you watch him videos from Thailand,</v>

984
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:41.660
two year old from Thailand smoking cigarettes thing ever.
I'm sorry,

985
00:56:41.661 --> 00:56:45.580
your kids smoking as cute as far as trends.
They don't give a fuck over there.

986
00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.870
And it's cute.
It's adorable.
I don't know why,

987
00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:49.060
but there's something at door will hit,

988
00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:53.250
gets mad when he doesn't get a cigarettes.
Throws temper tantrums.

989
00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:56.150
That's a freaks.
Yeah.
When you're two or three and whenever he is,

990
00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.610
you've got no self control.
Nicotine,

991
00:56:58.611 --> 00:57:01.610
Fritz by both of you guys have kicked cigarettes.
Brian,

992
00:57:01.611 --> 00:57:05.660
you're back on the cigarettes,
right?
Yeah.
For a couple weeks ago.
Okay,

993
00:57:05.661 --> 00:57:09.200
so I've never done the cigarettes.
Tell me,
what is the pole?

994
00:57:09.201 --> 00:57:11.270
Why is it so difficult to quit?
What is it?

995
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:13.460
<v 3>Well,</v>

996
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:18.490
it's one of the most addictive substances on the planet according to scientists.

997
00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:22.220
It's fucking horrible.
Here's the airwon.
So you're hooked on here.

998
00:57:22.221 --> 00:57:24.150
So they say that's this thing.
They always said,
you're right.

999
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.450
Let's say you're an ex heroin addict,
right?

1000
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.600
And you're in the program and you're going to Naa and you're working on your

1001
00:57:29.601 --> 00:57:31.760
life,
but heroin's legal,
right?

1002
00:57:31.761 --> 00:57:35.180
So every time you go out in public and walk to go get your groceries,

1003
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.370
there's a chance that when you go into the grocery store,

1004
00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:41.390
there's a guy with a belt around his arms shooting up before he goes to get

1005
00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:45.440
middle and deep.
So just everywhere you go,
yeah,
you're getting triggered.

1006
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:50.570
W with cigarettes,
it's exact.
It's like with cigarettes,

1007
00:57:50.571 --> 00:57:52.370
you're hooked on the most addictive substance,

1008
00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:55.730
but everywhere you go there's going to be a couple of people smoking,

1009
00:57:55.910 --> 00:58:00.510
triggering that addiction and forcing you back into the cycle ends.
Right.

1010
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.660
<v 5>Reaction is you're not going to die for having that one cigarette.</v>

1011
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.930
You're going to actually feel relaxed and exactly what you want.
You know,

1012
00:58:06.931 --> 00:58:09.510
you're not going to be like,
I had a cigarette and I had a heart attack and died.

1013
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:10.463
You know?

1014
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.470
<v 2>It's incredible.
It's incredible how widespread it is.</v>

1015
00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:16.530
<v 5>It's mostly for stress,
you know?
And it's mostly for relaxation.</v>

1016
00:58:16.531 --> 00:58:19.260
It's just like any drug,
but very mild compared to every other.
Yeah.

1017
00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:22.860
<v 2>I was very lucky that I had friends when I was in high school that had already</v>

1018
00:58:22.861 --> 00:58:25.500
started smoking cigarettes that already were hooked and I was like,

1019
00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:27.840
this is incredible.
They're 17 years old and they're hooked on cigarettes.

1020
00:58:27.841 --> 00:58:32.040
This is just fucking insane.
And so I made sure that I,
I never did it.
I tried to,

1021
00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:32.940
I think I tried it once.

1022
00:58:32.941 --> 00:58:36.120
I tried a cigarette at a party when I was like 15 I didn't like it.

1023
00:58:36.121 --> 00:58:40.170
It was disgusting.
But my point is like if you see somebody smoking cigarettes,

1024
00:58:40.171 --> 00:58:42.000
man,
the smoking cigarettes is grows.

1025
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:45.270
You ever see someone that that's a heroine guy?
Yo,

1026
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:49.650
you ever known anybody that's got a heroin problems?
I have never known.
Well,

1027
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:51.600
I guess I have known a heroin junkie here and there,

1028
00:58:51.601 --> 00:58:54.890
but I've never been close with them.
Have you ever been around someone?
Right,

1029
00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.730
right after they did it?
No.

1030
00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.880
There's this guy named buffalo bill when I used to play pool and white plains

1031
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.450
executive billiards in white plains,
New York.
There was a lot of action there.

1032
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:06.240
A lot of gambling that place you stay up till like four or five o'clock in the

1033
00:59:06.241 --> 00:59:09.480
morning.
The guy owned it,
his name is Guy Hamilton is cool motherfucker.

1034
00:59:09.481 --> 00:59:10.990
His actual name was guy as a reader,

1035
00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:14.520
but he was a professional piano player and he thought Aza reedy sounded to

1036
00:59:14.521 --> 00:59:19.380
Guinea.
So I went with Guy Hamilton.
I think it sounds more professional.
Anyway,

1037
00:59:19.381 --> 00:59:22.220
they used to have these,
a tremendous pool matches

1038
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.040
<v 4>that would go on due to bet thousands and thousands of dollars and people would</v>

1039
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:25.791
bet in the stands.

1040
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:28.910
I mean it was some of the most fun times of my life were watching people gamble

1041
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.280
and there was this one guy he used to come into play.

1042
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:32.960
There was a dude named George the Greek.

1043
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:36.440
There was this local house guy that had a ton of money and he'd like to bet
high,

1044
00:59:36.441 --> 00:59:39.860
he would always fuck it.
Come on you cock sucker.
You got no hot,
you bet.

1045
00:59:39.861 --> 00:59:42.020
5,000 and he always wanted a bed guys.

1046
00:59:42.021 --> 00:59:44.300
And so it guys would come in from out of state to play him.
And this dude,

1047
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:48.650
Buffalo Bill,
otherwise known as water dog,
that was his other nickname.
And He,
uh,

1048
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:49.700
he was a heroin junkie.

1049
00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.400
And what would happen is he would shoot heroin and then he'd come out of the

1050
00:59:52.401 --> 00:59:57.320
bathroom and sit in a seat like this for half an hour.
I mean,

1051
00:59:57.321 --> 01:00:01.460
like this like,
sorry,
now pause,
limp like a,
like the double gay limp thing.

1052
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:03.410
And you sit there and his head where like half.

1053
01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.710
And then he would get up after like 25 minutes of that,

1054
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.360
he would get up and start fucking Fairen balls into the hole with no fear.

1055
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:14.420
Really could not miss.
Wow.
Could not miss.

1056
01:00:14.421 --> 01:00:17.180
He was one of the best players I've ever seen play.

1057
01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:20.540
And he was blasted out of his fucking mind on heroin.

1058
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:24.890
I watched him run a hundred balls.
He was playing straight pool for it was,

1059
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:27.890
I don't remember the number,
but it was always the several thousands of dollars.

1060
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:29.330
He was playing a game straight pool.

1061
01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:33.470
The dude ran a hundred balls and out on a table with these tiny ass pockets.

1062
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:35.870
The pockets were not even four inches.

1063
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:38.840
It was like three and three quarter inches.
Standard is five inches.

1064
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.170
The pros plan,
four and a half.
These are like three and three quarter.

1065
01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:45.020
They were tiny ass and if you didn't hit the ball perfect,

1066
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.480
it would jar in the pocket and drive you fucking crazy.

1067
01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:50.570
This dude with a fire them through the fucking meat of the pocket,

1068
01:00:50.571 --> 01:00:54.160
like the pocket was a swimming pool and he was rolling a golf ball into it.

1069
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:57.920
He was a fucking master and there's babies walking around the scene on heroin,

1070
01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:03.020
black dead rattle snake eyes.
He might as well have been a fucking shark.

1071
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:07.640
His ibes were dead.
He was just heroin to the gills,
to the gills.

1072
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:11.450
You'd look at him,
you'd saw no one in there.
You saw no one in there,

1073
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:14.300
but he knew the rules are straight pool and he'd be fucking set up that break

1074
01:01:14.301 --> 01:01:17.030
shot,
smash that rack and be perfect on every ball.

1075
01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:20.450
It was infuriating and Georgia Greek would get crazy because he knew the guy was

1076
01:01:20.451 --> 01:01:23.330
on down.
He goes,
he's on the fucking shit.
I want to win this money.

1077
01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:25.040
I've got to get this cock sock off the shit.

1078
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:28.280
I'm not playing these fucking junkies anymore and you get crazy and he starts

1079
01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:29.900
yelling,
he's smoking cigarettes.
I'm going to fucking,

1080
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.420
he's fucking junkies is fucking,

1081
01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:34.610
you didn't hear a word that guy was saying just firing balls in the hole.

1082
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.660
Didn't even look up.

1083
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:38.420
George is like literally yelling and screaming cause he's about to lose this

1084
01:01:38.421 --> 01:01:40.780
money and the guy didn't miss a ball,
just didn't even pay.

1085
01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:44.870
<v 3>It's just something that,
you know like with heroin,
you know,
I obviously,</v>

1086
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:49.440
it seems to engender some kind of creative state and for music it's certainly

1087
01:01:49.441 --> 01:01:53.270
music,
but I never thought there was like I hand coordination associated with it.

1088
01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.110
<v 4>No,
what it is,
no,
his eye and coordination is already,</v>

1089
01:01:56.111 --> 01:02:00.070
he's been playing pool for his whole life.
This guy,
he's a water dog,

1090
01:02:00.071 --> 01:02:03.700
was this guy that had played all over the fucking world.
I mean he was,

1091
01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.150
he was a killer.
He was one of those dudes would come into a pool hall.

1092
01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:10.000
You know there's a lot of pool halls all across America where people are begging

1093
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:13.540
for some guy to come in and challenged the local player cause they think fucking

1094
01:02:13.541 --> 01:02:16.630
Danny's playing good.
He's got some money.
We're going to spend some money.

1095
01:02:16.631 --> 01:02:19.150
If any fucking road guys stick to going to take the money off Danny.

1096
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.900
Well he's one of those guys that would slip into these towns where they was.

1097
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:24.540
They would,
you know what I mean?
Still do to this day.
Pool halls.

1098
01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.860
Well our real action pool hall,
those are fun fucking places if you like pool.

1099
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:31.710
And the fun part is when someone comes in and wants a gamble.

1100
01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:35.490
So this guy would come in all dirty hair looking big,
fucking bald head,

1101
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:39.600
big stupid fat face.
Didn't look healthy at all.
Lyft all fucked up and he,

1102
01:02:39.601 --> 01:02:41.280
you know,
he,
you guys want to planes we want to play.

1103
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:42.950
And people looking at them going,
what is this guy?

1104
01:02:42.951 --> 01:02:45.890
A fucking hustler came in to walk.
He had this terrible cause.

1105
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:49.710
Even a bad car accident.
Always heroin down,
always heroin down,

1106
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.820
and he would just get in and just fire on people just fine when he was,

1107
01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:57.000
if he had his mixture right.
I've seen him fucked up before,

1108
01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:57.960
but he didn't have his heroin.

1109
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.000
There was one time where he wanted me to sponsor them.

1110
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:02.220
This is all back in California.
When I first moved here,

1111
01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.020
I ran into him at hard times,
billiards,

1112
01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:05.970
and he wanted me to put him in the tournament,
so I said,
yeah,

1113
01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:09.120
I'll put you in the Turner.
He goes,
I gotta get my shit to me.
Right.
I go,

1114
01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:11.820
you gotta get your Shit.
Okay,
we'll go get your shit.
He goes,
well,
I need a ride.

1115
01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:16.440
I go,
where Compton get the fuck outta here.
Like I'm not driving a Compton.
I was,

1116
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.970
I'm on a Sitcom,
dude.

1117
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:21.640
I'm not trying to drive an a Compton so you can cop heroin so he could play pool

1118
01:03:21.641 --> 01:03:24.480
better.
So he didn't get his heroin that day and he played like shit.

1119
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.920
If he would have to,
you have to get his heroin perfect.
Get as mixture.
Right.

1120
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.720
It's very talented player though,
man.

1121
01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:33.270
He just got unfortunately got under the grips of that shit,

1122
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.960
but when he was on it,
man,
I didn't care.
How's he doing now he's dead.

1123
01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.620
That's the thing about heroin dudes.
They don't really last that long.
No,

1124
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:44.490
that's not a healthy drug.
You know,
it's not one that you know,

1125
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:46.230
but when they're on it,
man,

1126
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.550
<v 0>yes,
he come out great.</v>

1127
01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:51.670
I mean there's always the question would Jimi Hendrix would,

1128
01:03:51.671 --> 01:03:56.060
have he been Jimmy Hendrix if it wasn't for acid,
if it was a mushrooms for you,

1129
01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.000
probably a lot better.
Can you imagine if he went off it?
Jimi Hendrix,

1130
01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.510
you imagine,
by the way,
here's the thing man,

1131
01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:09.570
I've got a friend who argues that that we're a tarted argument that contrarion

1132
01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.880
you would be better if you weren't on the whoever it is.

1133
01:04:15.881 --> 01:04:16.980
If they weren't on here and if they yeah,

1134
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:20.290
<v 3>worn on the mushrooms were not on acid,
they would be better and that is crap.</v>

1135
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:23.580
<v 0>Where's that coming from?
Is He never done anything?
No,
he has,</v>

1136
01:04:23.581 --> 01:04:26.970
but he's like a jazz person and he's like pointing out that like miles Davis was

1137
01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:31.000
great before he got in heroin and it doesn't look,
yeah,

1138
01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:32.790
but miles Davis was always smoking weed.

1139
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:35.610
Elvis Presley's never didn't draw those guys smoked weed.

1140
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.050
I guarantee you miles Davis smoked weed to per fucking jazz musicians.
Man.

1141
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.620
It's like comics.
I mean there's a few comics,
don't smoke weed,
just a few of us,

1142
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:47.550
but for the most part,
unless they have health problems,
why wouldn't you?
Oh,

1143
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:52.990
<v 3>Philip k Dick dedicated one of his books to all these people who had gone and</v>

1144
01:04:53.811 --> 01:04:57.590
seen from a psychedelic.
Wow.
And he had a,
he had a,

1145
01:04:57.591 --> 01:05:00.980
I can't remember how he described it,
but the way he described it was like,

1146
01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.450
he described them as like,

1147
01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.870
I can't remember that brilliant person out there knows who it was at the end of

1148
01:05:05.871 --> 01:05:10.110
that awesome animated waking life style movie they did.
Um,
what did that,

1149
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:11.720
what was that?
The scanner dark.
Yes.

1150
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:18.190
It's like kind of like the risk involved in deciding to do psychedelics or do

1151
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:21.100
whatever it is to enhance your art.

1152
01:05:21.101 --> 01:05:23.980
There's a certain risk involved because sometimes you aren't,

1153
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:28.500
you aren't going to come back.
Sometimes like when Mckenna makes the uh,

1154
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:33.460
Mao inhibitor and the whatever and his mind is getting ground up,

1155
01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:37.360
he,
there's a chance he might not have got some people don't make it out.

1156
01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:38.950
Like some people you run into them,

1157
01:05:38.951 --> 01:05:41.260
they at some point in their life they will probably brilliant.

1158
01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.560
They had it together,
they were there but now they're like

1159
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:47.930
<v 2>borderline personality or how you handle the trip and what direction you decide</v>

1160
01:05:47.931 --> 01:05:49.680
to let your consciousness go into.
Yeah,

1161
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.420
I mean there's parts in a trip where you can let go and everything can be okay

1162
01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:54.010
or you can fight it and your fuck.
Yeah.

1163
01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:57.610
I think that's also the case in real life.
I think after the experience is over,

1164
01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:58.170
there's,

1165
01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:01.120
there's an adjustment period when you have a really intense experience where you

1166
01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:05.320
come back to reality in regular everyday life and it seems pretty lame and it

1167
01:06:05.321 --> 01:06:08.250
seems fake and it seems slippery.
You know,

1168
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.740
one of the last time I did DMT was a few years ago and I didn't do it again

1169
01:06:11.741 --> 01:06:15.920
because the for like a couple of weeks after the experience like life,
uh,

1170
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:20.560
in my in apt way of describing it became slippery.

1171
01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.230
I felt like that the reality was very slippery.

1172
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:25.570
The idea that this insanely intense,

1173
01:06:25.571 --> 01:06:29.440
much more powerful experience than everyday life was available that easily that

1174
01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:33.100
it was just three puffs away and boom,
you're in this new dimension.

1175
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.360
That was too crazy to me.

1176
01:06:34.361 --> 01:06:39.130
It was really hard to to go and apply anything that I might have got from that

1177
01:06:39.131 --> 01:06:43.030
experience positively into regular everyday life because it made regular

1178
01:06:43.031 --> 01:06:46.360
everyday life seems so transparent.
It's tricky.

1179
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:49.510
It's tricky because it's not useful if you can't enjoy this life.

1180
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:53.470
Like the last thing you want to do is enjoy only the psychedelic world and then

1181
01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:57.250
you're just fucked up on a new thing every single day and you never,

1182
01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.520
you never interact with people here and it doesn't enhance here.

1183
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:02.310
It doesn't enhance this consciousness,
this state

1184
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:06.900
<v 3>also any cause they're people who are advocates of psychedelics.</v>

1185
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.680
Some of them I think take a bit of a delusional approach by making it seem like

1186
01:07:12.901 --> 01:07:16.560
these things are always going to be safe.
You're always going to be fine.

1187
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.160
It's like any great thing has an inherent risk.

1188
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:23.260
<v 2>Wow.
So you're going to be fine.
For the most part though,
are the natural ones.</v>

1189
01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:27.430
You don't hear about people dying from pod or mushrooms or DMT.

1190
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:30.700
You're going to die.
And I even even go crazy.

1191
01:07:30.701 --> 01:07:34.540
You hear the great crazy from acid crazy.
You hear from acid,
you hear,
you hear,

1192
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:37.540
um,
brain damage from MTMA.
I've heard that.
I've heard dude,

1193
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.720
<v 3>I think you can get brain damage from Mtma as far as going crazy from LSD.</v>

1194
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:48.760
It's like the bottom line is your brain is the organic computer,
right?

1195
01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:52.650
And whenever you're putting some kind of external thing and that,

1196
01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.140
that's shifting the way the operating system works and then rebooting it and

1197
01:07:56.141 --> 01:07:59.020
bringing it back online.
Just like any computer,

1198
01:07:59.021 --> 01:08:02.340
there's some chance that when that fucking program yeah,
too.

1199
01:08:02.341 --> 01:08:05.560
It was a big question mark in your dog.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
As well.

1200
01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:10.100
Microsoft word the fuck.
Yeah.
Because,
you know,
I lose loses sound.

1201
01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:16.370
I wish that it wasn't that way.
But if,
you know,
sometimes if you,
for example,

1202
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:19.760
<v 0>go look at a video of Timothy leary late in his life,</v>

1203
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:24.650
<v 2>you know,
what was he like?
Did he pull pull up like a a Timothy?
We,
no,</v>

1204
01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:27.860
we don't have to just describe what he's like,
he's,
he's lucid.

1205
01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:32.680
<v 0>No,
he's,
no,
he's not lucid.
He,
he's,
he's a little little fucked up man.
Yeah.</v>

1206
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.960
Maybe it was always like that,

1207
01:08:33.961 --> 01:08:38.130
but it seems that there is some sort of neurological impact.

1208
01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:42.480
The vast amount of psychedelics he's done.
It's a negative neurological

1209
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.730
<v 2>well impact.
Well,
Mckenna is the,
you know,</v>

1210
01:08:44.731 --> 01:08:47.910
the Great Bard of the psychedelic movement,
right?
Yeah.
And you know,

1211
01:08:47.911 --> 01:08:51.720
he died of a brain tumor.
Yeah.
I mean,
and he did say no.

1212
01:08:51.721 --> 01:08:54.240
The doctor said there's never been a case of mushrooms causing that,

1213
01:08:54.241 --> 01:08:57.480
but it's not just mushrooms he was doing,
he was doing,
well,
not only that,

1214
01:08:57.481 --> 01:09:01.050
the doctor might not have ever known anyone to take as much mushrooms,

1215
01:09:01.051 --> 01:09:04.710
just Mckenna.
I mean,
you're talking about a really special case.
I mean,

1216
01:09:04.711 --> 01:09:07.920
here's a guy who took a lot of fucking psychedelics all over his life.

1217
01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:10.650
The guy died of a mushroom shaped tumor.

1218
01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:13.630
I mean literally had a tumor that shaped like a mushroom is hot and heat.

1219
01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.540
That must've been so embarrassing for him.

1220
01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.920
<v 0>Like you really think so.
I headed out to Bj.</v>

1221
01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.220
I'm no actually you actually,

1222
01:09:24.221 --> 01:09:28.650
it was fairly open about it and he said um,
that a a shorter,

1223
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.240
intense life worth living.

1224
01:09:30.241 --> 01:09:33.480
Like if that is the cost of the experience that he's had,
it's absolutely worth.

1225
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:37.530
But it's like if you are a masturbation advocate and you're like it's totally

1226
01:09:37.531 --> 01:09:39.240
fine,
it's healthy,
you can jerk off all the time,

1227
01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:43.350
it doesn't do anything and then your off brain scan and it looked like there was

1228
01:09:43.351 --> 01:09:47.750
a,
a tumor shape,
like a jar of Vaseline in your brain's Dick.
Yeah.

1229
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.170
Why would it be a jar of Vaseline and
tried to get obscure fast?

1230
01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:57.660
You should have said like a dick.
So many other things.
It was just too obvious,

1231
01:09:57.661 --> 01:10:02.010
right?
Bastard.
Was Vaseline ever really a way to masturbate?

1232
01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.620
I tried to use it the other day and was like,
are you kidding?

1233
01:10:04.621 --> 01:10:05.580
It's not the right way.

1234
01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.560
<v 2>When I was in high school and I was like,</v>

1235
01:10:07.561 --> 01:10:10.380
that definitely feels better than you just using my hand,

1236
01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:12.960
but not worth the effort.
So I do it once.

1237
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.730
<v 0>Vaseline,
it's being gay is awful.
Massive.</v>

1238
01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.140
And also I still have frozen in my memory.

1239
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:20.340
I went to this really lonely guys apartment wine,

1240
01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:24.680
so it's editing something and like on his fucking desk was an open jar of

1241
01:10:24.681 --> 01:10:28.910
Vaseline with,
oh no,
it was a,
yeah,
you,
I forgot to clean

1242
01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:36.070
or he just didn't care.
He's like,
yeah,
it's my Vaseline.
That's my dip in job

1243
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.440
growth.
I watched 'em

1244
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:44.560
<v 2>this incredible documentary with a,</v>

1245
01:10:44.561 --> 01:10:48.700
it was a show in in the UK with Eddie Izzard.
Did you hear about it?
Marathon man.

1246
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:50.680
No reason why I'm thinking about Vaseline is he,

1247
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:55.150
he ran these marathons and one of the things he had to do was put like Vaseline

1248
01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:55.991
or you know,

1249
01:10:55.991 --> 01:11:00.991
some lubrication all over his sack and his balls and his dick and his nipples.

1250
01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:05.500
He ran some insane number of marathons in a row,

1251
01:11:05.501 --> 01:11:10.220
like over 40 in a row to raise money for this thing and he's not in shape and
he,

1252
01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:14.430
he doesn't,
didn't have a history of running and he started running marathons

1253
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:17.200
<v 4>and he was running.
I'm like,
he ran a thousand miles.
Wow.</v>

1254
01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.090
He ran all around the UK,
did it in like a month.
It's fucking incredible,
man.

1255
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.520
It's incredible because he's not even in shape.

1256
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:26.040
He just did it for through sheer willpower.

1257
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.270
I couldn't imagine if I had to run 26 fucking miles a day over and over and over

1258
01:11:30.271 --> 01:11:33.350
again.
I mean,
he was having all these problems.
Like today's my 11th marathon.

1259
01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.360
He gets to the fucking finish the 11th in a row,
dude,

1260
01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:39.900
in 10 days you ran 11 fucking marathons or in the 11 days,

1261
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:42.960
rather he ran 10 marathons.
Yeah,
he can.
He kept going.
He kept going.

1262
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:45.660
He would take a day off every now and then when they literally told him,

1263
01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:49.260
you can't walk today,
your feet are so fucked up.
You got blisters all,
I mean,

1264
01:11:49.261 --> 01:11:51.950
they were cutting blisters off and draining them with needles.

1265
01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:54.660
And he's wincing and then it would just run another marathon the next day.

1266
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:58.900
It's fucking incredible.
Incredible.
I never would have expected it.
You know,

1267
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:01.650
I always saw that guy on TV,
you know,
and he,
you know,

1268
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:04.950
he had some pretty clever material and he's wearing a dress and I was like,
okay,

1269
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:07.290
I guess that's his Shtick,
you know,
whatever.
What do I give a fuck?

1270
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.160
I never really paid attention.
But after watching this documentary,
I'm like,
wow,

1271
01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.330
like that guy's a powerful motherfucker.
That was a brilliant thing.
I mean the,

1272
01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:16.680
the,
the,

1273
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.850
the fact that he was able to push himself to run some like 40 something fucking

1274
01:12:20.851 --> 01:12:23.610
marathons over a thousand miles.
He ran,

1275
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.120
I think it was 1,100 miles or something crazy like that.

1276
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.740
He ran all around the UK.
It's fucking amazing.
And he's like,
you know,

1277
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:34.320
he's a fat guy who's 47 years old.

1278
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.430
He just willed himself to do it and he's never been a competitive athlete.

1279
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:38.303
Never done anything like that.

1280
01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:41.260
<v 3>Yeah.
It really shows you where you're setting the bar in your life.</v>

1281
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:44.860
Because like yesterday I was like willed myself to carry my groceries up my

1282
01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:49.000
steps.
I was like,
this is pretty good.
You didn't take the elevator by his house.

1283
01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:54.060
Somebody had glued pubic hair to the the just the crossing button where you push

1284
01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:57.370
the car.
I had the president and you get pubic hair?
No,
I mean that's it.

1285
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.200
That's it.
That is a,
I don't know how it applies but yeah,

1286
01:13:02.201 --> 01:13:06.970
that somebody in my neighborhood and my neighborhood is filled.

1287
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:10.720
It's a hipster hive and it's like filthy hipsters.

1288
01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:15.780
Someone had the brilliant idea of clipping their pubic hair and using rubber

1289
01:13:16.121 --> 01:13:19.210
cement.
The glue it on the button.
You have to press the across the street.

1290
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:22.210
<v 4>Now how does the hipster community get started?</v>

1291
01:13:22.211 --> 01:13:24.460
How does how to hipsters take over a neighborhood?

1292
01:13:24.461 --> 01:13:28.100
I know how Puerto Ricans do it.
I know how Chinese people do it.

1293
01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.600
<v 3>It starts with disagree coming in with their country and then they only spend,</v>

1294
01:13:31.601 --> 01:13:35.910
that goes from one language.
They meet together,
they form a community by town.

1295
01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.510
Word hipster is like a new word for like the subculture and the subculture gets

1296
01:13:40.511 --> 01:13:43.400
pushed basically.
It's like,
but is it really the subculture?

1297
01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.990
It is monstrously huge.
It's like the idea of alternative music.

1298
01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:49.430
It's not alternative when it's selling millions of copies.
So it goes,

1299
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.190
it goes like this.
Here's the way it works.
There's,

1300
01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:55.690
there's like on the very fringes of society right there,
the artists,

1301
01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.620
like the real artists,

1302
01:13:56.621 --> 01:13:59.800
the people who are getting like alien transmissions or whatever you want to call

1303
01:13:59.801 --> 01:14:03.370
it,
they're getting super inspiration and they're creating amazing things.

1304
01:14:03.371 --> 01:14:08.290
And usually these people are not like the mainstream.
They're way different.

1305
01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:11.100
They're usually crazy or off or they're not as,

1306
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:14.560
they're not in the same dimension that most people are.
Right,
right,
right.

1307
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:17.590
<v 2>Dude,
if you put this up to your mouth,
it'd be better work.</v>

1308
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:20.890
You're varying a lot cause you keep turning away from the microphone.

1309
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:24.420
It's very directional.
And the people get annoyed at this shit.
Sorry,

1310
01:14:24.421 --> 01:14:26.040
you guys put condenser microphones up,

1311
01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:29.460
but then you'd hear my dogs barking and you'd hear the fucking water running.

1312
01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:33.190
<v 3>Sounds good.
So hipster theory,
hips,
hipster theory.
You get the artist,</v>

1313
01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.700
the art and the artists got a group of friends,
right,
right.

1314
01:14:35.701 --> 01:14:39.430
The group of friends are really annoying and everyone cool moves away or kind of

1315
01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:43.260
artists know they're kind of artists and they start imitating whoever this,

1316
01:14:43.261 --> 01:14:45.810
this charismatic figures.
You get that group of friends,
right?

1317
01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.400
And so that group of friends there is,

1318
01:14:47.401 --> 01:14:50.670
you're the first group of people that goes and moves in to the shittiest

1319
01:14:50.671 --> 01:14:53.160
neighborhood where the rents low,
cause they're all artists.

1320
01:14:53.161 --> 01:14:55.980
They don't have a lot of money right now you've got a pretty cool group of

1321
01:14:55.981 --> 01:14:58.510
people cause you got the guys using the weird uh,

1322
01:14:58.530 --> 01:15:01.890
stencils at the bought baby holding the bomb and the flowers and he lives

1323
01:15:01.891 --> 01:15:05.070
downtown and everyone knows he's a genius and his friends live there too.

1324
01:15:05.071 --> 01:15:06.750
So let's go move downtown.
So what,

1325
01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:09.720
maybe we'll get beaten up or mugged a couple of times,

1326
01:15:09.721 --> 01:15:12.390
but we'll be around Banksy though.
Super artistic.

1327
01:15:12.391 --> 01:15:14.160
I was living on the shitty part of time.

1328
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:19.420
So then what ends up happening is you get following the group of friends and

1329
01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:22.500
another group of people who were friends with the friends and these are the

1330
01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:26.070
posers.
And then those are the people who start filling up the neighborhood.

1331
01:15:26.071 --> 01:15:29.100
And that's when you get a hipster neighborhood cause you get like people,

1332
01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:32.100
you get one really crazy guy.
I was like,
you know what,

1333
01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:35.610
today I'm going to dress like the front of sergeant pepper album.

1334
01:15:35.611 --> 01:15:38.610
I'm going to curl my mustache out and wear bell bottoms.
Oh,

1335
01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:41.200
what's it feel like to live in the center of the hive though?

1336
01:15:41.201 --> 01:15:41.920
Like is there anything like,

1337
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:45.330
cause I know you watch him like through binoculars at night and study them.

1338
01:15:45.331 --> 01:15:48.120
So what's,
is there like it's,
it's party,

1339
01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:51.690
lot of parties with the Depeche mode but like backwards or do you like it?

1340
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:52.950
Do you like living with all these hipsters?

1341
01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.670
I'd rather live there than West Hollywood or lived there with like with like

1342
01:15:56.671 --> 01:15:59.280
people who are,
who are,
you know,

1343
01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:03.300
taking authentic pleasure in riding the bullet saddle ranch.

1344
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:11.270
I'd rather live there than like around a group of people who love Karaoke.

1345
01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.910
Yeah.
I don't like to be,
I like to live around no people.
That's what I want.

1346
01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.580
You ever thought to be suburban at all?

1347
01:16:17.581 --> 01:16:20.730
Have you ever thought to move to like a Burbank or it just like a more suburban

1348
01:16:20.731 --> 01:16:23.610
neighborhood or do you kind of like being in the know I'm,

1349
01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:26.070
we're looking for a place right now.
We're trying to get the fuck out of there.

1350
01:16:26.071 --> 01:16:29.190
We're looking for a place.
Well,
we want to move near Maman.

1351
01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:33.170
We want to live in that area here.
This is Mars.
Cow Is telling you

1352
01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.470
<v 2>rev.
You don't even know what Mars is.</v>

1353
01:16:34.471 --> 01:16:37.440
You should have live with me or come to visit me.
When I was living in Colorado,

1354
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:38.430
when I was living in Colorado,

1355
01:16:38.431 --> 01:16:43.431
I was living on the top of a mountain 3000 feet above boulder on 150 acres,

1356
01:16:44.341 --> 01:16:47.700
eight miles up a dirt road into the woods.
That was,
that was Mars.

1357
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:51.780
That was literally,
you would see the sky at night just filled with star.

1358
01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:53.270
She's incredible.
Too soon.

1359
01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:57.360
<v 3>Move up there after a move up there.
After these Railey's start.</v>

1360
01:16:57.930 --> 01:17:01.770
<v 2>No,
listen man.
The probably problem up there is having babies,</v>

1361
01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.330
having little kids up there and having a wife.

1362
01:17:03.331 --> 01:17:05.280
It doesn't have to drive in the snow.
If it wasn't for all that shit,

1363
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:07.680
I would still be up there.
Right.
It was incredible.

1364
01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.170
It was like you're living around the most incredible artwork

1365
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.000
<v 4>that's ever been created by anything and it's natural artwork.
These mountains,</v>

1366
01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:17.390
this not a painting.
It's a natural three dimensional,
gigantic,

1367
01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:20.930
super beautiful thing that's right in front of you all the time and it's

1368
01:17:20.931 --> 01:17:24.080
humbling and majestic.
And I would drive up this fucking road to the,

1369
01:17:24.081 --> 01:17:24.914
to the mountain,

1370
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.030
and as you're turning and you're seeing the snow cap peaks in July,

1371
01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:32.300
there's fucking snow on them and it's just staggeringly beautiful.

1372
01:17:32.301 --> 01:17:37.160
And the sky is just crisp and clean.
There's not a hint of smog.

1373
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:41.450
It's incredible.
Incredible.
If you can live in a place like that,

1374
01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:44.090
why the fuck wouldn't you?
But it's hard.

1375
01:17:44.091 --> 01:17:46.970
That's a babies and your dog gets eaten by a fucking mountain lion.

1376
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:47.893
It's not easy.

1377
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:51.560
<v 3>I think that's the a isn't that the plot of the shining?
No.</v>

1378
01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:56.240
<v 5>Well,
it's kind of kind of is.
Dude was already nuts,
man.
I'm not nuts.</v>

1379
01:17:56.241 --> 01:18:00.350
That's the point.
Fuck man.
By the,
yeah,
he was his.
Jeremy,

1380
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:04.730
are you talking about?
I am trying.

1381
01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:08.540
Truth is Joe eight that means I am whiting.

1382
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:13.820
<v 3>Joe Ate the dog.
Actually there was no mountain lion dogs talking the book</v>

1383
01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:19.640
talking to many barks while I was writing.
I got crazy.
Joe,
what are you doing?

1384
01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:19.860
Okay,

1385
01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:23.370
<v 4>I have to write when everyone's asleep,
man,
don't you?
When do you write?</v>

1386
01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.840
Can you write during the day?
I just have to be alone.

1387
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:28.740
I don't feel like I get the same transmission.

1388
01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.380
I don't feel like I get the same connection to the universe.

1389
01:18:31.381 --> 01:18:35.250
It sounds completely retarded,
but it,
when more people are asleep,

1390
01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.240
I feel like there's less interference,
you know?
Oh,
I see.
I really,

1391
01:18:39.241 --> 01:18:43.050
the one of the reasons why,
and this sounds totally hippie,
you know,

1392
01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:46.200
go where a crystal you faggot.
It sounds like that,
but I,

1393
01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:50.190
one of the reasons why I like living way far away from people is it I,

1394
01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:52.980
I'm very sensitive to people's energy.

1395
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:56.820
I'm very sensitive to people's intent and very sensitive to,
you know,

1396
01:18:56.821 --> 01:19:00.360
to what's going on.
And I think even if I don't want to tune that in,

1397
01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:05.160
I think there's a certain amount of really like low,
low,

1398
01:19:05.161 --> 01:19:08.990
um,
low frequency interference.
Sure.

1399
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.460
You get from people when you're around them all the time.

1400
01:19:11.461 --> 01:19:12.930
Like if you're around a bunch of negative douche bags,

1401
01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.550
even if you're not interacting with them,

1402
01:19:14.551 --> 01:19:17.790
I think they're affecting the frequency of the environment.
Yeah.

1403
01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:21.960
Sounds silly now,
but it doesn't,
if you go to New York City man,
you feel the,

1404
01:19:21.961 --> 01:19:25.380
you feel the energy of the city.
What exactly are you feeling?

1405
01:19:25.381 --> 01:19:27.120
You're feeling all the fucking people,
man.

1406
01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:28.950
You're feeling something that's intangible

1407
01:19:29.170 --> 01:19:34.060
<v 3>and also,
you know,
it's like,
if you think about it,
we,
we did survive when,</v>

1408
01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:37.420
back in the days when Pete,
when it was common to get eaten by a tiger and stuff.

1409
01:19:37.421 --> 01:19:41.120
Yeah.
To be completely in tune with the tribe that you are living in.

1410
01:19:41.170 --> 01:19:43.630
The tribe wasn't in tune with each other.
You're dead.

1411
01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.000
Your tribe is gluing pubic hair to stop sign.
Yeah.
That's my tribe.

1412
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:51.810
That's your tribe.
That's what that's around.
That's what you're around them.
Well,

1413
01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:55.240
I know what you're saying.
I,
I feel less influenced by like that,

1414
01:19:55.241 --> 01:19:59.140
that level of when the,
when it's that far away.
But it's like,

1415
01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.960
it's more like when you're the group of people that you really hang around with,

1416
01:20:01.961 --> 01:20:05.080
like the person you live with,
the people that you drive around with.

1417
01:20:05.081 --> 01:20:08.010
Those are the people who are really shaping,
you know,
your

1418
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.800
<v 0>wife or your girlfriend was the one that did that though.</v>

1419
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.260
We've found out that she was the one that glued the pubic hairs.

1420
01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:18.290
The happiest days of my life.
Like my bitches a freak.
The fuck.

1421
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:23.430
Like why you want it around pubic hair.
He just got horny and crazy.

1422
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.670
I just didn't seem like the right to not even cubic.

1423
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.810
They're actually my butthole Harris.
Wow.

1424
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.970
I've been collecting them for 10 years since I was 12.

1425
01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:33.030
Did a girl with buddle hair and have to talk to her about it.

1426
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:40.630
If my girlfriend had butthole here,
you wouldn't say anything.
You just deal.
Yeah.

1427
01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:41.770
Whoa.
What am I going to,

1428
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:45.240
I would much rather deal with anger once she had a butthole hair this way back

1429
01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:48.210
in the day.
And,
um,
the bottle here at poop on it.

1430
01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:53.470
Oh God saw it was hitting it.
Oh my God.

1431
01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:56.400
That was too,
I was only 21 too,
so I totally went limp.

1432
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:59.190
I just could not keep it together and it was just too much.

1433
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.440
I had guys talk about it.
No,
I don't remember what I was,
uh,
I don't remember.

1434
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:08.670
I think I just just fucking made an excuse and ran out the room.
I did it.

1435
01:21:08.671 --> 01:21:11.850
This girl that had such so much butt hole here that sometimes you put it in like

1436
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:14.430
fuck her and it would pull her whole hair.

1437
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:18.530
And so you had to like push it out the way.
Really.

1438
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:24.830
You useless mother fucker.
Fuck.
How dare you

1439
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:31.050
tell shout something like that.
That's what he does all the time and it takes,

1440
01:21:31.051 --> 01:21:31.884
it's cute

1441
01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:40.530
how unappetizing to his movies look preview.
Every time it comes on,

1442
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:44.310
everyone goes [inaudible].
People go,
oh,

1443
01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:48.510
get the fuck outta here.
You can only rape my mind so many times,
sir,

1444
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:51.280
he's gotta change his name.
I've gone to two movies where that hit,

1445
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:55.320
that preview came on and both of them had that same exact reaction.
Ah,

1446
01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.780
people are sick of that dude.
People are sick of that dude.

1447
01:21:57.781 --> 01:21:59.880
We've done some podcast rants already.

1448
01:22:00.090 --> 01:22:03.510
The fuck you m night Shama Lama Ding Dong podcast for worse.

1449
01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.070
We've already done them so we can't repeat it.

1450
01:22:05.071 --> 01:22:08.520
But he's one of those guys where you know there's people that have accused him

1451
01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:11.430
of stealing the idea for the sixth sense to apparently there was something else

1452
01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:13.980
that had the exact same idea and it was written very similar.

1453
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:18.600
How does he keep getting money to make movies like Hollywood is filled with

1454
01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:21.390
retards?
Man,
they just,
he made me him.
Maybe he'll hit it again.

1455
01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:25.470
Proved if he gets it this time,
man,
he's back.
He's back.
Look at 6 cents.

1456
01:22:25.471 --> 01:22:30.450
He won the Oscar win an Oscar or something.
I think that's amazing though.

1457
01:22:30.451 --> 01:22:32.730
You make one good thing.
Oh,

1458
01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:36.840
you have to do is make one good thing and you get like seven bombs that you can

1459
01:22:36.841 --> 01:22:39.000
do.
Well,
he's had some that are born with that bad,

1460
01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:42.300
like unbreakable wasn't that bad.
I didn't enjoy it.
I mean,
I enjoyed it,

1461
01:22:42.301 --> 01:22:44.580
but I didn't think it was the greatest thing in the world.
But,

1462
01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:48.300
and then the village was kind of Goofy,
but it wasn't atrocious.

1463
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:49.890
But I heard the one with Marky mark,

1464
01:22:49.891 --> 01:22:54.180
the plant one when the plants come alive and killer.
Right.
That was awful.
So bad.

1465
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:58.860
It's so bad.
It's an unintentional comedy.
What about this new,
the new,

1466
01:22:58.861 --> 01:23:03.290
like what's his name?
I'm not there.
I'm still here.
Well,

1467
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:05.320
the one with the guy did the prank.

1468
01:23:05.321 --> 01:23:08.420
He went on Letterman and kind of acted like you went.
You did Jackie.

1469
01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:12.460
Have you seen this?
Phoenix?
Yeah.
It's a whole two year practice he was doing.

1470
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:15.010
Is it good acting crazy?
No.
No.

1471
01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:18.160
I don't think everyone knew that he was doing a prayer.
I don't care.

1472
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:22.180
No one was fooled.
Like everyone knew that he,
this was,
that means nothing to me.

1473
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:25.120
I don't like when people pretend to be something that not unless it's brilliant.

1474
01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.750
Right.
You know,
you gotta be bore Rod.
Okay.
Yeah,
if you can do that.
That's,

1475
01:23:28.751 --> 01:23:32.060
that's funny to me.
But just pretending you're crazy.
Who Cares?
And is thinking,

1476
01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:35.920
well,
you wasted two years of your time.
Dude,
I don't care about that guy at all.

1477
01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:39.400
Like,
why would you even care about the great actor?
He was great.
And Johnny Cash.

1478
01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:43.810
I mean,
it just doesn't seem like a good premise for most people.

1479
01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:48.130
It's hard for a dude to do Johnny Cash in my eyes and pull it off.
I'm like,

1480
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:52.060
you're going to do,
you're going to do Johnny Cash.
You're not Johnny Cash.

1481
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:53.380
Why are you pretending you're Johnny Cash?

1482
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:56.710
You're going to do Johnny can you got to be a bad motherfucker?
Johnny Cash.

1483
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:59.590
And he did it.
He pulled it off perfectly.
I bought it.

1484
01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:03.110
Hook line and sinker actors.
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
It was great.
And gladiator too.

1485
01:24:03.111 --> 01:24:06.070
It was fucking fantastic relationship with his sister.

1486
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:12.580
That idea for that.
The prank.
I know what it came from.

1487
01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:16.480
It came from cocaine real.
That's a cocaine idea.

1488
01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.090
He was doing blow with,
what's his name?
Um,

1489
01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:23.920
they got just talk on the banks thing.
He was doing blow.
He was,

1490
01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:26.710
he was doing cocaine with a,
who's the guy who did the Moo?

1491
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:31.270
Who produced the movie?
Colin Hanks.
Colin fuck off.

1492
01:24:31.271 --> 01:24:35.440
Sean Milan,
who is the guy who did it was a no idea.
Oh,
Casey Affleck.

1493
01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.280
Casey AFLAC.
Joaquim we're doing blow.

1494
01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:43.840
And that's a strong statement.
You just,
you just outed them.
Well,
I mean,

1495
01:24:43.841 --> 01:24:46.890
is that a surprise?
It just feels like a coke idea.
It feels like an IGA.

1496
01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.390
This is just purely European regulation.

1497
01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.000
This is in no way reflects the opinion of the Joe Rogan either.

1498
01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:55.960
What you're saying it though?
What?
So what,
so what happens now?
I don't know.

1499
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:58.250
I think a lawsuit.
Well,
lawsuits happen.

1500
01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.930
I just think it's funny you said allegedly.
No you didn't.

1501
01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.940
It's my theory.
I don't know if it's true.
So why did you,
why did you think that?

1502
01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:09.670
Why do you think that?
Because it's an ego idea.

1503
01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:12.910
It's like an idea that like you think you're going to do this new brilliant,

1504
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:16.660
innovative cutting edge thing and you're going to diverge away from what you're

1505
01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:17.710
already great at.

1506
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:20.560
And then you just end up putting out this thing where no one's tricked and

1507
01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:23.650
everyone's mildly annoyed.
It's just,
it's like,

1508
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.380
it's so stupid.
It's so poignant.
Just nailed it.

1509
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.640
Just do it.
Just do what you're good at.
Don't cause this always happens.

1510
01:25:33.641 --> 01:25:34.391
It always happens.

1511
01:25:34.391 --> 01:25:38.560
Where a really great actor or some someone or do you think it's an ego thing?

1512
01:25:38.610 --> 01:25:41.800
Yeah,
it's an,
it's an ego thing.
Why?
Why is it an ego thing?

1513
01:25:41.801 --> 01:25:42.940
Because he wants to see that.
If he,

1514
01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:46.390
if he can pull it off because he wants to see if he can pull it up and he thinks

1515
01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:50.890
he's important enough or the entire country is going to,
oh my God.

1516
01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:54.070
Well what's happened to our dear?
Why no one cares?

1517
01:25:54.130 --> 01:25:57.730
You go three months down the road.
You've forgotten about the guy.
Yeah.

1518
01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:00.430
It's a bit disappointing because he was a good actor.

1519
01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:04.100
He's still a good actor to make you work with nutty and stuff.
Some

1520
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.180
<v 2>shit into his face.
I remember when he had fake cheekbones.
Oh,</v>

1521
01:26:07.181 --> 01:26:11.310
is that you went nutty when money,
but they took them back.
It took him back.
Well,

1522
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:12.920
I hope they take quite keen back.

1523
01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.180
Do you don't want him to lose his position and I know I love his movies.

1524
01:26:17.181 --> 01:26:21.500
He's a great actor.
Great actor.
What about his hip hop?
Not impressed.
Love it.

1525
01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.280
Love it.
That's the only good thing about that movie is the music.

1526
01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:29.280
He's my new song.
Tell me what you think to today's Oh,
oh,
oh,

1527
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:33.650
I seen your girl's butthole.
Do Dude,
don't just give that stuff away.

1528
01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:37.730
Have you copyrighted that?
A senior girls bought home.

1529
01:26:39.250 --> 01:26:43.370
It's really good at searching lately.
You should make a move.
I,

1530
01:26:43.371 --> 01:26:44.300
there's a I,

1531
01:26:44.301 --> 01:26:47.750
there's several people that I know in my life that I would love to do one of

1532
01:26:47.751 --> 01:26:48.950
those.
Wendy's had to heat things.

1533
01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:53.000
Just have them convinced that we're really shooting.
Yes.
A movie with them.

1534
01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.600
Totally.
Really doing a document.
If you ever seen,
I haven't seen what the city,

1535
01:26:56.601 --> 01:27:00.260
he's amazing.
Awesome.
Still haven't seen it.
Check it out.
So good.

1536
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:04.370
The idea for people don't know is they convinced this crazy guy that he was

1537
01:27:04.371 --> 01:27:08.720
famous,
allegedly.
Allegedly.
Crazy.
He's crazy.

1538
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.740
Yeah.

1539
01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.000
<v 5>Oh yeah.
Allegedly.
Do you,</v>

1540
01:27:11.001 --> 01:27:15.280
is that you really have to say that I can't get in trouble.

1541
01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:18.390
<v 2>You don't want to hurt the flesh though.
I can get in trouble.</v>

1542
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:21.680
Frustrated it going to do with what I'm saying.
Don't be,
you know,

1543
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.370
<v 5>very,
I'm just very concerned about my slider.
Shut up.</v>

1544
01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:28.140
You're not my legal advisor.

1545
01:27:28.330 --> 01:27:33.330
You're saying that because Joe said that the main character scary Perry and

1546
01:27:34.381 --> 01:27:37.920
Wendy's city eat was crazy.
Now it's got that police could not have it.
Yeah.

1547
01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:41.080
<v 2>That guy could not have existed without the comedy store.</v>

1548
01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:46.240
The comedy store is like the magnet for the craziest fucking people from all

1549
01:27:46.241 --> 01:27:47.830
over the world would be drawn to that place.

1550
01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:52.270
You're never fucking people that we met at that place.
How about that?

1551
01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:56.200
That fucking hooker,
the crazy hooker that was on camera just telling me about,

1552
01:27:56.350 --> 01:28:00.130
she puts an ad in craigslist,
just shows up at God's houses and fucks him.

1553
01:28:00.131 --> 01:28:03.010
And that's the old way to do it.
Nowadays you just become a porn star.

1554
01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:05.320
Is that what they're doing?
Porn Star hookers.

1555
01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:07.720
It seems like everyone's a porn star.
Well,
it kind of makes sense.

1556
01:28:07.721 --> 01:28:10.330
It'd be like good advertising.
If you really wanted to be a hooker,

1557
01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.600
you would do porn and say,
you know,
you could be you.

1558
01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.490
It could be fucking this right now.
And you know,
and then they put an ad out,

1559
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:21.670
you know that it's crazy.
It's that there's this one porn star that's pretty

1560
01:28:22.050 --> 01:28:22.461
<v 5>well no,</v>

1561
01:28:22.461 --> 01:28:26.640
and I'm not going to say who it is and I searched her and found her on like a

1562
01:28:26.641 --> 01:28:29.730
one of those hooker,
a review websites.

1563
01:28:29.731 --> 01:28:33.750
Have you seen these where they review hookers?
It's like,
it's like,

1564
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:38.520
it's like Amazon where like that girl's pussy smiled but she did put out,

1565
01:28:38.521 --> 01:28:40.980
you know,
and it was good and you know,
anyways,

1566
01:28:40.981 --> 01:28:43.020
I found her on there and you could like,

1567
01:28:43.021 --> 01:28:46.530
it gives her rates and reviews and it also gives her mobile cell phone number so

1568
01:28:46.531 --> 01:28:50.610
you can just call her up.
I was like,
this is ridiculous.
This website,

1569
01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:54.600
what's the name of uh,
fuck.
I can't remember.

1570
01:28:54.601 --> 01:28:57.630
That's a good thing for people to know.
That is insane.
I can't remember.

1571
01:28:57.631 --> 01:28:58.800
I'm sure people are going to start twitching.

1572
01:28:59.130 --> 01:29:02.310
Reviews are always hilarious when you go Yelp and someone's

1573
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:07.260
<v 0>taken the time to write a serious lead paragraph review about a cafe,
thoughtful,</v>

1574
01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:11.670
thoughtful review like their Siskel and Ebert and they're reviewing like the,

1575
01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.940
the Sherman oaks.
Starbucks.
Well,

1576
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:17.340
I think some folks have like they have aspirations like,
hey,

1577
01:29:17.341 --> 01:29:21.120
I'll start out reviewing shit on Yelp and then I'll start a blog because people

1578
01:29:21.121 --> 01:29:23.400
enjoy my Yelp reviews.
And next thing you know,

1579
01:29:23.401 --> 01:29:28.380
a Gq will hire me to be their resident critic because of my snarky reviews.

1580
01:29:28.381 --> 01:29:31.080
Sad,
sad.
Pat,
I'm so snarky.

1581
01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:35.790
I really know how to cut you down.
Yeah.
You down to size.

1582
01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:37.710
The snarky reviews suck.

1583
01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:42.390
But what's even more unnerving is when someone gives like a passionate,

1584
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:45.900
a positive review for a Shoney's.
All right.
You know what I mean?

1585
01:29:45.901 --> 01:29:49.920
Or if someone likes Shoney's,
Denny's,
Denny's,
you know what I mean?
Or for like,

1586
01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:54.060
uh,
if you go on Yelp,
you can look at reviews for like,
um,
uh,

1587
01:29:54.061 --> 01:29:56.430
office depot or staples.

1588
01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:01.110
<v 5>I hope I'm a Yelp elite.
Are you a Yelp elite?
Yeah.
How many times they actually,</v>

1589
01:30:01.111 --> 01:30:03.830
you did two things today.
You made fun of him.
This,

1590
01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:07.940
<v 0>the,
the second one.
The salvia videos and the yellow.
Yeah.</v>

1591
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:11.160
He's a Salvia video and he's an ELP cards.
Sorry,
I don't mean to,

1592
01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:14.190
I'm not talking about you.
His reviews are great.

1593
01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.810
I see your reviews are hilarious.

1594
01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:17.560
<v 5>Sometimes you get,
you know,</v>

1595
01:30:17.561 --> 01:30:20.950
something that you hate and you want to make sure that if people are driving

1596
01:30:20.951 --> 01:30:23.920
around going,
let's go to a restaurant,
Bam,
oh,
this is something to know.

1597
01:30:23.921 --> 01:30:27.910
For the most part,
this is four stars.
You know,
I,
your reviews are different.

1598
01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:33.040
Like I like,
I like access of information.
You have to come off the ledge.

1599
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:36.910
Come on.
Yeah.
But would you take your sweetie to a restaurant if you like,

1600
01:30:36.911 --> 01:30:38.320
looked at the reviews and it says,
you know,

1601
01:30:38.321 --> 01:30:41.790
chef farts and on every plate before giving it to you?

1602
01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:44.520
Maybe if it was one review that said that,
yes,
that would be,

1603
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.020
I would still be down.

1604
01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.300
There was a restaurant where a chef farted on the plates I might get best is

1605
01:30:49.301 --> 01:30:52.090
when you go to people's,
uh,
if you follow that stuff,

1606
01:30:52.091 --> 01:30:54.120
if you go to their review site where you know,

1607
01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:58.030
you look at all the reviews and they're all negative to just a rotten,

1608
01:30:58.050 --> 01:31:02.830
can't write angry at everything they see everywhere they go.
I like it,

1609
01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.930
especially for dentists and doctors.

1610
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:09.340
So you went to this doctor has 9,000 reviews.

1611
01:31:09.341 --> 01:31:12.730
All positive and except one negative.
I'm going to go to that doctor,
you know.

1612
01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:15.850
Well there's people that will complain about Dunkin.
When you take these,

1613
01:31:15.851 --> 01:31:16.780
you know,
harsh hits.

1614
01:31:16.781 --> 01:31:19.030
To me it really hurts because you're not really thinking it out.

1615
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:24.140
I didn't think he's helping man.
How many reviews are you,

1616
01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.960
do you have on your Yelp?
I don't know.
A lot.
I love Yelp.
I just girls,

1617
01:31:29.170 --> 01:31:32.200
the girls ever yelled at you and they send you Yelp messages like I really loved

1618
01:31:32.201 --> 01:31:36.610
how you reviewed that Taco Bell.
Oh I have a lot dude.
I love your writing.
Yup.

1619
01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:39.340
Yup.
Actually has parties for all the Yelp elites.

1620
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:43.240
And then when you go there and this bomb on you it's like Oh my God,

1621
01:31:43.241 --> 01:31:47.460
it's like 40 people like 39 of them are Asian girls and then you know,

1622
01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:48.340
so it's like what,

1623
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:51.380
where did they have the part until we had it as last year when you walked in the

1624
01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:54.400
room,
we had a Christmas party at the viper room last year.

1625
01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:58.540
<v 0>That would suck that 40 Yelp reviewers in your establishment.
Cause one of them,</v>

1626
01:31:58.550 --> 01:32:00.040
it's going to leave Shitty Ryan walks.

1627
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:04.120
<v 5>No totally purple leisure shoes and you get served better because he'd like make</v>

1628
01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:07.030
me print out a Yelp badge and put it in her wallet and then you could like flip

1629
01:32:07.031 --> 01:32:11.080
it when you go to the hostess stand and they automatically serve you better and

1630
01:32:11.081 --> 01:32:14.100
try harder and cook her food.
But just kidding.
I don't today.
Okay.

1631
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:17.560
You went too far with that one son.
You should have bailed on that one.

1632
01:32:17.561 --> 01:32:20.260
Earlier you knew it was a stinker.
How many,

1633
01:32:20.261 --> 01:32:24.440
how many Asian checks have you met from these things?
Not many accident dining.

1634
01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:27.910
I've only gone once.
A few of you dated any of these agents now,

1635
01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:32.560
why not just fucked him on,
hey,
this is a family show.

1636
01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:35.860
You're going to fuck up here.
You look at it and you go,
Hey,

1637
01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:37.930
I'm a single man now I'm out there.
Yelping

1638
01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:44.380
nothing makes me feel better after I get out of a bad relationship then right.

1639
01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:49.320
Riding a Yelp review.
We'd stores.
Lately I've been yelping.
Oh yeah,

1640
01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:52.060
that's,
I mean,
it's cool because like you go,
you read these reviews and go,
hey,

1641
01:32:52.061 --> 01:32:54.520
these people,
you don't have a cash machine.
They'd do credit cards.

1642
01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:57.070
I do review Yelp.
I mean,
I read the reviews,

1643
01:32:57.071 --> 01:33:00.160
but I do not review things and that's really selfish for me.

1644
01:33:00.161 --> 01:33:03.970
I'm a fucking one way street.
Yeah.
You're like,
uh Oh.
Downloading torrents,

1645
01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:07.690
sharing.
I enjoy your reviews on Yelp,

1646
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:09.760
but outside of red band,
it's just,

1647
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:13.230
it's just to me like when you read some of the impassioned and passion Yelper

1648
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:17.650
view where someone's really that pissed off that they're like writing an angry

1649
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:20.230
Yelp review.
It's always,
some of them are so dumb.

1650
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.610
What bothers me when they start complaining about the prices,
you know,

1651
01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:28.690
and it's so overpriced and this and that and that this,

1652
01:33:28.691 --> 01:33:32.740
and I don't care how good the food is.
$39 for a steak.

1653
01:33:32.741 --> 01:33:36.340
It's ridiculous.
Well,
no,
it's not.
If the guy goes to the butcher,

1654
01:33:36.341 --> 01:33:40.570
mark himself and make sure he's only getting grass fed beef from very specific

1655
01:33:40.571 --> 01:33:42.850
organic cows and he brings to his restaurant.

1656
01:33:42.851 --> 01:33:46.360
This is the whole point of what he's serving you is like the berry best shit

1657
01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:49.390
from all over the world and you're complaining that it costs a few dollars more.

1658
01:33:49.391 --> 01:33:51.970
Like,
do you not understand what he's doing here?
How about the old,

1659
01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:56.800
the reason I gave this three stars instead of four stars is because when we came

1660
01:33:56.801 --> 01:33:59.090
into the restaurant it's just like,
yeah,
the,

1661
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:04.270
the hostess was eating her own meal and had to finish your mouthful before she

1662
01:34:05.171 --> 01:34:06.070
could speak to us.

1663
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:09.940
I got in trouble for one review because I was so pissed off that it went home

1664
01:34:09.941 --> 01:34:13.270
and did one of these like really bad reviews that you guys are talking about,

1665
01:34:13.271 --> 01:34:17.170
gave it one star,
posted the photo as being a kid with like hair missing,

1666
01:34:17.171 --> 01:34:19.320
you know,
like from his head for some reason.

1667
01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:21.790
You're like a patch of hair and I got in trouble for it.

1668
01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:24.610
Why did you get in trouble?
Uh,
just because of what I wrote.

1669
01:34:24.730 --> 01:34:27.030
Who'd you get in trouble from?
Well,
what did you write?
Uh,

1670
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.570
what do you want me to read a little bit though?
I wrote,

1671
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:35.350
well it was a $7 haircut and the guy fucked up your hair and then you put a

1672
01:34:35.351 --> 01:34:39.430
picture that wasn't really you fucked up hair and said it was you.
Yeah.

1673
01:34:39.431 --> 01:34:41.260
So you did a douchey thing?
No,
no,
no,
no.

1674
01:34:41.261 --> 01:34:43.840
She just acted like she'd never like cut hair in her life.

1675
01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:47.830
Like I was telling her things and she would like cut,
start cutting the,
the,

1676
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:50.770
it was,
she was hit by your beauty,
but uh,
anyways,

1677
01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:53.890
we should have busted a move when were sitting over.
Maybe that was what it was,

1678
01:34:53.891 --> 01:34:58.430
man.
Maybe you just put the spell on that bitch she to do with your pheromone

1679
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:02.510
<v 0>click.
I really thought that she got her like barbershop license from like,</v>

1680
01:35:02.511 --> 01:35:05.240
she thought the warranty card for the clippers was like her,
you know,

1681
01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:07.580
and that's all she needed or something.
It was that bad.

1682
01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:11.390
Like she never cut heroin and for frowns upon Newseum right there.

1683
01:35:11.391 --> 01:35:15.210
Brian frowns frowns upon O'Brien.

1684
01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:19.310
Chief is not happy.
The dance of destruction.
Not Happy.

1685
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:22.730
Isn't s Shiva supposed to be the god of cannabis?

1686
01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:27.910
<v 7>Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a city in India.
Uh,
I called Vara Nosse.</v>

1687
01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:30.220
Um,
where they cremate,

1688
01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:34.850
it's is the city on the Ganges River where they cremate all the bodies.
Um,

1689
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:39.910
and I went there and a marijuana is legal there because apparently at the end of

1690
01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:44.260
the age of Kali Yoga as Shiva is beginning to destroy the universe,

1691
01:35:44.290 --> 01:35:48.400
which is now this is called you explain that before you get into anything,

1692
01:35:48.401 --> 01:35:51.170
because a lot of people don't know what the fuck we're talking about,
but the,

1693
01:35:51.171 --> 01:35:55.360
is the Hindus believe that there are these ages?
Yeah.
It's like the,
you know,

1694
01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:58.660
it's like the cycles of time,
and I don't know the names of all the ages,

1695
01:35:58.661 --> 01:36:00.010
but the one we're in right now,

1696
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:05.200
it's basically based on the idea that it's almost based on like devos premise,

1697
01:36:05.201 --> 01:36:08.170
which is that we're d evolving and not evolving.

1698
01:36:08.171 --> 01:36:12.040
So like in its devos premise,
yeah.
Divo d evolution.

1699
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:13.990
That's what the students are like.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1700
01:36:13.991 --> 01:36:17.980
I did not know that until right now.
Yeah.
So just thought they had cool music.
No,

1701
01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:22.630
man,
they're the de evolution people.
Yeah,
it's cool.

1702
01:36:23.050 --> 01:36:27.430
But,
um,
gates of steel man.
So Kali Yoga is what we're in basically.

1703
01:36:27.431 --> 01:36:28.264
The idea is this,

1704
01:36:28.330 --> 01:36:32.950
when you have fresh fruit over time it kind of rots when you have a flower.

1705
01:36:32.951 --> 01:36:35.950
It wilts humanities the same way.
There's a cycle.

1706
01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:40.000
There's a golden age when that started.
Humans or super intelligent,

1707
01:36:40.001 --> 01:36:44.050
super tuned in with the universe and we're just wilting and rotting.
I as we,

1708
01:36:44.110 --> 01:36:46.870
as we reproduce at massive rates,

1709
01:36:46.871 --> 01:36:49.240
we're diluting the gene lines and there were,

1710
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:53.170
we're now it apparently in the middle of the age of colleague or at the very

1711
01:36:53.171 --> 01:36:56.770
beginning of the middle of the age of Kali Yoga and the symptoms at the age of

1712
01:36:56.771 --> 01:36:59.940
Kali Yoga are forgetfulness.
Um,

1713
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.980
<v 0>okay.</v>

1714
01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:05.310
<v 7>He like,
uh,
uh,
people are lazy.
Um,</v>

1715
01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:06.860
in so technology,

1716
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:12.010
what we consider to be a sign of things advancing is actually a sign of things

1717
01:37:12.141 --> 01:37:12.980
collapsing.

1718
01:37:12.981 --> 01:37:16.820
The fact that we need technology and that our focus has turned towards all the

1719
01:37:16.821 --> 01:37:19.970
different things that people think are important now only shows that we've

1720
01:37:19.971 --> 01:37:21.620
gotten really,
really stupid.

1721
01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:26.510
When in the beginning of time when there wasn't that many people,
um,

1722
01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.480
language wasn't necessary.
It's kind of like there's an anarchist,

1723
01:37:29.481 --> 01:37:32.670
what the fuck is that guy's name?
I shouldn't have said his name.
He's really,

1724
01:37:32.690 --> 01:37:36.470
he's really intense.
And he shares a similar viewpoint.
Uh,

1725
01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:39.820
someone out there has got to know this guy is an anti technologist.
Uh,

1726
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:41.990
and he believes that,
um,

1727
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:47.270
language and symbols and paintings and drawings and all of these things are

1728
01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:50.440
aberrations and that before that,

1729
01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:55.460
that the very act of translating the universe into a symbol is a lie because you

1730
01:37:56.851 --> 01:37:59.260
can't translate the universe into assemble.
And so the,

1731
01:37:59.430 --> 01:38:02.640
when people started doing cave drawings to depict the universe,

1732
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:06.510
this was the beginning of the collapse of society.

1733
01:38:06.511 --> 01:38:11.130
Because what you're interpreting reality in a way that isn't really reality,

1734
01:38:11.370 --> 01:38:13.740
you know the thing when you're in a conversation with somebody and you know,

1735
01:38:13.741 --> 01:38:17.220
you both agree,
you can't find the language to express it.
Right?

1736
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:20.340
And so you just stay in a fight,
right?
Even though you know,
underneath it all,

1737
01:38:20.341 --> 01:38:23.600
it's like it's something that's like,
you both are on the same page somehow.

1738
01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.500
Right?
So anyway,

1739
01:38:25.501 --> 01:38:29.100
the whole point is as the golden age,

1740
01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:31.020
people didn't have language.
They didn't,

1741
01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:34.260
they didn't or didn't have a written form.
They didn't need it.

1742
01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:35.910
And then as things began to collapse,

1743
01:38:35.911 --> 01:38:38.490
the written form evolved and all the variants of it.

1744
01:38:38.491 --> 01:38:42.880
And now we're in the age of Carla.
You go where everyone's completely,
you know,

1745
01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.770
forgotten everything.

1746
01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.900
<v 2>So how many times did they,</v>

1747
01:38:45.901 --> 01:38:49.320
the Hindus think that these cycles have repeated themselves over and over and

1748
01:38:49.321 --> 01:38:50.250
over.
That question.

1749
01:38:50.630 --> 01:38:51.463
<v 7>Cause the way they,</v>

1750
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:55.400
the way they explain it is they say to know how many times this cycle is

1751
01:38:55.401 --> 01:38:56.480
happening again and again,

1752
01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:01.660
which is the idea is it's the creator breathes the universe out and then sucks

1753
01:39:03.681 --> 01:39:06.200
it back in.
It's the,
it's the pattern of breath.

1754
01:39:06.201 --> 01:39:10.940
So the number of times that this has happened,
imagine the Himalayas,

1755
01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:14.170
right?
And imagine that once some people say a year,

1756
01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:19.180
some people say every hundred years I dove flies over that very top peak of the

1757
01:39:19.611 --> 01:39:22.760
Himalayas with a scarf,
a silk scarf,

1758
01:39:22.761 --> 01:39:26.240
and the silk scarf touches the very top peak.

1759
01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:29.360
Imagine the number of times,
imagine that,

1760
01:39:29.361 --> 01:39:32.120
that the Himalayas had been ground down into a valley.

1761
01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:36.260
That's how many times the universe has been born and destroyed.

1762
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:37.610
That number of times,

1763
01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.990
the amount of times it would take a s a dove carrying a scarf to erode it.

1764
01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:45.840
Of course,
this is not precise math ideas.

1765
01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:52.210
The idea is it's infinite.
It's literally possible to put a number on it.

1766
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.153
It's impossible.

1767
01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.150
<v 2>So this is,
these,
these ages have been anticipated over and over and over again.</v>

1768
01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.980
Yeah.
And so do they believe,

1769
01:39:59.010 --> 01:40:01.680
how long do they believe that human beings have been here?
I don't know.

1770
01:40:01.690 --> 01:40:05.700
They do have a number for it.
So they don't believe that human beings are,
are,

1771
01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:07.830
you know,
a few hundred thousand years old or a million years old.

1772
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:10.110
They think we're way,
way older than that.
And they think that they're,

1773
01:40:10.111 --> 01:40:14.130
and then this is the millionth version of a human universe is teeming with life.

1774
01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:18.710
Wow.
Now,
what about the Vedas?
Did you,
did you read about that?
Does,
sure.
It does.

1775
01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:19.920
Explain what that is.

1776
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.620
<v 7>So the,
the,
um,
the Vedas are the,
uh,
the,
uh,</v>

1777
01:40:24.650 --> 01:40:29.300
collected.
There's different,
the collected works of Hinduism,
which are,

1778
01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:30.010
uh,

1779
01:40:30.010 --> 01:40:33.520
<v 2>which is filled with like references to flying saucers and spaces.</v>

1780
01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:37.670
<v 7>Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,
you know,
yeah,
exactly.
It's,
it's,</v>

1781
01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:42.200
they use the term gods are Demigodz and they believe that when

1782
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:45.560
<v 2>there is,
if there was flying things to the sky,
what did they call those things?</v>

1783
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:48.770
I don't know about that.
I want to say [inaudible].
No,
I don't know.

1784
01:40:48.850 --> 01:40:51.490
<v 7>Well,
they had no,
there's like,
I can't remember the name.</v>

1785
01:40:51.491 --> 01:40:56.050
There are like flying chariots and stuff like that.
Yeah.
But I mean that's an,

1786
01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.510
that's an every,
that's an almost every religion.

1787
01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:02.620
There's like reports of flying weird flying things like,
uh,

1788
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:04.180
at the book of Ezekiel,

1789
01:41:04.181 --> 01:41:08.350
the Prophet is obviously a Ufo.

1790
01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:12.970
If it's anything,
it's someone talking about it uses a wheel within a wheel.
Yeah.

1791
01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:15.070
Yeah.
But yeah,

1792
01:41:15.071 --> 01:41:17.710
we're in the age of Kali Yoga and this is the age of disintegration and

1793
01:41:17.711 --> 01:41:21.880
everyone's dumb and everybody thinks the most important thing is like fucking

1794
01:41:21.881 --> 01:41:24.160
and reproducing.
And what happens next?

1795
01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:28.920
I suppose what happens next is the apocalypse where,

1796
01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:33.340
where you meet your,
what is supposedly in it accordingly

1797
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:38.100
<v 2>to the,
uh,
the Hindus.
What is the next state like?
We go through this,
this,
uh,</v>

1798
01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:38.980
you know,
current.

1799
01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:42.840
<v 7>So there's the depiction.
If you look up Colley who is,
uh,</v>

1800
01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:47.630
Chivas consort,
then you'll see this image of this like crazy,

1801
01:41:47.631 --> 01:41:52.430
wild haired woman.
Crazy bitch.
We're in the year of the crazy bitch.

1802
01:41:52.431 --> 01:41:55.640
Yeah.
And behind,
I'm not,
I would never call a colleague that,

1803
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:59.660
but by just out of pure superstition.
But behind Kali is,

1804
01:41:59.661 --> 01:42:01.570
this is humanity,
right?

1805
01:42:01.690 --> 01:42:05.390
So you see fire and all of humanity and there's an apocalypse happening and

1806
01:42:05.391 --> 01:42:09.740
Carly's wearing around her neck,
a garland of heads.
And those,

1807
01:42:10.650 --> 01:42:13.340
the,
those heads represent the gods.

1808
01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:18.390
So she's literally decapitated all of the gods and carries their heads around

1809
01:42:18.391 --> 01:42:20.930
this and wearing their heads.
And she's holding weapons in our hands.

1810
01:42:20.931 --> 01:42:25.490
But on one hand she's holding a flower and that flower represents the next

1811
01:42:25.491 --> 01:42:30.470
phase,
so it's like the idea is like kind of what's happening right now,

1812
01:42:30.471 --> 01:42:32.270
which is holy shit,
he's cool.

1813
01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:37.300
We've gotten so smart that now we know of course there's not a god with a beard

1814
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:43.280
and there's not a blue skinned God with forearms and there's not.

1815
01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.490
I mean there there could be super intelligent life,

1816
01:42:46.491 --> 01:42:50.420
but by now we know that the symbol systems that ancient people are using to

1817
01:42:50.421 --> 01:42:53.870
describe divinity or just that symbol systems.

1818
01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.200
We've deconstructed it now to the point where we're starting to understand that

1819
01:42:57.201 --> 01:43:01.160
these things,
the way they were described,
that's kind of like a fairy tale.

1820
01:43:01.330 --> 01:43:05.050
<v 2>Do you subscribe to the idea that most of these people that have described all</v>

1821
01:43:05.051 --> 01:43:08.500
these incredible experiences really stumbled upon psychedelics?

1822
01:43:08.710 --> 01:43:11.440
Do you think that a lot of these people were tripping and that's where all these

1823
01:43:11.441 --> 01:43:13.960
things came from?
Where do you think it's like Ufo is like what do you,

1824
01:43:13.961 --> 01:43:17.770
what do you think is the,
the basis for all these different religions,

1825
01:43:17.771 --> 01:43:19.490
especially like the Hindus and stuff,

1826
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:24.000
when you get to stuff that gets really like really like a science fiction,

1827
01:43:24.001 --> 01:43:25.010
he almost,
I,

1828
01:43:25.110 --> 01:43:28.900
<v 7>I get into the multiple histories of the universe theory and the idea that
we're,</v>

1829
01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:30.520
where we're existing right now,

1830
01:43:30.521 --> 01:43:35.521
there's an infinite number of parallel universes that are all happening around

1831
01:43:35.591 --> 01:43:40.380
us.
And I think that if this would create some kind of like if you,

1832
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:43.960
there's like an actual,
like this sounds crazy,

1833
01:43:43.961 --> 01:43:47.350
but I think if you were smart enough you could map it out with coordinates,

1834
01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:51.620
like all the different alternate realities and in these possible dose infinite

1835
01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:52.100
though,
how could

1836
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:52.680
<v 2>you map them?</v>

1837
01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:54.570
<v 7>I think you could to some certain degree.</v>

1838
01:43:54.690 --> 01:43:59.310
I think that there's certain levels of experience that have been mapped out and

1839
01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:03.630
have been encoded in the form of religion and those levels of experience.

1840
01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:07.640
Our encounters with divinity and weather.
And so when,

1841
01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:08.880
and I think Mckenna said this,
you know,

1842
01:44:08.881 --> 01:44:11.580
when you get into the whole Ufo thing and the alien thing and the higher

1843
01:44:11.581 --> 01:44:13.320
intelligence thing,
the,
the,

1844
01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:17.280
the extra terrestrial and the interdimensional being kind of become the same

1845
01:44:17.281 --> 01:44:21.720
thing.
So to me it's very easy to believe that there's life on other planets.

1846
01:44:21.721 --> 01:44:24.330
And I think that's a very high,
they're the,
the,
that's,

1847
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:26.280
it's impossible to not believe that in fact,

1848
01:44:26.281 --> 01:44:29.490
based on what people say about the expansiveness of the universe.

1849
01:44:29.670 --> 01:44:34.670
But I also think that outside of that existing around us at all times are other

1850
01:44:35.791 --> 01:44:36.930
levels of experience.

1851
01:44:36.931 --> 01:44:39.510
And we know this because we know about the spectrum of light and there's,

1852
01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.190
you hear it over and over again,

1853
01:44:41.191 --> 01:44:44.960
radio waves that if you could tune in and you could listen to rush Limbaugh

1854
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.180
right now.
But I think just in that way there's also,

1855
01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:50.170
<v 2>right,
or that you don't see in touch,
but they're there.</v>

1856
01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:52.440
<v 7>There's higher levels of experience.
Other than that.</v>

1857
01:44:52.441 --> 01:44:57.090
Now you have talked about your dime methyl tryptamine experience and other

1858
01:44:57.091 --> 01:45:00.090
people have reported this experience.
And when they talk about it,

1859
01:45:00.091 --> 01:45:03.780
there's two possibilities.
Well,
there's two basic possibilities.
One,

1860
01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:09.180
the human mind is so fucking powerful that somehow under the influence of this

1861
01:45:09.181 --> 01:45:09.960
drug,

1862
01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:14.670
it can actually construct an alternate dimension with super mathematical

1863
01:45:14.671 --> 01:45:19.671
geometries that are almost impossible to describe and so potent that it

1864
01:45:19.801 --> 01:45:24.360
apparently makes people feel like they're going to die from astonishment is

1865
01:45:24.361 --> 01:45:26.620
Terence Mckenna says,
and I believe you said the same thing.

1866
01:45:26.770 --> 01:45:30.610
<v 2>Yeah,
that's another possibility.
They literally tell you to relax,
right?</v>

1867
01:45:30.611 --> 01:45:32.620
We tell you to relax and try to take it all in.

1868
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.280
Do you think that that's your subconscious trying to tell you that you can find

1869
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:39.190
an experience here that you can take something from this and you should learn

1870
01:45:39.191 --> 01:45:40.600
how to like let it happen?

1871
01:45:40.630 --> 01:45:43.120
Or do you think that something's actually communicating with you?

1872
01:45:43.121 --> 01:45:45.610
That's where it gets like,
really who the fuck knows?
We'll see.

1873
01:45:45.611 --> 01:45:49.510
That's the funny thing about it is it's like this whole apple have said,

1874
01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:53.020
I'm sorry to interrupt you here.
People have said about that experience that the,

1875
01:45:53.050 --> 01:45:55.240
they could never have thought that up on their own.

1876
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:57.880
So they know that there's something that was communicating with them.

1877
01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:59.110
But I say that's bullshit.

1878
01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:02.650
You could know if you were under the influence of a drug,

1879
01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:06.490
like maybe your brain become super powered and your creativity becomes so

1880
01:46:06.491 --> 01:46:09.760
powerful that you manifest something that you actually believe is a real thing

1881
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:13.390
and it's only because something in your brain is getting jabbed with some new

1882
01:46:13.391 --> 01:46:17.440
chemical.
I mean the,
we ha,
I mean nobody wants that possibility to be real.

1883
01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:18.610
Everybody wants,
you know,

1884
01:46:18.611 --> 01:46:22.540
the idea that my romantic vision is that you're tuning into another dementia and

1885
01:46:22.541 --> 01:46:23.560
that you're communicating with aliens,

1886
01:46:23.561 --> 01:46:28.030
but it's also just as possible that your imagination is fucking insanely

1887
01:46:28.031 --> 01:46:31.630
powerful because you know you're supposed to be able to create all sorts of

1888
01:46:31.631 --> 01:46:34.310
things that allow people to change the world.

1889
01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:37.690
It's the iceberg theory of the human mind that we,
the very tip,

1890
01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:39.870
we only use 10% of our,
that's all bullshit though.

1891
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:43.150
That's all been proven to be just ignorant.
You can't say the only,

1892
01:46:43.151 --> 01:46:45.190
we only use a certain percentage of our brain,
but you know,

1893
01:46:45.191 --> 01:46:49.230
there are percentages of our brain that get used for different things.
You,

1894
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:53.520
you can certainly make the brain work better.
And do different things.
If you add,

1895
01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.340
you know,
electrical charges to it,
if you add chemicals to it,
you know,

1896
01:46:56.341 --> 01:46:58.460
you can get it to do weird things.
Well,
I'm more of a

1897
01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:01.490
<v 7>fiesta than you are and,
and I,
I do think that there are,</v>

1898
01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.860
I think there are higher levels of intelligence that have their own

1899
01:47:07.190 --> 01:47:08.023
consciousness.

1900
01:47:08.130 --> 01:47:11.770
<v 2>I'm open to that idea.
I'm open to it,
but I also see no evidence of it.</v>

1901
01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:15.340
So I'm open to it.
I'm,
I'm 100% open to it,
but I'm not going to commit to it.

1902
01:47:15.341 --> 01:47:17.920
I would never say that.
That is what I think is real.

1903
01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:20.410
My problem is I think when you start thinking like that,

1904
01:47:20.411 --> 01:47:21.820
when there's no evidence that gets silly,

1905
01:47:21.821 --> 01:47:24.790
it gets slippery and you start looking for shit.
It's not that.
Yes,
I agree.

1906
01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:28.330
You could be very sloppy with this kind of stuff,
but you're not sloppy.

1907
01:47:28.331 --> 01:47:31.930
I know you,
you,
you,
you,
you do come from a very real,
yeah.

1908
01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.870
<v 7>It's the logic man.
It's like,
so here's the logic.
The logic is,
okay,</v>

1909
01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:38.030
do the first question is,

1910
01:47:38.210 --> 01:47:43.210
do you believe that we are the only intelligent beings in an infinite universe?

1911
01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.060
And so there's a group of people who believe that,
and okay,

1912
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:51.390
<v 2>they're foolish right off the bat.
You,
you'd have to be foolish to believe that.</v>

1913
01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:53.820
You'd have to be foolish to know.
Why would you say that?

1914
01:47:53.821 --> 01:47:55.410
You could ever have the knowledge,

1915
01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:59.430
it's impossible at this current stage of the game.
It is an open answer.

1916
01:47:59.610 --> 01:48:01.410
You cannot answer it.
You should never say,

1917
01:48:01.411 --> 01:48:04.380
do you believe there is intelligent life in university?
I have no information.

1918
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.720
I have nothing,
but it's all just speculation.
Yeah.

1919
01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:09.020
<v 7>For me logically,</v>

1920
01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:14.060
just because the universe is apparently infinite and space,

1921
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:18.860
whatever that means,
it's a very big place.
And just because we're,
you know,

1922
01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:23.150
every day they come back with like,
we just found another,
uh,

1923
01:48:23.151 --> 01:48:25.760
we just found another,
a planet that's uh,
uh,

1924
01:48:25.770 --> 01:48:29.600
a planet around a sun and they have the idea,
the goldilocks region,

1925
01:48:29.601 --> 01:48:32.990
which they call the perfect place next to the sun where you need to be for life

1926
01:48:32.991 --> 01:48:35.900
to exist.
And based on just the few that they found,

1927
01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:39.170
that implication is that there's obviously,

1928
01:48:39.171 --> 01:48:40.360
and you know this backwards and forwards,

1929
01:48:40.370 --> 01:48:43.970
there's millions of planets surrounding signs and based on that,

1930
01:48:44.150 --> 01:48:47.840
there is an extremely high probability that there's other life out there,

1931
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:48.380
<v 2>right?
Yeah.</v>

1932
01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:52.830
But it could be other life that's so alien to us that we can't even recognize
it.

1933
01:48:52.831 --> 01:48:56.220
We don't have the senses to depict it.
It doesn't have to be carbon based.

1934
01:48:56.430 --> 01:49:00.570
They could have their good be beings made of light,
intelligent life made of air,

1935
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:02.320
you know,
made of a gas.
We don't,

1936
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:05.760
we don't put gigantic beings that are the size of our galaxy.

1937
01:49:05.761 --> 01:49:08.700
I mean we might be experiencing that right now.
I mean what I was used,

1938
01:49:08.701 --> 01:49:11.700
what are called the Fort Theory that if you didn't have a nose and someone

1939
01:49:11.701 --> 01:49:14.370
farther do,
you have no idea you're sitting there and someone's stench.

1940
01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.540
How do we not know that they are not an infinite number of senses that we don't

1941
01:49:18.541 --> 01:49:22.050
possess to detect an infinite amount of things that are around us all the time.

1942
01:49:22.051 --> 01:49:26.130
We just don't have any,
any census for,
we don't have the ability to tune into it.

1943
01:49:26.190 --> 01:49:30.510
That's possible.
It just,
the only thing that limits that is our own imagination.

1944
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:33.900
If space can be infinite,
so can possibilities.
If the,

1945
01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:37.770
if the universe literally isn't an infinite place or as close to infinite as is

1946
01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:39.870
possible,
then so are the possibilities through,

1947
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:41.880
so the possibilities of all sorts of different things,

1948
01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:44.510
<v 7>you know about the a and the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,</v>

1949
01:49:44.511 --> 01:49:47.350
the improbability drive?
No.
What does that have you read?

1950
01:49:47.351 --> 01:49:48.010
The hitchhiker's guide to

1951
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:52.420
<v 3>the galaxy?
It's a very funny good.
Yeah,
it's pretty good.
I mean,
I,
to be honest,</v>

1952
01:49:52.421 --> 01:49:56.050
I haven't read it since,
uh,
I was in high school,

1953
01:49:56.051 --> 01:49:58.240
so that's probably a little cheesy now if I read it.

1954
01:49:58.241 --> 01:50:00.790
But I still think about it from time to time.

1955
01:50:00.791 --> 01:50:05.791
And the device that drives the spaceships or one of their spaceships is called

1956
01:50:05.951 --> 01:50:07.510
an improbability drive.

1957
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:12.810
And it basically came into existence on its own because it was so improbable

1958
01:50:13.211 --> 01:50:16.330
that it would come into existence.
So it sort of manifested itself,

1959
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:21.160
which is funny because,
um,
and the idea of in the idea of time machines,

1960
01:50:21.370 --> 01:50:24.340
one of the ways that they think it might happen is it might just sort of come

1961
01:50:24.341 --> 01:50:28.270
into existence on its own if you just create the right circumstance for it

1962
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:33.130
anyway.
The,
well,
it makes sense.

1963
01:50:33.131 --> 01:50:35.440
All you have to do is you don't have to really have to Korea at a time machine.

1964
01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:38.230
You just have to create a portal for a time machine to use.
Well,
you know,

1965
01:50:38.231 --> 01:50:40.930
the MIT,
the time machine will show up from the future,
you know,

1966
01:50:40.931 --> 01:50:45.490
the MIT experiment that they did know.
So MIT had this idea,
which is like,
okay,

1967
01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:49.180
you know,
if there's time travel,
why haven't we seen time travelers yet?

1968
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:53.590
And so what they did is they,
the,
the theory was,
well,
we'll,

1969
01:50:53.610 --> 01:50:58.570
we'll create a press conference with shitloads of scientists,

1970
01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:03.550
almost like a party where a time traveler can come to this moment and

1971
01:51:03.551 --> 01:51:07.570
communicate whatever he needs to communicate to,
um,
to the world.

1972
01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:12.250
And so they threw this big thing where they had cameras and scientists and all

1973
01:51:12.251 --> 01:51:13.084
this shit.

1974
01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.400
Because the idea being that at whatever point in the future that time travels

1975
01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:20.380
invented,
they would no knows that back to this year was this to do this.

1976
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:24.130
I think it was like the 80s the Haiti,
nobody showed up shit back then.

1977
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:27.090
Nobody showed up.
No scientists showed up either now time traveler,

1978
01:51:27.110 --> 01:51:30.490
no time travel.
But yeah,
the scientists showed up.

1979
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:33.860
Well what they believe is the none.
That's just,
you know,
they is,

1980
01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:36.340
might as well be talking about fucking the x man.

1981
01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.060
You know the fuck they are using that word.

1982
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:44.470
But what scientists believe is that when the first time machine is invented,

1983
01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:49.510
that will be the moment that all other time travelers from now until eternity

1984
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:52.570
get to come back to that point in any point in between,

1985
01:51:52.571 --> 01:51:54.670
they'll be able to flow freely through time.

1986
01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:59.320
Once the door has been open and until that door is open,
there will be no time.

1987
01:51:59.321 --> 01:52:01.570
Travelers,
when we first started hanging out,

1988
01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:05.800
you gave me a marijuana lollipop.

1989
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:09.460
This is like right at the beginning of our friendship and I didn't know anything

1990
01:52:09.461 --> 01:52:11.590
about eating fat or how strong it was or whatever.

1991
01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:16.650
And I still remember this eating it and then you had just started led,

1992
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.380
let me open up for you on the road and I think it was after a show or driving

1993
01:52:20.381 --> 01:52:25.090
back and I'd eat one of these things and I'd never heard you say that idea of a

1994
01:52:25.091 --> 01:52:26.980
four.
And I remember you saying that.

1995
01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:30.880
And right at that moment that pot started kicking in and I was like,

1996
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:35.710
oh Jesus Christ.
I think it was so intense,
man.

1997
01:52:35.711 --> 01:52:37.930
I thought I saw alien heads floating in.

1998
01:52:37.931 --> 01:52:41.710
The Sky was just so freaked out cause ideas so crazy.

1999
01:52:41.711 --> 01:52:45.980
But what's really crazy is look just like the atomic bomb,
the time machine

2000
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.790
<v 2>is not just possible.
It's inevitable.
Yeah.
If they're going to keep searching,</v>

2001
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:54.380
if technology keeps increasing at the exponential rate that it always has been

2002
01:52:54.381 --> 01:52:57.350
increasing yet with its complexity with innovation,

2003
01:52:57.530 --> 01:53:00.920
they're going to get more and more information about matter and the universe and

2004
01:53:00.921 --> 01:53:02.900
time and they're going to get more and more power,

2005
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:06.290
more and more ability to process things.
I mean they just figured out a new,

2006
01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:11.180
some sort of a,
a new chip that operates on light,
some quantum leap in,
in,
in,

2007
01:53:11.181 --> 01:53:12.440
in chip technology.

2008
01:53:12.441 --> 01:53:15.500
And that computers are going to be like infinitely more powerful soon than they

2009
01:53:15.501 --> 01:53:16.120
are now.
Right?

2010
01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:16.950
<v 7>Think time machines,</v>

2011
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:19.440
the first time machine is actually going to be invented in your head.

2012
01:53:19.441 --> 01:53:23.040
Meaning they're going to program your head to go back then into 1940s and you

2013
01:53:23.041 --> 01:53:25.090
know,
before they actually will go back.
And David,

2014
01:53:25.110 --> 01:53:28.850
but I think if you can think of it,
it's possible,
right?
That's a cool,
you know,

2015
01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:33.750
it's going to open up your mind.
It's going to open up your telescope for time.

2016
01:53:33.810 --> 01:53:38.730
Right.
You can peer back and watch it.
Maybe you're,
you feel like you're in it.

2017
01:53:38.731 --> 01:53:40.680
You're feel like you're back in 1940 you know,

2018
01:53:40.681 --> 01:53:42.990
but your brain's just making you think you're in 19 yeah,

2019
01:53:43.110 --> 01:53:45.820
<v 2>I,
I've been talking about Tom Machines a lot on stage lately,
man.</v>

2020
01:53:45.821 --> 01:53:49.090
I've been doing a lot of time machine material.
You know,
I just think the idea,

2021
01:53:49.110 --> 01:53:52.390
the concept is so fascinating and the grandfather paradox is so fancy.

2022
01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:55.710
Fascinating that it's such a stupid reason for people to believe that a time

2023
01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:57.250
machine can never exist.
Right.

2024
01:53:57.251 --> 01:54:00.910
It is a true story that I tell on stage that actually really did happen where a

2025
01:54:00.911 --> 01:54:03.760
guy came up to me and said that your your time machine joke is funny,

2026
01:54:03.761 --> 01:54:05.230
but time machines are possible.

2027
01:54:05.530 --> 01:54:08.440
The guy like wanting to argue the time machines can never be impossible because

2028
01:54:08.441 --> 01:54:10.870
of the grandfathers.
Oh Great.
You know the grandfather paradox,

2029
01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:13.540
the paradox is if a time machine was real,

2030
01:54:13.690 --> 01:54:16.930
you could go back in time and kill your grandfather before your father was ever

2031
01:54:16.931 --> 01:54:20.140
born.
Thus he can never been born to make a time machine.
Right.

2032
01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:23.680
Just like the most ridiculous logic ever.
Like just because first of all,

2033
01:54:23.681 --> 01:54:27.760
just because you could go back in time and kill your grandfather and you would

2034
01:54:27.761 --> 01:54:31.600
cease to exist.
Just because you could do that doesn't mean you wouldn't do that.

2035
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:34.150
It means you could and maybe people would and yeah,

2036
01:54:34.151 --> 01:54:37.240
they would cease to exist and yeah,
it would break time.
I mean,
yeah,

2037
01:54:37.241 --> 01:54:40.750
it's possible that people could really go back in time.
They could break time.

2038
01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:43.030
You know about John t door?
No,
that's nonsense.

2039
01:54:43.150 --> 01:54:46.630
<v 7>Well,
no,
he,
it is nonsense of course.
But his,</v>

2040
01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:51.100
the way that he dealt with that paradox,
which I think is really smart,

2041
01:54:51.130 --> 01:54:55.360
is that when you're traveling back in time and not really traveling back in
time,

2042
01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:59.610
you're traveling into an alternate,
like multiple universe,

2043
01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:02.740
her similar to ours and the further back you go,

2044
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:06.940
which is a really smart thing that he added to the hoax because it's like,

2045
01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:12.240
it made it so that his predictions could be off a lot because we're not in this

2046
01:55:12.281 --> 01:55:13.810
dimension because they're not in this dimension.

2047
01:55:13.811 --> 01:55:15.400
But like the further back you go,

2048
01:55:15.401 --> 01:55:18.680
the more the timelines kind of starts splitting apart and diverging.

2049
01:55:18.730 --> 01:55:23.260
So events aren't,
don't line up exactly the same way.
So it's a great,

2050
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:24.660
it's the idea of infinite

2051
01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:28.860
<v 2>universes,
saddens people.
You know what,
it just,
when something looks that big,</v>

2052
01:55:28.861 --> 01:55:29.910
it makes people depressed.

2053
01:55:30.230 --> 01:55:34.560
Now when you tell people like maybe there are infinite lives that we are all

2054
01:55:34.561 --> 01:55:36.630
living,
you know,
all consecutively,

2055
01:55:36.631 --> 01:55:38.790
all right next to each other and they're all completely different.

2056
01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:43.770
The idea that I was like,
oh,
it's like I am just barely getting the pack.

2057
01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:48.690
The fact that um,
you know,
living here in America on earth in 2010,

2058
01:55:48.691 --> 01:55:51.150
I'm barely,
barely wrapping my head around that.

2059
01:55:51.330 --> 01:55:54.270
The idea that there's billions and billions and then that we're going to Redo

2060
01:55:54.271 --> 01:55:57.270
this every 15 billion years because it's going to be a new,

2061
01:55:57.271 --> 01:56:02.271
big bang and people are going to eventually evolve out of Amoebas and fish and

2062
01:56:02.521 --> 01:56:07.440
fucking lizards and rabbits and monkeys and humans.
Really.

2063
01:56:07.441 --> 01:56:09.930
It just keeps going over and over and over and over and over and over again.

2064
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:12.720
<v 7>Can I tell you my new theory of reincarnation?
Yes.</v>

2065
01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:16.350
And it's really intense because I thought of this and it freaked me out.

2066
01:56:16.450 --> 01:56:21.420
It's pretty horrible.
So it's like that common idea of reincarnation,

2067
01:56:21.421 --> 01:56:25.350
if you subscribed to the theory is that you die and you're born again.

2068
01:56:25.351 --> 01:56:28.590
You go through your childhood,
did you grow up and then you die.

2069
01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:32.220
Maybe you get born as a cat,
maybe a butterfly,
right?
Maybe an Amoeba.

2070
01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:33.600
This is what I was thinking.

2071
01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.690
Cause I had a dream months and in this dream I was a kid,

2072
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:44.850
a little girl,
and my mom was rubbing my head and I knew I was dying,

2073
01:56:45.150 --> 01:56:49.350
but I didn't know what that meant except I knew it was bad and I could kind of

2074
01:56:49.351 --> 01:56:50.730
feel myself fading out.

2075
01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:54.360
There was this like white sort of thing happening and then I woke up out of the

2076
01:56:54.361 --> 01:56:59.130
dream like,
fuck,
what is shitty dream?
So I was thinking like,
Oh fuck,

2077
01:56:59.370 --> 01:57:02.370
what if that's what reincarnation is?
What if when you die,

2078
01:57:02.670 --> 01:57:06.860
you know when you're driving home one night you've had too many pot while he

2079
01:57:06.861 --> 01:57:08.910
pops,
you're listening to coast to coast.

2080
01:57:08.911 --> 01:57:11.700
Someone says something shocking that makes you look away from the road.

2081
01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:15.180
You swerve off,
you slam into a tree,
you wake up,

2082
01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:18.390
you're here back in your house like,
Oh fuck,
what is shitty dream?

2083
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:19.890
But you've really died.

2084
01:57:19.891 --> 01:57:23.730
You just reincarnated again into an ultimate reality in an alternate reality.

2085
01:57:23.731 --> 01:57:27.030
So you literally can't die.
There's no break.

2086
01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:31.620
This just goes on forever and ever and ever and ever.
No break,

2087
01:57:31.770 --> 01:57:33.780
no stopping,
no new age.

2088
01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:37.150
Going into the light and seeing your parents and your family and taking a,

2089
01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:42.300
going to some new age cosmic spa where you get to shake off all your shitty

2090
01:57:42.301 --> 01:57:45.900
Karma.
It never stops.
It just keeps happening again.
Again,

2091
01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:49.350
maybe like right now there's an earthquake and the ceiling collapses and all of

2092
01:57:49.351 --> 01:57:52.850
a sudden you're just some daydreaming cabby and Boston like,
wow,

2093
01:57:52.851 --> 01:57:56.880
that was fucking weird.
I was just imagining I was a comedian in la,

2094
01:57:56.881 --> 01:57:57.960
but you know what I mean?

2095
01:57:58.030 --> 01:58:01.990
<v 2>Well,
that's bizarre.
You're going to change lives.
Snap into another role.
Life.</v>

2096
01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:04.540
You become the guy rides this body out.
Yeah.

2097
01:58:04.541 --> 01:58:07.160
You snap into an alternate life with all your memories.
Right.

2098
01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:10.470
<v 7>Embedded everything already embedded in there because it's an infinite,</v>

2099
01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.500
it's an infinite.
This,
the the,
it goes on forever.

2100
01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:16.640
<v 2>What if your consciousness is living a bunch of different lives simultaneously</v>

2101
01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:19.030
and you just can't,
you can't see them.
It's like a,

2102
01:58:19.031 --> 01:58:22.010
an office filled with cubicles and no one's poking their head over the top of

2103
01:58:22.011 --> 01:58:24.380
the cubicle.
Yeah,
right.
We're all rolling at the same time.

2104
01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:27.870
<v 7>Or like the way I thought about it is like if you're,
if there was like some,</v>

2105
01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:31.530
this,
it sounds really crazy,
but imagine that each of your fingers,

2106
01:58:31.531 --> 01:58:32.364
it sounds insane,

2107
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:35.880
but imagine like each of your fingers had their own personality and their own

2108
01:58:35.881 --> 01:58:38.580
like consciousness or something.
It's like,

2109
01:58:38.610 --> 01:58:42.010
and you could stick them through some kind of hole where they

2110
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.890
<v 2>would forget they were attached to your hand and they would just think that they</v>

2111
01:58:44.891 --> 01:58:47.230
were their own individual selves.
You know what I mean?

2112
01:58:47.231 --> 01:58:48.940
Like maybe that's what we are.

2113
01:58:48.941 --> 01:58:52.990
We're just like little fingers protruding into this dimension from some infinite

2114
01:58:52.991 --> 01:58:56.920
thing,
but the product of protruding into this dimension as we get instantaneous

2115
01:58:56.921 --> 01:59:01.390
amnesia and part of like dealing with a shock of coming into this dimension is

2116
01:59:01.391 --> 01:59:05.650
we forget our true identity and replace it with our ego structures.
Wow.
Well,

2117
01:59:05.651 --> 01:59:10.550
one of the things that,
uh,
okay,
yes.
On one of the things that,
uh,
you did,
uh,

2118
01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:14.350
quite a bunch when you were my roommate Duncan live with me a few years back for

2119
01:59:14.590 --> 01:59:17.770
a few months,
happy,
happy.
It wasn't a few months.
It was like three weeks,

2120
01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:21.530
two or three weeks.
It was that you are so,
it was so awesome.
Anyway,
Dunkin,

2121
01:59:21.850 --> 01:59:24.310
one of my best friends,
great guy and um,

2122
01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:26.830
came over and was getting the tank all the time.

2123
01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:29.160
So for me it was fascinating because I,

2124
01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:32.890
I've offered the tank to so many of my friends.
I've offered to so many people,

2125
01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:35.950
but there's something about it that weirds people the fuck out.
You know,

2126
01:59:35.951 --> 01:59:37.900
very few of them.
Tate,
when Tate lived here,

2127
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:40.230
he barely got in that thing and I was like,
yeah,

2128
01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:43.960
will you not in that thing every day we have the opportunity to literally,

2129
01:59:43.961 --> 01:59:46.330
that is a gateway to the center of the universe.

2130
01:59:46.331 --> 01:59:49.870
That's a fucking spaceship right there.
That's a spaceship to innerspace.
Yeah,

2131
01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:52.350
you're climbing that thing.
You're going to get rocket into,
into interspace.

2132
01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:54.370
It's right there.
It's in the basement.
You're going to use that shit.

2133
01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:57.310
But for whatever reason,
most most dudes are scared of it.

2134
01:59:57.311 --> 01:59:59.770
You jumped in that thing,
man.
You were in that thing a lot.

2135
02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:03.070
Well because at for a very long time I've wanted to go on those.

2136
02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:05.080
One of those things cause I was,
you know,

2137
02:00:05.081 --> 02:00:08.250
I knew about John Lilly and also of course the altered states.

2138
02:00:08.251 --> 02:00:11.190
The movie where the Guy Turns into a monkey.
Yeah.
Always wanting to want to go.

2139
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:14.180
I want to go on that one now.
Yeah.
That fucking thing.

2140
02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:19.190
<v 7>If you haven't seen his tank,
it's evolved.
When I was,</v>

2141
02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:22.850
when I was here,
you subpoenas old tank,
didn't you?
When you used to go in it,

2142
02:00:22.851 --> 02:00:26.750
you said you did.
I didn't pee in a urinal ass so I never,
I've net branch,

2143
02:00:27.170 --> 02:00:30.350
but the old tank was like,
it was cool looking.

2144
02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:35.860
But this fucking thing looks like a holodeck down there at some steel giant

2145
02:00:35.931 --> 02:00:37.420
weird things like a frigerator.

2146
02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:41.610
<v 2>Yeah,
it's the,
that's the,
that's the mothership man.
That thing puts you into,</v>

2147
02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:45.540
right.
Shoot you in an interspace.
I mean really,
it's really what it is.

2148
02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:47.810
I mean split.
What is space,
you know,
spaces.

2149
02:00:47.850 --> 02:00:50.190
You're supposed to be flying out into the infinite.
Yeah.
Well,

2150
02:00:50.191 --> 02:00:53.190
there's no space like the fucking space in your head because that truly is

2151
02:00:53.191 --> 02:00:53.821
infinite,
right?

2152
02:00:53.821 --> 02:00:56.490
You'd have to worry about running into asteroids or there's nothing out there.

2153
02:00:56.700 --> 02:01:01.650
I mean,
it's just free open energy and know your body is not connected.

2154
02:01:01.651 --> 02:01:02.460
It's just the line.

2155
02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:03.690
<v 7>Well,
when I was staying with you,</v>

2156
02:01:03.691 --> 02:01:07.020
it was because I had been living with a girl and the whole thing collapsed.

2157
02:01:07.021 --> 02:01:11.070
I don't want to talk about that.
But it was really cool to go into the well.

2158
02:01:11.071 --> 02:01:14.130
So when I,
when I moved into Virgo with Joe,

2159
02:01:14.610 --> 02:01:18.990
he was very kind and he's like,
you have unlimited access to my weed,

2160
02:01:19.050 --> 02:01:22.290
my flotation tank,
which was a super,
I mean,

2161
02:01:22.291 --> 02:01:24.930
if you've ever been out just getting out of a shitty relationship,

2162
02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:27.570
that is like an incredible gift to give someone.

2163
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:32.750
But the combination of the weed and the flotation tank and just,
uh,

2164
02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:35.190
just everything collapsing around you when you go into,

2165
02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:40.100
when I went into the tank the first time,
you know,
there's like a,
where nothing's

2166
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.860
<v 2>really happening.
You got to learn to relax.</v>

2167
02:01:42.570 --> 02:01:43.500
<v 7>But all of a sudden,</v>

2168
02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:48.860
the big experience I had was all these like memories of their relationship

2169
02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:54.650
started appearing in front of me.
Like,
and this sounds so seminar.
Like when you,

2170
02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:59.580
you know,
when you do a,
um,
multi chat on apple,
you know what I mean?

2171
02:01:59.581 --> 02:02:03.120
I swear to God,
it was like,
oh,
that's when we were at the beach and oh,

2172
02:02:03.121 --> 02:02:03.881
that's when we first met.

2173
02:02:03.881 --> 02:02:08.160
And then just there and it's all playing out in this like compete with such

2174
02:02:08.161 --> 02:02:11.700
great detail that uh,
I,

2175
02:02:11.730 --> 02:02:14.130
my normal memories never works like that,
but it was,

2176
02:02:14.131 --> 02:02:18.690
you could just see these things happening that you never noticed before and you

2177
02:02:18.691 --> 02:02:22.620
would just come out of the tank after having these vivid memories completely

2178
02:02:22.621 --> 02:02:27.210
depressed.
Like,
thanks tank.

2179
02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:32.040
Thanks for walking me through my miserable relationship.
But you know,

2180
02:02:32.041 --> 02:02:34.100
if I have more time machine,
I'm sure it's better.

2181
02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:36.850
<v 2>Well,
you know,
what it is,
is those are the things that are bothering you.</v>

2182
02:02:36.851 --> 02:02:39.340
Those are the memories that you're suppressing those.
That's the pain.

2183
02:02:39.341 --> 02:02:42.070
The fact that you were deeply in love when you were in this beautiful place and

2184
02:02:42.071 --> 02:02:43.660
now you're,
you're without it.
Yeah.

2185
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:47.170
Now it's been taken away from you like a limb limb that you miss like a part of

2186
02:02:47.171 --> 02:02:48.730
your,
one of your organs or something,

2187
02:02:48.970 --> 02:02:52.660
a part of your soul and the tank wants you to be aware of that and the tank once

2188
02:02:52.930 --> 02:02:54.930
all the things that fuck with you.
Like I don't,

2189
02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:58.900
I can't have any secrets in my head and go in the tank.
There's no secrets there.

2190
02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:03.120
Anything.
You don't want to talk about tax like,
Hey,
what's that right there?
Yeah,

2191
02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:04.510
let's go.
Let's get this out in the front.
Yeah,

2192
02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:07.340
let's pull this out in the front and get a spotlight on it.
You know,

2193
02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:11.800
it's like anything that's fucking with your head.
It's the key to not,

2194
02:03:11.801 --> 02:03:13.960
I don't want to say enlightenment,
but the key to peace,

2195
02:03:14.170 --> 02:03:17.650
the key to peace with the human mind is dealing with all your issues.

2196
02:03:17.710 --> 02:03:20.780
Anything that's bothering you,
anything that's you're not doing right,
anything.

2197
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:25.600
The tank exposes,
all that Shit.
Very psychedelic in that respect.

2198
02:03:25.601 --> 02:03:27.310
Whereas it's very introspective,

2199
02:03:27.311 --> 02:03:31.990
like deep and sort of somewhat kind of abrasive and disturbing,
you know?
Yeah.

2200
02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:34.690
Forces,
it forces you to look at yourself.
Well,
it always is.

2201
02:03:34.691 --> 02:03:36.570
I mean that's the thing I'd always,
anything you're,

2202
02:03:36.610 --> 02:03:40.750
you're trying to ignore as always.
It's always disturbing.
It's like puking,
right?

2203
02:03:40.751 --> 02:03:43.740
But it's psychedelic experience.
Drags that stuff out always.

2204
02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:45.990
And that's why people are always like,
no,
I would

2205
02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:50.110
<v 7>never,
I don't like smoking pot because it makes me nervous.
It makes me anxious.</v>

2206
02:03:50.111 --> 02:03:53.320
And it's like,
well,
yeah,
yeah.
Really.
It's not making you anxious.

2207
02:03:53.321 --> 02:03:57.730
It's like the fact that you're deeply in debt and,

2208
02:03:57.731 --> 02:04:01.930
or you're a whatever the millions of things you're trying to pretend aren't

2209
02:04:01.931 --> 02:04:04.570
happening in your,
what are your,
an alcoholic,
whatever,

2210
02:04:04.571 --> 02:04:07.630
all the things you're trying to deny that right under the surface.
And when you

2211
02:04:08.290 --> 02:04:12.470
<v 2>that comes,
comes up and you have to deal with it.
You can't have any soccer,</v>

2212
02:04:12.570 --> 02:04:15.420
you can't hide your secrets from weed.
Weed's too smart

2213
02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:21.000
and the end ladies Joe,
right?
I think that's a,

2214
02:04:21.001 --> 02:04:21.990
the end of the podcast.

2215
02:04:21.991 --> 02:04:26.880
It is now six 48 so it was probably like two and a half hours.
Right.
Awesome.

2216
02:04:26.881 --> 02:04:30.810
Long Ass fucking time.
Thank you very much to the fleshlight our sponsor,

2217
02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:33.110
as always,
we hung out with those guys in Austin.

2218
02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:36.060
You gotta check out Dunkin side podcasts by the way.
It's fucking hilarious.

2219
02:04:36.090 --> 02:04:40.410
Oh yeah.

2220
02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:42.630
Yeah,

The lavender hour.

2221
02:04:42.810 --> 02:04:47.340
It changed me and Natasha was here and um,

2222
02:04:47.341 --> 02:04:48.630

2223
02:04:48.631 --> 02:04:51.530
Do you have a calendar up on your website or on your Twitter is no calendar App.

2224
02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:55.470
I go up at the comedy store pretty regularly so people listen because a lot of

2225
02:04:55.471 --> 02:04:57.330
people don't know.
By the way,
the iTunes folks,

2226

2227
02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:04.260

If you wanted a watch,
you can watch something.

2228
02:05:04.261 --> 02:05:05.310
I don't know if you're just bored,

2229
02:05:05.311 --> 02:05:08.760
you want to watch something you can do a lot of,
are you,
I know.

2230
02:05:08.761 --> 02:05:11.730

2231
02:05:11.731 --> 02:05:13.710
like that,
but if you ever want to watch it,

2232
02:05:13.711 --> 02:05:16.530
they're all available on Ustream and if you are watching on Ustream,

It will be on my output.

2239
02:05:37.111 --> 02:05:40.120
A dates thing on my website should have that.
I'm stupid and not do that.
