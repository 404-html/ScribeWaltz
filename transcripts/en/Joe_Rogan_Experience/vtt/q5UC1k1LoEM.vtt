00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's a great,</v>

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.690
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea of infinite universes,</v>

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.770
<v Speaker 1>saddened to people.</v>

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.431
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

6
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:08.761
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

7
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>when something looks that big,</v>

8
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>it makes people depressed.</v>

9
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Now when you tell people like maybe there are infinite lives that we are all</v>

10
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

11
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>all consecutively,</v>

13
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>all right next to each other and they're all completely different.</v>

14
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>The idea that I was like,</v>

15
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.523
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

16
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like I am just barely getting through the pack.</v>

17
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.731
<v Speaker 1>The fact that,</v>

18
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>living here in America on earth in 2010,</v>

21
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:30.864
<v Speaker 1>I'm barely,</v>

22
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>barely wrapping my head around that.</v>

23
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's billions and billions and then that we're going to Redo</v>

24
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>this every 15 billion years because it's going to be a new big bang and people</v>

25
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:45.021
<v Speaker 1>are going to eventually evolve out of Amoebas and fish and fucking lizards and</v>

26
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>rabbits and monkeys and humans.</v>

27
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

28
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>It just keeps going over and over and over and over and over and over again.</v>

29
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you my new theory of reincarnation?</v>

30
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

31
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's really intense because I thought at this and it freaked me out.</v>

32
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty horrible.</v>

33
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the common idea of reincarnation.</v>

34
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>If you subscribe to the theory is that you die and you're born again.</v>

35
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>You go through your childhood,</v>

36
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>did you grow up and then you die.</v>

37
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get born as a cat,</v>

38
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>maybe a butterfly,</v>

39
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.643
<v Speaker 1>Maybe an Amoeba.</v>

41
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>This is what I was thinking.</v>

42
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Cause I had a dream months and in this dream I was a kid,</v>

43
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>a little girl,</v>

44
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and my mom was rubbing my head and I knew I was dying,</v>

45
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know what that meant except I knew it was bad and I could kind of</v>

46
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>feel myself fading out there is this like white sort of thing happening?</v>

47
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>And then I woke up out of the dream like,</v>

48
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:36.571
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

49
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>what is shitty dream?</v>

50
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking like,</v>

51
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.613
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

52
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>what if that's what reincarnation is?</v>

53
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>What if when you die,</v>

54
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're driving home one night you've had too many pot lollipops.</v>

55
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>You're listening to coast to coast.</v>

56
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Someone says something shocking that makes you look away from the road.</v>

57
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>You swerve off,</v>

58
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you slam into a tree,</v>

59
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.543
<v Speaker 1>you wake up,</v>

60
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>you're here back in your house.</v>

61
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:58.261
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

62
00:01:58.261 --> 00:01:58.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

63
00:01:58.831 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>what is shitty dream,</v>

64
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>but you've really died.</v>

65
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>You just reincarnated again into an ultimate reality in an alternate reality,</v>

66
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>so you literally can't die.</v>

67
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>There's no break.</v>

68
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>This just goes on forever and ever and ever and ever.</v>

69
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>No break,</v>

70
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>no stopping,</v>

71
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>no new age.</v>

72
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Going into the light and seeing your parents and your family and taking a,</v>

73
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>going to some new age,</v>

74
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>a cosmic spa where you get to shake off all your shitty Karma.</v>

75
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>It never stops.</v>

76
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>It just keeps happening again.</v>

77
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

78
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe like right now there's an earthquake and the ceiling collapses and all of</v>

79
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>a sudden you're just some daydreaming cabby and Boston like,</v>

80
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:34.201
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

81
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 1>that was fucking weird.</v>

82
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I was just imagining I was a comedian in la,</v>

83
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean?</v>

84
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:40.271
<v Speaker 1>that's bizarre.</v>

86
00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:41.440
<v Speaker 1>You're going to change lives.</v>

87
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Snap into another role to become the guy rides this body out.</v>

88
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:48.340
<v Speaker 1>You snap it into an alternate life with all your memories.</v>

90
00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Embedded everything already embedded in there because it's an infinite,</v>

92
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.663
<v Speaker 1>it's an infinite.</v>

93
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.001
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

94
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:53.834
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

95
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>it goes on forever.</v>

96
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>What if your consciousness is living a bunch of different lives simultaneously</v>

97
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>and you just can't,</v>

98
00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>you can't see them.</v>

99
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.371
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

100
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>an office filled with cubicles and no one's poking their head over the top of</v>

101
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:03.761
<v Speaker 1>the cubicle.</v>

102
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:04.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

103
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:04.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

104
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>We're all rolling at the same time.</v>

105
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Or like the way I thought about it is like if you're,</v>

106
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:09.180
<v Speaker 1>if there was like some,</v>

107
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.411
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

108
00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>it sounds really crazy,</v>

109
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>but imagine that each of your fingers,</v>

110
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:13.684
<v Speaker 1>it sounds insane,</v>

111
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>but imagine like each of your fingers had their own personality and their own</v>

112
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>like consciousness or something.</v>

113
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

114
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 1>and you could stick them through some kind of hole where they would forget they</v>

115
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>were attached to your hand and they would just think that they were their own</v>

116
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>individual selves.</v>

117
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.571
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

118
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe that's what we are.</v>

119
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>We're just like little fingers protruding into this dimension from some infinite</v>

120
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

121
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>but the product of protruding into this dimension as we get instantaneous</v>

122
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>amnesia and part of like dealing with a shock of coming into this dimension is</v>

123
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>we forget our true identity and replace it with our ego structures.</v>

124
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.643
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

125
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.991
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

126
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that,</v>

127
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.353
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

128
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
