<v Speaker 2>and Roseanne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 2>We made it happen finally years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years in the making.</v>

5
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Here I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

6
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things that we talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it like 30 times.</v>

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well thank you so much for having me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

11
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.830

<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

12
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 2>I have my first drink so much to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've been drinking for years</v>

13
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 2>illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

14
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't admit that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of you.</v>

15
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.260
<v Speaker 2>For Real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have to tell you.</v>

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Are you one of those people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

17
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

18
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 2>It's obscene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obscene how old I've become.</v>

19
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 2>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty one.</v>

20
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I'm seen.</v>

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

22
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's obscene.</v>

23
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost 50 happy.</v>

24
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Almost birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be 50 in a couple months.</v>

25
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 2>In a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

26
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexy as fuck for great.</v>

27
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Feel like you're making almost 50 look</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

28
00:00:58.111 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I also feel like there's a hair stuck to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my lip,</v>

29
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 2>so for anyone watching and if there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fuzzball on my face,</v>

30
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a 41 year old thing.</v>

31
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we have a r a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>h,</v>

32
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 2>d is not that strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really should've just left it there.</v>

33
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Then whatever it is that the length that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've collected since arriving deep in</v>

34
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:16.044
<v Speaker 2>the valley.</v>

35
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 1>One thing I do realize though as I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>older is like maintaining health is like</v>

36
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>an effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a lot more aware of</v>

37
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>making sure you eat the right stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making sure you,</v>

38
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you exercise on a regular</v>

39
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:32.930
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get attache because you'd get out</v>

40
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 1>of shape.</v>

41
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 2>It's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way harder to get back in right</v>

42
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you are such a healthy guy.</v>

43
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever go through a phase when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were younger of being unhealthy?</v>

44
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

45
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I never went through like a binge</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking or fat phase.</v>

46
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten overweight slightly before,</v>

47
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but even then I'd look at myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

48
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slob like,</v>

49
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>get it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

50
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:58.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

51
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

52
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>there's two schools of thought on it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one school of thought is that if you</v>

53
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>spend too much time on your body that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're vain and this is a frivolous</v>

54
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>pursuit because you're going to die</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway and it's all pointless,</v>

55
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like that's kind of a cop out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that the only have this</v>

56
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>one meet vehicle to get you through this</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and if it was a car,</v>

57
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>you'd maintain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a nice car,</v>

58
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take care of the oil,</v>

59
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

60
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get it serviced,</v>

61
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>you deal with all the stuff that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it run nice and I think that you've got</v>

62
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>to do that with your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least for me,</v>

63
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I have to do that with my body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't,</v>

64
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like I'm slacking off in a</v>

65
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>way that's lazy and irresponsible and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

66
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I just died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just see too many people with health</v>

67
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>consequences because they don't take</v>
<v Speaker 1>care of their bodies.</v>

68
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're saying it's self</v>

69
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 2>absorbed and it's a vein and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>shallow to care about your body and if</v>

70
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 2>you're saying that as an excuse to</v>

71
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.340
<v Speaker 3>allow yourself to not get into shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I think that you're not really</v>

72
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 3>facing what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like that thing where you're like,</v>

73
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:09.971
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just shallow.</v>

74
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

75
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 3>you're not really addressing what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual resistance is.</v>

76
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for me,</v>

77
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got into a phase where I was going to</v>

78
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:23.851
<v Speaker 3>a personal trainer and I got really into</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and for the first time all this stuff</v>

79
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 3>that I'd heard my whole life about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>sport,</v>

80
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 3>because I'm not a sports person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So about how sports can affect the rest</v>

81
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 3>of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never understood that.</v>

82
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I never understood the mental part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

83
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for that time,</v>

84
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not really in that place</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

85
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 3>but for the time that I was super into</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

86
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 3>I felt better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely did.</v>

87
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like I can put in effort in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gym and it's the effects.</v>

88
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Not In terms of what you see on my body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how I feel are immediate and uh,</v>

89
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 3>and also that thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a challenge for me,</v>

90
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to dig deep and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it and I like set these little</v>

91
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 3>goals for myself every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost every day that I could overcome.</v>

92
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.110
<v Speaker 3>And that was kind of insane that</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling,</v>

93
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 3>how good I felt when I did something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I didn't think I could do.</v>

94
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.960
<v Speaker 3>And it was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

95
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.023
<v Speaker 3>multiple times a week.</v>

96
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>

97
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not overlooked with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

98
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.920
<v Speaker 1>but with some people that is overlooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's unfortunate because</v>

99
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it's thought of as like a vain pursuit</v>
<v Speaker 1>or pursuit of vanity.</v>

100
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

101
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>it really restructures the way your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain functions when you,</v>

102
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>when you regularly exercise and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body pumps out all those endorphins and</v>

103
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:39.150
<v Speaker 1>you release all that stress and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body sweats.</v>

104
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just feels like it's flowing better.</v>

105
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Like everything's go like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your decisions are better.</v>

106
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:48.480
<v Speaker 1>The way you feel about things is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You leave the gym,</v>

107
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you have a smile on your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like driving your car,</v>

108
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>the sun feels better,</v>

109
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.021
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

110
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 3>and that thing where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did something healthy for me today.</v>

111
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Can I ask a question about something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you said earlier that actually kind</v>

112
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 3>of ties into all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said that when the times of your</v>

113
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 3>life where you would get a tiny bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>overweight,</v>

114
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 3>you'd look in the mirror and you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

115
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you forget exactly what you said,</v>

116
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:09.191
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

117
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 3>ew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting fat Slob or something.</v>

118
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking a lot lately about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ways that we talk to ourselves</v>

119
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 3>because I can be so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so brutal on myself.</v>

120
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 3>And I've really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I've gotten older and I think we've</v>

121
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 3>made it clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very old.</v>

122
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.773
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

123
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to go more gentle on myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like I don't speak to</v>

124
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 3>anyone the way I speak to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do.</v>

125
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the question.</v>

126
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's good that comes out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being really shitty to yourself?</v>

127
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>The good is the reaction to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you don't like that feeling and</v>

128
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>then you do something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think if you just look at</v>

129
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:49.170
<v Speaker 1>yourself and look in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go also</v>

130
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.260
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

131
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>tuck your gut into your shirt and Tuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shirt into your pants and you just</v>

132
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>go about your day and then have a heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

133
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're going to get the</v>

134
00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.970
<v Speaker 1>results that you really want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you.</v>

135
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>If you want your body to work well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be honest and if you have</v>

136
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>slacked off and you have gained weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you have eaten a bunch of shitty food</v>

137
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:13.721
<v Speaker 1>and you feel like really just slow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sludgy and you know that feeling that</v>

138
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you get if you just indulge too much or</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink too much that oh that just that</v>

139
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>the drinking too much of a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like last time we did that podcast here</v>

140
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>with Stan hope I fucking tried to brush</v>
<v Speaker 1>my teeth with deodorant,</v>

141
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>deodorant out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had my toothbrush.</v>

142
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

143
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Like my brain was so scrambled from just</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting hammered.</v>

144
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just a bad feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun while you're doing it.</v>

145
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's an expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

146
00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Who Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oscar Wilde,</v>

147
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things in moderation.</v>

148
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Including moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

149
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you got to enjoy your life,</v>

150
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling after indulging is where</v>

151
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>your body is just wrecked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible feeling.</v>

152
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 1>And I think the only way to for me at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least to move past that as we go.</v>

153
00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck face no more of that stupid shit.</v>

154
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>And then get on</v>

155
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.430
<v Speaker 2>the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would find back when I used to indulge</v>

156
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:12.191
<v Speaker 2>in everything more the feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 2>indulging in the feeling of I'm doing</v>

157
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 2>something that I don't think I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay with the fact that I'm doing it</v>

158
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 2>made me feel a strange from myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like I want to keep the</v>

159
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.290
<v Speaker 2>party going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were so many nights because I</v>

160
00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

161
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

162
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't indulge in much anymore because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate,</v>

163
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 2>was kind of getting out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is many years ago that I'm</v>

164
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 2>talking about because I've been on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet a lot of years.</v>

165
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

166
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll stop with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking call yourself.</v>

167
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 2>That's a true podcast and like some</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

168
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 2>my father said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure when I'll start with it,</v>

169
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think I'll stop with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

170
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be out and it would be 1:30 2:30</v>

171
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 2>the time when most people would just go</v>
<v Speaker 2>home and I didn't,</v>

172
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to go home because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to be with myself.</v>

173
00:07:56.361 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to go home with whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy I was talking to in the moment.</v>

174
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.461
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

175
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 2>So you just wanted to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

176
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to escape and then I wanted to</v>

177
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 2>escape myself.</v>

178
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

179
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a very honest way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I think a lot of people feel like</v>

180
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:13.630
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

181
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:18.210
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what the partying is</v>
<v Speaker 1>distraction from their own problems or</v>

182
00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:22.170
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goals that they haven't tried to go</v>

183
00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:26.280
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those sort of nagging problems in their</v>

184
00:08:26.281 --> 00:08:29.980
<v Speaker 1>life they're not working on totally does</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy it.</v>

185
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.990
<v Speaker 1>The mind works in such a weird way where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you chase after distractions sometimes</v>

186
00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:40.311
<v Speaker 1>with all this vigor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't do the same with the</v>

187
00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:45.831
<v Speaker 1>actual real issues in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't chase after them because it</v>

188
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.480
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no immediate gratification in</v>

189
00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:50.550
<v Speaker 1>doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

190
00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:53.280
<v Speaker 1>but there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even the immediate gratification</v>

191
00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>and chasing after distractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious</v>

192
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why you're doing it may not always to</v>

193
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 4>yourself though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

194
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 4>I guess not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

195
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 4>If you're paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most times you not.</v>

196
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:10.010
<v Speaker 4>It's weird how many different sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms the brain has in place to</v>

197
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:15.351
<v Speaker 4>protect you from all the blind spots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from discomfort and all the things that</v>

198
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 4>are wrong with your approach.</v>

199
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

200
00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:24.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean I sort of feel like when that</v>
<v Speaker 3>tells me is this an a self absorbed way</v>

201
00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:26.530
<v Speaker 3>to go through the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of feel like the point of being</v>

202
00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:31.531
<v Speaker 3>on this earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the points is self awareness and</v>

203
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.740
<v Speaker 3>to figure out what you're doing and why</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it and to kind of become</v>

204
00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:36.820
<v Speaker 3>self actualized.</v>

205
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.140
<v Speaker 4>It certainly helps you be more efficient</v>
<v Speaker 4>in what you're doing and also realize</v>

206
00:09:41.141 --> 00:09:42.820
<v Speaker 4>what it is you actually enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

207
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.860
<v Speaker 4>I think at the end of the day it's an</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and it's an experience that</v>

208
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.130
<v Speaker 4>restarts every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

209
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.640
<v Speaker 4>you go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it shuts off.</v>

210
00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:53.290
<v Speaker 4>You wake up and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we go again,</v>

211
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.270
<v Speaker 4>and you assume that this is the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>life and you assume that you're not just</v>

212
00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:02.110
<v Speaker 4>waking up in some sort of computer</v>
<v Speaker 4>program that pretends that you have 41</v>

213
00:10:02.111 --> 00:10:06.670
<v Speaker 4>years of memories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go about your day and if you want to</v>

214
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.270
<v Speaker 4>make the most out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be aware of these mistakes</v>

215
00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:14.290
<v Speaker 4>that you keep repeating and sort of just</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to not do that anymore and try to</v>

216
00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:15.340
<v Speaker 4>get better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know what I'm going to do?</v>

217
00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:17.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fucking start eating Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm gonna do?</v>

218
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna Start taking yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm going to do?</v>

219
00:10:19.211 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 4>I want to start at end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at these things as like a</v>

220
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.560
<v Speaker 4>positive sort of directions that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could get on that maybe will change and</v>

221
00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 4>then you like fall off the Vegan wagon</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you follow the yoga wagon,</v>

222
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.220
<v Speaker 4>you start drinking again and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this constant cycle with a lot of people</v>

223
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:34.570
<v Speaker 4>have like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

224
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.360
<v Speaker 4>going on diets and then fucking up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

225
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.210
<v Speaker 4>eating cake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>starting an exercise program and then</v>

226
00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:42.130
<v Speaker 4>getting fat again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

227
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.020
<v Speaker 4>I think being self aware helps you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have moments of reflection and I think</v>

228
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.980
<v Speaker 4>meditation is really important too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big one that a lot of people</v>

229
00:10:50.981 --> 00:10:55.480
<v Speaker 4>don't like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spend time alone by yourself doing</v>

230
00:10:55.481 --> 00:10:59.710
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do Twenty minutes a day to sit down and</v>

231
00:10:59.711 --> 00:11:02.560
<v Speaker 4>breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit down and think and they will help</v>

232
00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:05.890
<v Speaker 4>you tremendously it because we're on</v>
<v Speaker 4>momentum all the time.</v>

233
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.750
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

234
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 3>yesterday I began to feel overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

235
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.740
<v Speaker 3>just from this a bunch of stuff going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the moment I was just like,</v>

236
00:11:17.741 --> 00:11:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I felt kind of shaky and I'm happy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say I did not go to the kitchen and try</v>

237
00:11:22.211 --> 00:11:23.710
<v Speaker 3>to find something to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

238
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.810
<v Speaker 3>like sort of my old things that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would've done.</v>

239
00:11:25.811 --> 00:11:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made myself take some deep breaths and</v>

240
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:31.360
<v Speaker 3>tried to calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how well it worked,</v>

241
00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:34.420
<v Speaker 3>but at least I felt like that was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy way to deal with it in a moment.</v>

242
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it definitely worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

243
00:11:35.711 --> 00:11:37.420
<v Speaker 3>because you're talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's true.</v>

244
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here today so you made it,</v>

245
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.250
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

246
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.350
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>

247
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.263
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

248
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:46.130
<v Speaker 4>you're aware that you wanted to reset</v>
<v Speaker 4>your thinking.</v>

249
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.280
<v Speaker 4>So he spent some time and he took some</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep breaths and you reset your</v>

250
00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:51.800
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's real important for people</v>

251
00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 4>because how many times do you just in</v>

252
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>a momentous react?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I state this girl,</v>

253
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.630
<v Speaker 1>she's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Road rage.</v>

254
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious because she wasn't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big girl or a dangerous girl or</v>

255
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone cut her off,</v>

256
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:04.760
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you motherfucker.</v>

257
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And she would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would like gun the gas and get</v>

258
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 1>beside them and swerve in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was so crazy.</v>

259
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.480
<v Speaker 1>She's from Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago people.</v>

260
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she was just like really aggressive</v>

261
00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 1>that way and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I had to tell her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

263
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that with me in the car go</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we could die like,</v>

264
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your,</v>

265
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 1>your butt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was just like so caught up in</v>

266
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 1>the momentum of her emotions and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker thinks he can cut me off</v>

267
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it was like this thing that she</v>

268
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:43.591
<v Speaker 1>had done like all the time and she'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>never thought about it and addressing it</v>

269
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 1>and calming down breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

270
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I should probably stop doing</v>

271
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:51.460
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's this momentum of this pattern</v>

272
00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>of behavior that's cut so deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a groove that you always</v>

273
00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:59.800
<v Speaker 1>comfortably fall into like your</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee</v>

274
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.530
<v Speaker 2>proof coffee in my throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

275
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.260
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like written into your operating</v>

276
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 2>software,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain people that are</v>

277
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 2>programmed to see the world in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like people are trying to</v>

278
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 2>screw me over and I'm not going to let</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happen.</v>

279
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 2>And so they'll see it everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even where it isn't skews the coffee in</v>

280
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:23.140
<v Speaker 2>my throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I to stop drinking this stuff.</v>

281
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 2>We should come up with a better way</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that emulsified mct oil.</v>

282
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's the move without the</v>
<v Speaker 2>butter.</v>

283
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Give it a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's next move.</v>

284
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

285
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

286
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:34.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

287
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody does that.</v>

288
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

289
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.350
<v Speaker 1>it's normal and especially if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have been fucked over before,</v>

290
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Speaker 1>then you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

291
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 1>it's everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddammit.</v>

292
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 1>These fucking people.</v>

293
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be blindsided again.</v>

294
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.570
<v Speaker 2>It's when you actually do actually get</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked over,</v>

295
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.260
<v Speaker 2>like in a business deal or with someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's trying to fuck you over,</v>

296
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:55.810
<v Speaker 2>like financially or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

297
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.520
<v Speaker 2>it's very disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

298
00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a real criminal.</v>

299
00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm involved with the criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's trying to rob me.</v>

300
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Has that happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

301
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.010
<v Speaker 2>definitely and when it does happen it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just realize like,</v>

302
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

303
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.180
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well some people this is what they do</v>

304
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 2>and you have to now throw that into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mix.</v>

305
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people would just kind of try to</v>

306
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:17.620
<v Speaker 2>steal money from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

307
00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:20.500
<v Speaker 2>I would need to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>

308
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:22.690
<v Speaker 2>it still affected my throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

309
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I would need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

310
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 2>I would become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would begin to think about everything</v>

311
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:30.850
<v Speaker 2>and I'd be like when was the point at</v>
<v Speaker 2>which this started and I'd have to kind</v>

312
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:35.851
<v Speaker 2>of reconsider everything and that is my</v>
<v Speaker 2>own obsession with certified.</v>

313
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 2>We were talking before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I can prevent this</v>

314
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 2>happening in the future is to really</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how this happened now,</v>

315
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think I get a little too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can really like I can,</v>

316
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I can ruminate on something too much.</v>

317
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we all can,</v>

318
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think also if something's important to</v>

319
00:14:55.711 --> 00:14:57.480
<v Speaker 1>you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:14:57.481 --> 00:14:59.740
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want something to work out well,</v>

321
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.480
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a podcast you're doing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy show or something like that,</v>

322
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.540
<v Speaker 1>you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of obsess on things too</v>

323
00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:09.690
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get so involved in the details</v>

324
00:15:09.691 --> 00:15:10.650
<v Speaker 1>that you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

325
00:15:10.651 --> 00:15:12.930
<v Speaker 1>the old expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't see the forest for the trees.</v>

326
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.730
<v Speaker 2>But like what we were saying earlier</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the or I was saying about trying</v>

327
00:15:17.731 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 2>to talk to myself differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This um,</v>

328
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.430
<v Speaker 2>this might map barf because it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so hippy dippy,</v>

329
00:15:23.431 --> 00:15:26.310
<v Speaker 2>new age like stuart smalley almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

330
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 2>lately I've been thinking like is that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving behavior towards myself that I'm</v>

331
00:15:33.001 --> 00:15:36.480
<v Speaker 2>engaging in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm ruminating about something,</v>

332
00:15:36.481 --> 00:15:38.700
<v Speaker 2>are obsessing about something or</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about something that's</v>

333
00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:41.280
<v Speaker 2>upsetting me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is that am I being loving towards</v>

334
00:15:41.281 --> 00:15:45.090
<v Speaker 2>myself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in thinking that way after I</v>

335
00:15:45.091 --> 00:15:46.820
<v Speaker 2>finished vomiting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it like,</v>

336
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.110
<v Speaker 2>it allow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it allows me to actually kind of move</v>

337
00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:50.940
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like put those thoughts down,</v>

338
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.990
<v Speaker 2>which is a pretty new thing for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have been at the mercy of my</v>

339
00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:56.220
<v Speaker 2>thoughts always.</v>

340
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Well for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I try to avoid a lot of negative</v>

341
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:06.560
<v Speaker 1>behavior and negative thinking because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I allow it,</v>

342
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

343
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I always think of myself as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

344
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 1>if I was giving myself advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would I,</v>

345
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.650
<v Speaker 1>how would I treat it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would I,</v>

346
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably be pretty brutally honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So negative thinking and negative</v>

347
00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:21.650
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to avoid it almost for the</v>

348
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:24.440
<v Speaker 1>consequences of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chastising myself.</v>

349
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to chastise myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

350
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I want to like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm fucking up,</v>

351
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.010
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want to hear me going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on Pussy,</v>

352
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.320
<v Speaker 1>get it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

353
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 1>there's that part of me like it's almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a drill instructor is like looking</v>

354
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:39.980
<v Speaker 1>over my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure that I don't fuck</v>

355
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] like bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right here.</v>

356
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing is stupid,</v>

357
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:43.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

358
00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 1>don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get dumb.</v>

359
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.500
<v Speaker 1>And I've been dumb and I think we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>all been dumb and I just think all that</v>

360
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 1>self love and self help is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not if it allows you to continue the</v>

361
00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 1>same patterns over and over again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>still love yourself.</v>

362
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.720
<v Speaker 2>That's yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you have to really be</v>

363
00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.500
<v Speaker 2>honest and make sure that your rig</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigorously honest with yourself,</v>

364
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.560
<v Speaker 2>you can still love yourself and tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself you're a fat fuck.</v>

365
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes that's the most loving thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gently,</v>

366
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:14.130
<v Speaker 2>lovingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell myself I'm a fat.</v>

367
00:17:14.131 --> 00:17:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you say it was a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweet smile.</v>

368
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the loving part.</v>

369
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

370
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.233
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

372
00:17:23.061 --> 00:17:25.730
<v Speaker 1>and you still love yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you've been eating cake all day,</v>

373
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.571
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

374
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're gonna fucking die of an</v>

375
00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:29.090
<v Speaker 1>insulin crash here.</v>

376
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.250
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where.</v>

377
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.830
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it loving it,</v>

378
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.520
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really married to this barfy idea.</v>

379
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Is it loving to eat cake all day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

380
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.290
<v Speaker 2>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not treating yourself right.</v>

381
00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:42.700
<v Speaker 2>If you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the real</v>

382
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.670
<v Speaker 1>problem is that mouth pleasure is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even that good.</v>

383
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Like the mouth pleasure that you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>from eating cake is the first thinking</v>

384
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:52.920
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like the first bite or the</v>

385
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:55.610
<v Speaker 1>second bite maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you get deep into it,</v>

386
00:17:55.611 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of sickening that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just keep going.</v>

387
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Like my kid had a birthday party the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other day and we eat her cake and I was</v>

388
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fucking Christ.</v>

389
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 1>This stuff is so disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a tiny little bit because I'm</v>

390
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:10.470
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get into it and especially if you</v>

391
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 1>don't need a lot of cake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like after like the third or fourth</v>

392
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:13.840
<v Speaker 1>bite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

393
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this fucking pasty frosting and</v>

394
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 1>sugar and</v>

395
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.020
<v Speaker 3>are you one of those people who pushes</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the frosting to the side and was</v>

396
00:18:23.021 --> 00:18:23.401
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

397
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:24.510
<v Speaker 3>it's too sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

398
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I'll just have a bite of the wheat germ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

399
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:29.670
<v Speaker 3>I go for the frost at first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody does.</v>

400
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:32.130
<v Speaker 3>That's where the love is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although that's true.</v>

401
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.490
<v Speaker 3>I gave up carbs for about a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All carbs,</v>

402
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.751
<v Speaker 3>all carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

403
00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:39.660
<v Speaker 3>I was very strict about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at even,</v>

404
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 3>I was trying not to Overdo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kind of kind of trying to do like</v>

405
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.870
<v Speaker 3>strict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strict Atkins.</v>

406
00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:49.140
<v Speaker 3>So eventually I allowed more vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

407
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.230
<v Speaker 3>But at the beginning I was trying not to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go overboard with that.</v>

408
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.620
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was your,</v>

409
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 3>what was your response to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body's response at the beginning?</v>

410
00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.390
<v Speaker 3>So my story is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

411
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.500
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm growing up and into my twenties and</v>

412
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I kinda gone up and down and then</v>

413
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I finally lost the bulk of it and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>kept it off for years,</v>

414
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 3>but about a year ago it started creeping</v>
<v Speaker 3>back on a little bit because I'm doing</v>

415
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:18.840
<v Speaker 3>ivf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get pregnant and I'm</v>

416
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 3>shooting myself with hormones all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

417
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the things in the past,</v>

418
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.680
<v Speaker 3>all the ways in the past that I'd kept</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weight off because it had been about</v>

419
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:32.460
<v Speaker 3>10 years of really being careful with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>calories and exercising and all that.</v>

420
00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Like it just wasn't working anymore and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was freaking me the fuck out.</v>

421
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.600
<v Speaker 3>So that's when I started going to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal trainer and that's when I,</v>

422
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was not his advice.</v>

423
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what made me decide to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

424
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:48.960
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe if I just cut out all carbs,</v>

425
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 3>that'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at the beginning I did lose weight,</v>

426
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it no longer helped in terms of</v>

427
00:19:55.991 --> 00:19:56.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

428
00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 3>not then at a certain point I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

429
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:03.060
<v Speaker 3>the weight comes on at a certain point</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the ivf cycle and then comes back off</v>

430
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:06.450
<v Speaker 3>in between cycles and goes back and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized that I had been freaking out.</v>

431
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.720
<v Speaker 3>But it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just cycling on its own for people</v>

432
00:20:09.721 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 3>that are freaking out right now in vitro</v>
<v Speaker 3>fertilization,</v>

433
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.470
<v Speaker 3>in vitro fertilization is where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

434
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.200
<v Speaker 3>they fertilize your eggs outside of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

435
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:25.020
<v Speaker 3>It acts in vitro is in glass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what it means,</v>

436
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.710
<v Speaker 3>and it's a way that people who can't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant naturally can get pregnant.</v>

437
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm so in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it involves injecting a lot of hormones</v>

438
00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 3>and it's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole thing.</v>

439
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>

440
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.210
<v Speaker 3>it was affecting my weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that now that is what was</v>

441
00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:44.370
<v Speaker 3>affected my weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was freaking out at the time.</v>

442
00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 3>So initially there was some weight loss</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that stopped,</v>

443
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.640
<v Speaker 3>but I found for a while I enjoyed living</v>
<v Speaker 3>within very strict guidelines.</v>

444
00:20:57.521 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 3>It was just easier when we go to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant because I used to joke that I</v>

445
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:04.480
<v Speaker 3>would like to be buried in a bread</v>
<v Speaker 3>basket with a fuck ton of butter.</v>

446
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.550
<v Speaker 3>Bread and butter is my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

447
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.290
<v Speaker 3>and when we go to a restaurant and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring the bread,</v>

448
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:12.490
<v Speaker 3>like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even touch it.</v>

449
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

450
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.630
<v Speaker 3>it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was nice to not even have to think</v>

451
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:18.670
<v Speaker 3>about all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

452
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

453
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:24.880
<v Speaker 3>a few months ago I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like this is really doing</v>

454
00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:28.780
<v Speaker 3>anything for me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I miss my lean cuisine dinners,</v>

455
00:21:28.781 --> 00:21:31.150
<v Speaker 3>which is what I used to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuisine.</v>

456
00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.400
<v Speaker 4>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I of all the things you can miss.</v>

457
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy choice dinners as well with the,</v>

458
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.350
<v Speaker 4>with that process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit.</v>

459
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.230
<v Speaker 4>I know I had stopped eating the process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I missed.</v>

460
00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.790
<v Speaker 4>I missed the bullshit I missed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I missed the wood pulp.</v>

461
00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.240
<v Speaker 4>Wood wood is wood pulp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably some kind of filler in</v>

462
00:21:53.241 --> 00:21:55.520
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying like wood pulp in your</v>

463
00:21:55.521 --> 00:21:57.590
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In parmesan cheese.</v>

464
00:21:57.591 --> 00:22:00.310
<v Speaker 4>I think that come out recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

465
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.690
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie knows Jamie.</v>

466
00:22:02.691 --> 00:22:03.560
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

467
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.100
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

468
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.770
<v Speaker 4>What kind of Parmesan cheese and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

469
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.320
<v Speaker 4>you know the bottle of kraft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parmesan cheese.</v>

470
00:22:09.321 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 4>It came out that a certain percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is like wood shavings or something.</v>

471
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.000
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are they putting in your cheese so</v>

472
00:22:17.001 --> 00:22:21.450
<v Speaker 4>that there's a bigger plants though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

473
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.840
<v Speaker 4>Cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You sprinkle what?</v>

474
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.330
<v Speaker 4>Cellulose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

475
00:22:26.331 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Hotly contested,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but perhaps not for reasons.</v>

476
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.680
<v Speaker 4>My think FDA investigation found that a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pennsylvania company,</v>

477
00:22:30.681 --> 00:22:32.750
<v Speaker 4>castle cheese incorporated had doctored.</v>

478
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:37.190
<v Speaker 4>It's so called Parmesan with a mix of</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose.</v>

479
00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.870
<v Speaker 4>Also known as wood pulp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

480
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.880
<v Speaker 4>well you say cellulose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't sound like cellulose.</v>

481
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.820
<v Speaker 4>Just sounds like like fiber from plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plant material.</v>

482
00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there shouldn't be plant material and</v>

483
00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:51.050
<v Speaker 4>fucking cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

484
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.180
<v Speaker 4>asshole should go to jail for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Putting fucking wouldn't cheese.</v>

485
00:22:56.181 --> 00:22:59.870
<v Speaker 4>You can't just do that and you can't mix</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheddar cheese with wood and call it</v>

486
00:22:59.871 --> 00:23:04.730
<v Speaker 4>Parmesan so it should have its own new</v>
<v Speaker 4>variety,</v>

487
00:23:04.731 --> 00:23:06.050
<v Speaker 4>name wood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulp,</v>

488
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.210
<v Speaker 4>cheesy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just call it that.</v>

489
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.840
<v Speaker 4>People would buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mouth is watering.</v>

490
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're eating lean cuisine insane.</v>

491
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:18.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is in the processed</v>
<v Speaker 4>frozen dinners that I like,</v>

492
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.170
<v Speaker 4>but that's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of like when I smoked I was like,</v>

493
00:23:21.171 --> 00:23:22.880
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the fiberglass in the</v>

494
00:23:22.881 --> 00:23:25.220
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes that I like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When my wife was pregnant,</v>

495
00:23:25.221 --> 00:23:29.390
<v Speaker 4>she liked Tony knows pizza rolls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know those little fucking disgusting</v>

496
00:23:29.391 --> 00:23:30.710
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've not had them,</v>

497
00:23:30.711 --> 00:23:32.270
<v Speaker 4>but I've seen them in the freezer</v>
<v Speaker 4>section.</v>

498
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 4>I was buying them for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe you're actually wanting</v>

499
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:37.640
<v Speaker 4>to eat this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She ate healthy most of the time,</v>

500
00:23:37.641 --> 00:23:41.540
<v Speaker 4>but like she would just one of like vege</v>
<v Speaker 4>out and sit there holding onto her beach</v>

501
00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 4>ball stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tony knows pizza rolls now.</v>

502
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 4>How</v>

503
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 1>are you toward your wife and your kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of beat them up?</v>

504
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Do whatever the fuck I want to know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>my diet.</v>

505
00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in terms of being rigorously honest</v>

506
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:04.260
<v Speaker 1>or letting them kind of come to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own conclusions,</v>

507
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need to do that with my wife.</v>

508
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:10.440
<v Speaker 1>She's on the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know she,</v>

509
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.210
<v Speaker 1>she's pretty healthy too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she also likes to indulge but she's</v>

510
00:24:14.211 --> 00:24:15.350
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's pretty,</v>

511
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.710
<v Speaker 1>pretty balanced in terms of like how she</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches diet and exercise and healthy</v>

512
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:24.530
<v Speaker 1>eating and then occasionally indulging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's balanced.</v>

513
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Luckily that's not an issue and for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

514
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with kids the big struggle is trying to</v>

515
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:33.440
<v Speaker 1>keep them from eating too much sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to be that guy that</v>

516
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:35.870
<v Speaker 1>says you can't have sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she has some kids in her class.</v>

517
00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:37.550
<v Speaker 1>One of my daughters does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

518
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 1>this is one kid in particular that's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insane diet.</v>

519
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't eat any sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing processed and the kid's</v>

520
00:24:44.391 --> 00:24:47.180
<v Speaker 1>freaking out all the time because all</v>
<v Speaker 1>around them kids are eating cake and</v>

521
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:52.181
<v Speaker 1>having all these things and I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can set you up psychologically so</v>

522
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:55.160
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a bad way where you develop this,</v>

523
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.000
<v Speaker 1>where you want to bench later or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

524
00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think uh,</v>

525
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.330
<v Speaker 1>when your parents tell you not to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to eat,</v>

526
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you tell parents telling you not to</v>

527
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 1>be a slut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the first thing you want to do,</v>

528
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what everybody does,</v>

529
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't drink.</v>

530
00:25:07.911 --> 00:25:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

531
00:25:09.051 --> 00:25:11.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suppression is just not good for</v>

532
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:14.360
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I try to tell them is you</v>

533
00:25:14.361 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 1>can have a little sugar but you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be aware that sugar is just not good for</v>

534
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

535
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.150
<v Speaker 1>It tastes good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has consequences.</v>

536
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 1>So like when we'd go halloween trick or</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating,</v>

537
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd let them have a couple of pieces of</v>

538
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:26.250
<v Speaker 1>candy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

539
00:25:26.251 --> 00:25:28.850
<v Speaker 1>like you can have a couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't sit and eat that shit</v>

540
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 1>until you go into a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for you.</v>

541
00:25:30.921 --> 00:25:34.180
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes they repeat it like I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I eat too much sugar and it</v>

542
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.520
<v Speaker 1>just makes me feel terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then sometimes like my youngest</v>

543
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my youngest is a little like a little</v>

544
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:43.670
<v Speaker 1>barbarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll eat sugar and then run around the</v>

545
00:25:43.671 --> 00:25:45.850
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rory wrote like,</v>

546
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.590
<v Speaker 1>she just stormed the beaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she throws her arms back.</v>

547
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.790
<v Speaker 1>It shows you like run around the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sugar it up.</v>

548
00:25:52.791 --> 00:25:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>

549
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 1>We just gave her a rocket fuel or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

550
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Because you think about like a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny body,</v>

551
00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:58.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

552
00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.970
<v Speaker 1>My youngest is five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost six and she's,</v>

553
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what she weighs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably less than 50 pounds,</v>

554
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.200
<v Speaker 1>so if you give her a fucking candy bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much sugar's a God damn candy</v>

555
00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 1>bar and it's going in that tiny little</v>
<v Speaker 1>body and she just reacts to it.</v>

556
00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:13.424
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

557
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 1>like she'll just chase me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll kick me.</v>

558
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 1>She fucking tries to tackle me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just goes nuts.</v>

559
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:20.970
<v Speaker 1>She's like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really physical.</v>

560
00:26:20.971 --> 00:26:24.620
<v Speaker 1>When and when she's like sugared up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like super obvious.</v>

561
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

562
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.130
<v Speaker 1>as long as she's burning it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like let her just run around so</v>

563
00:26:29.131 --> 00:26:33.050
<v Speaker 1>she gets crazy and burn it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like her five hour energy with</v>

564
00:26:33.051 --> 00:26:36.530
<v Speaker 1>worse doesn't really last five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last about 40 minutes.</v>

565
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

566
00:26:38.811 --> 00:26:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel tired.</v>

567
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:43.010
<v Speaker 1>I just want to lie.</v>

568
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.910
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

569
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any experience in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:53.370
<v Speaker 1>so when they taste the sugar it tastes</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

571
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>They eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this feeling like,</v>

572
00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

573
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a sugar rush coming on right now.</v>

574
00:26:57.631 --> 00:26:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think like that.</v>

575
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.120
<v Speaker 1>They just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew,</v>

576
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not 100 percent strict but I do make</v>

577
00:27:07.411 --> 00:27:09.780
<v Speaker 1>them eat vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing I do.</v>

578
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I make them eat vegetables and I try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep them away from shitty food and I</v>

579
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:17.100
<v Speaker 1>try just try to explain why it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is why daddy likes to eat</v>

580
00:27:17.101 --> 00:27:18.630
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they always mock me that I don't</v>

581
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 1>eat bread and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like to stick things in front of my</v>

582
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 1>face that they eat and I don't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time I don't suppress</v>

583
00:27:25.981 --> 00:27:26.260
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

584
00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I try to just keep it like even when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do something wrong,</v>

585
00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things that I say is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did way worse than you.</v>

586
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

587
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.910
<v Speaker 1>if they did something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said ice,</v>

588
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.730
<v Speaker 1>do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was your age,</v>

589
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.590
<v Speaker 1>a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're smarter than me,</v>

590
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 1>like you're better at than me and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>always do that.</v>

591
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:46.410
<v Speaker 1>I always reinforce that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every mistake you've made,</v>

592
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I've made everything you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done.</v>

593
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:49.860
<v Speaker 1>If you lied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lied.</v>

594
00:27:49.861 --> 00:27:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Like if I catch him lying about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

595
00:27:51.311 --> 00:27:52.260
<v Speaker 1>not telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just say,</v>

596
00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:54.030
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to tell you when I was</v>

597
00:27:54.031 --> 00:27:56.460
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lied all the time and I didn't want to</v>

598
00:27:56.461 --> 00:27:57.960
<v Speaker 1>lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to get in trouble.</v>

599
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 1>And so I would just lost that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

600
00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Or is that a lie though?</v>

601
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some lion.</v>

602
00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

603
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

604
00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I think every kid has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

605
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 1>but I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to enforce in their head</v>

606
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:11.610
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to not love you.</v>

607
00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

608
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:15.060
<v Speaker 1>This is a part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's so great.</v>

609
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:17.670
<v Speaker 1>That's such a respectful way to raise</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids.</v>

610
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I try to treat them like they're little</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings that I know more than they</v>

611
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:24.120
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of him as my kids in that.</v>

612
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I own them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of them like they're my kids in</v>

613
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Speaker 1>terms of I love them deeply but not like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

614
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't own you like you're a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>

615
00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that setting them up</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that gives them a certain amount of</v>

616
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:39.420
<v Speaker 1>autonomy and a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence that I think is really</v>

617
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:40.920
<v Speaker 1>critical to develop early on.</v>

618
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.050
<v Speaker 1>So that's not a giant shock when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn 18,</v>

619
00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly build them into this idea.</v>

620
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:50.580
<v Speaker 1>You are a little autonomous human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm always going to be here.</v>

621
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Like if you need advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you need a hug,</v>

622
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:53.990
<v Speaker 1>if you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you always got a place to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry like</v>

624
00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:58.350
<v Speaker 1>everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't,</v>

625
00:28:58.351 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 1>don't go through life with fear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

626
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.100
<v Speaker 1>you know that you don't have to worry</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

627
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:04.710
<v Speaker 1>You have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're your own thing.</v>

628
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you into you in the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

629
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 1>You like space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:11.220
<v Speaker 1>when you get into like reading books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's your fucking thing?</v>

631
00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Find your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never had that chance as a kid,</v>

632
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I'm looking at my life,</v>

633
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm like back at like the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to me that made me sort of like</v>

634
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:31.010
<v Speaker 1>rebel and made me sort of reinforced the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that I need to be independent.</v>

635
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.260
<v Speaker 1>I need to get the fuck away from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people need to have stopped all</v>

636
00:29:34.261 --> 00:29:36.840
<v Speaker 1>this negative input coming from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different directions.</v>

637
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I sort of inhabit children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a chance to what I would have liked</v>

638
00:29:43.751 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 1>about my own childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have an oppressive upbringing?</v>

639
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't oppressive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just was.</v>

640
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.230
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a lot of attention is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

641
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.380
<v Speaker 1>my parents really just weren't into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

642
00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there was a lot of latchkey</v>

643
00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:00.900
<v Speaker 1>kids in our generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

644
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk out the door when I was seven and</v>

645
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 1>wander through the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do it.</v>

646
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I did a fisherman's wharf magic show</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was eight years old.</v>

647
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.940
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's their eight year old.</v>

648
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Like my daughter just turned eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my daughters did.</v>

649
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine her just walking out</v>

650
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:23.790
<v Speaker 1>my house in San Francisco and wandering</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the street and being by herself</v>

651
00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:25.780
<v Speaker 1>with no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine that.</v>

652
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.070
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think about like,</v>

653
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.440
<v Speaker 1>what my parents let me do and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

654
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:34.000
<v Speaker 1>made me independent and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God put me in so much danger.</v>

655
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:35.900
<v Speaker 1>There's so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

656
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.030
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're forced to be an adult</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a child,</v>

657
00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:42.560
<v Speaker 1>you pay for it somehow later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

658
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sure.</v>

659
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's pros and cons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

660
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:52.530
<v Speaker 1>if you can get through it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a more comprehensive view of</v>

661
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:56.500
<v Speaker 1>the world and the dangers are provided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean that was almost molested when</v>

662
00:30:56.501 --> 00:31:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I was like eight by some fucking creep</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a library that I was hanging out at</v>

663
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.530
<v Speaker 1>the library and saved me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

664
00:31:02.531 --> 00:31:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the monster movies when I was a</v>

665
00:31:05.141 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 1>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really into like,</v>

666
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Dracula and Frankenstein and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was looking through these books and</v>

667
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:12.940
<v Speaker 1>this guy came up to me and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really weird.</v>

668
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.250
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

669
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like a monster books.</v>

670
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.131
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

671
00:31:18.131 --> 00:31:18.730
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

672
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love monster books.</v>

673
00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I've got some monster books in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to see him on my hands?</v>

674
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like,</v>

675
00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:26.070
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I started walking with them in</v>

677
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:31.420
<v Speaker 1>the library and starts yelling at me</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she had seen me there before.</v>

678
00:31:31.421 --> 00:31:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's real nice lady and she's like</v>

679
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:34.270
<v Speaker 1>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph,</v>

680
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you get away from that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just got out of prison and the Guy</v>

681
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ran and I just started crying.</v>

682
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.460
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

683
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking at the time like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck just lets a little kid just</v>

684
00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 1>wander around like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they do.</v>

685
00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.320
<v Speaker 1>So time you thought that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

686
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking that at the time.</v>

687
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck am I just wandering around</v>

688
00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.870
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you tell your parents?</v>

689
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's fucked up is my mom didn't</v>

690
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:04.390
<v Speaker 1>remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I talked to my mom about it</v>

691
00:32:04.391 --> 00:32:05.560
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't remember.</v>

692
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you not remember?</v>

693
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.460
<v Speaker 1>This guy tried to molest me when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

694
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 1>He got upset at her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was her reaction to see you're</v>

695
00:32:12.611 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 1>getting upset?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that was that latch key thing</v>

696
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:15.701
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

697
00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:16.481
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

698
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:17.470
<v Speaker 1>you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happened.</v>

699
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they have this attitude.</v>

700
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for the longest time that was</v>

701
00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:23.350
<v Speaker 1>the attitude of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

702
00:32:23.351 --> 00:32:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept you physically safe.</v>

703
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:27.160
<v Speaker 1>You're in clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to school,</v>

704
00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:28.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:29.860
<v Speaker 1>so what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

706
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all the whole emotional side of</v>

707
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:33.900
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

708
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I think when you look at our generation</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus our parent's generation and their</v>

709
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:42.830
<v Speaker 1>parents generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just go back a couple generations</v>

710
00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:45.650
<v Speaker 1>to like my grandparents' days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandparents were immigrants.</v>

711
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 1>They came over on a boat from Italy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland.</v>

712
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:53.110
<v Speaker 1>And when you think about what their life</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like versus what our life is like</v>

713
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're barely even related.</v>

714
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:58.790
<v Speaker 1>We're so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so different with our access to</v>

715
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the understanding that people have</v>

716
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 1>about raising people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but communicating with people about</v>

717
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.320
<v Speaker 1>talking to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in your reference to going to the</v>

718
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:08.270
<v Speaker 1>library isn't fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

719
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

720
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean imagine you having that kind of a</v>

721
00:33:12.711 --> 00:33:15.890
<v Speaker 1>conversation with your parents when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were your age about loving yourself.</v>

722
00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Am I being loving myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

723
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:20.240
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go out there and farm.</v>

724
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Even I feel that way towards myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

725
00:33:22.771 --> 00:33:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm an old soul so I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

726
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.740
<v Speaker 2>I think you're introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're looking at yourself,</v>

727
00:33:28.741 --> 00:33:29.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind might in a dark.</v>

728
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Whereas this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more that than anything.</v>

729
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're trying to get pregnant.</v>

730
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:37.950
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

731
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:40.050
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually haven't transferred any of</v>

732
00:33:40.051 --> 00:33:44.040
<v Speaker 2>the embryos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've just been collecting them and</v>

733
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:49.100
<v Speaker 2>they're frozen and we are about to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first transfer in the next couple</v>

734
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.030
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd make it a Frankenstein baby.</v>

735
00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:55.450
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Science involved.</v>

736
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to you and I know you</v>

737
00:33:58.711 --> 00:34:00.480
<v Speaker 2>and Whitney Cummings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about that.</v>

738
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is crazy and a weird thing is</v>

739
00:34:05.911 --> 00:34:09.390
<v Speaker 2>that you could have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

740
00:34:09.391 --> 00:34:12.900
<v Speaker 2>of all of our embryos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two of them are good and will create</v>

741
00:34:12.901 --> 00:34:15.420
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they happen to be implanted at the</v>

742
00:34:15.421 --> 00:34:17.310
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I will give birth to twins,</v>

743
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.900
<v Speaker 2>but if not that and we go another round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I could have kids,</v>

744
00:34:21.901 --> 00:34:24.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years apart and like that's</v>

745
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.670
<v Speaker 2>what were you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you end up doing all this weird</v>

746
00:34:26.671 --> 00:34:29.460
<v Speaker 2>math of like how many should I implant</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maximize the chance of getting</v>

747
00:34:29.461 --> 00:34:29.880
<v Speaker 2>pregnant?</v>

748
00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Minimize the chance of multiples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

749
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

750
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.710
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take your egg and they take your</v>

751
00:34:35.711 --> 00:34:38.350
<v Speaker 1>husband's berm and they mix it up in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lab somewhere.</v>

752
00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they do it with lightning bolts and</v>

753
00:34:40.691 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 1>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've raised the table up to the.</v>

754
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything goes dark for a second and</v>

755
00:34:46.871 --> 00:34:49.790
<v Speaker 2>very quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

756
00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly like that.</v>

757
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Crazy that they can freeze the embryos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the trickiest one.</v>

758
00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:01.350
<v Speaker 2>And I think normally or I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditionally what they do is they take</v>

759
00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:06.160
<v Speaker 2>the eggs and then they take the sperm</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they put it together in a petri dish</v>

760
00:35:06.161 --> 00:35:08.080
<v Speaker 2>and then just kind of let it do its</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

761
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:12.820
<v Speaker 2>But for certain people they do something</v>
<v Speaker 2>called ECC,</v>

762
00:35:12.821 --> 00:35:14.050
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see if I can.</v>

763
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.770
<v Speaker 2>It's interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyto plasma,</v>

764
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:21.830
<v Speaker 2>my something sperm injection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they take the sperm and they</v>

765
00:35:22.961 --> 00:35:26.770
<v Speaker 2>literally inject it and I don't know how</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they must have the tiniest little</v>

766
00:35:26.771 --> 00:35:31.771
<v Speaker 2>needle into the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's even more minute.</v>

767
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crazy that they can do that</v>

768
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.930
<v Speaker 1>because what if you catch a week load</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way?</v>

769
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Like a week load gets lucky like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would always want the strong</v>

770
00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 2>just through the egg to get some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think that they are using</v>

771
00:35:46.071 --> 00:35:47.840
<v Speaker 2>analysis to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>

772
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.570
<v Speaker 2>get rid of the weak ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do sperm analysis.</v>

773
00:35:50.571 --> 00:35:51.950
<v Speaker 2>They do have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

774
00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:56.360
<v Speaker 2>that's like the first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like buds camp for sperm in the weak</v>

775
00:35:56.361 --> 00:35:57.560
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ring the bell,</v>

776
00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:02.060
<v Speaker 2>they take all the sperm they take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they drive them far into the mountains,</v>

777
00:36:02.061 --> 00:36:04.400
<v Speaker 2>they drop them off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give them one peanut and they say,</v>

778
00:36:04.401 --> 00:36:06.500
<v Speaker 2>we'll come back for you in three weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're still here,</v>

779
00:36:06.501 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 2>we're going to inject you into an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you a Swiss army knife for no</v>

780
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:11.680
<v Speaker 2>fucking piece of shoestring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Figured out stupid.</v>

781
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.980
<v Speaker 2>They take away your shoe laces and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you have a lot of thinking to do.</v>

782
00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Been very bad sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm to make a person stupid.</v>

783
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I get what you're saying in terms of</v>

784
00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.590
<v Speaker 2>natural selection.</v>

785
00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Ivf is circumventing all of that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's taking a whole bunch of women who</v>

786
00:36:31.941 --> 00:36:36.941
<v Speaker 2>are past the age that they can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant naturally and it's allowing</v>

787
00:36:38.001 --> 00:36:39.110
<v Speaker 2>them to get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

788
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you make an awesome person that</v>

789
00:36:44.181 --> 00:36:45.340
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>

790
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:46.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

791
00:36:46.251 --> 00:36:48.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also that argument which is,</v>

792
00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:50.570
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people who are doing it are</v>

793
00:36:50.571 --> 00:36:55.571
<v Speaker 2>people who have tried to be responsible</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wait until they're at a point in</v>

794
00:36:55.971 --> 00:37:00.500
<v Speaker 2>life when they can have kids versus like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 22 or 23 year old who,</v>

795
00:37:00.501 --> 00:37:03.290
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure there's plenty of great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually I've never met them,</v>

796
00:37:03.291 --> 00:37:05.240
<v Speaker 2>but they're probably out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had kids that young and it all</v>

797
00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:09.290
<v Speaker 2>turned out well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can get pregnant pretty easily</v>

798
00:37:09.291 --> 00:37:10.430
<v Speaker 2>usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

799
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I feel like most early people in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>early twenties aren't really ready to</v>

800
00:37:14.481 --> 00:37:19.481
<v Speaker 2>have kids yet and still like we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting emotionally ready later,</v>

801
00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.860
<v Speaker 2>but our biology is staying the same</v>

802
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.290
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the things that I</v>

803
00:37:24.291 --> 00:37:26.180
<v Speaker 1>always think about when I think about my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom.</v>

804
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Like my mom had me when she was 21 when</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got pregnant when she was 20 and</v>

805
00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:33.170
<v Speaker 1>when she's 21,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a baby when I was 21.</v>

806
00:37:33.171 --> 00:37:35.470
<v Speaker 1>I was a fucking moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

807
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.810
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine being forced to raise a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid when I was 21.</v>

808
00:37:38.811 --> 00:37:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I was so irresponsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't take care of myself and I</v>

809
00:37:42.831 --> 00:37:46.220
<v Speaker 1>think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural process of people getting</v>

810
00:37:46.221 --> 00:37:48.860
<v Speaker 1>pregnant really young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like how strange is it with human</v>

811
00:37:48.861 --> 00:37:51.890
<v Speaker 1>beings that you're essentially able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get pregnant when you're 13.</v>

812
00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

813
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.730
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just crazy fucking crazy.</v>

814
00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.360
<v Speaker 1>So my daughter who is just turned eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got five years.</v>

815
00:38:02.271 --> 00:38:04.430
<v Speaker 1>She pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

816
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.530
<v Speaker 1>She's a tiny little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little person,</v>

817
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.190
<v Speaker 1>little baby person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like that little baby person can</v>

818
00:38:10.191 --> 00:38:12.770
<v Speaker 1>have a baby inside of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's madness.</v>

819
00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just our biology is so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so irresponsible now.</v>

820
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.610
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

821
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

822
00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:21.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

823
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.840
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just such a weird holdover from a</v>

824
00:38:23.841 --> 00:38:27.590
<v Speaker 2>time that we can't even remember when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>made sense to get pregnant at 13.</v>

825
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

826
00:38:28.251 --> 00:38:29.270
<v Speaker 2>we can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

827
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.640
<v Speaker 1>that's the weirdest thing about biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

828
00:38:31.641 --> 00:38:34.580
<v Speaker 1>is that the changes that take place</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>

829
00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:38.140
<v Speaker 1>they over long periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands,</v>

830
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:41.920
<v Speaker 1>if not millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the changes take taking place in our</v>

831
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:46.300
<v Speaker 1>culture and our society over the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years has been insane.</v>

832
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.880
<v Speaker 1>The massive amount of difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in 1016 versus 2016 is just you</v>

833
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:57.210
<v Speaker 1>can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

834
00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 1>It's barely the same life.</v>

835
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the amount of change that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have recently is the same amount of</v>

836
00:39:05.371 --> 00:39:08.040
<v Speaker 3>change that had there has always been</v>
<v Speaker 3>historically though?</v>

837
00:39:08.041 --> 00:39:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Or do you feel like things are like</v>
<v Speaker 3>speeding up?</v>

838
00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely accelerating.</v>

839
00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.400
<v Speaker 1>They're accelerating because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

840
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:18.470
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent that it's just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world we live in today is alien compared</v>

841
00:39:18.471 --> 00:39:21.380
<v Speaker 1>to the world of a thousand years ago or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a few hundred years ago.</v>

842
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.050
<v Speaker 1>If you went 200 years ago and showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>them what people,</v>

843
00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.460
<v Speaker 1>how people are living today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

844
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the crazy science fiction authors,</v>

845
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:34.330
<v Speaker 1>authors of the 18 hundreds who you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jules Verne and you know orson wells and</v>

846
00:39:34.581 --> 00:39:38.300
<v Speaker 1>all these crazy people that had all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these great ideas about the future,</v>

847
00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.930
<v Speaker 1>they never thought the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is bizarre.</v>

848
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.740
<v Speaker 1>That the idea that it's not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal spaceships that change us.</v>

849
00:39:45.741 --> 00:39:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be laser beams that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were not going to live in the sky,</v>

850
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.730
<v Speaker 1>way crazier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna live in this one spot,</v>

851
00:39:52.731 --> 00:39:56.600
<v Speaker 1>but everything's going to be there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wirelessly and we're all going to be</v>

852
00:39:56.601 --> 00:39:59.630
<v Speaker 1>connected in that way globally</v>
<v Speaker 1>wirelessly.</v>

853
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the most fucked up thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was sitting at home the other day</v>

854
00:40:02.811 --> 00:40:06.200
<v Speaker 1>and somebody sent me a youtube video and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this crazy youtube video</v>

855
00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.930
<v Speaker 1>and as I'm watching Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bizarre is that?</v>

856
00:40:08.931 --> 00:40:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Someone just sent me something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I press it and now here I'm watching it</v>

857
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

858
00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:19.460
<v Speaker 1>it's playing out in front of me like not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even two seconds after I've got the text</v>

859
00:40:19.461 --> 00:40:20.870
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching this thing.</v>

860
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:21.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

861
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to you recently talk</v>

862
00:40:24.801 --> 00:40:29.801
<v Speaker 3>about how you don't think that the human</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain is really like can really knows</v>

863
00:40:30.141 --> 00:40:34.770
<v Speaker 3>how to process celebrity and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 3>we end up putting the Kardashians.</v>

864
00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.590
<v Speaker 3>Stop me if I'm putting words in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth,</v>

865
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:41.030
<v Speaker 3>but like that's why we end up putting</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kardashians on a pedestal or something</v>

866
00:40:41.031 --> 00:40:46.031
<v Speaker 3>because we are biological or biological</v>
<v Speaker 3>historically wired to follow achievement</v>

867
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:50.330
<v Speaker 3>and success and strength and things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

868
00:40:50.331 --> 00:40:54.010
<v Speaker 3>but then you take people and put them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV and turn them into idle,</v>

869
00:40:54.011 --> 00:40:55.400
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like that.</v>

870
00:40:55.401 --> 00:40:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Then our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

871
00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.220
<v Speaker 3>our lizard brain goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

872
00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:00.110
<v Speaker 3>you're someone who has achieved</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

873
00:41:00.111 --> 00:41:03.530
<v Speaker 3>I should follow you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kinda thinking by the same token,</v>

874
00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:07.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that the human brain knows</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to deal with technology information,</v>

875
00:41:07.221 --> 00:41:09.500
<v Speaker 3>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that because it's like</v>

876
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.930
<v Speaker 3>someone can say something shitty on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet and I don't get that bummed out</v>

877
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 3>by Internet comments anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a time where it's like</v>

878
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.720
<v Speaker 3>some something someone says something</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty.</v>

879
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.250
<v Speaker 3>My brain doesn't know how to regard that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know how to put that,</v>

880
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.890
<v Speaker 3>how to prioritize that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to see that in perspective.</v>

881
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.180
<v Speaker 3>It just feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

882
00:41:31.181 --> 00:41:33.320
<v Speaker 3>someone close to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is St something Shitty as opposed to</v>

883
00:41:33.321 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is</v>

884
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.670
<v Speaker 1>one comment in a sea of comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

885
00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also one person who you ordinarily</v>

886
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be in contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't want to hang out with them.</v>

887
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:48.050
<v Speaker 1>You didn't like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to start judging you,</v>

888
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:53.051
<v Speaker 1>but that's also the flip side of it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you can do with your podcast is</v>

889
00:41:54.861 --> 00:41:56.600
<v Speaker 1>reached people that you would never</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact,</v>

890
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.470
<v Speaker 1>reach the world and so you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have people reach back.</v>

891
00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what some people like about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

892
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I the ability to comment on something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody that's not valid at all,</v>

893
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.960
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to get criticisms that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just not valid.</v>

894
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:12.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I and I should say like that level</v>

895
00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:17.141
<v Speaker 1>of connection and that interaction is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think the best part of it and there is</v>

896
00:42:17.361 --> 00:42:19.760
<v Speaker 1>just this sort of dark side that comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that of like,</v>

897
00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hear some shit you wish</v>

898
00:42:21.381 --> 00:42:22.214
<v Speaker 1>you hadn't heard.</v>

899
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

900
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:26.810
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

901
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.180
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Kardashians,</v>

902
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:31.220
<v Speaker 1>that was something that Neil degrasse</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyson,</v>

903
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:34.550
<v Speaker 1>just instagram the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a conversation that he and I</v>

904
00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:39.320
<v Speaker 1>had when I did his podcast and I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>firmly believe that,</v>

905
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 1>that there's something about pointing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera at someone and putting them on a</v>

906
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 1>screen that you look at them and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>hijacks your reward system,</v>

907
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:52.670
<v Speaker 1>the reward system that's designed to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's like some,</v>

908
00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother of this tribe and she's been</v>

909
00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 1>alive for a long time and she has all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wisdom and so when she talks in</v>

910
00:43:00.261 --> 00:43:02.360
<v Speaker 1>front of the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's sits down and listens.</v>

911
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Why they listened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

912
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.990
<v Speaker 1>because she survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's achieved.</v>

913
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 1>She's someone who you have to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to because she knows things</v>

914
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she knows things.</v>

915
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So when she starts talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen.</v>

916
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:17.510
<v Speaker 1>That can all be hijacked by a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality TV show camera on Bravo.</v>

917
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:19.040
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real housewives.</v>

918
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Some pilled up bitch screaming at her</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and you know,</v>

919
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:27.290
<v Speaker 1>like we pay attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a friend of mine was at the,</v>

920
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:29.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the people from that real</v>

921
00:43:29.541 --> 00:43:33.200
<v Speaker 1>housewives show has this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a restaurant.</v>

922
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Is it sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And does it have to do with vanderpump</v>

923
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:38.000
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've recently become obsessed with</v>

924
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.490
<v Speaker 1>that lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fucking nuts at vanderbilt are all</v>

925
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:42.020
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking so crazy.</v>

926
00:43:42.021 --> 00:43:44.180
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when my friend was at the restaurant,</v>

927
00:43:44.181 --> 00:43:49.181
<v Speaker 1>she said that that lady walked in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people started losing their shit is</v>

928
00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.121
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's here.</v>

929
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>She's by why they're at the restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

930
00:43:51.981 --> 00:43:52.610
<v Speaker 1>See here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

931
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they were freaking out.</v>

932
00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.220
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't believe it.</v>

933
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.230
<v Speaker 1>They were getting their phones out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking up at her.</v>

934
00:43:57.231 --> 00:44:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an incredibly</v>

935
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.220
<v Speaker 1>unexceptional person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

936
00:44:04.221 --> 00:44:06.470
<v Speaker 1>she's just nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She holds her.</v>

937
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.960
<v Speaker 1>She talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got restaurants.</v>

938
00:44:08.961 --> 00:44:10.460
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're,</v>

939
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.070
<v Speaker 1>when you listening to her talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that makes you like</v>

940
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.230
<v Speaker 1>compelled to listen to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

941
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:19.190
<v Speaker 1>like really fascinating words coming out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her mouth.</v>

942
00:44:19.191 --> 00:44:22.010
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have any skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not an artist.</v>

943
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.660
<v Speaker 1>She's a singer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not.</v>

944
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.040
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

945
00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:28.760
<v Speaker 1>and then you get to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll sometimes I sort of get stuck in</v>

946
00:44:28.761 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 1>this eddy of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

947
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 1>what this</v>

948
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 2>person has created is a very watchable</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality show.</v>

949
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of content,</v>

950
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Kris Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what she's created,</v>

951
00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.960
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

952
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Is that art?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

953
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:44.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

954
00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love assholes.</v>

955
00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:50.150
<v Speaker 1>People love watching assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love people screaming at each other.</v>

956
00:44:50.151 --> 00:44:53.540
<v Speaker 1>We love people sniping at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love people doing shitty things to</v>

957
00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:56.630
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we love scenes that last 10 seconds,</v>

958
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:57.770
<v Speaker 1>10 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

959
00:44:57.771 --> 00:44:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Cut the next 10 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

960
00:44:59.391 --> 00:45:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Cut to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening now?</v>

961
00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:01.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening now?</v>

962
00:45:01.521 --> 00:45:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Like they know the exact amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they've got an</v>

963
00:45:04.071 --> 00:45:06.560
<v Speaker 1>algorithm like when to change the camera</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

964
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:08.480
<v Speaker 1>When or when to change the angle.</v>

965
00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to guess you have not ever</v>

966
00:45:11.051 --> 00:45:12.400
<v Speaker 2>seen vanderpump rules?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

967
00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I have recently become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

968
00:45:15.011 --> 00:45:17.390
<v Speaker 2>sort of addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

969
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.420
<v Speaker 2>and at the beginning my husband would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

970
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:21.430
<v Speaker 2>so what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd wander in like,</v>

971
00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:22.510
<v Speaker 2>what's going on now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

972
00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like watching the screen saver I</v>

973
00:45:26.831 --> 00:45:31.060
<v Speaker 2>had in college was just fractals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just watching beautiful Tan people</v>

974
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:33.130
<v Speaker 2>yell at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mesmerizing.</v>

975
00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:35.620
<v Speaker 2>And it kind of is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it calms me down,</v>

976
00:45:35.621 --> 00:45:37.630
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really paying attention.</v>

977
00:45:37.631 --> 00:45:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm just observing.</v>

978
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch the beverly hills</v>

979
00:45:41.121 --> 00:45:44.390
<v Speaker 1>housewife show just to get upset when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see these pilled up,</v>

980
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:47.100
<v Speaker 1>ladies yell at each other and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear the bathroom and then they</v>

981
00:45:47.101 --> 00:45:48.620
<v Speaker 1>would go to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's on pills,</v>

982
00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.040
<v Speaker 1>bitch at each other and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

983
00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:53.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

984
00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.970
<v Speaker 1>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would try to hurt each other's</v>

985
00:45:55.971 --> 00:45:58.550
<v Speaker 1>feelings on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like so obvious.</v>

986
00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

987
00:45:59.200 --> 00:45:59.681
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

988
00:45:59.681 --> 00:46:04.310
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing is that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically with what,</v>

989
00:46:04.311 --> 00:46:08.500
<v Speaker 2>with all of those shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can feel the producer slightly off</v>

990
00:46:08.501 --> 00:46:12.760
<v Speaker 2>camera feeding them lines and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like there's this drama that in</v>

991
00:46:12.761 --> 00:46:14.980
<v Speaker 2>real life wouldn't like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

992
00:46:14.981 --> 00:46:17.020
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you really that upset about that?</v>

993
00:46:17.021 --> 00:46:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Because suddenly six people are upset</v>
<v Speaker 2>about something that seems like not a</v>

994
00:46:20.621 --> 00:46:22.150
<v Speaker 2>big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like that was,</v>

995
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:24.850
<v Speaker 2>that existed on paper before they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>those scenes.</v>

996
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more importantly,</v>

997
00:46:26.171 --> 00:46:28.870
<v Speaker 1>your entertainment has been observing</v>
<v Speaker 1>fools.</v>

998
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Like you've put fools on for half an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour on television.</v>

999
00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And that now becomes what focuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were your mind focuses on instead</v>

1000
00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:40.960
<v Speaker 1>of something really truly interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and enlightening or something</v>

1001
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:44.440
<v Speaker 1>entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're watching fools reluctantly</v>

1002
00:46:44.441 --> 00:46:46.870
<v Speaker 1>with this like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty feeling like,</v>

1003
00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:48.250
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more one.</v>

1004
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:52.270
<v Speaker 1>And then you realize like these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you would never want to hang</v>

1005
00:46:52.271 --> 00:46:55.780
<v Speaker 1>out with in real life and here on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

1006
00:46:55.781 --> 00:46:59.230
<v Speaker 1>But I hear what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if what's weird is if that was a</v>

1007
00:46:59.231 --> 00:47:00.880
<v Speaker 1>drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a drama.</v>

1008
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:03.160
<v Speaker 1>It was a show and it was all completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>made up.</v>

1009
00:47:03.161 --> 00:47:05.740
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be nearly as interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the narratives are really</v>

1010
00:47:05.741 --> 00:47:07.960
<v Speaker 1>boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're going to go get shoes.</v>

1011
00:47:07.961 --> 00:47:10.630
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go down this journey</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and Debbie needs to.</v>

1012
00:47:10.631 --> 00:47:13.240
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't think she needs shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling her she needs fucking</v>

1013
00:47:13.241 --> 00:47:13.820
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>

1014
00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Accumulation chosen those shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not wear those shoes,</v>

1015
00:47:17.631 --> 00:47:18.810
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to tell her that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1016
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.670
<v Speaker 1>there's one girl who just says what's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>her mind.</v>

1017
00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:23.950
<v Speaker 1>She people think she's a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she just keeps it real.</v>

1018
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.890
<v Speaker 1>She keeps it real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She speaks her mind.</v>

1019
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep it real.</v>

1020
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Keep it real and know you have these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says what everyone else is afraid to</v>

1021
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 1>say except for the six other people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are also saying that we all think it,</v>

1022
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:38.560
<v Speaker 1>but we won't say it and she's the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says it should go right in your</v>

1023
00:47:38.561 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't care.</v>

1024
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:44.890
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't care and Stephanie for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know a couple of those people in</v>

1025
00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 1>real life like from the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from real housewives of Beverly Hills</v>

1026
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 1>and they're really sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really depressed and really sad and the</v>

1027
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 1>blowback from being on that show is</v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocious.</v>

1028
00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Like their social media blowback that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they read the comments and there they</v>

1029
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:03.100
<v Speaker 1>get devastated.</v>

1030
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when Kelsey grammer's</v>

1031
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:06.790
<v Speaker 1>wife was on that show for one fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>season?</v>

1032
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 1>And she tried to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like some.</v>

1033
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.030
<v Speaker 1>She tried to really play it up like she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fucking,</v>

1034
00:48:12.031 --> 00:48:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't wave the tsunami of hate.</v>

1035
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that kind of happens from what</v>

1036
00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:21.750
<v Speaker 1>you're saying about like we're watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>fools is you're nine.</v>

1037
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:26.790
<v Speaker 1>You're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching a great piece of art or</v>

1038
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:28.121
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1039
00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:33.121
<v Speaker 1>we're watching you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watch it with this idea that you're</v>

1040
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:35.350
<v Speaker 1>somehow better than the people you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>

1041
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's like they become</v>
<v Speaker 1>punching bags and that must suck.</v>

1042
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got.</v>

1043
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:45.220
<v Speaker 1>It has to suck because we'll Kelsey</v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar of course and her or getting a</v>

1044
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:49.180
<v Speaker 1>divorce and before they got a divorce</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got on the show and when she got on</v>

1045
00:48:49.181 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 1>the show it was like really weird stuff.</v>

1046
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Like she was hanging out with like</v>
<v Speaker 1>actors and hopping on the motorcycle</v>

1047
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:56.810
<v Speaker 1>with them and he's my friend and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive a good looking guy,</v>

1048
00:48:56.811 --> 00:49:00.340
<v Speaker 1>a fucking great hair and Kelsey</v>
<v Speaker 1>grammer's fat and gross and she's riding</v>

1049
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:01.690
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's Kinda hot and she used to be in</v>

1050
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:03.460
<v Speaker 1>playboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole thing was like,</v>

1051
00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:08.461
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she just had this crazy fucking</v>

1052
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:12.070
<v Speaker 1>shitty attitude and was flaunting it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of all these people's face.</v>

1053
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.400
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is I had met her before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and she wasn't really like that at</v>

1054
00:49:15.401 --> 00:49:17.440
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was her reality show.</v>

1055
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.590
<v Speaker 1>It's this thing they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like they have to like play it</v>

1056
00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I met her.</v>

1057
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I saw her at a party in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Shell,</v>

1058
00:49:25.461 --> 00:49:29.380
<v Speaker 1>like when the hate was coming down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she looked like the weight of the</v>

1059
00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:32.000
<v Speaker 1>fucking world was weighing on her like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was walking,</v>

1060
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:33.550
<v Speaker 1>because so many people hated her.</v>

1061
00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:34.870
<v Speaker 1>And then she got off the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1062
00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:37.390
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she was very smart in that way.</v>

1063
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.240
<v Speaker 1>But Kelsey grammer had some interview</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he did.</v>

1064
00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:44.110
<v Speaker 1>He said that's what she always wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I gave her what she wanted and I knew</v>

1065
00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:47.920
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't even really want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she always said she always wanted</v>

1066
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:50.650
<v Speaker 1>because that was the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she had this little video that you</v>

1067
00:49:50.651 --> 00:49:52.600
<v Speaker 1>did at the beginning of the show and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of his,</v>

1068
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1069
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been in Kelsey's shadow,</v>

1070
00:49:55.631 --> 00:49:59.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's time for me to step out of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those shows.</v>

1071
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 1>The world know who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting my star shine.</v>

1072
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those things.</v>

1073
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:10.140
<v Speaker 1>And the fucking just the green monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hate that descended upon her.</v>

1074
00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.640
<v Speaker 1>You could feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know a couple of those people that</v>

1075
00:50:15.641 --> 00:50:20.641
<v Speaker 1>are on that show and that overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative message that you put out by</v>

1076
00:50:21.881 --> 00:50:26.380
<v Speaker 1>being that person and the response to</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people hating you,</v>

1077
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>like literally millions of people</v>

1078
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.950
<v Speaker 4>saying you're a dumb cunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's devastating.</v>

1079
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:36.040
<v Speaker 4>It's devastating because the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>directly respond to whatever message</v>

1080
00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 4>that you're putting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that message is compelling that that</v>

1081
00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:43.910
<v Speaker 4>fucking Beverly Hills housewives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitchy message.</v>

1082
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to personify that low petty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>craven bitchiness that probably exists</v>

1083
00:50:53.321 --> 00:50:55.840
<v Speaker 3>in all human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the embodiment of it.</v>

1084
00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:00.660
<v Speaker 3>You think that that like in terms of put</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you put out in the universities,</v>

1085
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:01.780
<v Speaker 3>brings it back to them.</v>

1086
00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a distraction</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously.</v>

1087
00:51:03.581 --> 00:51:04.900
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those shows are a distraction.</v>

1088
00:51:04.901 --> 00:51:06.880
<v Speaker 4>Like all shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could say that about great</v>

1089
00:51:06.881 --> 00:51:08.590
<v Speaker 4>shows like game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a distraction.</v>

1090
00:51:08.591 --> 00:51:10.600
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately it's entertaining and what</v>
<v Speaker 4>does entertaining.</v>

1091
00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:13.180
<v Speaker 4>You're sitting there and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretending these things are happening</v>

1092
00:51:13.181 --> 00:51:16.720
<v Speaker 4>and you get to just go off with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to go.</v>

1093
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:21.190
<v Speaker 4>But there's something different about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that Tyrian lannister isn't</v>

1094
00:51:21.191 --> 00:51:24.220
<v Speaker 4>really Tyrian lannister when you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people,</v>

1095
00:51:24.221 --> 00:51:28.120
<v Speaker 4>this is them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is their actual face is their</v>

1096
00:51:28.121 --> 00:51:29.050
<v Speaker 4>clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

1097
00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:31.090
<v Speaker 4>this is them talking to these other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1098
00:51:31.091 --> 00:51:35.230
<v Speaker 4>There's cameras on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's this bizarre distortion of what</v>

1099
00:51:35.231 --> 00:51:36.580
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is reality.</v>

1100
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:40.480
<v Speaker 4>And also it's been real clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a formula that's been</v>

1101
00:51:40.481 --> 00:51:43.510
<v Speaker 4>established where if you can be the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch on the show that makes a lot of</v>

1102
00:51:43.511 --> 00:51:45.010
<v Speaker 4>noise and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>

1103
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:47.110
<v Speaker 4>you could keep it real and speak your</v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

1104
00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:50.350
<v Speaker 4>That girl gets a lot of potentials.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get a daytime talk show.</v>

1105
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.670
<v Speaker 4>And when that girl gets a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>attention,</v>

1106
00:51:51.671 --> 00:51:53.530
<v Speaker 4>they keep the camera on her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they keep the camera on her,</v>

1107
00:51:53.531 --> 00:51:55.840
<v Speaker 4>the other girls go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fucking bitches get all this camera</v>

1108
00:51:55.841 --> 00:51:57.910
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I know a couple of those girls that</v>

1109
00:51:57.911 --> 00:52:00.390
<v Speaker 4>are outside of it and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll bitch that the,</v>

1110
00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:01.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1111
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:02.320
<v Speaker 4>brandy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and that,</v>

1112
00:52:02.321 --> 00:52:04.210
<v Speaker 4>and now that's why they're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying attention to her.</v>

1113
00:52:04.211 --> 00:52:05.680
<v Speaker 4>But that fucking bitch and blah blah</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

1114
00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.870
<v Speaker 4>So they get the ramp it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll ramp up there like,</v>

1115
00:52:08.871 --> 00:52:12.400
<v Speaker 4>like I've decided that this season I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be more bitchy or I'm this</v>

1116
00:52:12.401 --> 00:52:13.090
<v Speaker 4>season,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna,</v>

1117
00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:15.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be more forceful because</v>

1118
00:52:15.041 --> 00:52:15.970
<v Speaker 4>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've sat back,</v>

1119
00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:18.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna let them edit me because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they edit me,</v>

1120
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:18.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what they're doing.</v>

1121
00:52:18.911 --> 00:52:21.010
<v Speaker 4>So what I'm gonna do is I'm not going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>give them anything to edit everything</v>

1122
00:52:21.011 --> 00:52:22.510
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fucking hit him like this.</v>

1123
00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:26.290
<v Speaker 4>This is how I feel on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He get caught up in this whole wave of</v>

1124
00:52:26.291 --> 00:52:27.124
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

1125
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.850
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If trying to manipulate the</v>

1126
00:52:28.851 --> 00:52:29.720
<v Speaker 3>manipulators.</v>

1127
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you see it in their faces.</v>

1128
00:52:31.591 --> 00:52:33.720
<v Speaker 4>They're just popping pills and drink it</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time and,</v>

1129
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.700
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1130
00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:39.510
<v Speaker 4>dealing with what they asked for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted this fame and so they get</v>

1131
00:52:39.511 --> 00:52:41.600
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then the also get</v>

1132
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:45.090
<v Speaker 3>the hate part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen,</v>

1133
00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of famous people in general?</v>

1134
00:52:49.621 --> 00:52:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen anyone enjoy fame?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I feel like my,</v>

1135
00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.620
<v Speaker 3>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I've seen it become,</v>

1136
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a thing that people have to learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>to manage,</v>

1137
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:00.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never what they thought it was</v>

1138
00:53:00.931 --> 00:53:01.764
<v Speaker 3>going to be.</v>

1139
00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.430
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Hart doesn't seem to have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem with it.</v>

1140
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:07.120
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Harts and interesting guy because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is a super positive,</v>

1141
00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.890
<v Speaker 4>super positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super motivated.</v>

1142
00:53:08.891 --> 00:53:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Even people shit on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't shit on them back.</v>

1143
00:53:11.261 --> 00:53:14.380
<v Speaker 4>Like he'll goof around with some comics</v>
<v Speaker 4>that will go after him.</v>

1144
00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.660
<v Speaker 4>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll mock them and make fun of them.</v>

1145
00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.090
<v Speaker 4>But he's always laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1146
00:53:19.091 --> 00:53:21.610
<v Speaker 4>he's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

1147
00:53:21.611 --> 00:53:25.170
<v Speaker 4>really ambitious guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think like his level of like what</v>

1148
00:53:25.171 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 4>he's looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this</v>

1149
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.560
<v Speaker 1>is just part of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just keeps going.</v>

1150
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I keep wanting to be like an oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be a mogul,</v>

1151
00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1152
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.000
<v Speaker 1>his goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He seems to be handling it better</v>

1153
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 1>than anybody I've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for most people,</v>

1154
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.950
<v Speaker 1>I think we all agree like we've had</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations about it.</v>

1155
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a conversation about it with a</v>

1156
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.840
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one thing that everybody seems to</v>

1157
00:53:45.841 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 1>agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to ever get as famous</v>

1158
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:50.640
<v Speaker 1>as Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a level of fame you don't</v>

1159
00:53:50.641 --> 00:53:52.140
<v Speaker 1>want to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be Brad Pitt.</v>

1160
00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Like a buddy of mine is friends with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Depp and he says,</v>

1161
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Depp can't go anywhere like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hangs out with them.</v>

1162
00:53:59.221 --> 00:54:01.710
<v Speaker 1>There's these guys with earpieces that</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow them everywhere.</v>

1163
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And they were in London staying at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Depp's house and he went to step</v>

1164
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:08.580
<v Speaker 1>outside to go get some cigarettes and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>walks outside and there's these guys</v>

1165
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.080
<v Speaker 1>standing there with earpieces on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you need a ride?</v>

1166
00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you need to take you anywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1167
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 1>this guy can't go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to a restaurant that he goes to</v>

1168
00:54:16.351 --> 00:54:19.110
<v Speaker 1>a restaurant and they swarm on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They swarm on him.</v>

1169
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Whereas some people can go to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and they can look over there,</v>

1170
00:54:22.231 --> 00:54:22.471
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1171
00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:26.050
<v Speaker 1>that's doug stanhope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look overall that's ron white and it's</v>

1172
00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.410
<v Speaker 1>they're famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>

1173
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not a crazy thing to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example.</v>

1174
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Me and Kevin James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're filming a movie.</v>

1175
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:39.090
<v Speaker 1>We were in Boston and we were hanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in his hotel and we're,</v>

1176
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:44.130
<v Speaker 1>we're joking around and laughing and out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the window looking in front of this</v>

1177
00:54:44.401 --> 00:54:49.401
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise was at this restaurant and we</v>

1178
00:54:49.441 --> 00:54:51.330
<v Speaker 1>looked out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw Tom Cruise,</v>

1179
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 1>we see people taking pictures of Tom</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruise and then we see people on the</v>

1180
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:59.460
<v Speaker 1>street running towards the restaurant of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking running,</v>

1181
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:03.180
<v Speaker 1>like running because they heard that Tom</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruise there and we're watching this and</v>

1182
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:04.430
<v Speaker 1>you know the glasses right here.</v>

1183
00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:07.710
<v Speaker 1>We're pressing up against the grass</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass so we can look at an angle and I</v>

1184
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:09.240
<v Speaker 1>stopped and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how crazy is I go?</v>

1185
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Here you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a movie star and you're like</v>

1186
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:18.200
<v Speaker 1>craning your neck to try to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>glimpse at Tom Cruise on the street at a</v>

1187
00:55:18.871 --> 00:55:22.530
<v Speaker 1>restaurant across the street from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't queens right there.</v>

1188
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.780
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's that famous,</v>

1189
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:29.760
<v Speaker 1>that famous people freak out when he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>around like he's way too famous.</v>

1190
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:33.450
<v Speaker 1>He's hit some weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre level.</v>

1191
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also weird that people do that and</v>

1192
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.500
<v Speaker 1>not saying I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them was,</v>

1193
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:47.070
<v Speaker 1>do you want to be in movies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean you want to be.</v>

1194
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:49.770
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be a superstar and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be in those gigantic</v>

1195
00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 1>blockbusters that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can happen.</v>

1196
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen to a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for every Samuel Jackson,</v>

1197
00:55:55.651 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 1>there's 100 dudes who try to be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for every.</v>

1198
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.640
<v Speaker 1>But for Tom Cruise like that is like as</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous as a person fucking gets in</v>

1199
00:56:02.641 --> 00:56:05.370
<v Speaker 1>America at least there's no more famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>person than that guy.</v>

1200
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 1>So when you see that it's compelling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of strange way.</v>

1201
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Even for a movie star like Kevin James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking famous guy.</v>

1202
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:16.290
<v Speaker 1>He's filming a movie starring in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

1203
00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:18.360
<v Speaker 1>looking out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't believe you can Tom Cruise.</v>

1204
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It's weird celebrity in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like currency</v>

1205
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 3>and I don't mean for the person who is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the celebrity.</v>

1206
00:56:26.831 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean for the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the the person who you're like,</v>

1207
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 3>I am seeing something that most people</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get to see.</v>

1208
00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Most people only see in terms of most</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's relationship with Tom Cruise.</v>

1209
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:40.360
<v Speaker 3>You see cocktail on top gun and all his</v>
<v Speaker 3>most recent films that I'm not naming</v>

1210
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:41.840
<v Speaker 3>because I don't know them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1211
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:44.650
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here you are.</v>

1212
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Just seeing him at a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's something that most people</v>

1213
00:56:46.781 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 3>don't get to see the rarity or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>scarcity of it.</v>

1214
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:52.061
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1215
00:56:52.061 --> 00:56:54.760
<v Speaker 3>what else I was thinking in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it does to our brain.</v>

1216
00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:58.210
<v Speaker 3>When you see someone's face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a huge.</v>

1217
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.871
<v Speaker 3>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1218
00:56:58.871 --> 00:57:02.200
<v Speaker 3>when you're sitting in a darkened</v>
<v Speaker 3>theater and someone's fake faces 50,</v>

1219
00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:07.120
<v Speaker 3>50 feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of replicates the way your</v>

1220
00:57:07.121 --> 00:57:10.510
<v Speaker 3>parents and all adults appear to you</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're a baby.</v>

1221
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a baby or just sitting there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's these faces.</v>

1222
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:16.310
<v Speaker 3>They're huge and they show up and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>are over you and then they're gone.</v>

1223
00:57:16.311 --> 00:57:17.144
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know,</v>

1224
00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:20.540
<v Speaker 4>do you know that that's what a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist believe,</v>

1225
00:57:20.541 --> 00:57:23.060
<v Speaker 4>or the origins of alien abduction</v>
<v Speaker 4>memories.</v>

1226
00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:27.650
<v Speaker 4>I did not know that they believed the</v>
<v Speaker 4>origins of alien abduction memories have</v>

1227
00:57:27.651 --> 00:57:31.940
<v Speaker 4>to do with birth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why that clinical strange</v>

1228
00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.150
<v Speaker 4>setting of being pulled out of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>mother's womb,</v>

1229
00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:40.330
<v Speaker 4>of seeing the light of those in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>really white sterile environment that</v>

1230
00:57:40.881 --> 00:57:45.881
<v Speaker 4>seems cold and harsh and the people with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the masks on surgical masks and big eyes</v>

1231
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:51.700
<v Speaker 4>that you see these things and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>become iconic in your head and you,</v>

1232
00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:55.700
<v Speaker 4>you think of them in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not in terms of like a person with a</v>

1233
00:57:55.701 --> 00:57:59.690
<v Speaker 4>mask on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in terms of this like very strange</v>

1234
00:57:59.691 --> 00:58:03.500
<v Speaker 4>distortion of reality and these are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first images that a person has.</v>

1235
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:07.160
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A human brain when they're a baby is</v>

1236
00:58:07.161 --> 00:58:08.360
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very tiny,</v>

1237
00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:13.361
<v Speaker 4>but obviously it's still a human brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we don't really know how much</v>

1238
00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:18.700
<v Speaker 4>data they store in terms of memories</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we don't have a context.</v>

1239
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Like they can't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't mean people.</v>

1240
00:58:22.011 --> 00:58:25.250
<v Speaker 4>Some people will claim that they have</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain memories from early childhood</v>

1241
00:58:25.251 --> 00:58:26.840
<v Speaker 4>and they might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be correct,</v>

1242
00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:32.140
<v Speaker 4>but it also might be some sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A rehashing of memories to the point</v>

1243
00:58:32.601 --> 00:58:34.420
<v Speaker 4>where it's not really a memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just for a minute,</v>

1244
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:37.880
<v Speaker 4>you've heard what's a memory?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's remembering how to describe a</v>

1245
00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:41.690
<v Speaker 4>memory you once had like the memory</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself probably doesn't exist anymore.</v>

1246
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.890
<v Speaker 4>You have a memory of how you told the</v>
<v Speaker 4>memory and that like really sort of</v>

1247
00:58:45.891 --> 00:58:50.150
<v Speaker 4>distorts it too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it think of like visually you've</v>

1248
00:58:50.151 --> 00:58:53.630
<v Speaker 4>never seen anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've been in a womb and then all of a</v>

1249
00:58:53.631 --> 00:58:57.440
<v Speaker 4>sudden you get pulled out and you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulled out by a guy with a fucking giant</v>

1250
00:58:57.441 --> 00:59:01.880
<v Speaker 4>light behind him and he's got a mask on</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's looking at you and you pull it</v>

1251
00:59:01.881 --> 00:59:02.000
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1252
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000
<v Speaker 4>You see his eyes and his face and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they believed that gets distorted</v>

1253
00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:12.880
<v Speaker 4>into this iconic giant head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black giant eyes and the the cold sort</v>

1254
00:59:13.911 --> 00:59:18.080
<v Speaker 4>of clinicals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antiseptic room,</v>

1255
00:59:18.081 --> 00:59:23.000
<v Speaker 4>this white room with the light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why everyone has these abduction</v>

1256
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 4>scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all deal with medical exams that</v>

1257
00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:29.420
<v Speaker 4>are pretty preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1258
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:33.890
<v Speaker 4>they're always going up your butt with</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and I think that's right where the</v>

1259
00:59:33.891 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 4>aliens go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1260
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:38.110
<v Speaker 4>I think that has to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's vulnerability because like</v>

1261
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.500
<v Speaker 4>you think about your button like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1262
00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:40.330
<v Speaker 4>get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1263
00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:41.990
<v Speaker 4>like everybody thinks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1264
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:47.020
<v Speaker 4>so I think that's the one thing you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrified of if the aliens had ultimate</v>

1265
00:59:47.331 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 4>control over you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you couldn't move your body and they</v>

1266
00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:50.061
<v Speaker 4>take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are they gonna do?</v>

1267
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:51.240
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna talk to my body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1268
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 4>it's going to go inside my body are</v>
<v Speaker 4>going into my,</v>

1269
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1270
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 4>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that really makes a lot of</v>

1271
00:59:58.191 --> 00:59:59.170
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

1272
00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 4>I'd never heard that before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's really interesting.</v>

1273
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.290
<v Speaker 4>That does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1274
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 4>How good your eyes work and then when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you come out of your mother not that.</v>

1275
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 4>Well now everything's hazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's hazy and weird in the</v>

1276
01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 4>light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

1277
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:17.360
<v Speaker 4>you've never seen light before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so seeing this extreme light as powerful</v>

1278
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 4>light source because everything has to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be really bright so you could really get</v>

1279
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:22.460
<v Speaker 4>a good look at everything and make sure</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're stitching up the badge.</v>

1280
01:00:22.461 --> 01:00:23.410
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1281
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 4>And getting in there and looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>baby and making sure everything's in</v>

1282
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.510
<v Speaker 4>place and then putting that baby in an</v>
<v Speaker 4>incubator like whoa.</v>

1283
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.220
<v Speaker 4>If you're a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some oftentimes circumcising,</v>

1284
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.090
<v Speaker 4>they don't do it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I guess they wait a few days,</v>

1285
01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.140
<v Speaker 4>still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1286
01:00:39.141 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 4>I get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get text messages or tweets all the</v>

1287
01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 4>time from people that support my stance</v>
<v Speaker 4>on circumcision.</v>

1288
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.610
<v Speaker 4>I think it's barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>

1289
01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.910
<v Speaker 4>It's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1290
01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:53.660
<v Speaker 4>The idea that people necessary nowadays</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred percent.</v>

1291
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:56.800
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this nonsense that it somehow or</v>

1292
01:00:56.801 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 4>another prevents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1293
01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:00.320
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no data.</v>

1294
01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:02.510
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go look at the actual studies</v>

1295
01:01:02.511 --> 01:01:05.330
<v Speaker 4>that try to back it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll talk about it in third world</v>

1296
01:01:05.331 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 4>countries like there's still no data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't tell me that you all couldn't</v>

1297
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 4>be the same exact result.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't be cleaning your Dick.</v>

1298
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:15.500
<v Speaker 4>How about just clean your deck and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll cut a baby's deck.</v>

1299
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:20.480
<v Speaker 4>I know because the amount of pain that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that maybe must feel,</v>

1300
01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:22.070
<v Speaker 4>oh well it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also,</v>

1301
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.030
<v Speaker 4>it's traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're taking away like a</v>

1302
01:01:26.031 --> 01:01:28.520
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of the child's freedom</v>
<v Speaker 4>and decision making,</v>

1303
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:32.270
<v Speaker 4>like really early on and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're cutting them there.</v>

1304
01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:33.350
<v Speaker 4>Cut It for no reason.</v>

1305
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.750
<v Speaker 4>Just screaming that in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of babies lose their decks.</v>

1306
01:01:35.751 --> 01:01:38.120
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super Common Infections,</v>

1307
01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:40.550
<v Speaker 4>really common babies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>babies die from it.</v>

1308
01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not like one has ever died</v>
<v Speaker 4>from it.</v>

1309
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.920
<v Speaker 4>A bunch died and there's a real problem</v>
<v Speaker 4>with traditional Jewish methods because</v>

1310
01:01:47.931 --> 01:01:52.040
<v Speaker 4>the moyal actual actually sucks on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>penis.</v>

1311
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:54.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making any of this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying it's,</v>

1312
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:59.210
<v Speaker 4>it's disgusting and they transfer herpes</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the baby sometimes and the babies die</v>

1313
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.950
<v Speaker 4>and it's not just one but many babies</v>
<v Speaker 4>have died from getting herpes from a</v>

1314
01:02:03.951 --> 01:02:07.880
<v Speaker 4>rabbi sucking on the baby's penis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1315
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:13.130
<v Speaker 4>I was watching this youtube video wants</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this guy defending this practice and</v>

1316
01:02:13.131 --> 01:02:13.964
<v Speaker 4>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1317
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.890
<v Speaker 4>an old rabbi and it was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

1318
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:18.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in the faith and if you believe in</v>

1319
01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:22.180
<v Speaker 4>God and God came up with it the right</v>
<v Speaker 4>way and this is</v>

1320
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:25.840
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand the link between</v>

1321
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.960
<v Speaker 2>cutting a piece of for skin or cutting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the forest skin and God like I don't.</v>

1322
01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:37.990
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not religious person in general,</v>

1323
01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.570
<v Speaker 2>so these things often don't link up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my head,</v>

1324
01:02:40.571 --> 01:02:42.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's like how I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get it.</v>

1325
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:44.380
<v Speaker 2>How does that have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>God?</v>

1326
01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:46.720
<v Speaker 4>It's an ancient shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's back when people were stupid as</v>

1327
01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:48.010
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know of any data.</v>

1328
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.933
<v Speaker 4>It's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

1329
01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.820
<v Speaker 2>I want to think that we are just as</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid now as we were then.</v>

1330
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:53.960
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1331
01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:54.790
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not.</v>

1332
01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:57.140
<v Speaker 4>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not as stupid as people who live</v>

1333
01:02:57.141 --> 01:03:01.300
<v Speaker 4>in the 19 twenties watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try to watch a movie from like 1940 and</v>

1334
01:03:01.301 --> 01:03:02.980
<v Speaker 4>watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dopey people were.</v>

1335
01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.900
<v Speaker 4>It was like God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was so dumb.</v>

1336
01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:07.690
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like they didn't even know how</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be in color.</v>

1337
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:11.140
<v Speaker 4>There were sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were so strange and childlike and</v>

1338
01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:13.450
<v Speaker 4>a lot of ways like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1339
01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.540
<v Speaker 4>the other thing is people just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have the access to</v>

1340
01:03:16.541 --> 01:03:18.550
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't live as long and they didn't</v>

1341
01:03:18.551 --> 01:03:21.920
<v Speaker 4>have anybody around them that had access</v>
<v Speaker 4>to information the way they do.</v>

1342
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:26.980
<v Speaker 4>You do for every scholar and every</v>
<v Speaker 4>person who is deeply embedded in</v>

1343
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:32.050
<v Speaker 4>intellectual pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had millions and millions of people</v>

1344
01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.360
<v Speaker 4>that just didn't give a fuck and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>just trying to get by.</v>

1345
01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:35.610
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cut you off.</v>

1346
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.770
<v Speaker 2>You were saying that you were watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1347
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 2>a rabbi talk about the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumcision</v>

1348
01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:45.660
<v Speaker 4>to portions of circumcision and doing it</v>
<v Speaker 4>the traditional way where you suck on</v>

1349
01:03:45.661 --> 01:03:49.710
<v Speaker 4>the baby's penis and it was talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that there's antiseptic properties</v>

1350
01:03:49.711 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 4>and saliva and it helps stop the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bleeding.</v>

1351
01:03:53.431 --> 01:03:54.330
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

1352
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 4>you just don't cause the bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just out to stop.</v>

1353
01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 4>I was so furious watching this asshole</v>
<v Speaker 4>dress like a wizard.</v>

1354
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Talk about sucking on baby Dick's after</v>
<v Speaker 4>they caught them.</v>

1355
01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:06.420
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to beat the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them are really dead.</v>

1356
01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:07.680
<v Speaker 4>It's just like watching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1357
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:12.000
<v Speaker 4>you make me so angry with your stupid</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking that you're justifying cutting</v>

1358
01:04:12.001 --> 01:04:16.770
<v Speaker 4>a baby's deck and you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>some dumb ass old ancient bullshit there</v>

1359
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:20.110
<v Speaker 4>was written by morons who thought the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world was flat and you,</v>

1360
01:04:20.111 --> 01:04:23.010
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to continue that in 2016</v>

1361
01:04:23.011 --> 01:04:26.370
<v Speaker 4>because it's tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it makes me mad.</v>

1362
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:30.570
<v Speaker 4>It makes me really mad because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about fucking babies.</v>

1363
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:34.440
<v Speaker 4>If you're a grown adult and you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>sucked into some stupid cult that wants</v>

1364
01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:37.710
<v Speaker 4>to cut your Dick and I let that old dude</v>
<v Speaker 4>suck on it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How old are you?</v>

1366
01:04:39.271 --> 01:04:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Thirty five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good light.</v>

1367
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.180
<v Speaker 4>Don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd say don't do it,</v>

1368
01:04:42.181 --> 01:04:44.550
<v Speaker 4>but good luck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you do it to a baby,</v>

1369
01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:49.551
<v Speaker 4>it just makes me fucking furious and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>see this guy you just see in cloaking</v>

1370
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:57.110
<v Speaker 4>himself in tradition and using it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>justify these like objectively barbaric</v>

1371
01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:01.000
<v Speaker 4>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you stand back and look at it like a</v>

1372
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:02.020
<v Speaker 4>analyzing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what?</v>

1373
01:05:02.021 --> 01:05:03.140
<v Speaker 4>What benefit is there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1374
01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.980
<v Speaker 4>What are the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the risks and what's the</v>

1375
01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:08.430
<v Speaker 4>consequences on what are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You sucking on a baby's Dick Dude,</v>

1376
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.520
<v Speaker 4>you talking about sucking baby decks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1377
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.040
<v Speaker 4>How has that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How has it real?</v>

1378
01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Like how is that guy not in jail?</v>

1379
01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.370
<v Speaker 4>How does that exist in this modern</v>
<v Speaker 4>world?</v>

1380
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Imagine though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he wasn't in a religion where imagine</v>

1381
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 4>if he just liked cutting baby dixon and</v>
<v Speaker 4>sucking on them.</v>

1382
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:29.020
<v Speaker 4>You'd fucking have him killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the fact that he can do that,</v>

1383
01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:33.340
<v Speaker 4>he can be regarded as an elder and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>scholar and he's got crazy robes on and</v>

1384
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got like a like gilded gold around</v>

1385
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:38.320
<v Speaker 4>the stupid fucking outfit that he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing.</v>

1386
01:05:38.321 --> 01:05:39.550
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1387
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 4>you fool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you angry that you were circumcised,</v>

1388
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:44.670
<v Speaker 4>assuming you were?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1389
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.460
<v Speaker 4>because my deck looks perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1390
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.930
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I had a chance to do it over again,</v>

1391
01:05:49.931 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely say don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

1392
01:05:52.361 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make me angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that I can do about it,</v>

1393
01:05:55.361 --> 01:05:58.390
<v Speaker 4>but it's just a foolhardy practice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1394
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.910
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't help anybody.</v>

1395
01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.880
<v Speaker 4>It sounded like it.</v>

1396
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:05.620
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if there was like an improvement</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can make,</v>

1397
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody was born unfortunately</v>

1398
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 4>with this flap of skin on their</v>
<v Speaker 4>forehead.</v>

1399
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.420
<v Speaker 4>But if you remove that flap of skin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1400
01:06:13.421 --> 01:06:15.560
<v Speaker 4>you can read people's minds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1401
01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:17.280
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1402
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.480
<v Speaker 4>I'd take that flap of skin off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's read each other's minds.</v>

1403
01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:21.430
<v Speaker 4>It'd be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They found out a hack.</v>

1404
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:24.040
<v Speaker 4>There's like a biohack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not it.</v>

1405
01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.300
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't.</v>

1406
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.133
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1407
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:30.730
<v Speaker 4>it lessens the pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changes the way your penis feels.</v>

1408
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.320
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't know,</v>

1409
01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:35.470
<v Speaker 4>but that's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole group of people that</v>

1410
01:06:35.471 --> 01:06:38.810
<v Speaker 4>work to bring their for skin back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you do that?</v>

1411
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:44.100
<v Speaker 4>That was apparently that you stretched</v>
<v Speaker 4>the skin slowly over time until it</v>

1412
01:06:44.141 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 4>regenerates a for skin it had never had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was possible.</v>

1413
01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:48.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's about it never general</v>

1414
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:52.240
<v Speaker 4>regenerates a real force skin because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always going to be folded over and</v>

1415
01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:56.550
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reaction is that it be it</v>

1416
01:06:56.650 --> 01:07:01.650
<v Speaker 4>reignites or re whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mucus membranes.</v>

1417
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.820
<v Speaker 4>So you're the tip of your penis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry to get graphic folks.</v>

1418
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:11.950
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to have like almost like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>liquid mucusy sort of membrane over it.</v>

1419
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:13.510
<v Speaker 4>That's all dried out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1420
01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:18.100
<v Speaker 4>When dudes get circumcised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so desensitizes your penis and when your</v>

1421
01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:22.300
<v Speaker 4>penis is encased in skin and the is</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulled back,</v>

1422
01:07:22.301 --> 01:07:24.880
<v Speaker 4>it's much more sensitive and supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more pleasurable.</v>

1423
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:28.360
<v Speaker 4>Know who knows if that was a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why they started doing it in the</v>

1424
01:07:28.361 --> 01:07:31.810
<v Speaker 4>first place or if it was a hygiene issue</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time.</v>

1425
01:07:31.811 --> 01:07:33.730
<v Speaker 4>People didn't know that much about</v>
<v Speaker 4>washing.</v>

1426
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

1427
01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:37.240
<v Speaker 4>What was the initial urge?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1428
01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.650
<v Speaker 4>Mitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's under debate,</v>

1429
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.800
<v Speaker 4>but did you see the headlines yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 4>about how science has.</v>

1430
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:49.540
<v Speaker 4>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've developed this some sub second</v>

1431
01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:51.820
<v Speaker 4>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>second skin for that.</v>

1432
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:53.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

1433
01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:56.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that seems like it would actually do</v>

1434
01:07:56.321 --> 01:07:57.220
<v Speaker 4>the opposite.</v>

1435
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe if you kept it on every day.</v>

1436
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:03.090
<v Speaker 4>I guess you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if you kept it on everyday,</v>

1437
01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.980
<v Speaker 4>what the thing about that second skin</v>
<v Speaker 4>though that's interesting is that</v>

1438
01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:07.450
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think that they're going to be able</v>

1439
01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:11.500
<v Speaker 4>to use it for medication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like for people that have psoriasis or</v>

1440
01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:14.170
<v Speaker 4>Eczema,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can put medication on and then put</v>

1441
01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:17.810
<v Speaker 4>that second skin on second skin will</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually hold the medication in place.</v>

1442
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.220
<v Speaker 4>He has a second skin things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That trip I was watching,</v>

1443
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:26.750
<v Speaker 4>they did it to this old lady's face and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just sucked it back in or bags under</v>

1444
01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 4>my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like normal,</v>

1445
01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.690
<v Speaker 4>a seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's invisible.</v>

1446
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:33.410
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird line for your face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but better because you can kind of see</v>

1447
01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.900
<v Speaker 4>invisalign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to change the way people's</v>

1448
01:08:35.901 --> 01:08:38.450
<v Speaker 4>faces look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the people that did the Joan rivers</v>

1449
01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:41.270
<v Speaker 4>thing that just filled their face up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with rubber and stretched it all out</v>

1450
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.673
<v Speaker 4>there fucked.</v>

1451
01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:46.550
<v Speaker 4>They're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like all the early adopters of surgery</v>

1452
01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:49.880
<v Speaker 4>and fillers and all that craziness that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have done to their lips and</v>

1453
01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:54.970
<v Speaker 4>there's this lady that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't call her monster face to face,</v>

1454
01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:59.980
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a type of look that I call monster</v>

1455
01:09:00.111 --> 01:09:02.090
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of women have it.</v>

1456
01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:04.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that monster face thing,</v>

1457
01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.540
<v Speaker 4>what happens is they stretch their face</v>
<v Speaker 4>out so much that their mouth is way too</v>

1458
01:09:08.541 --> 01:09:11.930
<v Speaker 4>big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like their lips go way over here.</v>

1459
01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.290
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to go over here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're doing this because they're</v>

1460
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:17.840
<v Speaker 4>just pulling it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're pulling a face back so much that</v>

1461
01:09:17.841 --> 01:09:19.550
<v Speaker 4>when they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they smile and they open their</v>

1462
01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:22.130
<v Speaker 4>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start doing the FIBONACCI sequence</v>

1463
01:09:22.131 --> 01:09:24.920
<v Speaker 4>in your mind and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's wrong because there's a</v>

1464
01:09:24.921 --> 01:09:26.890
<v Speaker 4>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your nose,</v>

1465
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:31.370
<v Speaker 4>the correct size for your eyes and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>lips and your chin and your face and we</v>

1466
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:33.620
<v Speaker 4>all have like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a symmetry to it,</v>

1467
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:37.820
<v Speaker 4>a human face and there's a sequence that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fibonacci sequence you can actually</v>

1468
01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:38.660
<v Speaker 4>calculate it.</v>

1469
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.330
<v Speaker 4>FIBONACCI had to do with facial features</v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>

1470
01:09:41.331 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 4>I've heard a FIBONACCI but I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize it has to do with a lot of</v>

1471
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:48.140
<v Speaker 4>different features that exist in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like pine cones,</v>

1472
01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:51.930
<v Speaker 4>nautilus shells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard it used when I'm.</v>

1473
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:55.760
<v Speaker 4>So I used to play in a band and so when</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friends tend to recording studios and</v>

1474
01:09:55.761 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 4>I know that it was used to like figure</v>
<v Speaker 4>out acoustic nodes,</v>

1475
01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:01.700
<v Speaker 4>I think some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some pattern of sound waves.</v>

1476
01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:06.260
<v Speaker 4>Well tool did a whole song with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fibonacci sequence,</v>

1477
01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:07.283
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1478
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.180
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1479
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:13.250
<v Speaker 4>they figured out a way to incorporate</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sequence into the way the lyrics are</v>

1480
01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:15.170
<v Speaker 4>structured and the way that the beats</v>
<v Speaker 4>are structured.</v>

1481
01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:17.090
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

1482
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:21.410
<v Speaker 4>the ratio of a person's face gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>distorted with plastic surgery and it's</v>

1483
01:10:21.411 --> 01:10:24.800
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's upsetting when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see someone they've got like crazy</v>

1484
01:10:24.801 --> 01:10:26.030
<v Speaker 4>fake lips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Whoa,</v>

1485
01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:27.550
<v Speaker 4>what's going on with your lips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1486
01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.320
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or knows what is going on with her.</v>

1487
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 4>So I think that when we change things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does this jamie sequence and</v>

1488
01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.320
<v Speaker 4>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1489
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:37.971
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1490
01:10:37.971 --> 01:10:40.700
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's showing the um,</v>

1491
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.360
<v Speaker 4>the sequence as applied to the human</v>
<v Speaker 4>face,</v>

1492
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:47.810
<v Speaker 4>but it's applied to everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently.</v>

1493
01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:53.000
<v Speaker 4>But I think when you see it as pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool and see it sunflowers when you see</v>

1494
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:53.834
<v Speaker 4>it in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1495
01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:58.730
<v Speaker 4>in human faces after surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the reasons why</v>

1496
01:10:58.731 --> 01:11:02.210
<v Speaker 4>there's like an automatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like repelling response.</v>

1497
01:11:02.211 --> 01:11:04.100
<v Speaker 4>Like it pulls you back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1498
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I wonder is because I feel like I'm</v>

1499
01:11:07.461 --> 01:11:11.210
<v Speaker 4>really good at spotting plastic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wonder how many people walked by</v>

1500
01:11:11.211 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 4>and I don't like people who have good</v>
<v Speaker 4>plastic</v>

1501
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.040
<v Speaker 2>surgery where you just don't notice it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just think they're attractive.</v>

1502
01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Like that must exist.</v>

1503
01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.730
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely some subtle prostate</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery that they've done really well.</v>

1504
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:26.560
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some subtle facelifts and</v>
<v Speaker 4>some things along those lines that uh,</v>

1505
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:28.720
<v Speaker 4>another person I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know this lady,</v>

1506
01:11:28.721 --> 01:11:32.470
<v Speaker 4>she's like 60 and she looks hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty hot and she's had a gang of</v>

1507
01:11:32.471 --> 01:11:34.000
<v Speaker 4>shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe too much.</v>

1508
01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:38.320
<v Speaker 4>Like she may be like a obsesses a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit nips and tucks.</v>

1509
01:11:38.321 --> 01:11:39.820
<v Speaker 4>But you look at her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1510
01:11:39.821 --> 01:11:41.220
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's 60.</v>

1511
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.500
<v Speaker 4>Like she looks really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She but you know,</v>

1512
01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.720
<v Speaker 4>they do a little of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little desk.</v>

1513
01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 4>But then I know monster face and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1514
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:52.210
<v Speaker 4>she's got a mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a good eat a baby's head.</v>

1515
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:54.310
<v Speaker 4>Like she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she just looks like a monster.</v>

1516
01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.760
<v Speaker 4>Like her cheeks are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is she happy with how she looks at you?</v>

1517
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:59.260
<v Speaker 4>The fuck knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know her that well,</v>

1518
01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.110
<v Speaker 4>but are actually this girl stopped up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with rubber.</v>

1519
01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:06.400
<v Speaker 4>They do weird stuff where it looks like</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just had mouth surgery where their</v>

1520
01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.350
<v Speaker 4>jaws are swollen because they feel like</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much puffing out their face.</v>

1521
01:12:11.351 --> 01:12:12.610
<v Speaker 4>Remove some of the wrinkles.</v>

1522
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.850
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was funny in a town that prizes</v>

1523
01:12:15.851 --> 01:12:19.540
<v Speaker 2>being skinny so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see so many people.</v>

1524
01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Men to have these like balloony faces</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there is just filled with,</v>

1525
01:12:24.401 --> 01:12:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's botox or juvederm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1526
01:12:26.521 --> 01:12:28.810
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not had any of that done,</v>

1527
01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.000
<v Speaker 2>so I don't really know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

1528
01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their faces.</v>

1529
01:12:32.471 --> 01:12:35.200
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it looks like they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>puffing them out.</v>

1530
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.400
<v Speaker 2>It will look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's.</v>

1531
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.010
<v Speaker 2>They're filled with irritant is what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1532
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:41.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's an actual physical</v>

1533
01:12:41.041 --> 01:12:45.720
<v Speaker 4>substance in there that's making their</v>
<v Speaker 4>face thicker to get rid of the lines.</v>

1534
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:48.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff is going to go away.</v>

1535
01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.420
<v Speaker 4>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're on the verge of releasing.</v>

1536
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.480
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy in Germany that created</v>
<v Speaker 4>this procedure called Regena keen and</v>

1537
01:12:56.491 --> 01:13:00.180
<v Speaker 4>Regena keen is they take your blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they spin it in a centrifuge and the</v>

1538
01:13:00.181 --> 01:13:04.890
<v Speaker 4>heated up and then they take the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like a yellow serum that gets</v>

1539
01:13:04.891 --> 01:13:08.190
<v Speaker 4>developed in your blood and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>direct response to the heat.</v>

1540
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:10.500
<v Speaker 4>Your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body reacts as if it's in a flu and</v>

1541
01:13:10.501 --> 01:13:12.480
<v Speaker 4>it produces these radical</v>
<v Speaker 4>antiinflammatories.</v>

1542
01:13:12.481 --> 01:13:16.110
<v Speaker 4>They take these inflammatories and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>inject it into injured areas and all</v>

1543
01:13:16.111 --> 01:13:17.190
<v Speaker 4>these athletes like coby</v>

1544
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.250
<v Speaker 2>Brianne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1545
01:13:19.251 --> 01:13:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I just read about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wonderful athlete.</v>

1546
01:13:22.071 --> 01:13:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Kim Kardashians did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it a plasma facial.</v>

1547
01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>

1548
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:30.080
<v Speaker 2>That's still a blood in a centrifuge and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then heated</v>

1549
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:30.953
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's um,</v>

1550
01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.110
<v Speaker 4>that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bullshit.</v>

1551
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:34.721
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1552
01:13:34.721 --> 01:13:35.011
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1553
01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:35.311
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1554
01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:36.410
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1555
01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.170
<v Speaker 4>it's a type of plasma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1556
01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:40.890
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it called?</v>

1557
01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget what they're called,</v>

1558
01:13:44.161 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 4>but it's similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's similar.</v>

1559
01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 4>I forget the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the procedures named something.</v>

1560
01:13:47.461 --> 01:13:49.650
<v Speaker 4>Plasma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plasma.</v>

1561
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:52.740
<v Speaker 4>Fucking God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't I not remember this?</v>

1562
01:13:52.741 --> 01:13:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's similar but not the same.</v>

1563
01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:00.090
<v Speaker 4>This regena king thing involves heat and</v>
<v Speaker 4>in devolves your blood's response to the</v>

1564
01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:03.290
<v Speaker 4>heat and then taking that serum and</v>
<v Speaker 4>injecting it back by point being that</v>

1565
01:14:03.291 --> 01:14:08.291
<v Speaker 4>same doctor that created this procedure</v>
<v Speaker 4>created a new procedure that restarts</v>

1566
01:14:08.671 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 4>the body's production of Collagen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what wrinkles are,</v>

1567
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:16.600
<v Speaker 4>is your body loses its elasticity and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>starts to give in and starts to get</v>

1568
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:19.750
<v Speaker 4>sloppy and loose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why people get facelifts.</v>

1569
01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with his new procedure,</v>

1570
01:14:22.001 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 4>he's going to restart your body's</v>
<v Speaker 4>production of Collagen.</v>

1571
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.160
<v Speaker 4>You're going to develop college and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a 20 year old.</v>

1572
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.710
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is fucking freaky because that's</v>

1573
01:14:29.711 --> 01:14:31.090
<v Speaker 4>all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1574
01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.790
<v Speaker 4>it's not something like you're asking</v>
<v Speaker 4>people to,</v>

1575
01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to jump 10 feet higher,</v>

1576
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:39.040
<v Speaker 4>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not insurmountable.</v>

1577
01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:42.670
<v Speaker 4>It's just a simple matter of the body</v>
<v Speaker 4>not producing as much as something that</v>

1578
01:14:42.671 --> 01:14:45.160
<v Speaker 4>it used to produce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they figured out a way to get it to</v>

1579
01:14:45.161 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So instead of pulling your face back and</v>

1580
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:49.000
<v Speaker 4>stuffing it with rubber and all that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1581
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Are there health benefits to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is that just vanity?</v>

1582
01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Because like you know earlier we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about that is,</v>

1583
01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.590
<v Speaker 2>is being in the gym all the time about</v>
<v Speaker 2>vanity.</v>

1584
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I would say if you're 80 and you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look 20,</v>

1585
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:04.180
<v Speaker 2>that's vanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean ask me when I'm 80,</v>

1586
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:06.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's like why does everyone need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look?</v>

1587
01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:07.810
<v Speaker 2>So you look better when you're 20</v>

1588
01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.810
<v Speaker 4>so if you want to look better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

1589
01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.550
<v Speaker 4>It's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it vanity?</v>

1590
01:15:11.551 --> 01:15:13.380
<v Speaker 4>Well there's a vanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you cut your hair,</v>

1591
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:15.000
<v Speaker 4>is it vanity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you wear nice clothes?</v>

1592
01:15:15.001 --> 01:15:16.320
<v Speaker 4>The vanity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you wash your face,</v>

1593
01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:17.543
<v Speaker 4>when you were making.</v>

1594
01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I think about especially used to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that all the time because I really</v>

1595
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:25.840
<v Speaker 2>wanted a nose job for the longest time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got one.</v>

1596
01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I still</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do that.</v>

1597
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.850
<v Speaker 2>You have a beautiful nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1598
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a mind.</v>

1599
01:15:32.481 --> 01:15:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1600
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:36.360
<v Speaker 2>what is a mind fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with my nose?</v>

1601
01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:39.580
<v Speaker 2>And my fear is always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1602
01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:43.900
<v Speaker 2>what if I end up with some stupid tiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>nose that doesn't look right on my face</v>

1603
01:15:43.901 --> 01:15:47.080
<v Speaker 2>and then I can't get it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus I feel like that's just,</v>

1604
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:50.050
<v Speaker 2>that's just going too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I think.</v>

1605
01:15:50.051 --> 01:15:53.020
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had braces so my teeth looked</v>

1606
01:15:53.021 --> 01:15:55.240
<v Speaker 2>different than they would have looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise.</v>

1607
01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:58.870
<v Speaker 2>And I straightened my hair and I looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>better with straight hair.</v>

1608
01:15:58.871 --> 01:16:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I looked better with straight teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like all these little things.</v>

1609
01:16:02.351 --> 01:16:07.351
<v Speaker 2>So why is that one different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just is because it involves,</v>

1610
01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:10.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undergoing a procedure and I sort of</v>

1611
01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here's the thing,</v>

1612
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still it's like where do you draw</v>

1613
01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:18.880
<v Speaker 2>the line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were born with a weird hump on</v>

1614
01:16:18.881 --> 01:16:21.580
<v Speaker 2>your nose and they straightened that out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden you're a beautiful.</v>

1615
01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can happen.</v>

1616
01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.371
<v Speaker 2>That can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1617
01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:25.440
<v Speaker 2>there's people that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we?</v>

1618
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1619
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:29.320
<v Speaker 2>but just a nip tuck we've decided is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1620
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that it's not okay.</v>

1621
01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.550
<v Speaker 4>You can do whatever the fuck you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a rabbit hole.</v>

1622
01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.070
<v Speaker 4>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go down that I want to get a nose</v>

1623
01:16:37.071 --> 01:16:37.731
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rabbit hole,</v>

1624
01:16:37.731 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 4>you might go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think my eyebrows be better if there</v>

1625
01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:40.654
<v Speaker 4>were an inch.</v>

1626
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you saying there would be no,</v>

1627
01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.680
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

1628
01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:48.250
<v Speaker 2>well that's the argument against a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make my lips just a little tucker</v>

1629
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.670
<v Speaker 2>this on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this.</v>

1630
01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I want this tiny little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what stops me from starting any</v>

1631
01:16:56.581 --> 01:17:01.320
<v Speaker 2>of that is that I don't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>monster faced because it's so easy to go</v>

1632
01:17:01.321 --> 01:17:02.150
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1633
01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:04.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my upper lip is not as full as my lower</v>

1634
01:17:04.441 --> 01:17:06.510
<v Speaker 2>lip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I could change that or like I feel</v>

1635
01:17:06.511 --> 01:17:08.850
<v Speaker 2>like I'm beginning to get lines here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I could do something,</v>

1636
01:17:08.851 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's all those</v>

1637
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.360
<v Speaker 1>sections in there at some filler in just</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucket from a little fat around the</v>

1638
01:17:14.361 --> 01:17:16.640
<v Speaker 1>outside of my lips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have the wrinkles will be</v>

1639
01:17:16.641 --> 01:17:17.690
<v Speaker 1>happy or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1640
01:17:17.691 --> 01:17:19.400
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of this fat can we moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1641
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know there's an alien up</v>
<v Speaker 1>your butt.</v>

1642
01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Will help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helps people take some of the fat,</v>

1643
01:17:23.331 --> 01:17:25.880
<v Speaker 1>other inner thigh only injected in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass and I'll sign it.</v>

1644
01:17:25.881 --> 01:17:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Looks like they're wearing a diaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lady went that done about that.</v>

1645
01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Are you hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people?</v>

1646
01:17:33.261 --> 01:17:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Live all this older white people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1647
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:39.170
<v Speaker 1>They just panic and start sticking stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their body,</v>

1648
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:40.940
<v Speaker 1>but she looks like she's wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>diaper.</v>

1649
01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.100
<v Speaker 1>She's got these little popsicle legs</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she doesn't know.</v>

1650
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:49.150
<v Speaker 1>She unhappy with her flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before I don't know that well know</v>

1651
01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.930
<v Speaker 1>that she had some stuff injecting her</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

1652
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.760
<v Speaker 1>She's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only one I know is don't either.</v>

1653
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I know quite a few people have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre practice.</v>

1654
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.700
<v Speaker 2>There's our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with waist training?</v>

1655
01:17:57.910 --> 01:18:00.670
<v Speaker 2>I only learned about this recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another crazy thing,</v>

1656
01:18:00.671 --> 01:18:05.671
<v Speaker 2>but I was at the grocery store and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman with this gigantic ass</v>

1657
01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:08.860
<v Speaker 2>gigantic thighs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like big,</v>

1658
01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.391
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>

1659
01:18:10.391 --> 01:18:14.680
<v Speaker 2>tiny little waist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so turned on.</v>

1660
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:18.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very unnatural</v>

1661
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:21.810
<v Speaker 1>gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine got with this girl once</v>

1662
01:18:22.050 --> 01:18:25.500
<v Speaker 1>and they hooked up and they got together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start fooling around and she had a</v>

1663
01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:28.280
<v Speaker 1>thick waste and it freaked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

1664
01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:31.980
<v Speaker 1>he said that she was boxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said she went from her shoulder down</v>

1665
01:18:31.981 --> 01:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>to her hips and it was a straight line</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

1666
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.450
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freaked you out.</v>

1667
01:18:36.451 --> 01:18:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Like how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1668
01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I had to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1669
01:18:38.371 --> 01:18:43.371
<v Speaker 1>what the geometry of your body like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that it didn't go.</v>

1670
01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's pretty,</v>

1671
01:18:44.851 --> 01:18:46.260
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never met the girl.</v>

1672
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's pretty.</v>

1673
01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.061
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1674
01:18:48.061 --> 01:18:49.020
<v Speaker 1>she's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1675
01:18:49.021 --> 01:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's beautiful,</v>

1676
01:18:50.551 --> 01:18:55.050
<v Speaker 1>but her body was too square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you notice that before you got</v>

1677
01:18:55.051 --> 01:18:55.820
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1678
01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:00.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it would be a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we got together it was a big</v>

1679
01:19:00.241 --> 01:19:02.160
<v Speaker 1>deal and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1680
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:06.050
<v Speaker 2>well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least he's trying to look at the</v>

1681
01:19:06.051 --> 01:19:07.730
<v Speaker 2>things that really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>

1682
01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.500
<v Speaker 2>What kind of woman does your friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally?</v>

1683
01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being so fucking judgment hungry</v>

1684
01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 2>artist side instead of just being like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nose job or braces or something.</v>

1685
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:22.100
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing like the boxy body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this fucking piece of shit.</v>

1686
01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1687
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:26.120
<v Speaker 2>you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I walk around with like,</v>

1688
01:19:26.121 --> 01:19:29.000
<v Speaker 2>there's like 19 things about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into,</v>

1689
01:19:29.001 --> 01:19:29.900
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1690
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People won't notice.</v>

1691
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:36.800
<v Speaker 2>And then like I never even thought of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of boxiness of a body being</v>

1692
01:19:36.801 --> 01:19:40.580
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm married so I'm not out there</v>

1693
01:19:40.581 --> 01:19:43.310
<v Speaker 2>trying to impress people with my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Be boxy.</v>

1694
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:45.710
<v Speaker 2>I can be boxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got that freedom,</v>

1695
01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:49.160
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying I didn't know I</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to worry about that.</v>

1696
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't need to worry about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you were hanging out with my</v>

1697
01:19:51.831 --> 01:19:52.664
<v Speaker 2>retarded friend.</v>

1698
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.740
<v Speaker 2>But if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well is he retarded when definitely</v>

1699
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:59.720
<v Speaker 2>retarded comes to that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's retarded when comes to everything.</v>

1700
01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1701
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:05.590
<v Speaker 2>But I was just amazed that he left this</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl's place because she had a boxy body</v>

1702
01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:06.711
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1703
01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:10.170
<v Speaker 2>would he have had sex with her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise he would have stuck it in the</v>

1704
01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:12.180
<v Speaker 2>boxes box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The boxes box.</v>

1705
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that joke could have come off</v>

1706
01:20:13.861 --> 01:20:18.750
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The execution invite me back some day</v>

1707
01:20:18.751 --> 01:20:19.970
<v Speaker 2>and I'm only going to have that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

1708
01:20:19.971 --> 01:20:22.950
<v Speaker 2>It is our first go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a different face by then,</v>

1709
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:26.280
<v Speaker 2>but that joke will pretend to ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1710
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was in the Irvine Improv.</v>

1711
01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:32.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bray Bray Improv.</v>

1712
01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:35.300

<v Speaker 1>waiting to go on.</v>

1713
01:20:35.301 --> 01:20:38.330
<v Speaker 1>And we were just barbecued high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really,</v>

1714
01:20:38.331 --> 01:20:42.740
<v Speaker 1>really stoned and was watching TV and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was comedy central was on comedy</v>

1715
01:20:42.741 --> 01:20:44.410
<v Speaker 1>central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those shows where,</v>

1716
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:46.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1717
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:48.370
<v Speaker 1>before she died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Joan Rivers,</v>

1719
01:20:51.201 --> 01:20:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Joan Rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joan rivers had full on rubber face and</v>

1720
01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.080
<v Speaker 1>she was on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're really high,</v>

1721
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.960
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1722
01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:01.520
<v Speaker 1>they just glaring stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1723
01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.980
<v Speaker 1>and I just go and I just held my hand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my face,</v>

1724
01:21:03.981 --> 01:21:04.970
<v Speaker 1>like the home alone kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1725
01:21:04.971 --> 01:21:07.620
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1726
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Like what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I count was anybody how.</v>

1727
01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:16.190
<v Speaker 1>How was just like letting this go on was</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come someone doesn't step in and go,</v>

1728
01:21:16.191 --> 01:21:18.440
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do this.</v>

1729
01:21:18.441 --> 01:21:21.890
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her whole head was just rubber and</v>

1730
01:21:21.891 --> 01:21:24.260
<v Speaker 1>inflated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing was moving,</v>

1731
01:21:24.261 --> 01:21:26.090
<v Speaker 1>nothing was moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The forehead wasn't moving,</v>

1732
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:27.830
<v Speaker 1>the cheeks weren't moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1733
01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a total new kind of face that</v>

1734
01:21:31.611 --> 01:21:32.750
<v Speaker 1>never existed before,</v>

1735
01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:38.090
<v Speaker 2>that we see on tv all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That always shocks me or frightens me.</v>

1736
01:21:38.781 --> 01:21:41.530
<v Speaker 2>That idea that what if I couldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an expressions?</v>

1737
01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if couldn't do this?</v>

1738
01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

1739
01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.120
<v Speaker 2>But that's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's so important for.</v>

1740
01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.630
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to be on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a face that displays emotion is</v>

1741
01:21:53.631 --> 01:21:55.640
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why would you want to humble yourself</v>

1742
01:21:55.641 --> 01:21:56.474
<v Speaker 2>to that degree?</v>

1743
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:59.150
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You brought this up because I was</v>

1744
01:21:59.151 --> 01:22:04.151
<v Speaker 1>watching boxing this weekend and Canelo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alvarez fought Amir Khan and I'm,</v>

1745
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:08.210
<v Speaker 1>they're doing this thing now in boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

1746
01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Where when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1747
01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:15.800
<v Speaker 1>post-fight ring announcer is</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewing the fighters.</v>

1748
01:22:15.801 --> 01:22:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Who is Max Kellerman who is interviewing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fighter.</v>

1749
01:22:17.901 --> 01:22:22.901
<v Speaker 1>She's asking these questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have these girls stand right there.</v>

1750
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:26.520
<v Speaker 1>These really pretty girls like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand for like,</v>

1751
01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.040
<v Speaker 1>like as if they're his friends and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand right next to them and it's so</v>

1752
01:22:31.041 --> 01:22:33.860
<v Speaker 1>fucking distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one girl,</v>

1753
01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she has botox or for</v>
<v Speaker 1>faces just naturally shiny.</v>

1754
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:39.650
<v Speaker 1>She looks like really young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think she has botox,</v>

1755
01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:42.890
<v Speaker 1>but she's just sitting there like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>smile,</v>

1756
01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:45.680
<v Speaker 1>like half expression and she probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>can move her face.</v>

1757
01:22:45.681 --> 01:22:48.740
<v Speaker 1>It's probably all in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all I'm thinking of is fucking heads</v>

1758
01:22:48.741 --> 01:22:49.550
<v Speaker 1>frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Fred's,</v>

1759
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:51.690
<v Speaker 1>she's only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could have had 29 years old.</v>

1760
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't racism.</v>

1761
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:58.190
<v Speaker 1>People do Botox now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how bold vanderpump rules.</v>

1762
01:22:58.310 --> 01:23:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to bring it up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do that?</v>

1763
01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If their face is not wrinkled?</v>

1764
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Apparently according to one of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1765
01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a preventative.</v>

1766
01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.270
<v Speaker 1>They're getting interviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the girl behind him.</v>

1767
01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.900
<v Speaker 1>She's very pretty beautiful girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her fucking forehead hasn't moved in</v>

1768
01:23:13.901 --> 01:23:16.500
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That God damn thing is frozen.</v>

1769
01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Face looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plastic does it.</v>

1770
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:20.980
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty hot seat.</v>

1771
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:23.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a certain amount of plastic I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate,</v>

1772
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was freaking me out.</v>

1773
01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is there a wiser skin frozen?</v>

1774
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Is that just seeing her in the back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell,</v>

1775
01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:37.090
<v Speaker 1>but it was like there's like a shyness</v>
<v Speaker 1>to foreheads when they do that shit.</v>

1776
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like an artificial shyness</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

1777
01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's pull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even that it's pulled back,</v>

1778
01:23:43.301 --> 01:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but he was zapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1779
01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:49.690
<v Speaker 1>zapped it and froze it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little tiny micro muscular.</v>

1780
01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Things aren't happening and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>paralyzed.</v>

1781
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Botulism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're injecting botulism in your</v>

1782
01:23:57.011 --> 01:24:01.000
<v Speaker 1>fucking face to keep it from moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're paralyzing your face.</v>

1783
01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I know lady who did it and it went bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got a cheap one done and our eye</v>

1784
01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:07.780
<v Speaker 1>droop down like those six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1785
01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:12.200
<v Speaker 1>six weeks later for six weeks it looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking Arturo Gotti was like.</v>

1786
01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Speaker 1>It was like somebody had been beating on</v>
<v Speaker 1>her with Jabs.</v>

1787
01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1788
01:24:15.221 --> 01:24:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone has a side of her mouth and</v>

1789
01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:21.290
<v Speaker 1>she was a newscaster side of my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drooped her tail.</v>

1790
01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.020
<v Speaker 1>When it came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did she do?</v>

1791
01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:25.300
<v Speaker 1>So the newscast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she.</v>

1792
01:24:25.301 --> 01:24:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she went on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only.</v>

1793
01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I heard about it from other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she was freaking out about it.</v>

1794
01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.193
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Fucking what a weird problem to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I injected too much botulism in the side</v>

1796
01:24:38.411 --> 01:24:43.411
<v Speaker 1>of my face and now I drool when I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what honestly scares me about all</v>

1797
01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:49.930
<v Speaker 1>that stuff is the idea of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>going wrong that is don't trust anyone</v>

1798
01:24:49.931 --> 01:24:51.610
<v Speaker 1>enough to let them do that.</v>

1799
01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:54.230
<v Speaker 1>We'll also those when they inject the</v>
<v Speaker 1>botulism,</v>

1800
01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:58.450
<v Speaker 1>there's like a lot of different levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that are good at it and Shitty</v>

1801
01:24:58.451 --> 01:25:00.100
<v Speaker 1>at it and some people they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1802
01:25:00.101 --> 01:25:01.840
<v Speaker 1>there's people that think more is</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

1803
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:06.100
<v Speaker 1>so more of that stuff in there and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>freeze the whole fucking thing.</v>

1804
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:07.960
<v Speaker 1>People do it to their arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that?</v>

1805
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:09.820
<v Speaker 1>They do it to different parts of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

1806
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I recently heard though about how it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a migraine care and that makes sense.</v>

1807
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Thirty nine tiny injections in different</v>
<v Speaker 1>places in your head and it helps with</v>

1808
01:25:20.831 --> 01:25:22.480
<v Speaker 1>migraines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of makes sense.</v>

1809
01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.500
<v Speaker 1>If migraines or pressure and pressure is</v>
<v Speaker 1>caused by tension released those</v>

1810
01:25:26.501 --> 01:25:27.490
<v Speaker 1>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

1811
01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:31.120
<v Speaker 1>What do people do when they put it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their arms or why people don't want the</v>

1812
01:25:31.121 --> 01:25:33.010
<v Speaker 1>way their elbows looking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1813
01:25:33.011 --> 01:25:34.390
<v Speaker 1>that's different jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1814
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>

1815
01:25:35.681 --> 01:25:38.800
<v Speaker 1>We'll see what that guy that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are not real muscles.</v>

1816
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:44.130
<v Speaker 1>That's something called we're looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at a video or an image of</v>

1817
01:25:45.191 --> 01:25:50.191
<v Speaker 1>a guy who's on something called Synthol</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Synthol is something that people who</v>

1818
01:25:50.231 --> 01:25:54.190
<v Speaker 1>were into bodybuilding do where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>inject it into their muscles and it's</v>

1819
01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:57.010
<v Speaker 1>oil that inflates the size of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>

1820
01:25:57.310 --> 01:25:59.050
<v Speaker 1>doesn't change the strength of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>

1821
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.750
<v Speaker 1>but it makes your muscles like blow up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look completely.</v>

1822
01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That guy with the red tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll</v>

1823
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:05.960
<v Speaker 4>look at these guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>

1824
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:09.980
<v Speaker 4>They've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They inject their muscles and make them</v>

1825
01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:14.600
<v Speaker 4>fucking enormous and not just a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger way bigger than normal.</v>

1826
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.320
<v Speaker 4>Like it's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1827
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:20.000
<v Speaker 4>Well it doesn't look real at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy,</v>

1828
01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 4>but it's a form of body dysmorphia where</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys think it looks good.</v>

1829
01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:29.360
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when a girl gets size 78,</v>

1830
01:26:29.361 --> 01:26:31.880
<v Speaker 4>double e tents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get crazy.</v>

1831
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.310
<v Speaker 4>They just start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start thinking that that's the way to go</v>

1832
01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.490
<v Speaker 4>and it never looks big enough for them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they just want to get bigger and</v>

1833
01:26:37.491 --> 01:26:42.320
<v Speaker 4>bigger and bigger and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>anorexics bodybuilders body dysmorphia</v>

1834
01:26:42.321 --> 01:26:43.310
<v Speaker 4>is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1835
01:26:43.311 --> 01:26:45.230
<v Speaker 4>well you were saying like looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>your own known and she's like,</v>

1836
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:49.520
<v Speaker 4>I just changed this and do something</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it and just start finding.</v>

1837
01:26:49.521 --> 01:26:51.980
<v Speaker 4>You stare at it long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start finding things you don't like</v>

1838
01:26:51.981 --> 01:26:52.814
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start,</v>

1839
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:56.360
<v Speaker 4>you just go through the looking glass</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he gets everything gets distorted.</v>

1840
01:26:56.430 --> 01:27:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Hi kind of thing almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1841
01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:02.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really seems that almost all women</v>

1842
01:27:02.761 --> 01:27:04.530
<v Speaker 3>have a certain amount of body</v>
<v Speaker 3>dysmorphia.</v>

1843
01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:07.950
<v Speaker 3>I know I certainly do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially having been pretty overweight</v>

1844
01:27:07.951 --> 01:27:09.960
<v Speaker 3>and then now whatever I am and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1845
01:27:09.961 --> 01:27:12.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to regard myself in the</v>

1846
01:27:12.481 --> 01:27:14.730
<v Speaker 3>mirror and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need anyone to tell me how to</v>

1847
01:27:14.731 --> 01:27:17.150
<v Speaker 3>regard myself unless it's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1848
01:27:17.170 --> 01:27:19.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1849
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Well I just realized I was sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>inviting,</v>

1850
01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.960
<v Speaker 3>inviting some stuff and I thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no thank you.</v>

1851
01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1852
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:31.470
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most women in this culture don't really</v>

1853
01:27:31.891 --> 01:27:32.650
<v Speaker 3>have a sense of what</v>

1854
01:27:32.650 --> 01:27:33.450
<v Speaker 4>they look like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1855
01:27:33.450 --> 01:27:36.850
<v Speaker 4>I think there's also an issue with</v>
<v Speaker 4>improvement in general,</v>

1856
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.240
<v Speaker 4>whereas you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that also can be applied to</v>

1857
01:27:40.241 --> 01:27:42.940
<v Speaker 4>people that just get way too rich and</v>
<v Speaker 4>way too successful.</v>

1858
01:27:42.941 --> 01:27:46.180
<v Speaker 4>It can be applied to looking at your own</v>
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>

1859
01:27:46.690 --> 01:27:49.030
<v Speaker 4>looking at your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at your face,</v>

1860
01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:51.070
<v Speaker 4>your face in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>

1861
01:27:51.190 --> 01:27:53.710
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can improve the way you look,</v>

1862
01:27:53.711 --> 01:27:55.390
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can wear makeup,</v>

1863
01:27:55.630 --> 01:27:59.560
<v Speaker 4>you can change your hairstyle and when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you can do something you're always</v>

1864
01:27:59.561 --> 01:28:01.690
<v Speaker 4>never sure when you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1865
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.450
<v Speaker 4>so like if you're making a painting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how hard is it to make a painting and</v>

1866
01:28:04.451 --> 01:28:05.490
<v Speaker 4>walk away like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1867
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:06.581
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1868
01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:11.581
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going a little more and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>process of improvement,</v>

1869
01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.920
<v Speaker 4>you can get caught up in it where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>lose your objectivity and you can't see</v>

1870
01:28:17.441 --> 01:28:22.300
<v Speaker 4>it the way other people can see it and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that is a big part of what body</v>

1871
01:28:22.301 --> 01:28:23.380
<v Speaker 4>dysmorphia is.</v>

1872
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.610
<v Speaker 4>You just factionism yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1873
01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:26.240
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1874
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.390
<v Speaker 4>we have this desire to improve things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1875
01:28:28.391 --> 01:28:32.200
<v Speaker 4>You have design.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to renovate my house.</v>

1876
01:28:32.201 --> 01:28:34.300
<v Speaker 4>The next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going fucking crazy and tearing</v>

1877
01:28:34.301 --> 01:28:37.110
<v Speaker 4>walls down and rewiring things and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1878
01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:38.080
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1879
01:28:38.081 --> 01:28:40.840
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this thing where you can't</v>

1880
01:28:40.841 --> 01:28:43.840
<v Speaker 4>just appreciate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to like constantly change</v>

1881
01:28:43.841 --> 01:28:48.130
<v Speaker 4>things and if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's applied to your face,</v>

1882
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:51.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or your waste with the waste training</v>

1883
01:28:51.551 --> 01:28:53.830
<v Speaker 4>that you're about to get into that where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

1884
01:28:53.831 --> 01:28:58.831
<v Speaker 4>those corsets and soc themselves in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>compress their organs and also hinder</v>

1885
01:28:58.901 --> 01:29:00.460
<v Speaker 4>organ function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1886
01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.150
<v Speaker 4>it can fuck with the way your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're not.</v>

1887
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:06.720
<v Speaker 4>Everything is not fucking jammed in</v>
<v Speaker 4>light that you can change the shape of</v>

1888
01:29:06.721 --> 01:29:08.220
<v Speaker 4>your organs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1889
01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 4>it's this soft tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you wear a corset enough?</v>

1890
01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:14.290
<v Speaker 4>I saw a guy with the course of the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>day where,</v>

1891
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:15.960
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming he was a guy because he had</v>

1892
01:29:15.961 --> 01:29:18.000
<v Speaker 4>a beard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in this day and age and not allowed</v>

1893
01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:19.590
<v Speaker 4>to assume that anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1894
01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:23.940
<v Speaker 4>he was at universal universal citywalk</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a city park,</v>

1895
01:29:23.941 --> 01:29:24.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking,</v>

1896
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:30.350
<v Speaker 4>the rides and he had a pink corset on</v>
<v Speaker 4>and birkenstocks.</v>

1897
01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.460
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a dude</v>

1898
01:29:32.770 --> 01:29:35.530
<v Speaker 3>such mixed messages because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>birkenstocks are like,</v>

1899
01:29:35.650 --> 01:29:37.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just be comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The course that's like,</v>

1900
01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:38.800
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1901
01:29:38.801 --> 01:29:39.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1902
01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:42.160
<v Speaker 4>I think his message was this is how he</v>
<v Speaker 4>likes to dress,</v>

1903
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:45.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a pink corset and it was</v>

1904
01:29:45.011 --> 01:29:47.230
<v Speaker 4>stuffed into this thing and then he had</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1905
01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:50.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wacky hair and a beard and like kind of</v>

1906
01:29:50.921 --> 01:29:53.080
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He close kind of some,</v>

1907
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:56.060
<v Speaker 4>some parts of the clothing he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing were women's law.</v>

1908
01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the,</v>

1909
01:29:57.531 --> 01:30:01.240
<v Speaker 4>the shirt as well as a woman's shirt was</v>
<v Speaker 4>very odd.</v>

1910
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:03.640
<v Speaker 4>Just sounds like an uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 4>ensemble.</v>

1911
01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:05.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what kind of childhood he</v>
<v Speaker 4>had,</v>

1912
01:30:06.010 --> 01:30:08.530
<v Speaker 4>but maybe he's just going to fight that</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the day he dies,</v>

1913
01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:12.610
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know or maybe that I don't</v>

1914
01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:15.190
<v Speaker 4>understand what some people like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

1915
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:18.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't like some things that other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like I don't know what's going on</v>

1916
01:30:18.401 --> 01:30:20.080
<v Speaker 4>in their head where they look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>something and they go,</v>

1917
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:22.090
<v Speaker 4>that looks amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1918
01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.760
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some people that is what they like,</v>

1919
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:29.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for him maybe it's that like people that</v>

1920
01:30:29.051 --> 01:30:31.700
<v Speaker 4>like to dress up like furries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1921
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:32.583
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>

1922
01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:37.980
<v Speaker 4>what is it about putting on a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>giant mascot outfit of a squirrel that</v>

1923
01:30:39.011 --> 01:30:40.740
<v Speaker 4>really gets your rocks off?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1924
01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:41.820
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1925
01:30:41.821 --> 01:30:45.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think I have to know.</v>

1926
01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:47.970
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1927
01:30:47.971 --> 01:30:48.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1928
01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:52.780
<v Speaker 3>In terms of things like fetishes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that someone can</v>

1929
01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.190
<v Speaker 3>understand the mindset of someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that.</v>

1930
01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:01.620
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that is so baked into your,</v>

1931
01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:05.350
<v Speaker 3>your like operating software to use that</v>
<v Speaker 3>term again.</v>

1932
01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:07.780
<v Speaker 3>That it's like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that that's.</v>

1933
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:09.940
<v Speaker 3>If I were to explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else would get it.</v>

1934
01:31:09.941 --> 01:31:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's more like,</v>

1935
01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.860
<v Speaker 3>I like the smell of vanilla or I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the smell,</v>

1936
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:16.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns my stomach</v>

1937
01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:18.320
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird when you find out that some</v>

1938
01:31:18.321 --> 01:31:22.550
<v Speaker 4>fetishes or just sort of burned into</v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind at a very young age when</v>

1939
01:31:22.551 --> 01:31:26.060
<v Speaker 4>you're sexually maturing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Dr Chris Ryan was a friend of mine</v>

1940
01:31:26.061 --> 01:31:29.690
<v Speaker 4>has been on the podcast before he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to me about,</v>

1941
01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>

1942
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.960
<v Speaker 4>especially boys when they're in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain level of puberty,</v>

1943
01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:41.210
<v Speaker 4>I think it's age is between 11 and 14.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any sort of sexual encounters that they</v>

1944
01:31:42.111 --> 01:31:46.910
<v Speaker 4>have during those age can almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>permanently burn those,</v>

1945
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.863
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1946
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:52.870
<v Speaker 4>encounters into their category of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive things.</v>

1947
01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.470
<v Speaker 4>Things that they find sexually</v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive,</v>

1948
01:31:54.471 --> 01:31:58.370
<v Speaker 4>including like sex with men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was talking about how men can be</v>

1949
01:31:58.371 --> 01:32:00.280
<v Speaker 4>totally straight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe</v>

1950
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.040
<v Speaker 1>they got blown by some guy when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were 14,</v>

1951
01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>like in some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird moment.</v>

1952
01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:10.111
<v Speaker 1>And then they become attracted to men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billowing them for like forever.</v>

1953
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:12.790
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like a weird fetish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1955
01:32:13.130 --> 01:32:14.680
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's imprinted.</v>

1956
01:32:14.710 --> 01:32:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I forget the term he used</v>

1957
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:19.480
<v Speaker 3>suggesting that therefore then they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay or they're not gay.</v>

1958
01:32:19.481 --> 01:32:21.310
<v Speaker 3>They just are introduced blowing them.</v>

1959
01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's suggesting.</v>

1960
01:32:23.521 --> 01:32:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's all sorts of,</v>

1961
01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:28.560
<v Speaker 1>there's both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what he's saying is that</v>

1962
01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:33.620
<v Speaker 1>some men can be even attracted to gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>porn are attracted the idea of guys</v>

1963
01:32:34.051 --> 01:32:36.260
<v Speaker 1>blowing guys and not be gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1964
01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1965
01:32:37.890 --> 01:32:40.650
<v Speaker 1>we don't like to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would like to make things very clean</v>

1966
01:32:40.651 --> 01:32:43.680
<v Speaker 1>the way we categorize things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd like to have like very clean and</v>

1967
01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:44.820
<v Speaker 1>obvious categories.</v>

1968
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we're all on a spectrum than the</v>

1969
01:32:47.251 --> 01:32:49.560
<v Speaker 3>categories breakdown for different</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1970
01:32:49.561 --> 01:32:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1971
01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:54.030
<v Speaker 3>I forget what term he used about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>imprinting,</v>

1972
01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:55.260
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I.</v>

1973
01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

1974
01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

1975
01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:00.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that younger people are much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more comfortable with the fluidity of</v>

1976
01:33:00.751 --> 01:33:02.910
<v Speaker 3>sexuality and with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1977
01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:07.911
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>

1978
01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:11.530
<v Speaker 3>there was a fair amount of girls making</v>
<v Speaker 3>out with girls,</v>

1979
01:33:11.710 --> 01:33:13.840
<v Speaker 3>but in front of guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at me.</v>

1980
01:33:13.841 --> 01:33:15.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm so wild and making out with a girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not,</v>

1981
01:33:15.731 --> 01:33:18.040
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like that's now,</v>

1982
01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.320
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'd actually don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was gonna say.</v>

1983
01:33:20.321 --> 01:33:21.610
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that happens all the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1984
01:33:21.611 --> 01:33:23.470
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sound like a blue hair or something.</v>

1985
01:33:23.471 --> 01:33:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't actually know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people</v>

1986
01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:30.660
<v Speaker 1>are experimenting with the idea of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are outside of the confines</v>

1987
01:33:32.201 --> 01:33:36.670
<v Speaker 1>of normal patterns and because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like who their parents are and</v>

1988
01:33:36.671 --> 01:33:39.740
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they want to be able to rebel.</v>

1989
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:44.750
<v Speaker 1>One of the best ways to rebel is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibit behaviors or indulge in</v>

1990
01:33:45.101 --> 01:33:48.370
<v Speaker 1>behaviors that are forbidden or they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of patterns.</v>

1991
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is this girl at the comedy store?</v>

1992
01:33:50.321 --> 01:33:54.100
<v Speaker 1>One of the waitresses was telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about her friend who it was.</v>

1993
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:58.060
<v Speaker 1>She said it was like hilarious the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>set it because he said,</v>

1994
01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm not gay because I've had sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>with guys and I didn't like it.</v>

1995
01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:05.650
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the most</v>

1996
01:34:05.651 --> 01:34:07.540
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual things that a guy could</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

1997
01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:09.520
<v Speaker 1>And we were laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

1998
01:34:09.521 --> 01:34:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1999
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know if you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking Dick and team suck a dick.</v>

2000
01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2001
01:34:15.701 --> 01:34:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had sex with a guy,</v>

2002
01:34:18.371 --> 01:34:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I blew them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it at all and I'm never</v>

2003
01:34:20.801 --> 01:34:21.634
<v Speaker 1>doing it again,</v>

2004
01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:28.340
<v Speaker 1>and she was talking about his commitment</v>
<v Speaker 1>to finding out,</v>

2005
01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:34.420
<v Speaker 1>to not prejudging by think that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that in the seventies in particular,</v>

2006
01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:40.290
<v Speaker 1>there was a bunch of rock stars that</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimented with gay sex like Pete</v>

2007
01:34:40.291 --> 01:34:44.890
<v Speaker 1>towns and did it and Mick Jagger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Bowie supposedly did it like,</v>

2008
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:49.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it was common that people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimenting with boundaries and they</v>

2009
01:34:51.031 --> 01:34:53.520
<v Speaker 1>were challenging where those boundaries</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

2010
01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 1>where they begin and where they end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also know that like homosexuality</v>

2011
01:34:58.071 --> 01:35:01.580
<v Speaker 1>in particular was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common a long time ago.</v>

2012
01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:04.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even pet history,</v>

2013
01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's word right.</v>

2014
01:35:06.850 --> 01:35:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Passed Pettis history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2015
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2016
01:35:10.770 --> 01:35:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2017
01:35:12.230 --> 01:35:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Being a pet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassed they.</v>

2018
01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.450
<v Speaker 1>That was super common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>

2019
01:35:17.610 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe somewhere and it's.</v>

2020
01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.650
<v Speaker 1>We're so close to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2021
01:35:21.710 --> 01:35:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word pedophiles does.</v>

2022
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:26.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between being a or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pederastic pedophile.</v>

2023
01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:28.490
<v Speaker 1>One of them is like they get attracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

2024
01:35:28.491 --> 01:35:30.620
<v Speaker 1>One of them is they engage in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2025
01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:35.150
<v Speaker 1>But it was super common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really common amongst like really</v>

2026
01:35:35.151 --> 01:35:38.900
<v Speaker 1>respected people like socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato.</v>

2027
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:43.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that were the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they acknowledged that they had young</v>

2028
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:46.670
<v Speaker 1>boyfriends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little tiny young people.</v>

2029
01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:50.570
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But back then it wasn't fucked and</v>

2030
01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:54.620
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Greeks and the Romans and</v>

2031
01:35:54.621 --> 01:35:57.880
<v Speaker 1>they'd be constantly engaged in</v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexual behavior.</v>

2032
01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.870
<v Speaker 1>That's weird about like depictions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in modern media.</v>

2033
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:05.330
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't indulge in that like that's</v>

2034
01:36:05.331 --> 01:36:08.690
<v Speaker 1>like not a part of like the movie 300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2035
01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Punch dudes but fucking each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we're led to</v>

2036
01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:20.100
<v Speaker 1>believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone over the texts,</v>

2037
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:25.390
<v Speaker 1>it seems like we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not showing an ample amount of bud</v>

2038
01:36:25.391 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 1>fucking amongst students.</v>

2039
01:36:26.970 --> 01:36:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that it could have been so accepted</v>

2040
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:35.610
<v Speaker 3>and then there could have been such a</v>
<v Speaker 3>change where up until recently,</v>

2041
01:36:35.611 --> 01:36:39.750
<v Speaker 3>it's like people who were truly gay did</v>
<v Speaker 3>not feel comfortable being gay.</v>

2042
01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it could change that much.</v>

2043
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2044
01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Jen.</v>

2045
01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:46.950
<v Speaker 1>It could be religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also.</v>

2046
01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:50.520
<v Speaker 1>It could very well be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you grow up with?</v>

2047
01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I think a lot of what people are is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you grow up with?</v>

2048
01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.580
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the variations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2049
01:36:56.581 --> 01:36:59.730
<v Speaker 1>you talk about the spectrum cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors that exist in human beings.</v>

2050
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:05.030
<v Speaker 1>There is a wide and varied and in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>places extremely bizarre and so you look</v>

2051
01:37:06.331 --> 01:37:10.590
<v Speaker 1>at like isolated tribes in particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look at some of their strange</v>

2052
01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:13.470
<v Speaker 1>practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's this group in New Guinea</v>

2053
01:37:13.770 --> 01:37:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2054
01:37:15.090 --> 01:37:18.570
<v Speaker 1>they call them the semen warriors of New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guinea and they,</v>

2055
01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:22.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they do is they take</v>
<v Speaker 1>young boys away from their mothers very</v>

2056
01:37:22.081 --> 01:37:24.990
<v Speaker 1>early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live in these bachelor groups and</v>

2057
01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:27.610
<v Speaker 1>it's all just child rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2058
01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:28.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2059
01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:33.210
<v Speaker 1>and they think that the only way a young</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy can grow up and develop his.</v>

2060
01:37:33.211 --> 01:37:36.180
<v Speaker 1>If he ingest semen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2061
01:37:36.181 --> 01:37:39.870
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has been going on for thousands</v>

2062
01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:42.390
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently this isolated tribe that does</v>

2063
01:37:42.391 --> 01:37:47.391
<v Speaker 1>this and these are like fierce warriors</v>
<v Speaker 1>who fucking kill their enemies and eat</v>

2064
01:37:47.731 --> 01:37:49.070
<v Speaker 1>them and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of,</v>

2065
01:37:49.090 --> 01:37:51.840
<v Speaker 1>a lot of cannibalism exists in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated tribes,</v>

2066
01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:54.150
<v Speaker 1>especially around New Guinea for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange reason,</v>

2067
01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but what</v>

2068
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I would think would be fascinating would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be talking to the person who escaped</v>

2069
01:37:59.881 --> 01:38:01.710
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If assuming there are,</v>

2070
01:38:01.711 --> 01:38:05.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean they must.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tribes must shed members ever</v>

2071
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:07.830
<v Speaker 3>occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then which way did they go and what</v>

2072
01:38:07.831 --> 01:38:08.664
<v Speaker 3>do they do?</v>

2073
01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2074
01:38:09.730 --> 01:38:13.630
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of ways it's a cult behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like can I have a friend who used to be</v>

2075
01:38:13.631 --> 01:38:17.770
<v Speaker 4>in the moonies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a dude who grew up a Mooney.</v>

2076
01:38:17.771 --> 01:38:20.380
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do grew up a Christian scientist or</v>

2077
01:38:20.381 --> 01:38:21.670
<v Speaker 4>Jehovah witness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a couple.</v>

2078
01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Jehovah's Witness.</v>

2079
01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:24.040
<v Speaker 3>That's me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Former Jehovah's Witnesses.</v>

2080
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:25.270
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's weird man.</v>

2081
01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:28.400
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that my friends who are Jehovah's</v>

2082
01:38:28.401 --> 01:38:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Witnesses who are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2083
01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.040
<v Speaker 3>they are no longer practicing but their</v>
<v Speaker 3>families still are o g and that creates</v>

2084
01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:36.650
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of problems like my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2085
01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:41.030
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her mom didn't come to her wedding</v>

2086
01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:46.340
<v Speaker 3>because I forget because what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something about her wedding wasn't</v>

2087
01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Jehovah's Witness approved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she,</v>

2088
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:51.980
<v Speaker 3>her mom couldn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2089
01:38:52.490 --> 01:38:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How specific mom.</v>

2090
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

2091
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:58.850
<v Speaker 3>I have a Joe Rogan question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have noticed,</v>

2092
01:39:00.230 --> 01:39:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I have noticed that you posted a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>images that show the brutality of</v>

2093
01:39:05.091 --> 01:39:07.210
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2094
01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:11.510
<v Speaker 3>and I'm wondering what about that aspect</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nature appeals?</v>

2095
01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not even just the brutality of</v>

2096
01:39:13.411 --> 01:39:14.660
<v Speaker 4>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just nature in general,</v>

2097
01:39:14.661 --> 01:39:17.160
<v Speaker 4>like those photos that I have over there</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2098
01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:20.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's joke named Cj cjm photography,</v>

2099
01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.760
<v Speaker 4>cjm underscore photography sent us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are these wolves in yellowstone.</v>

2100
01:39:26.101 --> 01:39:29.790
<v Speaker 4>I just think I just am fascinated by</v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife,</v>

2101
01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.130
<v Speaker 4>like see those walls and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible.</v>

2102
01:39:32.370 --> 01:39:33.330
<v Speaker 4>They're amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2103
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:34.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2104
01:39:34.981 --> 01:39:36.780
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the actual photo itself.</v>

2105
01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:41.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm just really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really fascinated by wildlife and for</v>

2106
01:39:41.551 --> 01:39:46.080
<v Speaker 4>whatever reason wild predators fascinate</v>
<v Speaker 4>me more because they're scary and just</v>

2107
01:39:46.081 --> 01:39:51.081
<v Speaker 4>because the way they live is so it's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>explosive and dynamic and final,</v>

2108
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:57.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when the image of the bear that I</v>

2109
01:39:57.901 --> 01:40:01.400
<v Speaker 4>posted the other day that was eating the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sheep and pulling those fields shape</v>

2110
01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:06.710
<v Speaker 4>that it followed from a was killed the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sheep and that was pulling the fetus out</v>

2111
01:40:06.811 --> 01:40:10.260
<v Speaker 4>of its body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that is just so ruthless and</v>

2112
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:11.783
<v Speaker 4>brutal.</v>

2113
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.260
<v Speaker 4>There's something about that aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2114
01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:18.450
<v Speaker 4>of nature that's just insanely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2115
01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.490
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I say attractive,</v>

2116
01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:22.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm like,</v>

2117
01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.400
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat it up,</v>

2118
01:40:23.401 --> 01:40:25.110
<v Speaker 4>eat it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm excited by it.</v>

2119
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:28.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm drawn to it and compelled to view it</v>

2120
01:40:28.621 --> 01:40:33.621
<v Speaker 4>and fascinated by the fact that these</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals exist with us on this planet</v>

2121
01:40:35.641 --> 01:40:40.641
<v Speaker 4>alongside us right now in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of the more amazing aspects</v>

2122
01:40:41.131 --> 01:40:46.131
<v Speaker 4>about North America is that North</v>
<v Speaker 4>America has these wildlife preserves,</v>

2123
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.800
<v Speaker 4>these places like yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these state and national parks where</v>

2124
01:40:52.890 --> 01:40:57.890
<v Speaker 4>they have these animals that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>wandering around and any given time you</v>

2125
01:40:58.991 --> 01:41:02.970
<v Speaker 4>can go to yellowstone and you could see</v>
<v Speaker 4>bison and woves and,</v>

2126
01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:05.350
<v Speaker 4>and bear and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2127
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:07.540
<v Speaker 4>whether you're there or whether you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not there,</v>

2128
01:41:07.541 --> 01:41:10.240
<v Speaker 4>that is how they live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They live in the same way.</v>

2129
01:41:10.241 --> 01:41:14.710
<v Speaker 4>They've lived for millions of years and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this really barbaric raw,</v>

2130
01:41:14.711 --> 01:41:19.450
<v Speaker 4>natural world where it's just about</v>
<v Speaker 4>breeding and killing and trying to keep</v>

2131
01:41:19.451 --> 01:41:22.660
<v Speaker 4>the numbers as high as possible while,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2132
01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:28.090
<v Speaker 4>riding it out until the Alpha male gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>too old to defend its territory.</v>

2133
01:41:28.091 --> 01:41:31.000
<v Speaker 4>And then gets forced out and eventually</v>
<v Speaker 4>dies and freezes to death.</v>

2134
01:41:31.001 --> 01:41:34.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's this intense long running</v>

2135
01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:36.700
<v Speaker 4>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just really,</v>

2136
01:41:36.701 --> 01:41:39.130
<v Speaker 4>really fascinated by wildlife in</v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

2137
01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wondered if there's an element</v>

2138
01:41:47.931 --> 01:41:52.931
<v Speaker 2>of it that you feel like people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>face that that's our true nature to a</v>

2139
01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:56.380
<v Speaker 2>degree and like what we come from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I,</v>

2140
01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:58.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can post nature images and it can be</v>

2141
01:41:58.491 --> 01:42:01.070
<v Speaker 2>like look at these puppies will get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>puppy per friending a duckling.</v>

2142
01:42:01.130 --> 01:42:03.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what I post.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really nature though.</v>

2143
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Well natural images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like,</v>

2144
01:42:06.111 --> 01:42:06.944
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2145
01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:10.970
<v Speaker 2>people often don't focus on the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're presenting.</v>

2146
01:42:10.971 --> 01:42:11.691
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2147
01:42:11.691 --> 01:42:12.524
<v Speaker 2>it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

2148
01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:15.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's icky and it makes me uncomfortable.</v>

2149
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you delight?</v>

2150
01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Is there a part of you that wishes</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would recognize that that is a</v>

2151
01:42:23.841 --> 01:42:24.674
<v Speaker 2>reality more?</v>

2152
01:42:24.850 --> 01:42:25.780
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2153
01:42:25.781 --> 01:42:28.120
<v Speaker 4>yes for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's not why I'm putting it up.</v>

2154
01:42:28.121 --> 01:42:29.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm putting it up just because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>compelling to me,</v>

2155
01:42:30.330 --> 01:42:31.000
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just,</v>

2156
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.530
<v Speaker 4>when I see things that are cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like,</v>

2157
01:42:32.531 --> 01:42:34.510
<v Speaker 4>look at this fucking war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is wild.</v>

2158
01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:36.490
<v Speaker 4>Looking at that and I feel compelled to</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it up.</v>

2159
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.620
<v Speaker 4>But I think our life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way we live in cities and in urban</v>

2160
01:42:41.621 --> 01:42:46.470
<v Speaker 4>areas is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is insanely filtered in terms of like</v>

2161
01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:49.000
<v Speaker 4>our interactions with the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

2162
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:53.620
<v Speaker 4>especially when we're consuming things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that come from the outside and then it</v>

2163
01:42:53.621 --> 01:42:58.621
<v Speaker 4>comes not just as far as animals but</v>
<v Speaker 4>even plant life.</v>

2164
01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:03.060
<v Speaker 4>Even just just gardens in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>

2165
01:43:03.061 --> 01:43:05.410
<v Speaker 4>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we buy too much vegetables from</v>

2166
01:43:05.411 --> 01:43:09.130
<v Speaker 4>the store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We buy too many vegetables from a box</v>

2167
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:14.340
<v Speaker 4>from a shelf and we stick it in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>plastic bag and we drive it away.</v>

2168
01:43:14.410 --> 01:43:17.860
<v Speaker 4>I think we would all to ourselves a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of good if we grew some.</v>

2169
01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.560
<v Speaker 4>We kind of understood this process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I grow vegetables and I put them in</v>

2170
01:43:23.921 --> 01:43:26.830
<v Speaker 4>a salad and I chopped them up and cook</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and eat them.</v>

2171
01:43:26.831 --> 01:43:30.760
<v Speaker 4>And there's something incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>satisfying about being there for the</v>

2172
01:43:30.761 --> 01:43:33.940
<v Speaker 4>entire process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knowing that this is a seed I put in the</v>

2173
01:43:33.941 --> 01:43:36.400
<v Speaker 4>dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put the fertilizer up at the water and</v>

2174
01:43:36.401 --> 01:43:41.401
<v Speaker 4>here it is in a salad and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>connection to your food and to this the</v>

2175
01:43:42.671 --> 01:43:47.671
<v Speaker 4>life form that you're consuming itself</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that way that I don't think you get</v>

2176
01:43:48.670 --> 01:43:52.850
<v Speaker 4>any other way and I think I think that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the filter that we've created by</v>

2177
01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.850
<v Speaker 4>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by supermarkets,</v>

2178
01:43:55.851 --> 01:43:59.180
<v Speaker 4>by restaurants and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's unhealthy because I think</v>

2179
01:43:59.181 --> 01:44:04.010
<v Speaker 4>it keeps us from a true complete</v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of our position in this</v>

2180
01:44:04.011 --> 01:44:06.080
<v Speaker 4>whole thing that that bear.</v>

2181
01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:10.760
<v Speaker 4>The only difference between that bear in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the space that you're in right now is</v>

2182
01:44:10.761 --> 01:44:14.060
<v Speaker 4>just distance like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bear could be right over there.</v>

2183
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:16.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's wandering around on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>

2184
01:44:16.401 --> 01:44:18.920
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have fences around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just distance.</v>

2185
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:22.820
<v Speaker 4>That keeps it from being in Woodland</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hills walking down the street.</v>

2186
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.940
<v Speaker 4>That's really all that stops it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's terrifying.</v>

2187
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:27.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got its own environment.</v>

2188
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:31.670
<v Speaker 4>It's got its own range and so it stays</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that range and eat the animals that</v>

2189
01:44:31.671 --> 01:44:33.770
<v Speaker 4>are in that range,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not even just terrifying.</v>

2190
01:44:33.771 --> 01:44:38.771
<v Speaker 4>Just the idea that that is a life form</v>
<v Speaker 4>that coexist with us and our life form.</v>

2191
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:44.290
<v Speaker 4>We have figured out a way to isolate it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these very strange tribal systems in</v>

2192
01:44:44.961 --> 01:44:47.890
<v Speaker 4>these communities and civilizations and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cities.</v>

2193
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:53.430
<v Speaker 4>It's very bizarre and so that's the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>appealing thing about wildlife and wild</v>

2194
01:44:53.691 --> 01:44:55.250
<v Speaker 4>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially predators because that's what</v>

2195
01:44:55.251 --> 01:45:00.251
<v Speaker 4>we're afraid of the most were afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 4>being consumed by one of these things</v>

2196
01:45:00.351 --> 01:45:02.900
<v Speaker 4>that just consumes their consuming</v>
<v Speaker 4>machines.</v>

2197
01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:07.190
<v Speaker 4>They're just walking through the woods</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for something to consume and</v>

2198
01:45:07.191 --> 01:45:09.200
<v Speaker 4>that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They try to fuck and they try to kill</v>

2199
01:45:09.201 --> 01:45:14.201
<v Speaker 4>things to eat them and it's so bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's all going on right now</v>

2200
01:45:14.331 --> 01:45:18.050
<v Speaker 4>constantly all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most of our interactions with</v>

2201
01:45:18.051 --> 01:45:21.410
<v Speaker 4>animals or puppies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dogs or cat,</v>

2202
01:45:21.411 --> 01:45:22.940
<v Speaker 4>hey sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a can of food,</v>

2203
01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:26.120
<v Speaker 4>open the Canada and the thing about</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground up fucking chickens and got</v>

2204
01:45:26.121 --> 01:45:27.170
<v Speaker 4>stuffed in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can.</v>

2205
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:30.080
<v Speaker 4>We're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're weird and I think we're</v>

2206
01:45:30.081 --> 01:45:31.850
<v Speaker 4>disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

2207
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:33.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I.</v>

2208
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:35.390
<v Speaker 4>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm engrossed in it.</v>

2209
01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:40.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm just constantly watching nature</v>
<v Speaker 4>documentaries and paying attention to</v>

2210
01:45:40.341 --> 01:45:42.950
<v Speaker 4>articles about it and I'm fascinated by</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2211
01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Are you interested in desensitizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself to horrific images?</v>

2212
01:45:50.511 --> 01:45:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Like I've had people on my podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2213
01:45:52.001 --> 01:45:57.001
<v Speaker 3>It's usually people who came up in tech</v>
<v Speaker 3>who went through a phase where they felt</v>

2214
01:45:57.431 --> 01:46:00.760
<v Speaker 3>the need to watch beheading videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unlike anything anyone would send them,</v>

2215
01:46:00.761 --> 01:46:03.520
<v Speaker 3>they felt the need to watch it so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could handle it.</v>

2216
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:07.970
<v Speaker 4>This is a thought process that I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

2217
01:46:08.210 --> 01:46:10.940
<v Speaker 4>I get why somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if something really bothers them,</v>

2218
01:46:10.941 --> 01:46:13.520
<v Speaker 4>they would want to see it a lot and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that does happen,</v>

2219
01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:16.070
<v Speaker 4>how you see things enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get desensitized.</v>

2220
01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.570
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a really negative feeling</v>
<v Speaker 4>to watch like a reporter get his head</v>

2221
01:46:20.571 --> 01:46:22.220
<v Speaker 4>cut off by the Taliban or something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2222
01:46:22.221 --> 01:46:24.200
<v Speaker 4>It's a really negative feeling that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want.</v>

2223
01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:28.250
<v Speaker 4>I remember I watched this isis video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the last ones that I watched of</v>

2224
01:46:28.251 --> 01:46:32.120
<v Speaker 4>these guys shooting these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had them debt face down.</v>

2225
01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:34.450
<v Speaker 4>The shot them all and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just,</v>

2226
01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:37.640
<v Speaker 4>you see their body's reacting to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bullets and the climb over this guy and</v>

2227
01:46:37.641 --> 01:46:40.930
<v Speaker 4>they cut his head off and I'm watching</v>
<v Speaker 4>them dig into this guy's neck with this</v>

2228
01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:44.870
<v Speaker 4>knife and pull his head up and yell Ilog</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bar and hold it up.</v>

2229
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:47.420
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I remember thinking as I'm watching</v>

2230
01:46:47.421 --> 01:46:47.750
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2231
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:48.583
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2232
01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:51.180
<v Speaker 4>I it not wanting to use anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2233
01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.760
<v Speaker 4>I know those guys exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got it in my database.</v>

2234
01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:57.240
<v Speaker 4>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to be feeling like shit all</v>

2235
01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:58.950
<v Speaker 4>day for the rest of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thinking like,</v>

2236
01:46:58.951 --> 01:47:02.730
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck does everything goes so bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>that someone's making a youtube video</v>

2237
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.820
<v Speaker 4>gunning people down and cutting their</v>
<v Speaker 4>head off with a pocket knife.</v>

2238
01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:09.260
<v Speaker 4>I consider this what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2239
01:47:09.330 --> 01:47:10.163
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2240
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.131
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2241
01:47:11.131 --> 01:47:15.330
<v Speaker 4>that that guy lived to be 30 whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old before he shooting this guy</v>

2242
01:47:15.331 --> 01:47:20.070
<v Speaker 4>and cutting this out off like what is</v>
<v Speaker 4>his experiences in his life that led him</v>

2243
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:24.450
<v Speaker 4>to be at the point where he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 4>project this horrific image to the rest</v>

2244
01:47:24.451 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 4>of the world to put fear and terror into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eyes of the beholder.</v>

2245
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:30.570
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it that he's trying to do?</v>

2246
01:47:30.571 --> 01:47:32.280
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What has gone wrong?</v>

2247
01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.930
<v Speaker 4>What you're trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

2248
01:47:33.931 --> 01:47:37.980
<v Speaker 4>it's what you were saying about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>spectrum like this in the spectrum,</v>

2249
01:47:37.981 --> 01:47:41.400
<v Speaker 4>there's a horrific behavior is versus</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful behaviors.</v>

2250
01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:46.700
<v Speaker 4>There's this broad and I think there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something to be said for knowing that</v>

2251
01:47:48.391 --> 01:47:53.160
<v Speaker 4>darkness just so that you can understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this is also in the mix.</v>

2252
01:47:53.161 --> 01:47:56.550
<v Speaker 4>This is also in the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't look for it everywhere because</v>

2253
01:47:56.551 --> 01:48:00.210
<v Speaker 4>it'll fucking freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But knowing that it's there,</v>

2254
01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:02.750
<v Speaker 4>it's probably better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist.</v>

2255
01:48:02.770 --> 01:48:03.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2256
01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.700
<v Speaker 4>Because I think if you pretend it</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't exist,</v>

2257
01:48:05.701 --> 01:48:09.060
<v Speaker 4>that means that you pretend it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>exist in yourself.</v>

2258
01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:11.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden you're getting</v>

2259
01:48:11.131 --> 01:48:12.670
<v Speaker 4>drunk and being an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:48:12.671 --> 01:48:15.330
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine sent me an article</v>
<v Speaker 4>about this girl who went over to,</v>

2261
01:48:15.331 --> 01:48:20.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Syria to try to love her way through the</v>

2262
01:48:20.071 --> 01:48:22.860
<v Speaker 4>country and she was raped and killed</v>
<v Speaker 4>really quickly.</v>

2263
01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when he,</v>

2264
01:48:25.001 --> 01:48:26.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he sent it to me,</v>

2265
01:48:26.161 --> 01:48:28.820
<v Speaker 4>I remember like reading this article and</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking like,</v>

2266
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:30.930
<v Speaker 4>who?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would someone be so naive that they</v>

2267
01:48:30.931 --> 01:48:34.260
<v Speaker 4>think they could just go and hug all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people wanted to this land?</v>

2268
01:48:34.261 --> 01:48:37.680
<v Speaker 4>And then she was gang raped and killed</v>
<v Speaker 4>by these Muslim guys.</v>

2269
01:48:38.190 --> 01:48:43.190
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just there's a lot of people that don't</v>

2270
01:48:44.101 --> 01:48:49.101
<v Speaker 4>want to believe that some people had a</v>
<v Speaker 4>really shitty upbringing.</v>

2271
01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:53.130
<v Speaker 4>They had a shitty deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were born in a terrible part of the</v>

2272
01:48:53.131 --> 01:48:55.260
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were exposed to horrific things</v>

2273
01:48:55.261 --> 01:48:58.350
<v Speaker 4>very early on in their programming is</v>
<v Speaker 4>ugly.</v>

2274
01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:03.090
<v Speaker 4>It's dark and ugly and filled with</v>
<v Speaker 4>trauma and pain and suffering and</v>

2275
01:49:03.091 --> 01:49:05.100
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is who they are.</v>

2276
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:09.480
<v Speaker 4>But that is a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why the people that are total 100</v>

2277
01:49:09.481 --> 01:49:12.180
<v Speaker 4>percent antimilitary good luck with all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2278
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:16.140
<v Speaker 4>Good luck with it because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying is you hope for the</v>

2279
01:49:16.141 --> 01:49:18.870
<v Speaker 4>compassion of all these people in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world to,</v>

2280
01:49:18.871 --> 01:49:20.490
<v Speaker 4>that it matches up with yours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2281
01:49:20.491 --> 01:49:22.800
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't because there are parts in</v>

2282
01:49:22.801 --> 01:49:27.390
<v Speaker 4>the world where these people are 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old and for 30 years they have</v>

2283
01:49:27.391 --> 01:49:30.660
<v Speaker 4>been exposed to horrific violence and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is what they do.</v>

2284
01:49:31.050 --> 01:49:33.120
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless they die,</v>

2285
01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:36.000
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just how they behave and you are</v>

2286
01:49:36.001 --> 01:49:40.140
<v Speaker 4>going to run into them and most likely</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to enact horrific violence</v>

2287
01:49:40.141 --> 01:49:41.670
<v Speaker 4>on people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or on you.</v>

2288
01:49:42.210 --> 01:49:43.650
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2289
01:49:43.770 --> 01:49:48.250
<v Speaker 4>that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to be at a total pacifist growing</v>

2290
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:49.510
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I was young,</v>

2291
01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2292
01:49:52.241 --> 01:49:57.241
<v Speaker 3>now I recognize that that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately a beautiful but naive way</v>

2293
01:49:57.491 --> 01:49:59.350
<v Speaker 3>to go through the world because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2294
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:01.030
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a,</v>

2295
01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:05.890
<v Speaker 3>not realistic to have no military and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that you never need it because you</v>

2296
01:50:05.891 --> 01:50:06.724
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need,</v>

2297
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:10.510
<v Speaker 3>you need to be able to show strength and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be able to be protected and</v>

2298
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:14.590
<v Speaker 3>you need to crush bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it happens in different places,</v>

2299
01:50:14.591 --> 01:50:19.540
<v Speaker 3>and I hate that though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't love having to have come to that</v>

2300
01:50:19.541 --> 01:50:21.790
<v Speaker 3>conclusion like I preferred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prefer.</v>

2301
01:50:21.791 --> 01:50:25.660
<v Speaker 3>I prefer the idea that you can just hug</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and make a difference.</v>

2302
01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:27.990
<v Speaker 4>That'd be beautiful and it works in</v>
<v Speaker 4>small groups.</v>

2303
01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:31.500
<v Speaker 4>It works in some places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look at North Korea,</v>

2304
01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:34.170
<v Speaker 4>you've got a dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got some evil.</v>

2305
01:50:34.171 --> 01:50:38.700
<v Speaker 4>Fuck who's running an entire country and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it keeps people entirely under his</v>

2306
01:50:38.701 --> 01:50:42.360
<v Speaker 4>thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean literally an entire country under</v>

2307
01:50:42.361 --> 01:50:43.450
<v Speaker 4>this guise thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2308
01:50:43.710 --> 01:50:45.780
<v Speaker 4>Think about what's going on right now in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Congo.</v>

2309
01:50:45.781 --> 01:50:50.160
<v Speaker 4>Think about what's going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all throughout the darker aspects of the</v>

2310
01:50:50.161 --> 01:50:54.930
<v Speaker 4>world where people are poor and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>violence everywhere.</v>

2311
01:50:54.931 --> 01:50:59.370
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of places in the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>today that are the apocalypse there.</v>

2312
01:50:59.371 --> 01:51:02.340
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this crazy vice piece on</v>

2313
01:51:02.341 --> 01:51:05.400
<v Speaker 4>Liberia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you ever go to vice.</v>

2314
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:08.850
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come Jesus Christ have this video on</v>

2315
01:51:09.210 --> 01:51:13.050
<v Speaker 4>Liberia and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they call him general butt naked because</v>

2316
01:51:13.051 --> 01:51:13.560
<v Speaker 4>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2317
01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:16.080
<v Speaker 4>he would go into fights naked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You going to end.</v>

2318
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:17.490
<v Speaker 4>He was a part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2319
01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:20.940
<v Speaker 4>civil war that was going on in Liberia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was accountable.</v>

2320
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:23.430
<v Speaker 4>He killed babies from these neighboring</v>
<v Speaker 4>tribes.</v>

2321
01:51:23.431 --> 01:51:27.030
<v Speaker 4>He would go over and kill the children</v>
<v Speaker 4>and eat their heart and they thought</v>

2322
01:51:27.031 --> 01:51:29.400
<v Speaker 4>that like eating a piece of a children's</v>
<v Speaker 4>heart,</v>

2323
01:51:29.670 --> 01:51:31.920
<v Speaker 4>a child's heart would protect you in</v>
<v Speaker 4>battle.</v>

2324
01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:36.300
<v Speaker 4>They would cover themselves with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>blood of these innocent children and run</v>

2325
01:51:36.301 --> 01:51:40.050
<v Speaker 4>through these fucking neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just horrific,</v>

2326
01:51:40.051 --> 01:51:42.570
<v Speaker 4>horrific stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's going on right now.</v>

2327
01:51:42.571 --> 01:51:47.340
<v Speaker 4>Like Liberia right now is a terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying place.</v>

2328
01:51:47.670 --> 01:51:49.980
<v Speaker 4>And if it happened in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she would say,</v>

2329
01:51:49.981 --> 01:51:52.230
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the apocalypse is here.</v>

2330
01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:57.030
<v Speaker 4>What's the apocalypse is here on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not in woodland hills.</v>

2331
01:51:57.031 --> 01:52:00.240
<v Speaker 4>It's not in studio city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not in Beverly Hills,</v>

2332
01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:01.530
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's here.</v>

2333
01:52:01.650 --> 01:52:02.483
<v Speaker 4>It's on earth.</v>

2334
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I like that.</v>

2335
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:11.530
<v Speaker 3>The awareness of how much fucked up shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>is happening all over the place is when</v>

2336
01:52:12.501 --> 01:52:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I am tuned into that frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt very overwhelmed and just</v>

2337
01:52:16.461 --> 01:52:17.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2338
01:52:17.331 --> 01:52:19.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I have to do anything,</v>

2339
01:52:19.941 --> 01:52:24.941
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I don't know what to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that because like on my show,</v>

2340
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:27.500
<v Speaker 3>my show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was twice a week and on a Thursday</v>

2341
01:52:27.501 --> 01:52:30.200
<v Speaker 3>show I've started featuring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend of mine who's a dog</v>

2342
01:52:30.201 --> 01:52:34.430
<v Speaker 3>trainer and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes to specifically the downy</v>

2343
01:52:34.431 --> 01:52:35.780
<v Speaker 3>shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but other shelters</v>

2344
01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:41.330
<v Speaker 3>kill shelters and takes these dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>trains them and gets them more</v>

2345
01:52:41.331 --> 01:52:44.750
<v Speaker 3>adoptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I've been featuring a dog a week</v>

2346
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:47.480
<v Speaker 3>hoping to try to get the word out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2347
01:52:47.630 --> 01:52:50.240
<v Speaker 3>but now that I'm aware of all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different dogs,</v>

2348
01:52:50.241 --> 01:52:53.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm also aware when all of a sudden you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the website and it says,</v>

2349
01:52:53.661 --> 01:52:54.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's,</v>

2350
01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:55.850
<v Speaker 3>I was no longer available.</v>

2351
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:57.830
<v Speaker 3>And I know what that means now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2352
01:52:57.890 --> 01:53:01.880
<v Speaker 3>it means that dog has been put down as</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to so and so may not be</v>

2353
01:53:01.881 --> 01:53:04.730
<v Speaker 3>available or so and so has been adopted</v>
<v Speaker 3>or so and so's with a rescue.</v>

2354
01:53:04.731 --> 01:53:07.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when it says is no longer</v>

2355
01:53:07.221 --> 01:53:09.320
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I used to just think,</v>

2356
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:10.700
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone adopted that dog.</v>

2357
01:53:10.701 --> 01:53:11.091
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2358
01:53:11.091 --> 01:53:14.000
<v Speaker 3>that dog got put down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now that I'm aware of all this,</v>

2359
01:53:14.001 --> 01:53:19.001
<v Speaker 3>I find I'm get emotionally attached to</v>
<v Speaker 3>each dog that I don't personally know.</v>

2360
01:53:19.730 --> 01:53:22.820
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm overwhelmed with the sadness of</v>

2361
01:53:22.821 --> 01:53:24.800
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think like this is,</v>

2362
01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:29.540
<v Speaker 3>this is nothing compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrendous awfulness on every level.</v>

2363
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:33.290
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to that thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make the tiniest difference in</v>

2364
01:53:33.291 --> 01:53:37.880
<v Speaker 3>one little life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy for me to just feel</v>

2365
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.090
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try to even be doing anything because</v>

2366
01:53:41.091 --> 01:53:42.550
<v Speaker 3>there's always something so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much</v>

2367
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:44.440
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2368
01:53:44.610 --> 01:53:46.960
<v Speaker 4>that's a good way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is always something somewhere,</v>

2369
01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:52.120
<v Speaker 4>something so much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think in some weird way that also</v>

2370
01:53:52.121 --> 01:53:54.250
<v Speaker 4>makes us appreciate when things are</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

2371
01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:59.110
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the more unique</v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects of today is that you can pay</v>

2372
01:53:59.111 --> 01:54:02.020
<v Speaker 4>attention to some of the horrific parts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world and go,</v>

2373
01:54:02.021 --> 01:54:04.290
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are so fucking lucky that we're not</v>

2374
01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:07.540
<v Speaker 4>trapped in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're so lucky that we're not living in</v>

2375
01:54:07.541 --> 01:54:09.190
<v Speaker 4>the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're so lucky that.</v>

2376
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend Justin,</v>

2377
01:54:12.010 --> 01:54:12.843
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2378
01:54:13.090 --> 01:54:17.290
<v Speaker 4>builds wells in the Congo and he goes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Congo and he's there for like six</v>

2379
01:54:17.291 --> 01:54:20.710
<v Speaker 4>months at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just got malaria for the second time and</v>

2380
01:54:21.250 --> 01:54:22.710
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a,</v>

2381
01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:27.350
<v Speaker 4>just a gem of a human being and he is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of this,</v>

2382
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:32.650
<v Speaker 4>this charity called fight for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>forgotten where he goes and it helps</v>

2383
01:54:32.651 --> 01:54:37.330
<v Speaker 4>these pygmies build water wells and</v>
<v Speaker 4>maintains them for them and stuff like</v>

2384
01:54:37.331 --> 01:54:37.660
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2385
01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:42.190
<v Speaker 4>But this guy's experience when he talks</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the horrific plight of these</v>

2386
01:54:42.191 --> 01:54:45.610
<v Speaker 4>people and we'll all the gun through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gone through and all the persecution</v>

2387
01:54:45.611 --> 01:54:49.480
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've experienced it just really you</v>

2388
01:54:49.481 --> 01:54:51.670
<v Speaker 4>leave and you want to be nicer to</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2389
01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:54.750
<v Speaker 4>You want to listen to him talk and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to his experiences.</v>

2390
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:58.330
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you one have hope because the guy's</v>

2391
01:54:58.331 --> 01:55:01.840
<v Speaker 4>willing to leave Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Texas and fly down to the Congo and,</v>

2392
01:55:01.841 --> 01:55:04.930
<v Speaker 4>and become a part of these people's</v>
<v Speaker 4>lives and try to help them and elevate</v>

2393
01:55:04.931 --> 01:55:07.180
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's all this hope for humanity in</v>

2394
01:55:07.181 --> 01:55:10.840
<v Speaker 4>that this person that has no real</v>
<v Speaker 4>connection with these folks other than</v>

2395
01:55:10.841 --> 01:55:14.080
<v Speaker 4>just meeting them once and then falling</v>
<v Speaker 4>in love with their tribe,</v>

2396
01:55:14.770 --> 01:55:16.780
<v Speaker 4>that that is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's also,</v>

2397
01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:18.520
<v Speaker 4>it makes you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2398
01:55:18.521 --> 01:55:22.510
<v Speaker 4>we were looking for problems today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're looking for things to be</v>

2399
01:55:22.511 --> 01:55:24.040
<v Speaker 4>automated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should I fixed my nose?</v>

2400
01:55:24.230 --> 01:55:27.910
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But things could be so much worse.</v>

2401
01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.910
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes back to that spectrum and the</v>

2402
01:55:30.911 --> 01:55:34.300
<v Speaker 4>spectrum of information that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we can access today.</v>

2403
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:38.180
<v Speaker 4>It's almost mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain is really not a,</v>

2404
01:55:38.590 --> 01:55:43.150
<v Speaker 4>it's not really available to tune into</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different parts,</v>

2405
01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:45.120
<v Speaker 4>the world all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you could,</v>

2406
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 4>it's so easy to lose focus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy to lose</v>

2407
01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:50.370
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

2408
01:55:50.371 --> 01:55:51.270
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2409
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I went to France a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could go because you go to Paris.</v>

2410
01:55:56.130 --> 01:55:58.770
<v Speaker 3>I did three scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2411
01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we originally were going to go in</v>

2412
01:56:02.581 --> 01:56:07.581
<v Speaker 3>December and we rescheduled even though</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that the chances of anything</v>

2413
01:56:07.891 --> 01:56:11.010
<v Speaker 3>actually happening are so small and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost that thing of like,</v>

2414
01:56:11.011 --> 01:56:13.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that special that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's going to happen to me,</v>

2415
01:56:13.621 --> 01:56:16.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there is that after the</v>

2416
01:56:16.231 --> 01:56:18.180
<v Speaker 3>attack we started thinking maybe this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2417
01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:20.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why were we going in the winter anyway?</v>

2418
01:56:20.161 --> 01:56:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Everyone says it's not the best time to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

2419
01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:24.870
<v Speaker 3>so let's just postpone it because we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>always been debating should we go in</v>

2420
01:56:24.871 --> 01:56:25.860
<v Speaker 3>December,</v>
<v Speaker 3>April.</v>

2421
01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then after I,</v>

2422
01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:33.690
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't scared once we made the</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision to go,</v>

2423
01:56:33.691 --> 01:56:35.550
<v Speaker 3>but I wondered are we making the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision?</v>

2424
01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:38.940
<v Speaker 3>But once I was there I was absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also moved to New York.</v>

2425
01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm like shortly after nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once I was there I was not scared.</v>

2426
01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:43.710
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2427
01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:46.860
<v Speaker 3>feel like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fear is more in contemplating going</v>

2428
01:56:46.861 --> 01:56:48.110
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2429
01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:52.440
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being there,</v>

2430
01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:56.640
<v Speaker 3>being in another country where my daily</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts aren't like,</v>

2431
01:56:56.641 --> 01:56:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to check twitter all the time</v>

2432
01:56:58.111 --> 01:56:59.580
<v Speaker 3>and I've got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whatever.</v>

2433
01:56:59.581 --> 01:57:04.290
<v Speaker 3>The bullshit of my daily life is having</v>
<v Speaker 3>that instead be replaced with,</v>

2434
01:57:04.291 --> 01:57:08.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to remember how to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>this word and try and like trying to</v>

2435
01:57:08.551 --> 01:57:10.950
<v Speaker 3>communicate with people and hoping they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can understand me.</v>

2436
01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and looking into all this beautiful art</v>

2437
01:57:15.211 --> 01:57:16.350
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that you do.</v>

2438
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really upon coming back,</v>

2439
01:57:19.711 --> 01:57:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm finding readjusting into the date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My daily routine is more difficult and I</v>

2440
01:57:24.331 --> 01:57:29.331
<v Speaker 3>don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go back to a caring so</v>

2441
01:57:29.731 --> 01:57:33.060
<v Speaker 3>much about minute bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's kind of the gift of</v>

2442
01:57:33.061 --> 01:57:34.650
<v Speaker 3>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not local travel,</v>

2443
01:57:34.690 --> 01:57:37.680
<v Speaker 3>not small trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the gift of going to another country</v>

2444
01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:39.270
<v Speaker 3>or being around people who speak a</v>
<v Speaker 3>different language,</v>

2445
01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:43.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it kind of like takes your brain</v>

2446
01:57:43.561 --> 01:57:48.030
<v Speaker 3>and treat it like a snow globe and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything kind of gets readjusted and</v>

2447
01:57:48.031 --> 01:57:52.260
<v Speaker 3>you remember that there's a so much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>than whatever it is you've been waking</v>

2448
01:57:52.261 --> 01:57:53.250
<v Speaker 3>up and thinking about</v>

2449
01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:57.150
<v Speaker 4>also that their world is so vastly</v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

2450
01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:59.730
<v Speaker 4>The language is different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sounds they make are different.</v>

2451
01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:03.150
<v Speaker 4>Their traditions are different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their customs are different,</v>

2452
01:58:03.151 --> 01:58:05.670
<v Speaker 4>the food they eat is different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The neighborhoods,</v>

2453
01:58:05.671 --> 01:58:07.830
<v Speaker 4>they walked down and live in our</v>
<v Speaker 4>different there.</v>

2454
01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:10.890
<v Speaker 4>There are established patterns are just</v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

2455
01:58:10.891 --> 01:58:13.800
<v Speaker 4>And then when you experience those</v>
<v Speaker 4>different patterns and different</v>

2456
01:58:13.801 --> 01:58:16.190
<v Speaker 4>cultures and different cities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

2457
01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:17.400
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you just go,</v>

2458
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:19.620
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big fucking world.</v>

2459
01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:20.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2460
01:58:20.770 --> 01:58:22.960
<v Speaker 3>might it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's so easy to think that it's</v>

2461
01:58:22.961 --> 01:58:27.700
<v Speaker 3>all exactly as that your life is very</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to whatever the life that</v>

2462
01:58:27.701 --> 01:58:29.160
<v Speaker 3>everyone else is living in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go out there.</v>

2463
01:58:30.330 --> 01:58:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Like I kept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking,</v>

2464
01:58:31.290 --> 01:58:32.051
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2465
01:58:32.051 --> 01:58:35.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not like I was in the rain forest</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

2466
01:58:35.621 --> 01:58:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Like I recognized I was in a place that</v>
<v Speaker 3>all things considered is actually pretty</v>

2467
01:58:39.581 --> 01:58:41.970
<v Speaker 3>similar to where we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2468
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:46.120
<v Speaker 3>we went out to [inaudible] one day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of drove to the countryside and</v>

2469
01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:50.350
<v Speaker 3>that's where Monet Monet lived and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he painted,</v>

2470
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:51.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2471
01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:54.460
<v Speaker 3>it's his house and there's the gardens</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he painted.</v>

2472
01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go visit his house.</v>

2473
01:58:56.170 --> 01:58:59.590
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was thinking,</v>

2474
01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.700
<v Speaker 3>what if you just lived out here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is,</v>

2475
01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:06.220
<v Speaker 3>what is that life like to your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2476
01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:07.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour,</v>

2477
01:59:08.110 --> 01:59:10.150
<v Speaker 3>you're in the countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do they do?</v>

2478
01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:12.010
<v Speaker 3>What goes on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of course,</v>

2479
01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:13.600
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's like,</v>

2480
01:59:13.601 --> 01:59:15.710
<v Speaker 3>it feels like very little goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's probably not.</v>

2481
01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:20.240
<v Speaker 4>Well I think it's similar to the drive</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to San Francisco,</v>

2482
01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:23.990
<v Speaker 4>drive up to San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take the five and you stop at one of</v>

2483
01:59:23.991 --> 01:59:28.160
<v Speaker 4>those like farm towns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like what in the fuck you know,</v>

2484
01:59:28.161 --> 01:59:31.310
<v Speaker 4>and I want to go to a restaurant and</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to some kid is like washing dishes</v>

2485
01:59:31.311 --> 01:59:32.144
<v Speaker 4>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2486
01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.250
<v Speaker 4>grow up here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck did you do?</v>

2487
01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:35.960
<v Speaker 4>What do you guys do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much math do you guys have?</v>

2488
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:38.990
<v Speaker 4>Like what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where people get like super</v>

2489
01:59:38.991 --> 01:59:43.420
<v Speaker 4>desperado and drugs too because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>just looking for some kind of crazy</v>

2490
01:59:43.421 --> 01:59:46.310
<v Speaker 4>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll just drive into town of 3000</v>

2491
01:59:46.311 --> 01:59:47.750
<v Speaker 4>people in the middle of nowhere and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2492
01:59:47.751 --> 01:59:50.410
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the.</v>

2493
01:59:51.530 --> 01:59:54.230
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of right wing shit up</v>
<v Speaker 4>there too.</v>

2494
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:56.150
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the weirdest things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always think.</v>

2495
01:59:56.210 --> 01:59:59.720
<v Speaker 4>I always think of California as being</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty left wing,</v>

2496
01:59:59.721 --> 02:00:01.400
<v Speaker 4>pretty open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty liberal.</v>

2497
02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:04.980
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in Orange County,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I did not have that sense of awe</v>

2498
02:00:05.710 --> 02:00:08.560
<v Speaker 4>when you drive up like through the farm</v>
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>

2499
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:12.130
<v Speaker 4>like you'll see like these gigantic Mitt</v>
<v Speaker 4>Romney for president sides.</v>

2500
02:00:12.131 --> 02:00:14.490
<v Speaker 4>This was like during the election,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2501
02:00:14.590 --> 02:00:16.890
<v Speaker 4>I remember driving up there going like</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

2502
02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:18.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama is the,</v>

2503
02:00:18.610 --> 02:00:21.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the real enemy of our country,</v>

2504
02:00:21.461 --> 02:00:24.280
<v Speaker 4>like these big ass billboards where</v>
<v Speaker 4>people had put up not,</v>

2505
02:00:24.281 --> 02:00:27.880
<v Speaker 4>not just like a thought that they had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they wanted to project it out to</v>

2506
02:00:27.881 --> 02:00:30.790
<v Speaker 4>everybody driving up there buying apples</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever the fuck they're buying</v>

2507
02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:35.320
<v Speaker 4>apples or math or math.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were part of Orange County from</v>

2508
02:00:35.630 --> 02:00:39.280
<v Speaker 3>a corona del Mar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super right wing,</v>

2509
02:00:39.281 --> 02:00:40.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very.</v>

2510
02:00:40.451 --> 02:00:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It waS very homogenous.</v>

2511
02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very white,</v>

2512
02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:45.820
<v Speaker 3>very blond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue eyed,</v>

2513
02:00:46.290 --> 02:00:48.670
<v Speaker 3>great athletic killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2514
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:52.040
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

2515
02:00:52.090 --> 02:00:56.100
<v Speaker 3>that's their cash crop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Journalistic is very athletic and we'll</v>

2516
02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:01.060
<v Speaker 3>just that foR the kids that I went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>school with were just very good at</v>

2517
02:01:01.061 --> 02:01:04.380
<v Speaker 3>sports and they valued that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2518
02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:05.650
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2519
02:01:05.651 --> 02:01:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely do not feel like I fit in.</v>

2520
02:01:07.451 --> 02:01:08.410
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2521
02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:13.590
<v Speaker 3>it was round and soft and pasty and had</v>
<v Speaker 3>black hair and brown eyes and just could</v>

2522
02:01:14.531 --> 02:01:16.050
<v Speaker 3>not keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2523
02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:21.700
<v Speaker 3>I always joked that it was like a leni</v>
<v Speaker 3>riefenstahl wet dream there.</v>

2524
02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:25.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just very this very that,</v>

2525
02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:28.810
<v Speaker 3>that the pride of white people there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2526
02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.980
<v Speaker 3>and I resented growing up there and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I got older I realized all the,</v>

2527
02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:34.960
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2528
02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I realize why my parents moved there</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was born in oakland and</v>

2529
02:01:38.471 --> 02:01:39.680
<v Speaker 3>apparently it was kind of rough.</v>

2530
02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:41.060
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2531
02:01:41.090 --> 02:01:45.500
<v Speaker 3>they fled with the rest of the white</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to orange county where it's</v>

2532
02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:50.450
<v Speaker 3>incredibly safe and everything is</v>
<v Speaker 3>manicured and the schools are nice and</v>

2533
02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:54.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's safe being the prominent thing I</v>

2534
02:01:54.501 --> 02:01:56.330
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And growing up I was like,</v>

2535
02:01:56.331 --> 02:02:00.620
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck would you choose this place</v>

2536
02:02:00.621 --> 02:02:03.800
<v Speaker 3>where we're so different in every way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then eVeryone here,</v>

2537
02:02:03.810 --> 02:02:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2538
02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:06.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an older,</v>

2539
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:08.520
<v Speaker 3>as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go back and I,</v>

2540
02:02:08.521 --> 02:02:11.630
<v Speaker 3>and I see it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's nice and it is peaceful and it is</v>

2541
02:02:11.631 --> 02:02:14.960
<v Speaker 3>calm and I get why you'd want to raise</v>
<v Speaker 3>your kids there.</v>

2542
02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:18.200
<v Speaker 3>It was weird that you get these groups</v>
<v Speaker 3>of white people together and they just</v>

2543
02:02:18.201 --> 02:02:19.070
<v Speaker 3>calm the fuck down.</v>

2544
02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm just looking to sit with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>other white people and calm down.</v>

2545
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:28.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing the irvine improv this</v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend,</v>

2546
02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:33.590
<v Speaker 3>like the safest city in America and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking 100 years running or something</v>

2547
02:02:33.591 --> 02:02:36.110
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in a bar in town and I thought</v>

2548
02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:39.020
<v Speaker 3>irvine was more boring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more boring,</v>

2549
02:02:39.710 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's a great place to do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice folks.</v>

2550
02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2552
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:51.320
<v Speaker 3>What was your path to get into</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasting?</v>

<v Speaker 3>And stuff,</v>

2561
02:03:09.450 --> 02:03:11.990
<v Speaker 3>I was good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very in love with myself.</v>

2562
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:15.520
<v Speaker 3>I was like la times today,</v>

<v Speaker 3>young and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>there's just no stopping me.</v>

2568
02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:34.700
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2569
02:03:34.701 --> 02:03:35.660

<v Speaker 3>And I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2574
02:03:45.171 --> 02:03:48.230
<v Speaker 3>playing in a band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing for the osi weekly while</v>

<v Speaker 3>I played drums too.</v>

2577
02:03:52.251 --> 02:03:54.760
<v Speaker 3>I was the drummer initially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2578
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:57.290
<v Speaker 3>and there were three of us and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2579
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:58.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get too in love with me because</v>

2580
02:03:58.881 --> 02:04:00.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm not staying in orange county for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice.</v>

2581
02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Moved back to orange county and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>there for five years after college and</v>

2582
02:04:04.071 --> 02:04:06.560
<v Speaker 3>the entire time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not where I'm supposed to be,</v>

2583
02:04:06.561 --> 02:04:08.210
<v Speaker 3>this is not what I wanted to do with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2584
02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:10.880
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it was such an unpleasant</v>

2585
02:04:10.881 --> 02:04:13.090
<v Speaker 3>asshole to be around because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2586
02:04:13.530 --> 02:04:14.960
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2587
02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:16.970
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've changed.</v>

2588
02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:20.030
<v Speaker 3>But back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2589
02:04:20.031 --> 02:04:23.060
<v Speaker 3>it was like a year for the band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like don't get too used to.</v>

2590
02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:25.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not staying here.</v>

2591
02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Experiences limb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2592
02:04:27.051 --> 02:04:30.200
<v Speaker 3>And especially I feel bad because a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of the people in the band,</v>

2593
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:32.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're still in bands,</v>

2594
02:04:32.451 --> 02:04:35.030
<v Speaker 3>like they really wanted to make this</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen and I was like,</v>

2595
02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:38.370
<v Speaker 3>this is just my stupid little thing I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing on the side while I'm pursuing</v>

2596
02:04:38.371 --> 02:04:40.470
<v Speaker 3>what I'm really trying to pursue in</v>
<v Speaker 3>college.</v>

2597
02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.770
<v Speaker 3>I love the college I went to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I went to college,</v>

2598
02:04:43.771 --> 02:04:45.930
<v Speaker 3>I believe in college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also think it can make you a</v>

2599
02:04:45.931 --> 02:04:48.960
<v Speaker 3>little bit insufferable and that's who I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was when I graduated.</v>

2600
02:04:48.961 --> 02:04:52.620
<v Speaker 3>So I was writing at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2601
02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:57.930
<v Speaker 3>I have to have like my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the life that I want to lead is headed</v>

2602
02:04:57.931 --> 02:04:59.970
<v Speaker 3>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the one I'm leading is going this</v>

2603
02:04:59.971 --> 02:05:01.440
<v Speaker 3>way and I've got to bridge the gap.</v>

2604
02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:04.860
<v Speaker 3>So I moved To New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made the decision to move to New York</v>

2605
02:05:04.861 --> 02:05:08.160
<v Speaker 3>and then nine slash 11 happened like six</v>
<v Speaker 3>days after I made the decision and I was</v>

2606
02:05:08.161 --> 02:05:08.851
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

2607
02:05:08.851 --> 02:05:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm going anyway even though I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I did though.</v>

2608
02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:15.060
<v Speaker 3>What was the thought process behind New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York?</v>

2609
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2610
02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:21.060
<v Speaker 3>so the most cosmopolitan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most writing because that was my,</v>

2611
02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:23.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing for magazines was my thing and</v>

2612
02:05:23.071 --> 02:05:27.480
<v Speaker 3>writing in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of the way it was where all</v>

2613
02:05:27.481 --> 02:05:29.790
<v Speaker 3>that took place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all the people that I was talking</v>

2614
02:05:29.791 --> 02:05:31.440
<v Speaker 3>to when I was freelancing for national</v>
<v Speaker 3>magazines,</v>

2615
02:05:31.441 --> 02:05:33.780
<v Speaker 3>we're based in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just seemed like the place to go for</v>

2616
02:05:33.781 --> 02:05:35.490
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also,</v>

2617
02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:40.760
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be in a city and I remember</v>
<v Speaker 3>my band toured and I met this guy and I</v>

2618
02:05:42.091 --> 02:05:45.660
<v Speaker 3>was walking around san francisco and san</v>
<v Speaker 3>francisco felt like such a city to me</v>

2619
02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:47.760
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want to be in a place that has</v>

2620
02:05:47.761 --> 02:05:49.320
<v Speaker 3>the feel of a city.</v>

2621
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:54.830
<v Speaker 3>And I met this guy who worked at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>venue that we were playing and he was</v>

2622
02:05:54.871 --> 02:05:58.740
<v Speaker 3>telling me that he was moving to</v>
<v Speaker 3>brooklyn because san francisco Just</v>

2623
02:05:58.741 --> 02:06:01.770
<v Speaker 3>wasn't enough of a city for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember the kind of that was</v>

2624
02:06:01.771 --> 02:06:02.670
<v Speaker 3>blowing my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>

2625
02:06:02.671 --> 02:06:05.430
<v Speaker 3>this feels like such a city to me if</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't the city enough,</v>

2626
02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:08.610
<v Speaker 3>like what am I doing in these cow</v>
<v Speaker 3>pastures in orange county?</v>

2627
02:06:09.090 --> 02:06:10.320
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2628
02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:15.500
<v Speaker 3>I made the decision to move and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually moved and I was there for</v>

2629
02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:19.170
<v Speaker 3>about nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First couple of years,</v>

2630
02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:24.120
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more difficult than I thought it</v>

2631
02:06:24.121 --> 02:06:24.490
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2632
02:06:24.490 --> 02:06:28.230
<v Speaker 3>I felt weirdly insecure and I hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>expected to feel socially insecure,</v>

2633
02:06:28.231 --> 02:06:29.430
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left everything.</v>

2634
02:06:29.431 --> 02:06:30.350
<v Speaker 3>I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left the bay.</v>

2635
02:06:30.370 --> 02:06:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't know where I fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly,</v>

2636
02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:36.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially after having been in the band</v>

2637
02:06:36.121 --> 02:06:39.330
<v Speaker 3>like that my whole life during the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the band was,</v>

2638
02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:42.030
<v Speaker 3>and also I wrote about music before I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was ever in the band,</v>

2639
02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:47.420
<v Speaker 3>so my life was going to shows or playing</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows and I had a group of friends and a</v>

2640
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:50.280
<v Speaker 3>community that I really missed once I</v>
<v Speaker 3>left them.</v>

2641
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:52.110
<v Speaker 3>So then I was in New York and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2642
02:06:52.111 --> 02:06:55.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't have friends and I don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>job and I'm freelancing,</v>

2643
02:06:55.381 --> 02:06:57.450
<v Speaker 3>but it's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I'm doing and I feel</v>

2644
02:06:57.451 --> 02:07:00.420
<v Speaker 3>very alone and I feel uncomfortable and</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

2645
02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:03.570
<v Speaker 3>Thankfully that went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just took longer than I thought it</v>

2646
02:07:03.571 --> 02:07:05.070
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2647
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:10.430
<v Speaker 3>got a job at time out New York where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked for a number of years and while I</v>

2648
02:07:10.951 --> 02:07:13.250
<v Speaker 3>was at time out New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2649
02:07:13.290 --> 02:07:17.130
<v Speaker 3>they were looking for editors to go on</v>
<v Speaker 3>television to talk about events goIng on</v>

2650
02:07:17.131 --> 02:07:18.390
<v Speaker 3>in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

2651
02:07:18.391 --> 02:07:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2652
02:07:18.930 --> 02:07:21.330
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2653
02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:24.990
<v Speaker 3>and it was channel four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So wbc,</v>

2654
02:07:25.950 --> 02:07:30.000
<v Speaker 3>they really liked me and they wanted me</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep coming back and doing it every</v>

2655
02:07:30.001 --> 02:07:31.340
<v Speaker 3>saturday morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2656
02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:34.140
<v Speaker 3>so when they initially they were going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a group of editors doing it and</v>

2657
02:07:34.141 --> 02:07:37.730
<v Speaker 3>they decided they just wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was,</v>

2658
02:07:37.930 --> 02:07:41.380
<v Speaker 3>was great because I was so destined for</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatness and it gets all happening.</v>

2659
02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:43.800
<v Speaker 3>That's how I felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2660
02:07:44.630 --> 02:07:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's clear that I'm trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>self deprecating worry.</v>

2661
02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:51.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming off as an asshole</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

2662
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:54.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I began doing that a lot and I realized</v>

2663
02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:55.990
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed the,</v>

2664
02:07:55.991 --> 02:07:58.550
<v Speaker 3>that performance element.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm right.</v>

2665
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:59.920
<v Speaker 3>I like to go on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on camera.</v>

2666
02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started doing other tv stuff.</v>

2667
02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I was aware of youtube and I</v>

2668
02:08:08.261 --> 02:08:10.370
<v Speaker 3>was experimenting with youtube and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting my,</v>

2669
02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:13.780
<v Speaker 3>my television clips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started doing a lot of new stuff.</v>

2670
02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:18.040
<v Speaker 3>I was putting my television clips on</v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube and then I don't know what made</v>

2671
02:08:18.041 --> 02:08:18.910
<v Speaker 3>me decide one day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2672
02:08:18.911 --> 02:08:22.390
<v Speaker 3>what if I just recorded myself doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>some book reviews.</v>

2673
02:08:22.570 --> 02:08:23.560
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I just did,</v>

2674
02:08:23.561 --> 02:08:24.550
<v Speaker 3>just talked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2675
02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:28.180
<v Speaker 3>the question to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like talk directly to my little bit of</v>

2676
02:08:28.181 --> 02:08:30.400
<v Speaker 3>an audience that I'm beginning to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>because have a blog as well.</v>

2677
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I did that and the response to</v>

2678
02:08:33.731 --> 02:08:35.170
<v Speaker 3>that was so overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2679
02:08:35.171 --> 02:08:37.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't care if it's polished when</v>

2680
02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:40.120
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more about the immediacy and it's</v>

2681
02:08:40.121 --> 02:08:42.510
<v Speaker 3>more about you talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started getting into that and</v>

2682
02:08:42.511 --> 02:08:45.000
<v Speaker 3>started doing the various web shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2683
02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:47.170
<v Speaker 3>and then I created a show called alison</v>
<v Speaker 3>rosen engineer,</v>

2684
02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:51.130
<v Speaker 3>best friend on ustream and I would do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2685
02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:55.120
<v Speaker 3>It was a talk show from my living room</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I woUld do for three hours every</v>

2686
02:08:55.121 --> 02:08:59.620
<v Speaker 3>sunday evening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was not that dissimilar.</v>

2687
02:08:59.621 --> 02:09:02.920
<v Speaker 3>There's so many negatives in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sentence from the podcasts that I have</v>

2688
02:09:02.921 --> 02:09:04.030
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I started.</v>

2689
02:09:04.031 --> 02:09:06.400
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the segments that I do now was</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that show.</v>

2690
02:09:06.401 --> 02:09:09.820
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was used streaming you</v>

2691
02:09:09.821 --> 02:09:13.960
<v Speaker 3>were also on ustream and oftentimes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the front page of ustream it would,</v>

2692
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:16.240
<v Speaker 3>it would have me and you way back when?</v>

2693
02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:17.103
<v Speaker 3>Cruising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ma'am.</v>

2694
02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Are you still on ustream?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2695
02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:23.890
<v Speaker 3>we don't stream on ustream anymore</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were doing it and we're</v>

2696
02:09:23.891 --> 02:09:25.900
<v Speaker 3>trying to do it simultaneously with</v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>

2697
02:09:25.901 --> 02:09:28.240
<v Speaker 3>But there's something wrong with our tri</v>
<v Speaker 3>caster.</v>

2698
02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:31.270
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still sucks when it doesn't really want</v>

2699
02:09:31.271 --> 02:09:31.961
<v Speaker 3>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would work.</v>

2700
02:09:31.961 --> 02:09:35.420
<v Speaker 3>It's just not solid and in one will drop</v>
<v Speaker 3>off and crash.</v>

2701
02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:40.570
<v Speaker 3>So we had to choose one platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about youtube is youtube</v>

2702
02:09:40.571 --> 02:09:44.200
<v Speaker 3>lets you pause and it lets you backtrack</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're actually watching it.</v>

2703
02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Ustream doesn't support that future and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more users or watching youtube.</v>

2704
02:09:48.971 --> 02:09:51.850
<v Speaker 3>So we just decided to jump ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2705
02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2706
02:09:56.810 --> 02:09:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I had begun to wonder</v>

2707
02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:05.940
<v Speaker 3>is the audience there for online</v>
<v Speaker 3>streaming visual stuff in the same way</v>

2708
02:10:07.161 --> 02:10:09.600
<v Speaker 3>that they're there for podcasts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember listening,</v>

2709
02:10:09.610 --> 02:10:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I was friends with doug benson and</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to his podcast and I got this</v>

2710
02:10:12.561 --> 02:10:17.050
<v Speaker 3>curiosity about podcasts and then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard that adam corolla was looking for</v>

2711
02:10:17.051 --> 02:10:19.730
<v Speaker 3>a news girl and I was still in New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time,</v>

2712
02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:23.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I like tried to send them my stuff</v>

2713
02:10:23.391 --> 02:10:24.800
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't hear anything and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2714
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:27.860
<v Speaker 3>well I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did what I can and no one's getting</v>

2715
02:10:27.861 --> 02:10:28.860
<v Speaker 3>back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2716
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:33.910
<v Speaker 3>and then very rapIdly someone in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>family got sick and I moved from New</v>

2717
02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:38.570
<v Speaker 3>York to California to be with them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we didn't.</v>

2718
02:10:38.970 --> 02:10:41.330
<v Speaker 3>That turns that that person Is actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing very well now.</v>

2719
02:10:41.331 --> 02:10:43.430
<v Speaker 3>But at the time it wasn't clear what</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction it was going to go.</v>

2720
02:10:43.431 --> 02:10:45.530
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't make sense to stay in New</v>

2721
02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:46.730
<v Speaker 3>York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2722
02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:48.500
<v Speaker 3>when this was happening.</v>

2723
02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:53.480
<v Speaker 3>So I moved back kind of suddenly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then around the time that I was</v>

2724
02:10:53.481 --> 02:10:56.450
<v Speaker 3>lying on my parent's couch being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell did I do?</v>

2725
02:10:56.451 --> 02:10:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Why did I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that I made the right</v>

2726
02:10:58.731 --> 02:10:59.570
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And coming back,</v>

2727
02:10:59.571 --> 02:11:03.410
<v Speaker 3>I got an email from like august and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think the entire message was in the</v>

2728
02:11:03.411 --> 02:11:05.870
<v Speaker 3>subject line and it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2729
02:11:06.110 --> 02:11:07.820
<v Speaker 3>adam carolla show this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this time,</v>

2730
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:09.620
<v Speaker 3>can you come in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said sure.</v>

2731
02:11:10.610 --> 02:11:14.120
<v Speaker 3>So I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I auditioned and then they narrowed</v>

2732
02:11:14.121 --> 02:11:17.120
<v Speaker 3>it down to like four of us and then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>auditioned again and then I got the job.</v>

2733
02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:19.040
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2734
02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:22.580
<v Speaker 3>it was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like doing your own thing better?</v>

2735
02:11:23.230 --> 02:11:26.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I began doing my own thing while I was</v>

2736
02:11:26.361 --> 02:11:30.860
<v Speaker 3>still there and I really enjoy doing my</v>
<v Speaker 3>own thing.</v>

2737
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also really liked being on that show</v>

2738
02:11:33.861 --> 02:11:34.581
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2739
02:11:34.581 --> 02:11:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm grateful for the four years that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had there and I,</v>

2740
02:11:39.650 --> 02:11:44.650
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of positive memories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also a fair amount of things that I</v>

2741
02:11:44.721 --> 02:11:45.800
<v Speaker 3>think that was fucked up.</v>

2742
02:11:46.130 --> 02:11:51.130
<v Speaker 3>But you just sort of what I just did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to.</v>

2743
02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:57.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you do want me to.</v>

2744
02:11:57.770 --> 02:11:59.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to do,</v>

2745
02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:03.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever I talk about it,</v>

2746
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.590
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking on this other day</v>

2747
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:08.150
<v Speaker 3>whenever I talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2748
02:12:08.151 --> 02:12:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about this today close</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about this show and if it were,</v>

2749
02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:14.450
<v Speaker 3>if it was going to come up or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2750
02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:18.980
<v Speaker 3>whenever I talk about all the stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened on that show near the end when</v>

2751
02:12:18.981 --> 02:12:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I was no longer on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2752
02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:26.420
<v Speaker 3>I simultaneously afterwards wish I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>said nothing and wish I had said more.</v>

2753
02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:28.130
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2754
02:12:28.131 --> 02:12:31.910
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I have those dual competing</v>

2755
02:12:31.911 --> 02:12:35.210
<v Speaker 3>feelings?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the reason is because I have</v>

2756
02:12:35.211 --> 02:12:36.590
<v Speaker 3>mixed feelings about the whole thing.</v>

2757
02:12:36.590 --> 02:12:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Like there's part of me that so thankful</v>
<v Speaker 3>for my time on the show and thankful</v>

2758
02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:44.120
<v Speaker 3>that I was given that opportunity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2759
02:12:44.121 --> 02:12:47.780
<v Speaker 3>we toured and I learned so much and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the best time and all that and</v>

2760
02:12:47.781 --> 02:12:50.150
<v Speaker 3>there's part of me that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2761
02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:54.500
<v Speaker 3>fuck you for not respecting me enough as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a human being to have a conversation</v>

2762
02:12:54.501 --> 02:12:56.660
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sat next to you for four years.</v>

2763
02:12:56.780 --> 02:12:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Like you mean about the way you test?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2764
02:12:59.630 --> 02:13:01.390
<v Speaker 3>So it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2765
02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I think that I still have mixed feelings</v>
<v Speaker 3>about everything,</v>

2766
02:13:04.731 --> 02:13:07.700
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware of how fortunate I was and I'm</v>

2767
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:11.900
<v Speaker 3>grateful for so much and I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also feel like there were certain</v>

2768
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:15.350
<v Speaker 3>elements of it that I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fucked up like I said.</v>

2769
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:17.060
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2770
02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:19.580
<v Speaker 3>where was I going with all of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

2771
02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:23.030
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about the bad aspects</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

2772
02:13:23.090 --> 02:13:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well no,</v>

2773
02:13:24.201 --> 02:13:25.640
<v Speaker 3>you were saying too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like doing my own thing.</v>

2774
02:13:25.930 --> 02:13:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes I do,</v>

2775
02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:31.070
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's elements I miss.</v>

2776
02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were good on the show.</v>

2777
02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:35.330
<v Speaker 4>I remember that's where we met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2778
02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:39.620
<v Speaker 4>the times that you thought you and I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>some interesting exchanges or on the</v>

2779
02:13:39.621 --> 02:13:42.490
<v Speaker 4>show were you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were really tuned in like I,</v>

2780
02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:46.760
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I really love adam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like adam is like,</v>

2781
02:13:46.761 --> 02:13:51.380
<v Speaker 4>you go over a guy's house and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a bunch of locked doors and you can</v>

2782
02:13:51.381 --> 02:13:53.900
<v Speaker 4>hang out with them in the living room</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's time to leave you leave and</v>

2783
02:13:53.901 --> 02:13:55.160
<v Speaker 4>you never get to see what's in those</v>
<v Speaker 4>locks</v>

2784
02:13:55.180 --> 02:13:55.840
<v Speaker 3>doors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

2785
02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't always feel like or ever feel</v>

2786
02:13:58.421 --> 02:13:59.254
<v Speaker 3>like you connect.</v>

2787
02:13:59.290 --> 02:14:01.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's just him.</v>

2788
02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:06.680
<v Speaker 4>That's his personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just a guy who isn't this like he's</v>

2789
02:14:07.961 --> 02:14:11.280
<v Speaker 4>got that radio persona or the tv</v>
<v Speaker 4>persona,</v>

2790
02:14:11.290 --> 02:14:13.660
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like this is,</v>

2791
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:16.600
<v Speaker 4>this is his range,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is where he's going down.</v>

2792
02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:18.130
<v Speaker 4>YoU know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you and I would have</v>

2793
02:14:18.131 --> 02:14:20.270
<v Speaker 4>conversations on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the thIngs that I liked,</v>

2794
02:14:20.290 --> 02:14:23.320
<v Speaker 4>like you would ask like these</v>
<v Speaker 4>provocative questions,</v>

2795
02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:27.220
<v Speaker 4>you probe and do things and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>think necessarily he does know it was,</v>

2796
02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:29.930
<v Speaker 4>it was an interesting mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2797
02:14:30.630 --> 02:14:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2798
02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I thought so too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a surprise to me to find out</v>

2799
02:14:37.001 --> 02:14:39.400
<v Speaker 2>that he was unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does argue or anything?</v>

2800
02:14:39.401 --> 02:14:41.660
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean on air or.</v>

2801
02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:42.573
<v Speaker 2>We either one</v>

2802
02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:45.200
<v Speaker 3>never off air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never off air.</v>

2803
02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Everything was always really cordial and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

2804
02:14:48.630 --> 02:14:50.970
<v Speaker 3>I honestly thought everything was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought everything was good.</v>

2805
02:14:50.971 --> 02:14:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I thought we were in a good place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was very,</v>

2806
02:14:52.831 --> 02:14:57.831
<v Speaker 3>very surprised to find out that how</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong I was about how he was feeling</v>

2807
02:14:58.441 --> 02:15:00.150
<v Speaker 3>about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2808
02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:03.150
<v Speaker 3>and I only found that out because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>fired,</v>

2809
02:15:03.570 --> 02:15:06.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he did an episode where he</v>

2810
02:15:06.630 --> 02:15:11.630
<v Speaker 3>talked about everything and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kind of blown away by all the f</v>

2811
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:14.880
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't listen to it for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people were tweeting me,</v>

2812
02:15:14.881 --> 02:15:16.860
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people were tweeting me these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like why'd you do this?</v>

2813
02:15:16.861 --> 02:15:17.694
<v Speaker 3>Why'd you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2814
02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:20.700
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is all,</v>

2815
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:23.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was when,</v>

2816
02:15:23.970 --> 02:15:26.020
<v Speaker 2>when you're saying that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain what you're talking about.</v>

2817
02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:31.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think of like one of the,</v>

2818
02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:33.130
<v Speaker 3>one of the shining example.</v>

2819
02:15:33.190 --> 02:15:34.023
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2820
02:15:36.250 --> 02:15:37.770
<v Speaker 2>is this going to be one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneous</v>

2821
02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:43.480
<v Speaker 2>too much and it makes me the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable is getting into the weeds</v>

2822
02:15:43.481 --> 02:15:44.490
<v Speaker 2>with all the details because yeah,</v>

2823
02:15:44.590 --> 02:15:46.820
<v Speaker 3>just sounds so petty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2824
02:15:46.821 --> 02:15:49.400
<v Speaker 3>don't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bring it up.</v>

2825
02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:50.353
<v Speaker 3>It's no big deal.</v>

2826
02:15:52.580 --> 02:15:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2827
02:15:54.110 --> 02:15:57.440
<v Speaker 2>It's weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I'm so afraid to get to</v>

2828
02:15:57.441 --> 02:15:58.610
<v Speaker 2>talk about it either.</v>

2829
02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:01.560
<v Speaker 4>You know that there's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people that have opinions and</v>

2830
02:16:01.561 --> 02:16:04.230
<v Speaker 4>it's all gonna come down on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be supportive people and</v>

2831
02:16:04.231 --> 02:16:05.530
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2832
02:16:05.630 --> 02:16:07.320
<v Speaker 4>Then they're going to try to tweet it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam,</v>

2833
02:16:07.321 --> 02:16:08.550
<v Speaker 4>this flow can be sustainable.</v>

<v Speaker 1>different little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing my show on his network and</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was just a whole like,</v>

2858

<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2859

2860
02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And did it make you reexamine how you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>your show?</v>

2861
02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2862
02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:21.430
<v Speaker 1>In what way did you try to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there a.</v>

2863
02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Was there a part of you that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2864
02:17:23.211 --> 02:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>well is there something about me that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying?</v>

2865
02:17:26.090 --> 02:17:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Is there something about me that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>grading,</v>

2866
02:17:27.831 --> 02:17:29.420
<v Speaker 1>like what is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2867
02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Like why did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2868
02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:35.090
<v Speaker 1>you know what I said to you early in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast where you can tell I go,</v>

2869
02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:37.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a podcast or is mine because</v>

2870
02:17:37.191 --> 02:17:39.590
<v Speaker 1>you're like worrying some people gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

2871
02:17:39.591 --> 02:17:41.210
<v Speaker 1>They're going to approach it a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2872
02:17:41.211 --> 02:17:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you're constantly examining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to do a podcast,</v>

2873
02:17:44.211 --> 02:17:46.010
<v Speaker 1>you're trying constantly examining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2874
02:17:46.011 --> 02:17:49.430
<v Speaker 1>am I talking too much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is as boring as this repetitive,</v>

2875
02:17:49.431 --> 02:17:52.460
<v Speaker 1>like how do I juice this up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to make this exciting.</v>

2876
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:56.420
<v Speaker 1>When you recovered from that and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2877
02:17:56.421 --> 02:17:57.360
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm on my own.</v>

2878
02:17:57.361 --> 02:18:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it make you tentative date?</v>

2879
02:18:00.130 --> 02:18:00.891
<v Speaker 1>Did you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2880
02:18:00.891 --> 02:18:04.220
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to maybe be less bold or maybe</v>

2881
02:18:04.221 --> 02:18:06.530
<v Speaker 1>more cautious or maybe more aware.</v>

2882
02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that</v>

2883
02:18:13.530 --> 02:18:18.530
<v Speaker 3>all the extra attention that was on me</v>
<v Speaker 3>after it happened</v>

2884
02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:25.700
<v Speaker 3>made me</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak in the way that I'm speaking right</v>

2885
02:18:25.711 --> 02:18:27.720
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is super unnatural and really</v>

2886
02:18:27.721 --> 02:18:30.420
<v Speaker 3>halting and examining every word before</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say it.</v>

2887
02:18:30.421 --> 02:18:31.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it did,</v>

2888
02:18:31.261 --> 02:18:33.030
<v Speaker 3>it did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2889
02:18:33.810 --> 02:18:36.000
<v Speaker 3>because okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm just going to talk about some of</v>

2890
02:18:36.001 --> 02:18:39.540
<v Speaker 3>it immediately afterwards when they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people coming to people</v>

2891
02:18:39.541 --> 02:18:41.040
<v Speaker 3>tweeting at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why didn't you do this?</v>

2892
02:18:41.041 --> 02:18:41.811
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blah,</v>

2893
02:18:41.811 --> 02:18:42.040
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2894
02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:44.880
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to set the record straight.</v>

2895
02:18:45.330 --> 02:18:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and someone that I,</v>

2896
02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:52.200

<v Speaker 3>but who doesn't come from podcast and</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't take the bait allison,</v>

2898
02:18:56.880 --> 02:18:59.190
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when the dust settles,</v>

2899
02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:03.660
<v Speaker 3>do not get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just allow,</v>

2900
02:19:03.690 --> 02:19:04.550
<v Speaker 3>just be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>see what's happening today.</v>

2902
02:19:09.330 --> 02:19:12.720
<v Speaker 3>And it may like that night I had planned</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be like,</v>

2903
02:19:12.721 --> 02:19:16.500
<v Speaker 3>here's my side of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's my response to this,</v>

2904
02:19:16.501 --> 02:19:17.171
<v Speaker 3>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this,</v>

2905
02:19:17.171 --> 02:19:20.070
<v Speaker 3>to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was going to get into it because</v>

2906
02:19:20.180 --> 02:19:25.180
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was so much untruth out there and</v>

2907
02:19:27.291 --> 02:19:29.300
<v Speaker 3>I had very simple like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no this,</v>

2908
02:19:29.301 --> 02:19:30.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me read,</v>

2909
02:19:30.050 --> 02:19:31.850
<v Speaker 3>here's the email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what this said,</v>

2910
02:19:31.851 --> 02:19:33.710
<v Speaker 3>here's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not the way it went down.</v>

2911
02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:36.350
<v Speaker 3>You guys are getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are getting a distorted version of</v>

2912
02:19:36.351 --> 02:19:39.710
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I listened to this guy and I</v>

2913
02:19:39.711 --> 02:19:41.270
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes a lot of sense,</v>

2914
02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:47.320
<v Speaker 3>so I am just going to say thank you for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great time that I had on the show</v>

2915
02:19:47.331 --> 02:19:52.331
<v Speaker 3>and I wish you the best and I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then for the next two months I</v>

2916
02:19:53.241 --> 02:19:58.241
<v Speaker 3>chafed against that because it's like I</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree that that is a great position to</v>

2917
02:19:59.361 --> 02:20:04.361
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have an audience,</v>

2918
02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:06.680
<v Speaker 3>if you have a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that podcast,</v>

2919
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:08.300
<v Speaker 3>depending on the kind of products you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

2920
02:20:08.301 --> 02:20:10.910
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part it's predicated on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the relationship you have with the</v>

2921
02:20:10.911 --> 02:20:14.390
<v Speaker 3>listeners and the fact that you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>honest with them and you're transparent</v>

2922
02:20:14.391 --> 02:20:15.830
<v Speaker 3>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're your authentic,</v>

2923
02:20:15.831 --> 02:20:16.790
<v Speaker 3>genuine self.</v>

2924
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:22.030
<v Speaker 3>So all of a sUdden I did not know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be my authentic genuine self while also</v>

2925
02:20:22.041 --> 02:20:26.870
<v Speaker 3>trying to be like very to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not discuss this thing.</v>

2926
02:20:26.871 --> 02:20:31.871
<v Speaker 3>That was such a big thing obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was kind of like going</v>

2927
02:20:32.421 --> 02:20:37.421
<v Speaker 3>vacillate and going back and forth and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and being authentic in every way other</v>

2928
02:20:37.671 --> 02:20:39.800
<v Speaker 3>than this one topic that I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about it.</v>

2929
02:20:39.801 --> 02:20:40.590
<v Speaker 3>And then it surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2930
02:20:40.590 --> 02:20:44.360
<v Speaker 3>why am I not talking about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels so weird to not be talking</v>

2931
02:20:44.361 --> 02:20:46.160
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I finally did talk about it and</v>

2932
02:20:46.161 --> 02:20:50.210
<v Speaker 3>it was a couple months later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2933
02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:52.300
<v Speaker 3>but even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2934
02:20:52.301 --> 02:20:54.020
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that specifically is a thing where</v>

2935
02:20:54.021 --> 02:20:56.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had never said any of that</v>

2936
02:20:56.180 --> 02:20:58.210
<v Speaker 4>were talking though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're,</v>

2937
02:20:58.211 --> 02:20:59.400
<v Speaker 4>you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>arriving,</v>

2938
02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:01.480
<v Speaker 4>talking around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even in doing so,</v>

2939
02:21:01.481 --> 02:21:03.080
<v Speaker 4>you're still discussing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2940
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:05.530
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're spending an inordinate amount of</v>

2941
02:21:05.531 --> 02:21:07.810
<v Speaker 4>time like thinking about it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussing it.</v>

2942
02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:10.540
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just mean you and I had discussed it</v>

2943
02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:11.770
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2944
02:21:12.250 --> 02:21:14.770
<v Speaker 4>my thoughts were pretty much the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just don't,</v>

2945
02:21:15.130 --> 02:21:16.930
<v Speaker 4>don't bother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just kick ass,</v>

2946
02:21:16.931 --> 02:21:18.610
<v Speaker 4>go do your shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry about it.</v>

2947
02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:20.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people,</v>

2948
02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:22.030
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be times where people just</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

2949
02:21:22.690 --> 02:21:24.700
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't gel.</v>

2950
02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:27.580
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it jelled for you more than a job</v>
<v Speaker 4>for him.</v>

2951
02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:30.310
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe the opportunity was better for</v>
<v Speaker 4>you than it was for him.</v>

2952
02:21:30.850 --> 02:21:31.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2953
02:21:31.961 --> 02:21:33.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people shouldn't be forced to have to</v>

2954
02:21:33.911 --> 02:21:35.520
<v Speaker 4>work together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especIally in show business.</v>

2955
02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:37.440
<v Speaker 3>I hundred percent agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2956
02:21:37.441 --> 02:21:41.910
<v Speaker 3>in no way was I ever like this is he</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have made this decision.</v>

2957
02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:43.300
<v Speaker 3>Seems to marry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2958
02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:45.760
<v Speaker 4>was network though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

2959
02:21:45.970 --> 02:21:49.120
<v Speaker 4>That seems lIke there was something more</v>
<v Speaker 4>to it because if you guys stopped</v>

2960
02:21:49.121 --> 02:21:52.360
<v Speaker 4>working together and he just kept you on</v>
<v Speaker 4>his network and helped promote you and,</v>

2961
02:21:52.361 --> 02:21:53.740
<v Speaker 4>and pumped you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems.</v>

2962
02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:56.800
<v Speaker 4>That seems more amicable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it makes sense.</v>

2963
02:21:56.801 --> 02:21:57.350
<v Speaker 4>It seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2964
02:21:57.350 --> 02:21:59.690
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying about how it</v>

2965
02:21:59.691 --> 02:22:04.691
<v Speaker 3>didn't make sense to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there he is pissed and I don't know why</v>

2966
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:07.020
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2967
02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Do your own show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

2968
02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:12.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll start doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've already been doing this.</v>

2969
02:22:13.250 --> 02:22:15.230
<v Speaker 3>How's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going really well.</v>

2970
02:22:15.250 --> 02:22:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Do you want it twice a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twice a week.</v>

2971
02:22:17.330 --> 02:22:22.330
<v Speaker 3>Monday a one-on-one and thursday is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a panel of us and it's going</v>

2972
02:22:22.431 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 3>really well and I really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2973
02:22:25.771 --> 02:22:27.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's good to go.</v>

2974
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Just don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not worrying about it.</v>

2975
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:33.750
<v Speaker 3>But you are because you talked about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2976
02:22:34.050 --> 02:22:36.570
<v Speaker 3>When I talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worry about the fact that I just</v>

2977
02:22:36.571 --> 02:22:40.440
<v Speaker 3>talked about it and I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get to the bottom of why that</v>

2978
02:22:40.441 --> 02:22:40.951
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2979
02:22:40.951 --> 02:22:42.870
<v Speaker 3>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because I'm up different</v>

2980
02:22:42.871 --> 02:22:46.740
<v Speaker 3>minds about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might just be because there's so</v>

2981
02:22:46.741 --> 02:22:51.360
<v Speaker 3>much immediate online response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime I dance around it,</v>

2982
02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:54.880
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the more difficult things</v>
<v Speaker 4>about anything that you're putting out</v>

2983
02:22:54.881 --> 02:22:58.190
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a talk show or a podcast or</v>

2984
02:22:58.210 --> 02:23:03.210
<v Speaker 4>fucking even an album or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the navigating the response and the</v>

2985
02:23:03.761 --> 02:23:06.940
<v Speaker 4>social media response is just so</v>
<v Speaker 4>different than the response that you</v>

2986
02:23:06.941 --> 02:23:10.990
<v Speaker 4>would have gotten a few decades ago or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>decade ago.</v>

2987
02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:12.220
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so different.</v>

2988
02:23:12.221 --> 02:23:15.430
<v Speaker 4>It's a different world and no one knows</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly how to handle it.</v>

2989
02:23:15.460 --> 02:23:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they can give you really good</v>

2990
02:23:17.171 --> 02:23:18.850
<v Speaker 4>advice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no one's done it.</v>

2991
02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 4>No one said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2992
02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:22.420
<v Speaker 4>in the 30 years of my career when</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter came along,</v>

2993
02:23:22.421 --> 02:23:25.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't really have that to say so</v>

2994
02:23:26.650 --> 02:23:30.790
<v Speaker 4>you can eat in the paralysis by analysis</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you were.</v>

2995
02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:33.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were just talking about fighting</v>

2996
02:23:33.401 --> 02:23:34.710
<v Speaker 4>term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2997
02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:37.690
<v Speaker 4>like you analyze things too much when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fighting and you freeze up,</v>

2998
02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:41.500
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hesitates is lost you.</v>

2999
02:23:41.501 --> 02:23:45.520
<v Speaker 4>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're unfortunately incapable of being</v>

3000
02:23:45.521 --> 02:23:47.290
<v Speaker 4>yourself because you worried about</v>
<v Speaker 4>criticism.</v>

3001
02:23:47.650 --> 02:23:50.950
<v Speaker 4>That's also something that clients want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want,</v>

3002
02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:54.130
<v Speaker 4>they want to be able to fuck with you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the point where I see her,</v>

3003
02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:55.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allIson reads my tweets,</v>

3004
02:23:55.961 --> 02:24:00.520
<v Speaker 4>I see words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what she says no because me and then</v>

3005
02:24:00.521 --> 02:24:01.240
<v Speaker 4>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3006
02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:02.920
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good job on rogan's podcast.</v>

3007
02:24:02.921 --> 02:24:05.530
<v Speaker 4>You fucking dumb bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk about yourself much.</v>

3008
02:24:07.410 --> 02:24:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you think about that the next</v>

3009
02:24:10.241 --> 02:24:12.370
<v Speaker 4>time you talk and then they creep into</v>
<v Speaker 4>your head and</v>

3010
02:24:12.430 --> 02:24:15.880
<v Speaker 3>that's why I tried to not expose the to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the degree that I can.</v>

3011
02:24:15.881 --> 02:24:18.570
<v Speaker 3>I try not to expose myself to it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3012
02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:23.640
<v Speaker 3>I think to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not helping me to do any,</v>

3013
02:24:24.010 --> 02:24:27.550
<v Speaker 3>to be good at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not making a better show when I</v>

3014
02:24:27.551 --> 02:24:30.310
<v Speaker 3>do my own show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is making me concerned that these</v>

3015
02:24:30.311 --> 02:24:32.650
<v Speaker 3>18 ads are upset with something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3016
02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:38.020
<v Speaker 4>It can give you a different perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally someone can say something</v>

3017
02:24:38.021 --> 02:24:40.990
<v Speaker 4>that will eliminate some aspects of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>own behavior that maybe you weren't</v>

3018
02:24:40.991 --> 02:24:45.250
<v Speaker 4>aware of that as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also possible that you can tap</v>

3019
02:24:45.251 --> 02:24:50.251
<v Speaker 4>into a river of cons and just drown</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can also use you because I've</v>

3020
02:24:51.671 --> 02:24:56.671
<v Speaker 4>swum in those rivers swam spanner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that video that I posted the</v>

3021
02:24:56.680 --> 02:25:01.060
<v Speaker 4>other day about one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous rivers in the world and it's</v>

3022
02:25:01.061 --> 02:25:03.640
<v Speaker 4>insanely deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tweeted it yesterday.</v>

3023
02:25:03.641 --> 02:25:08.560
<v Speaker 4>I believe this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this place in england and it's</v>

3024
02:25:08.561 --> 02:25:12.220
<v Speaker 4>this river that if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a calm,</v>

3025
02:25:12.310 --> 02:25:17.020
<v Speaker 4>just sort of meandering river just</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't like anything exceptional,</v>

3026
02:25:17.021 --> 02:25:20.530
<v Speaker 4>but the way it's cut into the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the ground,</v>

3027
02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:23.200
<v Speaker 4>what you're seeing is not the entire</v>
<v Speaker 4>river.</v>

3028
02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:28.440
<v Speaker 4>There's an underlying aspect of it with</v>
<v Speaker 4>torrential currents.</v>

3029
02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:31.780
<v Speaker 4>So if you get stuck in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go in it,</v>

3030
02:25:31.810 --> 02:25:33.220
<v Speaker 4>you literally can't escape.</v>

3031
02:25:33.310 --> 02:25:36.250
<v Speaker 4>Did you get smashed up against the rocks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you get killed?</v>

3032
02:25:36.430 --> 02:25:36.790
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

3033
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:38.470
<v Speaker 4>play this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks so plastic.</v>

3034
02:25:38.471 --> 02:25:39.830
<v Speaker 4>Let this play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3035
02:25:39.831 --> 02:25:43.190
<v Speaker 4>jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is the most dangerous stretch of</v>

3036
02:25:43.191 --> 02:25:45.870
<v Speaker 4>water anywhere on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How crazy is that?</v>

3037
02:25:45.871 --> 02:25:49.500
<v Speaker 4>It's a bold claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the name of this video?</v>

3038
02:25:49.501 --> 02:25:54.030
<v Speaker 4>Lives and never rapids and the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous stretch of water in the world.</v>

3039
02:25:54.390 --> 02:25:56.120
<v Speaker 4>This is treated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it says?</v>

3040
02:25:56.610 --> 02:25:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Straight up street in bolton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some woods.</v>

3041
02:25:58.861 --> 02:26:01.170
<v Speaker 4>You could jump over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People occasionally do,</v>

3042
02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:03.990
<v Speaker 4>but if you miss that jump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll kill you.</v>

3043
02:26:04.830 --> 02:26:07.800
<v Speaker 4>This is what the rIver looks like about</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 meters upstream,</v>

3044
02:26:08.010 --> 02:26:11.310
<v Speaker 4>same river.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that water went down thanks to the</v>

3045
02:26:11.311 --> 02:26:14.430
<v Speaker 4>local geology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The river basically turns on its side,</v>

3046
02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:17.640
<v Speaker 4>help passages and tunnels in the rocks</v>
<v Speaker 4>below.</v>

3047
02:26:18.060 --> 02:26:22.080
<v Speaker 4>Those banks are actually overhangs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There isn't any riverbed just belOw the</v>

3048
02:26:22.081 --> 02:26:26.250
<v Speaker 4>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a deep boiling mass of fast and</v>

3049
02:26:26.251 --> 02:26:27.450
<v Speaker 4>deadly currents.</v>

3050
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:31.860
<v Speaker 4>There were claims that falling in has a</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent fatality rate.</v>

3051
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way to confirm that,</v>

3052
02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:36.690
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because a local person doesn't die and</v>

3053
02:26:36.691 --> 02:26:38.260
<v Speaker 4>river doesn't make the news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3054
02:26:38.261 --> 02:26:40.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has claimed a lot of lives there.</v>

3055
02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:45.390
<v Speaker 4>Even tales from the twelfth century of</v>
<v Speaker 4>young boy said to be the future king of</v>

3056
02:26:45.391 --> 02:26:50.391
<v Speaker 4>scotland who died trying to jump across</v>
<v Speaker 4>those waters on anything or anyone that</v>

3057
02:26:50.761 --> 02:26:53.850
<v Speaker 4>falls in might not come out in any</v>
<v Speaker 4>recognizable form.</v>

3058
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:59.150
<v Speaker 4>It could just get polarized against the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rocks and the water over and over and</v>

3059
02:26:59.521 --> 02:27:01.260
<v Speaker 4>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

3060
02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:04.050
<v Speaker 4>put a cameron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then I'd have to get close to the</v>

3061
02:27:04.051 --> 02:27:08.790
<v Speaker 4>edge and the edge isn't sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just cubs towards the water and it's</v>

3062
02:27:08.850 --> 02:27:13.140
<v Speaker 4>covered in slippery moss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Besides the mortar is opaque and brown</v>

3063
02:27:13.141 --> 02:27:16.950
<v Speaker 4>with pit stain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd see nothing it survivable.</v>

3064
02:27:17.490 --> 02:27:20.070
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>really have to look at it,</v>

3065
02:27:20.071 --> 02:27:22.860
<v Speaker 4>so people listening to this go and check</v>
<v Speaker 4>out the video.</v>

3066
02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:23.880
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it on vimeo?</v>

3067
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:25.530
<v Speaker 4>What is it on your tongue?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Youtube.</v>

3068
02:27:26.460 --> 02:27:29.310
<v Speaker 4>The videos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Much better representation because what</v>

3069
02:27:29.311 --> 02:27:33.540
<v Speaker 4>they do is they show you what the river</v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like at its widest part,</v>

3070
02:27:33.541 --> 02:27:37.020
<v Speaker 4>which is enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it cuts down into a small area</v>

3071
02:27:37.021 --> 02:27:41.670
<v Speaker 4>that you can jump across and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>much water rolling through such a small</v>

3072
02:27:41.671 --> 02:27:46.671
<v Speaker 4>area that it creates this intense</v>
<v Speaker 4>current and just fucking bizarre,</v>

3073
02:27:46.741 --> 02:27:48.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like an optical illusion because it</v>

3074
02:27:48.961 --> 02:27:50.880
<v Speaker 4>just feels like a stream that looks like</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

3075
02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:56.370
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile it'S super deep and raging</v>
<v Speaker 4>beneath it and you just can't.</v>

3076
02:27:56.371 --> 02:28:01.371
<v Speaker 4>The subconscious</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep river of cons,</v>

3077
02:28:04.410 --> 02:28:07.680
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's like in a lot of ways it's</v>

3078
02:28:07.681 --> 02:28:09.930
<v Speaker 4>what you're dealing with and now we got</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that,</v>

3079
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.830
<v Speaker 4>but that's where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3080
02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:13.110
<v Speaker 4>River of cons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we were talking about.</v>

3081
02:28:14.190 --> 02:28:15.340
<v Speaker 4>Even for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3082
02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:18.300
<v Speaker 4>the people that are doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times they don't even realize</v>

3083
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:22.850
<v Speaker 4>the harm they're doing to themselves in</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own psyche by just lashing out of</v>

3084
02:28:22.851 --> 02:28:23.450
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3085
02:28:23.450 --> 02:28:25.280
<v Speaker 4>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a page yesterday.</v>

3086
02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:29.990
<v Speaker 4>he was tweeting at someone I know really</v>
<v Speaker 4>negative shit and I went to his page and</v>

3087
02:28:29.991 --> 02:28:34.550
<v Speaker 4>his entire twitter page,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is him shitting on various famous</v>

3088
02:28:34.551 --> 02:28:39.551
<v Speaker 4>people and trying to get them to respond</v>
<v Speaker 4>to him like what a bizarre life and also</v>

3089
02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:43.520
<v Speaker 4>the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be incredibly damaging to</v>

3090
02:28:43.521 --> 02:28:47.510
<v Speaker 4>your self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be just constantly lashing out at</v>

3091
02:28:47.511 --> 02:28:50.690
<v Speaker 4>famous people and trying to get them tO</v>
<v Speaker 4>respond to you.</v>

3092
02:28:50.691 --> 02:28:53.240
<v Speaker 4>Just trying to insult them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to troll them.</v>

3093
02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:59.240
<v Speaker 4>So bizarre always makes me wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it young people?</v>

3094
02:28:59.511 --> 02:29:03.440
<v Speaker 4>Is it like people who are in that phase</v>
<v Speaker 4>of life where you're young and you're</v>

3095
02:29:03.441 --> 02:29:05.850
<v Speaker 4>angry?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them you just need an outlet.</v>

3096
02:29:06.410 --> 02:29:07.070
<v Speaker 4>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3097
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:10.250
<v Speaker 4>some of them were older men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of it's men.</v>

3098
02:29:10.251 --> 02:29:13.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you ever ran into a man who's in</v>

3099
02:29:13.011 --> 02:29:14.530
<v Speaker 4>his fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never had a family,</v>

3100
02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:17.600
<v Speaker 4>never been married.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a weirdness to those folks.</v>

3101
02:29:18.170 --> 02:29:20.990
<v Speaker 4>There's a real weirdness to these older</v>
<v Speaker 4>set in their ways.</v>

3102
02:29:20.991 --> 02:29:24.470
<v Speaker 4>Guys that never really settled down with</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>

3103
02:29:25.010 --> 02:29:26.840
<v Speaker 4>You will run into him oCcasionally and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

3104
02:29:26.841 --> 02:29:27.740
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like you,</v>

3105
02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:30.230
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're surviving without a heart.</v>

3106
02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:31.330
<v Speaker 4>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>

3107
02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:34.610
<v Speaker 4>like when one of these people that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>your missing organs or something like</v>

3108
02:29:34.611 --> 02:29:37.340
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're missing a critical aspect of what</v>

3109
02:29:37.341 --> 02:29:38.360
<v Speaker 4>it means to be a person.</v>

3110
02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed,</v>

3111
02:29:41.010 --> 02:29:43.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fair amount of,</v>

3112
02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:48.480
<v Speaker 3>of hate that I was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is years ago,</v>

3113
02:29:48.481 --> 02:29:52.560
<v Speaker 3>I had noticed a pattern that I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes discover,</v>

3114
02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:55.140
<v Speaker 3>like I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get some shitty comment and then</v>

3115
02:29:55.141 --> 02:30:00.141
<v Speaker 3>I would go to the person's page and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a newborn and it was like a lot of</v>

3116
02:30:00.811 --> 02:30:05.811
<v Speaker 3>brand new dads and that really surprised</v>
<v Speaker 3>me that like it's brand new dads who are</v>

3117
02:30:05.851 --> 02:30:08.100
<v Speaker 3>writing shitty things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3118
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my husband's theory is like,</v>

3119
02:30:10.531 --> 02:30:12.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're not getting sex so.</v>

3120
02:30:13.110 --> 02:30:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird theory.</v>

3121
02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:17.660
<v Speaker 3>They're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>

3122
02:30:18.510 --> 02:30:19.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his theory,</v>

3123
02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:24.570
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're tired and there's been this huge</v>

3124
02:30:24.571 --> 02:30:26.040
<v Speaker 3>change in their relationship</v>

3125
02:30:26.210 --> 02:30:28.940
<v Speaker 4>or they're just assholes and the baby</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't cure it.</v>

3126
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:33.290
<v Speaker 4>The thing that was most overwhelming to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

3127
02:30:33.930 --> 02:30:37.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm having a baby was like how</v>
<v Speaker 4>compassion I felt for other people.</v>

3128
02:30:38.180 --> 02:30:39.290
<v Speaker 4>How I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3129
02:30:39.291 --> 02:30:40.730
<v Speaker 4>these other people that are all fucked</v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

3130
02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:44.480
<v Speaker 4>or just babies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were babies that were just exposed</v>

3131
02:30:44.481 --> 02:30:47.480
<v Speaker 4>to the wrong stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wrong life,</v>

3132
02:30:47.481 --> 02:30:49.970
<v Speaker 4>the wrong emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wrong family,</v>

3133
02:30:49.971 --> 02:30:54.971
<v Speaker 4>the wrong schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then here you are a raging twat at</v>

3134
02:30:55.491 --> 02:30:56.740
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3135
02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:58.250
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3136
02:30:58.251 --> 02:31:01.040
<v Speaker 4>we're essentially long running</v>
<v Speaker 4>equations.</v>

3137
02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:05.720
<v Speaker 4>All of our life experiences and</v>
<v Speaker 4>interactions calculated to alison rosen.</v>

3138
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand 16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3139
02:31:06.921 --> 02:31:09.710
<v Speaker 4>that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's why it's why it's interesting when</v>

3140
02:31:09.711 --> 02:31:13.730
<v Speaker 4>you sit here and you tell me about your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life experience,</v>

3141
02:31:13.731 --> 02:31:14.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>born in,</v>

3142
02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:16.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oakland moving to orange county.</v>

3143
02:31:16.821 --> 02:31:17.780
<v Speaker 4>I gotta get outta here.</v>

3144
02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm in a band,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to leave.</v>

3145
02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:21.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm in New York and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then did,</v>

3146
02:31:21.081 --> 02:31:21.481
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>

3147
02:31:21.481 --> 02:31:26.100
<v Speaker 4>did all these different interactions and</v>
<v Speaker 4>different engagements.</v>

3148
02:31:26.101 --> 02:31:29.070
<v Speaker 4>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you're here and you are the sum</v>

3149
02:31:29.071 --> 02:31:33.120
<v Speaker 4>total of these experiences and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>reflections on these experiences.</v>

3150
02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:37.710
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have lived fucked up lives are the</v>

3151
02:31:37.711 --> 02:31:41.000
<v Speaker 4>most interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people that have these mundane self</v>

3152
02:31:41.001 --> 02:31:45.990
<v Speaker 4>absorbed existences are the most boring</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they really haven't had the</v>

3153
02:31:45.991 --> 02:31:48.960
<v Speaker 4>trials and tribulations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really haven't had those moments where</v>

3154
02:31:48.961 --> 02:31:51.270
<v Speaker 4>they had to question themselves and try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out what the fuck they're</v>

3155
02:31:51.271 --> 02:31:55.560
<v Speaker 4>doing with themselves that when you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and you hit those low points and</v>

3156
02:31:55.561 --> 02:31:58.800
<v Speaker 4>then rebound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where life's lessons happen.</v>

3157
02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:01.020
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's kind of weird as a parent</v>

3158
02:32:01.021 --> 02:32:03.540
<v Speaker 4>because I don't want my kids to face</v>
<v Speaker 4>adversity.</v>

3159
02:32:03.541 --> 02:32:05.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want my kids have a really fun time.</v>

3160
02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:10.850
<v Speaker 4>But I also know that unless they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless they do face disappointment and</v>

3161
02:32:11.850 --> 02:32:13.650
<v Speaker 4>some adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least some,</v>

3162
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:19.190
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to get a full,</v>
<v Speaker 4>full handle on how to manage those</v>

3163
02:32:20.041 --> 02:32:21.360
<v Speaker 4>waters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3164
02:32:21.700 --> 02:32:24.760
<v Speaker 2>do fall into the river of cons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know what to do.</v>

3165
02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:27.820
<v Speaker 2>So like I swim in the river of freely</v>

3166
02:32:28.330 --> 02:32:31.960
<v Speaker 4>been around them for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's know you're not gonna fuck with</v>

3167
02:32:31.961 --> 02:32:36.961
<v Speaker 4>my zen that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I lived an entire entirely</v>

3168
02:32:37.391 --> 02:32:41.200
<v Speaker 4>sheltered life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of how much my resilience would</v>

3169
02:32:41.201 --> 02:32:42.220
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3170
02:32:42.221 --> 02:32:47.221
<v Speaker 4>And how much resilience do people have</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they don't experience life outside</v>

3171
02:32:47.321 --> 02:32:51.430
<v Speaker 4>of their very small existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're very small community.</v>

3172
02:32:51.431 --> 02:32:54.940
<v Speaker 4>they're very small pattern of life</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>

3173
02:32:55.330 --> 02:32:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Is that sort of letting my kids go</v>

3174
02:32:59.471 --> 02:33:02.650
<v Speaker 2>through adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThAt part I know is going to be hard for</v>

3175
02:33:02.651 --> 02:33:06.280
<v Speaker 2>me because I'm the kind of person where</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if there's someone in the corner</v>

3176
02:33:06.281 --> 02:33:07.091
<v Speaker 2>that has an itch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3177
02:33:07.091 --> 02:33:08.470
<v Speaker 2>let me come over and scratch it for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

3178
02:33:08.471 --> 02:33:11.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to feel discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm very tuned into.</v>

3179
02:33:11.921 --> 02:33:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to be a helicopter parent?</v>

3180
02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Got to hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3181
02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Just women when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have children later in life,</v>

3182
02:33:19.241 --> 02:33:21.490
<v Speaker 2>that's when they're most likely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter.</v>

3183
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:24.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of helicopter parents at</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kid's school.</v>

3184
02:33:24.370 --> 02:33:28.810
<v Speaker 2>I probably will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be the right level of</v>

3185
02:33:28.811 --> 02:33:33.811
<v Speaker 2>helicopter parent to like keep my kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe and I'm happy but not fuck them up</v>

3186
02:33:35.591 --> 02:33:37.280
<v Speaker 2>wIth being smothering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3187
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:38.231
<v Speaker 2>Tod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be.</v>

3188
02:33:38.231 --> 02:33:41.290
<v Speaker 2>The challenge for me I think is tough</v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

3189
02:33:41.660 --> 02:33:42.850
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

3190
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Everybody does it different and kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>come out different.</v>

3191
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:51.740
<v Speaker 4>Then there's also like my two kids are</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fucking dissembler there,</v>

3192
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:56.750
<v Speaker 4>so dissembler there's age difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them is almost seven or one of</v>

3193
02:33:57.251 --> 02:33:59.230
<v Speaker 4>them is actually just turned eight</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather,</v>

3194
02:33:59.231 --> 02:34:02.680
<v Speaker 4>and one of them is almost six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so out of the box,</v>

3195
02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:05.980
<v Speaker 4>the six year old is the one who eats</v>
<v Speaker 4>candy and becomes a barbarian.</v>

3196
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:07.860
<v Speaker 4>She's so much depth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'll.</v>

3197
02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:10.960
<v Speaker 4>She's six soon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's so much different than her</v>

3198
02:34:10.961 --> 02:34:15.190
<v Speaker 4>sister is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just so different and they grew</v>

3199
02:34:15.191 --> 02:34:19.480
<v Speaker 4>up in the same loving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same amount of attention,</v>

3200
02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:21.940
<v Speaker 4>same amount of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3201
02:34:21.941 --> 02:34:24.790
<v Speaker 4>obviously slightly different life</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences can be no different.</v>

3202
02:34:24.791 --> 02:34:25.810
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different friends,</v>

3203
02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:28.960
<v Speaker 4>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not just that it's the innate</v>

3204
02:34:28.961 --> 02:34:32.110
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they come out of the box different.</v>

3205
02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:33.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something I wonder.</v>

3206
02:34:33.841 --> 02:34:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're saying that sitting here,</v>

3207
02:34:36.930 --> 02:34:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm the sum total of everything I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>

3208
02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also think how much is just</v>

3209
02:34:42.861 --> 02:34:45.460
<v Speaker 2>genetic counseling there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3210
02:34:45.580 --> 02:34:48.640
<v Speaker 4>It's also the variabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's,</v>

3211
02:34:48.730 --> 02:34:51.430
<v Speaker 4>it's not just genetics that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>variable.</v>

3212
02:34:51.431 --> 02:34:54.130
<v Speaker 4>It's like those genetics very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3213
02:34:54.131 --> 02:34:57.490
<v Speaker 4>like brothers and sisters are different</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some parents.</v>

3214
02:34:57.860 --> 02:35:01.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm wondering what the combination is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how much of your husband is going</v>

3215
02:35:01.081 --> 02:35:05.140
<v Speaker 4>to be in your kid and how much of it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and is it a 50 slash 50 split,</v>

3216
02:35:05.250 --> 02:35:07.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do your and how much of that other</v>

3217
02:35:07.201 --> 02:35:08.034
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3218
02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:11.190
<v Speaker 2>And do your jeans just dominate is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3219
02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:15.090
<v Speaker 2>ever seen like a person who's blond</v>
<v Speaker 2>haired and blue eyed and if the kid</v>

3220
02:35:15.091 --> 02:35:16.560
<v Speaker 2>doesn't look anything like them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like oh,</v>

3221
02:35:16.561 --> 02:35:20.580
<v Speaker 2>you just get your genes got dominated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other genes.</v>

3222
02:35:20.670 --> 02:35:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3223
02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:22.650
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

3224
02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:25.290
<v Speaker 2>My sister who has the same coloring as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

3225
02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:28.920
<v Speaker 2>has a blonde blue eyed baby was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

3226
02:35:29.130 --> 02:35:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his is blonde and blue eyed,</v>

3227
02:35:30.770 --> 02:35:34.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just believed that the dark jeans</v>

3228
02:35:34.981 --> 02:35:38.540
<v Speaker 2>would dominate and they did not fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>jeans to go over.</v>

3229
02:35:38.550 --> 02:35:39.690
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3230
02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:42.480
<v Speaker 2>it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting</v>

3231
02:35:42.660 --> 02:35:44.490
<v Speaker 4>also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just that,</v>

3232
02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:47.760
<v Speaker 4>like the genetic variables which which</v>
<v Speaker 4>are are,</v>

3233
02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:50.910
<v Speaker 4>are truly fascinating personality</v>
<v Speaker 4>variables,</v>

3234
02:35:50.911 --> 02:35:55.911
<v Speaker 4>all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also how they interact with each</v>

3235
02:35:56.041 --> 02:35:58.530
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is going to be so much different</v>

3236
02:35:58.531 --> 02:36:01.560
<v Speaker 4>than how you interact with them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching kids interact with each other</v>

3237
02:36:01.561 --> 02:36:04.950
<v Speaker 4>and getting annoyed at each other and</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to work that out and what</v>

3238
02:36:04.951 --> 02:36:08.640
<v Speaker 4>watching their own little personality</v>
<v Speaker 4>disputes that they have and how they</v>

3239
02:36:08.641 --> 02:36:11.280
<v Speaker 4>navigate those and little tools they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

3240
02:36:11.281 --> 02:36:13.510
<v Speaker 4>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my youngest one cries at everything.</v>

3241
02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:18.630
<v Speaker 4>Everything's like to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like go way overboard and settle down,</v>

3242
02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:20.610
<v Speaker 4>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3243
02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:24.690
<v Speaker 4>because they figure out like if I cry I</v>
<v Speaker 4>get hugs and someone picks me up and so</v>

3244
02:36:24.691 --> 02:36:26.550
<v Speaker 4>that's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anything that goes wrong,</v>

3245
02:36:26.551 --> 02:36:28.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna start crying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like I'll,</v>

3246
02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:30.390
<v Speaker 4>I'll watch her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she'll do something wrong,</v>

3247
02:36:30.570 --> 02:36:34.920
<v Speaker 4>her sister will get pissed at you at her</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then she'll run away crying that her</v>

3248
02:36:34.921 --> 02:36:36.010
<v Speaker 4>sister did something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

3249
02:36:36.020 --> 02:36:36.610
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

3250
02:36:36.610 --> 02:36:37.443
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

3251
02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:40.260
<v Speaker 4>I just watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched that whole thing go down.</v>

3252
02:36:40.261 --> 02:36:43.680
<v Speaker 4>That's not how it went.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the cries.</v>

3253
02:36:43.681 --> 02:36:47.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bigger and so it becomes like you don't</v>

3254
02:36:47.011 --> 02:36:51.240
<v Speaker 4>want your kid to be a cry baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You also want your kid to recognize that</v>

3255
02:36:51.241 --> 02:36:55.620
<v Speaker 4>you know exactly when or what went on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also want to let them know that</v>

3256
02:36:55.621 --> 02:36:59.550
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's where I've always gone to the.</v>

3257
02:36:59.551 --> 02:37:03.120
<v Speaker 4>I did the exact same thing when I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>your age and I think that's a big one.</v>

3258
02:37:03.121 --> 02:37:05.220
<v Speaker 4>Like letting them know and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3259
02:37:05.221 --> 02:37:07.560
<v Speaker 4>not letting it go to no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no harp on it.</v>

3260
02:37:07.770 --> 02:37:08.603
<v Speaker 4>Sled it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

3261
02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:09.271
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

3262
02:37:09.271 --> 02:37:11.280
<v Speaker 4>give me a hug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go play with some stuff like let</v>

3263
02:37:11.281 --> 02:37:13.230
<v Speaker 4>it go because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they learn themselves,</v>

3264
02:37:13.231 --> 02:37:15.350
<v Speaker 4>they see themselves that things don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

3265
02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:17.360
<v Speaker 4>They see themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got called out on their</v>

3266
02:37:17.361 --> 02:37:18.290
<v Speaker 4>manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3267
02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:20.680
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got my fucking ran my crying game and</v>

3268
02:37:20.681 --> 02:37:25.340
<v Speaker 4>I shut down today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no one's getting mad,</v>

3269
02:37:25.430 --> 02:37:27.920
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like I'm a terrible person.</v>

3270
02:37:27.921 --> 02:37:30.650
<v Speaker 4>I need to feel awful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but crying gained don't work on daddy.</v>

3271
02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that the stakes aren't that</v>

3272
02:37:32.871 --> 02:37:35.450
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I grew up with the feeling at</v>

3273
02:37:35.451 --> 02:37:40.040
<v Speaker 2>all times and that the stakes were very</v>
<v Speaker 2>high and I,</v>

3274
02:37:40.041 --> 02:37:43.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have parents who have that the stakes</v>

3275
02:37:43.941 --> 02:37:46.340
<v Speaker 2>are high attitude towards everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>

3276
02:37:46.341 --> 02:37:47.174
<v Speaker 2>this is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3277
02:37:47.210 --> 02:37:50.690
<v Speaker 2>the stakes are very low here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just very,</v>

3278
02:37:50.691 --> 02:37:55.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prone to anxiety and prone to a</v>

3279
02:37:56.661 --> 02:37:57.620
<v Speaker 2>overreacting</v>

3280
02:37:57.790 --> 02:38:02.790
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's also those stakes are entirely</v>

3281
02:38:03.221 --> 02:38:05.770
<v Speaker 4>dependent upon like what are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

3282
02:38:05.860 --> 02:38:08.890
<v Speaker 4>what's the full extent of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities of things can go right or</v>

3283
02:38:08.891 --> 02:38:09.470
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>

3284
02:38:09.470 --> 02:38:09.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3285
02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:13.010
<v Speaker 2>whaT's the worst that could happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's not a big deal then.</v>

3286
02:38:13.011 --> 02:38:13.844
<v Speaker 2>So it happens.</v>

3287
02:38:14.010 --> 02:38:16.110
<v Speaker 4>Just you'll fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3288
02:38:16.111 --> 02:38:18.450
<v Speaker 4>But it's a perspective issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're living in the Congo,</v>

3289
02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:20.760
<v Speaker 4>whatever issue came up wouldn't come up</v>
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>

3290
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:23.430
<v Speaker 4>Like I guarantee you these people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are like trying to find water,</v>

3291
02:38:23.431 --> 02:38:24.990
<v Speaker 4>don't look at their nose and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>god,</v>

3292
02:38:24.991 --> 02:38:27.690
<v Speaker 4>I've got to figure out a way to get out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the Congo and get to beverly hills.</v>

3293
02:38:27.930 --> 02:38:30.860
<v Speaker 4>Get my fucking nose fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My nose.</v>

3294
02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:33.600
<v Speaker 4>Not talking about your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my nose.</v>

3295
02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:35.550
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about Congo person's nose.</v>

3296
02:38:35.551 --> 02:38:36.384
<v Speaker 4>You're just making it.</v>

3297
02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:39.380
<v Speaker 2>You're tAlking about my nose and I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying.</v>

3298
02:38:39.381 --> 02:38:43.130
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me that you think I</v>
<v Speaker 2>should get plastic surgery I think gets</v>

3299
02:38:43.210 --> 02:38:45.420
<v Speaker 2>you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm getting from them.</v>

3300
02:38:45.570 --> 02:38:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I felt like</v>

3301
02:38:46.260 --> 02:38:48.240
<v Speaker 4>the entire time I was on joe rogan's</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>

3302
02:38:48.241 --> 02:38:52.290
<v Speaker 4>he was judging my nose and I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk about it but I don't want to</v>

3303
02:38:52.291 --> 02:38:54.660
<v Speaker 4>talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like one of those things</v>

3304
02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I could say too much or sued</v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously on one.</v>

3305
02:38:59.190 --> 02:39:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for talking about my nose.</v>

3306
02:39:02.010 --> 02:39:04.500
<v Speaker 2>But hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like the way you've talked</v>

3307
02:39:04.501 --> 02:39:07.080
<v Speaker 2>about my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking entire podcast was a thinly</v>

3308
02:39:07.081 --> 02:39:11.190
<v Speaker 2>veiled slight at my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he asked me to go online and</v>

3309
02:39:11.191 --> 02:39:14.190
<v Speaker 2>people are tweeting me half truths about</v>
<v Speaker 2>my nose.</v>

3310
02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:15.150
<v Speaker 4>You know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do.</v>

3311
02:39:15.150 --> 02:39:18.660
<v Speaker 4>They're going to subtly photoshop your</v>
<v Speaker 4>nose just slightly bigger and you know,</v>

3312
02:39:18.670 --> 02:39:19.770
<v Speaker 4>look at the picture like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>

3313
02:39:19.771 --> 02:39:21.420
<v Speaker 4>do I look like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you're going to go to the</v>

3314
02:39:21.421 --> 02:39:22.530
<v Speaker 4>bathroom and look at your notes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go,</v>

3315
02:39:22.531 --> 02:39:23.700
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3316
02:39:23.701 --> 02:39:26.130
<v Speaker 4>thank you for giving them this bang up</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

3317
02:39:26.910 --> 02:39:31.910
<v Speaker 4>Well I know this guy who photoshops is</v>
<v Speaker 4>radio personality and he takes them and</v>

3318
02:39:32.701 --> 02:39:35.610
<v Speaker 4>he does like these subtle weird things</v>
<v Speaker 4>to his face.</v>

3319
02:39:35.850 --> 02:39:40.850
<v Speaker 4>He makes his teeth bigger and make some</v>
<v Speaker 4>bolder and he makes his hands smaller</v>

3320
02:39:41.490 --> 02:39:45.240
<v Speaker 4>and he makes his shoulders like more</v>
<v Speaker 4>narrow but just slightly.</v>

3321
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:49.590
<v Speaker 4>When you look at him you go fuck is</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on with them and this and it</v>

3322
02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:52.740
<v Speaker 4>drives the radio guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think probably crazy.</v>

3323
02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:55.710
<v Speaker 4>Does he know that the guys doing it</v>
<v Speaker 4>though or is he just thinks that he's</v>

3324
02:39:55.711 --> 02:39:57.400
<v Speaker 4>becoming disproportionate?</v>

3325
02:39:57.410 --> 02:39:59.640
<v Speaker 4>I think you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well some of the pictures of the guys</v>

3326
02:39:59.641 --> 02:40:03.500
<v Speaker 4>more obvious and some of them is more</v>
<v Speaker 4>subtle but it's the.</v>

3327
02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:06.970
<v Speaker 4>But the fact that that's not what he</v>
<v Speaker 4>really looks like that.</v>

3328
02:40:06.971 --> 02:40:11.460
<v Speaker 4>But the fact that someone could take</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you look like and make it different</v>

3329
02:40:11.610 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 4>but just slightly but just will fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>with you.</v>

3330
02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:16.800
<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

3331
02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:20.220
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ears aren't too big,</v>

3332
02:40:20.221 --> 02:40:22.830
<v Speaker 4>but if somebody like stretches your ears</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just a little bit and makes them poke</v>

3333
02:40:22.831 --> 02:40:25.530
<v Speaker 4>out of your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is going on in my ears?</v>

3334
02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:29.640
<v Speaker 4>like that's the photoshop thing is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird thing.</v>

3335
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:33.030
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that people could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also weird that people use it to</v>

3336
02:40:33.031 --> 02:40:35.800
<v Speaker 4>manipulate their own image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Face tuning.</v>

3337
02:40:36.090 --> 02:40:39.800
<v Speaker 4>Male comedian who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who smooths hIs skin out and does it</v>

3338
02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.730
<v Speaker 4>like a glamour filter on a bad fake as</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

3339
02:40:44.850 --> 02:40:47.170
<v Speaker 4>It looks bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like super bowl.</v>

3340
02:40:47.210 --> 02:40:48.960
<v Speaker 4>And then you see them In real life like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3341
02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:51.880
<v Speaker 4>where the fuck what did you have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chicken pox.</v>

3342
02:40:51.881 --> 02:40:56.881
<v Speaker 4>And last tIme I saw your photos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She gonna fight with a fucking salt gun.</v>

3343
02:40:58.530 --> 02:41:00.330
<v Speaker 4>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

3344
02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:04.240
<v Speaker 4>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to manipulate faces and the,</v>

3345
02:41:04.250 --> 02:41:08.310
<v Speaker 4>the photoshop thing and what they do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>models where they're thin out their ways</v>

3346
02:41:08.311 --> 02:41:10.630
<v Speaker 4>and wiping butts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've seen those,</v>

3347
02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:15.840
<v Speaker 4>those reality versus the photoshop</v>
<v Speaker 4>images overwhelming has changed.</v>

3348
02:41:16.291 --> 02:41:18.630
<v Speaker 4>and then I wish I could remember what I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was watching,</v>

3349
02:41:18.631 --> 02:41:21.600
<v Speaker 4>but it was something where they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing that they can do this to moving</v>

3350
02:41:21.601 --> 02:41:23.670
<v Speaker 4>images.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So movies,</v>

3351
02:41:23.671 --> 02:41:25.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they showed the real version of the</v>

3352
02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:29.100
<v Speaker 4>actress in whatever movie versus what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you saw on screen.</v>

3353
02:41:29.101 --> 02:41:32.670
<v Speaker 4>And it was sort of the equivalent of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>photo shopped magazine cover.</v>

3354
02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:34.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're going to get to a point</v>

3355
02:41:34.620 --> 02:41:39.620
<v Speaker 4>very soon where actors are unnecessary</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you look at some of the</v>

3356
02:41:39.990 --> 02:41:42.630
<v Speaker 4>incredible cgi that they're able to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

3357
02:41:42.631 --> 02:41:43.320
<v Speaker 4>where they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

3358
02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:46.860
<v Speaker 4>they're so close to absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 4>recreating a human being.</v>

3359
02:41:47.310 --> 02:41:52.310
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to need actors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe voiceover actors to just even that</v>

3360
02:41:52.321 --> 02:41:56.010
<v Speaker 4>maybe they'll get to their point where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're visual or audio software can</v>

3361
02:41:56.011 --> 02:42:01.011
<v Speaker 4>manipulate the human voice in the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>way that you could do wIth music</v>

3362
02:42:01.711 --> 02:42:05.850
<v Speaker 4>software where you could use garage band</v>
<v Speaker 4>songs without knowing any guitars.</v>

3363
02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:09.060
<v Speaker 4>So actors who are listening time to</v>
<v Speaker 4>start a podcast,</v>

3364
02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:11.280
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost over bitches,</v>

3365
02:42:11.430 --> 02:42:14.190
<v Speaker 4>but it's not because you're never going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to recreate like a Daniel</v>

3366
02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:16.890
<v Speaker 4>Day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lewis never like someone who can go that</v>

3367
02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:18.630
<v Speaker 4>deep into something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost,</v>

3368
02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:23.400
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like until he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know it can be done.</v>

3369
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:24.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

3370
02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:29.310
<v Speaker 4>his intense commitment to a character is</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

3371
02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:32.460
<v Speaker 4>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's also part of what you love</v>

3372
02:42:32.461 --> 02:42:34.110
<v Speaker 4>about watching that guy in the movies</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3373
02:42:34.111 --> 02:42:36.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Daniel Day lewis,</v>

3374
02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:37.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during that first,</v>

3375
02:42:37.810 --> 02:42:40.200
<v Speaker 4>not first blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it called in,</v>

3376
02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:43.740
<v Speaker 4>there will be blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there will be blood character like,</v>

3377
02:42:43.741 --> 02:42:44.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's him,</v>

3378
02:42:44.821 --> 02:42:46.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Daniel Day lewis.</v>

3379
02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:51.000
<v Speaker 4>But you also completely believe he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking guy that's half of the</v>

3380
02:42:51.001 --> 02:42:56.001
<v Speaker 4>thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that someone does the</v>

3381
02:42:56.251 --> 02:42:57.520
<v Speaker 4>cirque de solei,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3382
02:42:57.550 --> 02:42:59.610
<v Speaker 4>like look at the guy flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3383
02:42:59.611 --> 02:43:04.200
<v Speaker 4>that that's a person that had a practice</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they had to get so proficient that</v>

3384
02:43:04.201 --> 02:43:09.201
<v Speaker 4>they could do something that looks</v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible and then do it line by line</v>

3385
02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:12.110
<v Speaker 4>out of order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

3386
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:16.840
<v Speaker 3>speakIng about recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think my conception of acting is,</v>

3387
02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:21.880
<v Speaker 3>is almost like comes from a theater</v>
<v Speaker 3>world where it's like you put on a</v>

3388
02:43:21.881 --> 02:43:25.510
<v Speaker 3>costume and then you go be a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>person for two hours or whatever.</v>

3389
02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Like a theater movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amalgam.</v>

3390
02:43:27.740 --> 02:43:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I shot this pilot recently and you</v>

3391
02:43:32.201 --> 02:43:35.140
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was shot out of order as</v>

3392
02:43:35.230 --> 02:43:38.470
<v Speaker 3>things are when they're shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it kind of gave me this insight into</v>

3393
02:43:38.471 --> 02:43:39.190
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3394
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:44.190
<v Speaker 3>part so much of the skill is just your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to pick it up out of order and</v>

3395
02:43:46.961 --> 02:43:49.120
<v Speaker 3>act it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you know,</v>

3396
02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:50.920
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so piecemeal.</v>

3397
02:43:51.020 --> 02:43:53.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would Daniel Day lewis did?</v>

3398
02:43:53.101 --> 02:43:56.520
<v Speaker 4>the lincoln movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently he was in character as</v>

3399
02:43:56.521 --> 02:43:59.400
<v Speaker 4>lincoln the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk to people as lincoln.</v>

3400
02:43:59.401 --> 02:44:02.700
<v Speaker 4>Everything he did as lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the aide is lincoln went to bed as</v>

3401
02:44:02.701 --> 02:44:04.800
<v Speaker 4>lincoln woke up as lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

3402
02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:07.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a little much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

3403
02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:12.420
<v Speaker 4>Nutty dude to hang around with knowing</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that way because it was christian</v>

3404
02:44:12.421 --> 02:44:14.310
<v Speaker 4>bale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do that kind of stuff too.</v>

3405
02:44:14.570 --> 02:44:15.590
<v Speaker 4>You hear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

3406
02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:18.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean you saw the machinist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see that movie?</v>

3407
02:44:18.380 --> 02:44:19.230
<v Speaker 4>You never saw that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3408
02:44:19.231 --> 02:44:20.910
<v Speaker 4>I know I should though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on my list.</v>

3409
02:44:20.940 --> 02:44:23.250
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lost a whole bunch of weight.</v>

3410
02:44:23.251 --> 02:44:26.340
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he got to death's door.</v>

3411
02:44:26.730 --> 02:44:30.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally got to death's door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looked like an auschwitz victim.</v>

3412
02:44:30.570 --> 02:44:34.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how a person allows</v>

3413
02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:37.500
<v Speaker 4>themselves to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a good image.</v>

3414
02:44:37.530 --> 02:44:39.450
<v Speaker 4>J jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a real image from the movie.</v>

3415
02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:41.850
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a digital recreation.</v>

3416
02:44:41.851 --> 02:44:43.140
<v Speaker 4>That's him for real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3417
02:44:43.330 --> 02:44:45.390
<v Speaker 4>I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I seen that picture.</v>

3418
02:44:45.610 --> 02:44:49.440
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he got to the point where his</v>

3419
02:44:49.441 --> 02:44:53.910
<v Speaker 4>body was shriveled away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had no body fat and he was dying.</v>

3420
02:44:54.090 --> 02:44:59.090
<v Speaker 4>He played a guy with severe insomnia</v>
<v Speaker 4>that started to have hallucinations and</v>

3421
02:45:00.390 --> 02:45:04.260
<v Speaker 4>was losing his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really crazy shit.</v>

3422
02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:08.760
<v Speaker 4>But that someone takes it to that level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's like one of the badges of</v>

3423
02:45:08.761 --> 02:45:11.940
<v Speaker 4>honor when it comes to those types of</v>
<v Speaker 4>actors,</v>

3424
02:45:11.941 --> 02:45:14.970
<v Speaker 4>like robert deniro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to do that member in raging</v>

3425
02:45:14.971 --> 02:45:17.280
<v Speaker 4>bull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he got an incredible shape.</v>

3426
02:45:17.281 --> 02:45:18.960
<v Speaker 4>We got really lean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looked like a boxer,</v>

3427
02:45:18.961 --> 02:45:23.190
<v Speaker 4>and then for the end of the movie got</v>
<v Speaker 4>really fat and he played like jake</v>

3428
02:45:23.191 --> 02:45:25.920
<v Speaker 4>lamata all swollen and filled with</v>
<v Speaker 4>spaghetti,</v>

3429
02:45:26.310 --> 02:45:28.680
<v Speaker 4>but who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who had that?</v>

3430
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:31.890
<v Speaker 4>That famous quip is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you just try acting?</v>

3431
02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:33.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget who it was.</v>

3432
02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:36.870
<v Speaker 4>I want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just say it.</v>

3433
02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:38.670
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3434
02:45:38.730 --> 02:45:42.900
<v Speaker 4>But meanwhile would have sir laurence</v>
<v Speaker 4>olivier play jake lamotta in raging</v>

3435
02:45:42.901 --> 02:45:44.080
<v Speaker 4>bull.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did it have sucked?</v>

3436
02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:47.760
<v Speaker 4>What was good?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suspect it would not have been as good</v>

3437
02:45:47.810 --> 02:45:49.460
<v Speaker 4>and probably whatnot have been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3438
02:45:49.470 --> 02:45:53.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean you like when he played that guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>in cape fear,</v>

3439
02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:55.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean to get into kind of shape that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>got in.</v>

3440
02:45:55.171 --> 02:46:00.171
<v Speaker 4>Remember when he's doing those chin ups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you believed that he was his rage</v>

3441
02:46:00.691 --> 02:46:03.900
<v Speaker 4>filled ex con that was coming to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>revenge.</v>

3442
02:46:03.901 --> 02:46:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Like he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like he approached life that</v>

3443
02:46:07.711 --> 02:46:09.150
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just,</v>

3444
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:14.230
<v Speaker 4>he was acting like he had an adopted</v>
<v Speaker 4>this mindset and had it fully ingrained</v>

3445
02:46:14.901 --> 02:46:17.750
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into who he was portraying on screen.</v>

3446
02:46:17.930 --> 02:46:19.550
<v Speaker 4>It's why those movies are so good.</v>

3447
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that is the difference between,</v>

3448
02:46:22.430 --> 02:46:25.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>superstar powerhouse,</v>

3449
02:46:25.071 --> 02:46:30.071
<v Speaker 2>really compelling acting and just sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of average acting is that they really</v>

3450
02:46:30.171 --> 02:46:32.900
<v Speaker 2>are living at versus they are acting it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in a moment.</v>

3451
02:46:33.340 --> 02:46:34.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean you have to take it to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>utmost,</v>

3452
02:46:35.020 --> 02:46:38.830
<v Speaker 4>but that's also why it's so frustrating</v>
<v Speaker 4>to watch robert deniro in the intern</v>

3453
02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:41.320
<v Speaker 4>like jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that?</v>

3454
02:46:41.380 --> 02:46:44.340
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched clips of it on an airplane and</v>

3455
02:46:44.341 --> 02:46:46.360
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I took my headphones</v>

3456
02:46:46.361 --> 02:46:46.931
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

3457
02:46:46.931 --> 02:46:50.500
<v Speaker 4>am I watching stupid ass movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like,</v>

3458
02:46:50.501 --> 02:46:53.860
<v Speaker 4>this is a guy that was a part of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the great cinematic</v>

3459
02:46:53.861 --> 02:46:56.230
<v Speaker 4>masterpieces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was in the godfather.</v>

3460
02:46:56.231 --> 02:46:58.480
<v Speaker 4>Ii was raging bull.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3461
02:46:58.481 --> 02:47:00.160
<v Speaker 4>he just like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>the list goes on.</v>

3462
02:47:00.161 --> 02:47:02.050
<v Speaker 4>Taxi driver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3463
02:47:02.051 --> 02:47:06.220
<v Speaker 4>he was in some fucking masterpieces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meet the fockers.</v>

3464
02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't he in that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>

3465
02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:11.290
<v Speaker 4>Probably where it started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably realized like I don't even have</v>

3466
02:47:11.291 --> 02:47:14.980
<v Speaker 4>to act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember these stupid words to say and</v>

3467
02:47:14.981 --> 02:47:17.230
<v Speaker 4>just get some fat money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huh?</v>

3468
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:18.743
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

3469
02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:19.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3470
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's kind of like.</v>

3471
02:47:21.531 --> 02:47:24.800

<v Speaker 2>caricature of apa.</v>

<v Speaker 2>contract.</v>

<v Speaker 4>The devil remember,</v>
