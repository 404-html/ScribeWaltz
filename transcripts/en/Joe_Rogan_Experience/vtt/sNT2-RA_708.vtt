29
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 4>matter of moments and you will emerge into another space time created by the</v>

30
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:22.730
<v Speaker 4>singularity of the black hole you just fell into.</v>

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine giving your son to someone to hack his balls off so he could</v>

34

40
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 3>You have a chance to be a constraint.</v>

41
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.160
<v Speaker 1>If you have any marijuana in your blood in Japan,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna be able to fight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That drug in Japan.</v>

52
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I was facing some bad time,</v>

53
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:00.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

55
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I was a famous figure and they wanted to make an example to me.</v>

56
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>So it was then the,</v>

57
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>the interrogation came to finding out where I got my stuff in Japan,</v>

58
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>if you throw everything to a foreign person,</v>

59
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.183
<v Speaker 1>they'll drop.</v>

60
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.190
<v Speaker 1>They won't want to go fight someone in America.</v>

61
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.350

<v Speaker 5>Not that popular.</v>

90
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's that popular there.</v>

91
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:13.331
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

92
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:15.490

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

96
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 5>This is the most awkward guy ever.</v>

97
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

98
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.060

<v Speaker 5>That lazy gentleman was a gas moment in our podcast.</v>

107
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.590
<v Speaker 6>My belief is all of us have all of us create what we need to work through to</v>

108
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 6>create and learn what we need to in this world.</v>

109
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 6>And so I can't look at anyone as a victim.</v>

110
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 6>I can't even a child.</v>

111
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't blame them.</v>

112
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.241
<v Speaker 6>I don't say,</v>

113
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 6>this is your fault.</v>

118
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.110

<v Speaker 9>They were afraid he would go out and die the traditional way.</v>

288
00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:30.390
<v Speaker 9>When Eskimo people got old,</v>

<v Speaker 5>listen to that.</v>

374
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.110
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to shut you down with a gun next to your head.</v>

375
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 5>You're telling me if that's true.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You can put a gun to your bucket at all.</v>

382
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

383
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.990
<v Speaker 5>Telling me that's good music.</v>

384
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 5>You're fucking 20 years old.</v>

385
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:21.270
<v Speaker 5>Not at all.</v>

386
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.460
<v Speaker 5>Like when somebody says I like the Dave Matthews Band,</v>

387
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 5>I will pistol whip you.</v>

388
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 5>He's beauty.</v>

389
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 5>He just find my yard.</v>

390
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 5>I swear he is to look at me.</v>

391
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 5>He was my friend.</v>

392
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:39.210
<v Speaker 5>I know that sounds retarded.</v>

393
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 5>But you are afraid of aliens though,</v>

394
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

395
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:42.511
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

396
00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:47.511
<v Speaker 5>My first a path mapped out in your house had to get out of the aliens show up.</v>

397
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.760
<v Speaker 5>That's the rumor man.</v>

398
00:11:52.761 --> 00:11:53.600
<v Speaker 5>That's heard.</v>

399
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

400
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 2>heard you have a plan because I know you like to use game plans,</v>

401
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 2>so I figured he's had an alien.</v>

402
00:11:59.440 --> 00:11:59.801
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

403
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 2>I know cat ready and I know Jujitsu all didn't show up.</v>

404
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 2>I put a triangle choke on him and I also have,</v>

405
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I kept that as well,</v>

406
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:08.030
<v Speaker 2>so I kept that to a Japanese get,</v>

407
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.921
<v Speaker 2>I'll see if they come,</v>

408
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:10.090
<v Speaker 2>I can slice them apart.</v>

409
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Speaker 2>You've um,</v>

410
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 11>you've kicked the green bitch.</v>

411
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 11>Yes.</v>

412
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.641
<v Speaker 11>Yes.</v>

413
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 11>After a 24 year intense relationship with the,</v>

414
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:20.550
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

415
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 11>the green goddess or the Green Bitch,</v>

416
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.820
<v Speaker 11>depending on what mood she's in.</v>

417
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 11>I had to stop.</v>

418
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.190
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

419
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.023
<v Speaker 11>and uh,</v>

420
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 11>I've come in for some,</v>

421
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 11>I've convinced for some,</v>

422
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.240
<v Speaker 11>some criticism for this and I feel it's important to say that,</v>

423
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

424
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.070
<v Speaker 11>I hugely value and love cannabis.</v>

425
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.050
<v Speaker 11>I think it's a wonderful herbal ally and I think that,</v>

426
00:12:46.051 --> 00:12:49.810
<v Speaker 11>I don't think that I would ever have written my books off historical mystery if</v>

427
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.300
<v Speaker 11>I had not encountered cannabis.</v>

428
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.620
<v Speaker 2>But like you mean you guys are both in better shape than I am,</v>

429
00:12:54.621 --> 00:12:56.060
<v Speaker 2>but I work out 45 minutes a month.</v>

430
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.310
<v Speaker 2>I do my whole body vibration 45 minutes a month.</v>

431
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

432
00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I do high end had a minute less ridiculous.</v>

433
00:13:02.521 --> 00:13:03.650
<v Speaker 2>That's five times more than me.</v>

434
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

435
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.730
<v Speaker 2>You too busy.</v>

436
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I have some theories about that I was doing,</v>

437
00:13:09.921 --> 00:13:12.260
<v Speaker 2>I invented bulletproof intermittent fasting during that time,</v>

438
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.930
<v Speaker 2>which is when you do bulletproof coffee during an intermittent fast,</v>

439
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.191
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

440

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.050
<v Speaker 5>I could do John Mayer did to too.</v>

588
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:53.281
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

589
00:16:53.281 --> 00:16:53.970
<v Speaker 5>I think he's great.</v>

590
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:54.840
<v Speaker 5>I think he's very talented.</v>

591
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.520
<v Speaker 5>But if your wife is really into going,</v>

592
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:57.511
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm saying?</v>

593
00:16:57.511 --> 00:16:59.370
<v Speaker 5>Like she dragged you there and just stares at him.</v>

594
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.993
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

595
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.270
<v Speaker 5>Boob bless you.</v>

596
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.130
<v Speaker 5>Notice she's not clapping because when her hands slipped down her genes,</v>

597
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.830
<v Speaker 5>she's his knuckle deep.</v>

598
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.153
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

599
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.063
<v Speaker 5>so sad.</v>

600
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.090
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like someone's stabbing of seal.</v>

601
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.303
<v Speaker 5>Just</v>

602
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.800
<v Speaker 5>she's just Fiserv herself.</v>

603
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.390
<v Speaker 5>She's all the way to her elbow.</v>

604
00:17:21.391 --> 00:17:23.760
<v Speaker 5>Just grounded it in there.</v>

605
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.580
<v Speaker 5>You can see her rib cage expand as a fist.</v>

606
00:17:26.581 --> 00:17:27.414
<v Speaker 5>Goes up there</v>

607
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.690
<v Speaker 5>fucking love you.</v>

608
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:36.821
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

609
00:17:36.821 --> 00:17:37.654
<v Speaker 6>Let's go.</v>

610
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.940
<v Speaker 6>And if you break down humor like that,</v>

611
00:17:39.941 --> 00:17:40.361
<v Speaker 6>like you said,</v>

612
00:17:40.361 --> 00:17:41.320
<v Speaker 6>fine tooth comb,</v>

613
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.610
<v Speaker 6>every single joke where 90% of the jokes you do,</v>

614
00:17:45.611 --> 00:17:48.130
<v Speaker 6>unless you're talking about balloons are bouncing a ball,</v>

615
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.560
<v Speaker 6>have hurt somebody.</v>

616
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.620
<v Speaker 6>If we get that literal with humor than almost all jokes comics tell are going to</v>

617
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 6>be up for a a careful examination.</v>

618
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 6>Contributing to a fucking rape culture is nonsense and it is to say comedian</v>

619
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 6>contributes to rape culture is simply bullshit and it's simplistic thinking.</v>

620
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 6>It's a way of saying,</v>

621
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:12.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't like what you're saying and I don't want you to say it,</v>

622
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.920
<v Speaker 6>but I can't come out with that.</v>

623
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 6>So I have to find a higher reason which makes it sound like you shouldn't say</v>

624
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:17.761
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

625
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:18.360
<v Speaker 6>For this reason,</v>

626
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.460
<v Speaker 6>as the ban against these weapons roads,</v>

627
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 6>other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas and</v>

628
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 6>using them cheeses over time where the troops were again,</v>

629
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:30.030
<v Speaker 6>face the prospect.</v>

630
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 6>Honestly,</v>

631
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.710
<v Speaker 6>we don't attack the area.</v>

632
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:32.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to get some poison gas.</v>

633
00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 6>It could be easier for terrorist organizations and the day after any military</v>

634
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:37.404
<v Speaker 6>action,</v>

635
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:42.090
<v Speaker 6>we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens</v>

636
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.510
<v Speaker 6>those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism.</v>

637
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.000
<v Speaker 4>Biden beat me at poker.</v>

638
00:18:47.001 --> 00:18:48.290
<v Speaker 4>He used to run Raytheon.</v>

639
00:18:48.291 --> 00:18:48.880
<v Speaker 4>They sell how?</v>

640
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.760
<v Speaker 4>Hellfire missiles.</v>

641
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.831
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

642
00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:52.491
<v Speaker 4>now he's leaving.</v>

643
00:18:52.491 --> 00:18:53.450
<v Speaker 4>The same way came in.</v>

644
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

645
00:18:54.381 --> 00:18:56.480
<v Speaker 4>Nice and dramatic that just that alone,</v>

646
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.030
<v Speaker 4>all of this ready attrical shit was orchestrated.</v>

647
00:18:59.031 --> 00:18:59.660
<v Speaker 4>Folks,</v>

648
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.300
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you there are some people that are involved in this.</v>

649
00:19:02.301 --> 00:19:03.500
<v Speaker 4>There's some producers,</v>

650
00:19:03.501 --> 00:19:03.920
<v Speaker 4>there's some,</v>

651
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.020
<v Speaker 4>there's an artistic director they want.</v>

652
00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:06.351
<v Speaker 4>That was a,</v>

653
00:19:06.351 --> 00:19:08.540
<v Speaker 4>that was a well planned out scene.</v>

654
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.583
<v Speaker 4>He walks up,</v>

655
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.970
<v Speaker 4>he walks back.</v>

656
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.300
<v Speaker 4>The fact that they do it in this ancient stupid house where he supposedly lives.</v>

657
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.871
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

658
00:19:14.871 --> 00:19:19.670
<v Speaker 4>you know he's in some fucking seven mile thick bunker down deep into the ground.</v>

659
00:19:19.671 --> 00:19:22.880
<v Speaker 4>The bowels of the Earth where Dick Cheney was hiding all throughout the Iraq</v>

660
00:19:22.881 --> 00:19:23.470
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>

661
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.961
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>

662
00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:26.220
<v Speaker 4>here's just a metal slide he jumps in and look at.</v>

663
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.961
<v Speaker 4>It's a shoot,</v>

664
00:19:26.961 --> 00:19:28.160
<v Speaker 4>like a laundry chute,</v>

665
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.850
<v Speaker 4>jumps in and slides through the lens and the towels and just go some cell phone</v>

666
00:19:33.851 --> 00:19:37.070
<v Speaker 4>off and surrounded by lizards who are like excellent work.</v>

667
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

668
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:37.761
<v Speaker 4>it's bad.</v>

669
00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:38.660
<v Speaker 4>It's about men's layer.</v>

670
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:43.490
<v Speaker 4>How much time between her putting the Saran wrap over your butt hole and you</v>

671
00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:44.211
<v Speaker 4>shooting a load,</v>

672
00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:45.130
<v Speaker 4>how much time fit?</v>

673
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.000
<v Speaker 4>15 seconds to put the Saran wrap,</v>

674
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.530
<v Speaker 4>five seconds to shoot.</v>

675
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:49.701
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

676
00:19:49.701 --> 00:19:50.000
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

677
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.300
<v Speaker 12>It's,</v>

678
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:50.931
<v Speaker 12>it's horrendous.</v>

679
00:19:50.931 --> 00:19:53.300
<v Speaker 12>I mean you call it feminism Marxists with pennies.</v>

680
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.760
<v Speaker 12>Does that socialism,</v>

681
00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:55.594
<v Speaker 12>socialism,</v>

682
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.970
<v Speaker 12>socialism at test,</v>

683
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.080
<v Speaker 12>but that was a bad character and one of my novels,</v>

684
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.700
<v Speaker 12>I just go on the feminism.</v>

685
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.030
<v Speaker 12>Socialism at Penn is that is very true because I mean,</v>

686
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.020
<v Speaker 12>and then people call,</v>

687
00:20:06.021 --> 00:20:06.531
<v Speaker 12>oh my God,</v>

688
00:20:06.531 --> 00:20:07.101
<v Speaker 12>that's so terrible.</v>

689
00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:07.390
<v Speaker 12>That's not,</v>

690
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.700
<v Speaker 12>I just went through all the founding matriarchs of the feminist system that all</v>

691
00:20:10.701 --> 00:20:11.241
<v Speaker 12>Marxists,</v>

692
00:20:11.241 --> 00:20:16.241
<v Speaker 12>all leftist and so on and also it feminist is so pro woman then where are they</v>

693
00:20:17.031 --> 00:20:17.990
<v Speaker 12>with Margaret Thatcher?</v>

694
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.230
<v Speaker 12>Margaret Thatcher was like the first leader of a Western country.</v>

695
00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:22.730
<v Speaker 12>She struggled that from nothing.</v>

696
00:20:22.731 --> 00:20:24.350
<v Speaker 12>I made an incredibly powerful woman,</v>

697
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.430
<v Speaker 12>but she was on the right.</v>

698
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:25.761
<v Speaker 12>You see,</v>

699
00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:26.600
<v Speaker 12>so they hate her.</v>

700
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.710
<v Speaker 12>What about Iran?</v>

701
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.221
<v Speaker 12>I ran,</v>

702
00:20:28.221 --> 00:20:28.521
<v Speaker 12>wrote,</v>

703
00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:32.690
<v Speaker 12>wrote the most influential book outside the Bible and the second most</v>

704
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.980
<v Speaker 12>influential book and according to The New York Times review of books after the</v>

705
00:20:36.981 --> 00:20:37.640
<v Speaker 12>Bible,</v>

706
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:37.851
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

707
00:20:37.851 --> 00:20:38.091
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

708
00:20:38.091 --> 00:20:42.200
<v Speaker 12>we shaped a western philosophy in many ways and western politics and the</v>

709
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:42.860
<v Speaker 12>feminist hater.</v>

710
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.071
<v Speaker 12>Why?</v>

711
00:20:43.071 --> 00:20:44.470
<v Speaker 12>Cause she was on the right cause he's,</v>

712
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.171
<v Speaker 12>that's what they think.</v>

713
00:20:45.171 --> 00:20:46.340
<v Speaker 12>She was not actually on the right,</v>

714
00:20:46.341 --> 00:20:50.370
<v Speaker 12>but so I mean I have these sorts of suspicions when they're sort of the,</v>

715
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.110
<v Speaker 12>is it the leftist ideology or the pro woman?</v>

716
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 12>Now if it's the pro woman,</v>

717
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.140
<v Speaker 12>then they should be incredibly positive.</v>

718
00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.430
<v Speaker 12>Where are the feminists when people insult people like Ann Coulter,</v>

719
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.331
<v Speaker 12>where are the feminist?</v>

720
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:02.740
<v Speaker 12>When people insult Sarah Pailin,</v>

721
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.240
<v Speaker 12>you don't like Bill Maher,</v>

722
00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:05.140
<v Speaker 12>her called her a cunt.</v>

723
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 12>I mean that's really pretty vicious.</v>

724
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:08.411
<v Speaker 12>Like publicly,</v>

725
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:08.861
<v Speaker 12>openly,</v>

726
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:09.131
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

727
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:12.630
<v Speaker 12>I mean where are the fee because they are on the rise and culture and they're</v>

728
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.540
<v Speaker 12>considered to be on the right.</v>

729
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 12>So they get a pass when people go,</v>

730
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:15.731
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

731
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:18.040
<v Speaker 12>but you then say something bad about a woman on the left.</v>

732
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:21.970
<v Speaker 12>And so I think that he is more left than it is pro women because when they</v>

733
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:24.220
<v Speaker 12>choose between their politics and the agenda,</v>

734
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 12>they always seem to choose the politics of what the agenda is.</v>

735
00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:28.980
<v Speaker 12>And that's why I say it's left as rather than then problem.</v>

736
00:21:28.981 --> 00:21:29.300
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>

737
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.280
<v Speaker 5>People always take things at face value.</v>

738
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.100
<v Speaker 5>They don't tend to get to know you or,</v>

739
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm sitting right in front of you now.</v>

740
00:21:35.571 --> 00:21:38.060
<v Speaker 5>Would you say that I am a woman?</v>

741
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.043
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

742
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.500
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

743
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.240
<v Speaker 5>Don't say you're a woman.</v>

744
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.530
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

745
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.363

<v Speaker 5>14.</v>

775
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.760
<v Speaker 5>14 and that's what I was noticing.</v>

776
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:25.840
<v Speaker 5>I was smoking dope then.</v>

777
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 5>I was no innocent then I was smoking dope.</v>

778
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.701
<v Speaker 5>I was finger bang.</v>

779
00:22:29.701 --> 00:22:30.534
<v Speaker 5>And people,</v>

780
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.690
<v Speaker 1>the hardest thing in the world is to say,</v>

781
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:34.500
<v Speaker 1>if somebody says to you,</v>

782
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.333
<v Speaker 1>relax,</v>

783
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.660
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

784
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.980
<v Speaker 1>or be yourself,</v>

785
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:38.970
<v Speaker 1>it just be yourself,</v>

786
00:22:38.971 --> 00:22:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

787
00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.100
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

788
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

789
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:41.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

790
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:46.190
<v Speaker 1>and yet I think as we become more professional and better at what we're doing,</v>

791
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.640
<v Speaker 1>when somebody says to you,</v>

792
00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:48.570
<v Speaker 1>be yourself,</v>

793
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.493
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

794
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.640
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

795
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

796
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.440
<v Speaker 1>you're not burdened by these false selves and these things that,</v>

797
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:56.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

798
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.630
<v Speaker 1>that you think you ought to be or ought block to say,</v>

799
00:22:58.631 --> 00:23:00.540
<v Speaker 1>or how you want to look or what you ought to be.</v>

800
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:05.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think in many ways that's what any artist does as they become a</v>

801
00:23:05.311 --> 00:23:06.420
<v Speaker 1>professional at what they do.</v>

802
00:23:06.421 --> 00:23:08.430
<v Speaker 1>They learned to kind of get out of their own way.</v>

803
00:23:08.431 --> 00:23:09.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's the hardest thing of all,</v>

804
00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

805
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.080
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel a responsibility for that or towards that as an artist?</v>

806
00:23:14.081 --> 00:23:16.170
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever feel like because of the,</v>

807
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.170
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing,</v>

808
00:23:17.171 --> 00:23:17.711
<v Speaker 4>because if you're,</v>

809
00:23:17.711 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 4>you're so motivated,</v>

810
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:21.350
<v Speaker 4>you get so much done and you have so many different projects going.</v>

811
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.331
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

812
00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 4>do you realize the impact of that?</v>

813
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Because a lot of people were inspired by though the,</v>

814
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.630
<v Speaker 4>not just the work ethic that you have,</v>

815
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.730
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

816
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.540
<v Speaker 4>how much quality shit you produce,</v>

817
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 4>whether it's wine or music or,</v>

818
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate the company.</v>

819
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

820
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:36.691
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

821
00:23:36.691 --> 00:23:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I think you can't really worry about it.</v>

822
00:23:38.371 --> 00:23:40.430
<v Speaker 1>You just got to do what it is doing.</v>

823
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.470
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

824
00:23:42.471 --> 00:23:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I just have to do what I'm doing.</v>

825
00:23:43.491 --> 00:23:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>

826
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:44.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

827
00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.253
<v Speaker 1>there's a sense of,</v>

828
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 1>for the art or for the,</v>

829
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.171
<v Speaker 1>the process.</v>

830
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And just for myself,</v>

831
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

832
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I care about what I'm doing.</v>

833
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

834
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.850
<v Speaker 1>if I start caring about what you think about what I'm doing,</v>

835
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.970
<v Speaker 1>whether it's going to be helping you,</v>

836
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:56.331
<v Speaker 1>then I'm,</v>

837
00:23:56.331 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

838
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.261
<v Speaker 1>that I'm,</v>

839
00:23:57.261 --> 00:23:57.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

840
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 1>an assisted living,</v>

841
00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

842
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.480
<v Speaker 1>employee when I was on the space station the second time.</v>

843
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the other crew members,</v>

844
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:04.970
<v Speaker 1>her name is sue Holmes.</v>

845
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

846
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.590
<v Speaker 1>she and I were talking,</v>

847
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Speaker 1>we'd known each other since test pilot school.</v>

848
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>And in passing a throwaway thing,</v>

849
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 1>she didn't even think she was saying.</v>

850
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:11.990
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

851
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.171
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

852
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:12.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

853
00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Earth said that we're supposed to do this next.</v>

854
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.321
<v Speaker 1>And in my mind,</v>

855
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I heard Earth said,</v>

856
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I heard those words come out of her mouth.</v>

857
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

858
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:25.180
<v Speaker 1>she has in her mind completely a split off from the other 7 billion people.</v>

859
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 1>There's her crew and earth is one singular identifiable entity on the other</v>

860
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:31.814
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

861
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 1>And that was a real,</v>

862
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:35.980
<v Speaker 1>a bellringer to me of what it's going to be like to go to Mars.</v>

863
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Those people are going to be,</v>

864
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

865
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.130
<v Speaker 1>a completely discrete unit of people and there'll be Martians.</v>

866
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.150
<v Speaker 1>They won't be earthlinks pretty quick in their heads.</v>

867
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:45.530
<v Speaker 1>And how do you deal with that?</v>

868
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 1>How do we plan for that?</v>

869
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And it's still a long ways in the future,</v>

870
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of the many things we need to sort out before we,</v>

871
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.753
<v Speaker 1>because as you say,</v>

872
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.220
<v Speaker 1>once you get the engines going fast enough that you're,</v>

873
00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 1>you're headed for Mars,</v>

874
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 1>you can't just turn around.</v>

875
00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.510

887
00:25:21.121 --> 00:25:21.980
<v Speaker 6>last six,</v>

<v Speaker 6>nine months,</v>

890
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.860
<v Speaker 6>I was financing the thing by selling ecstasy.</v>

891
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.130
<v Speaker 5>What's,</v>

<v Speaker 5>my acting class and you know how long I was an acting class years.</v>

894
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 5>There was a guy,</v>

895
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:32.893
<v Speaker 5>really good guy,</v>

896
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:33.860
<v Speaker 5>normal guy.</v>

897
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.533
<v Speaker 5>So I thought,</v>

898
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.373
<v Speaker 5>and he was,</v>

899
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:41.120
<v Speaker 5>and I hired him to shoot me to shoot this audition.</v>

900
00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:44.870
<v Speaker 5>So I go to his house and he's got this great camera and on his wall is a dream</v>

901
00:25:44.871 --> 00:25:48.710
<v Speaker 5>board and on his wall is his,</v>

<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

906
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.500
<v Speaker 5>He's put his face.</v>

907
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:56.980
<v Speaker 5>He's put his face on the cover of vanity fair and those magazines,</v>

908
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 5>he's got slogan's saying,</v>

909
00:26:00.321 --> 00:26:01.220

910
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 5>you're the one and it's a dream board.</v>

911
00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.241
<v Speaker 5>And it was big.</v>

912
00:26:05.241 --> 00:26:05.541
<v Speaker 5>It was good.</v>

913
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 5>Covered his whole wall,</v>

914
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:07.454
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

915
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:08.360
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

916
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.290
<v Speaker 5>you should dream big,</v>

917
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.620
<v Speaker 5>but you should also be realistic with who you are.</v>

918
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:13.483
<v Speaker 5>I won't do it.</v>

919
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.470
<v Speaker 5>He's gonna do it.</v>

920
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:15.303
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

921
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.900
<v Speaker 5>He could put his hand between my legs and roll me back.</v>

922
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:21.760
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

923
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.910
<v Speaker 5>But see that way you'll get,</v>

924
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 5>don't let him see you doing that.</v>

925
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.083
<v Speaker 5>He's going to hurt you.</v>

926
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.710
<v Speaker 5>What does this 10% you keep saying,</v>

927
00:26:30.711 --> 00:26:31.970
<v Speaker 5>why do you keep saying 10%?</v>

928
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.403
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

929
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 5>Brian keeps saying 10%.</v>

930
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.580
<v Speaker 5>It's a running joke based in truth.</v>

931
00:26:37.581 --> 00:26:38.630
<v Speaker 5>I had some issues.</v>

932
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:40.820
<v Speaker 5>I had some situations in my life and I,</v>

933
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 5>I like to put numbers on things and based</v>

934
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 2>on these factors and experiences and thought processes,</v>

935
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.040
<v Speaker 2>we came to the number of,</v>

936
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:50.241
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

937
00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:51.074
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

938
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 2>10% gay.</v>

939
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm open with it.</v>

940
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.070
<v Speaker 2>You know it it,</v>

941
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

942
00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 2>what'd she just say it?</v>

943
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.543
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

944
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you just said.</v>

945
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.200
<v Speaker 2>What you just said was a statement that would really work if everybody knew what</v>

946
00:27:04.201 --> 00:27:05.034
<v Speaker 2>you were saying,</v>

947
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what you're saying.</v>

948
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:07.980
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying is a 10% gay.</v>

949
00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:08.581
<v Speaker 2>I'm open with it.</v>

950
00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:09.414
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

951
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean you're 10% gay?</v>

952
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.293
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

953
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I came out on my podcast probably like six months ago.</v>

954
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.450
<v Speaker 2>You came out 10% yes.</v>

955
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.473
<v Speaker 2>So funny.</v>

956
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.111
<v Speaker 2>Is there any beers in there?</v>

957
00:27:27.111 --> 00:27:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

958
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.573
<v Speaker 2>Go get me a beer.</v>

959
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I need a beer on this one.</v>

960
00:27:30.711 --> 00:27:30.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

961
00:27:30.801 --> 00:27:31.630
<v Speaker 2>this is going to get rid of,</v>

962
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

963
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.020
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>

964
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I just want to point something out of how we are so weird like as a culture that</v>

965
00:27:38.361 --> 00:27:41.660
<v Speaker 2>this is a part of like normal everyday office life.</v>

966
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Like we've got to make some decisions here.</v>

967
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Like okay look at this woman.</v>

968
00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.020
<v Speaker 2>She's showing everything but her vagina,</v>

969
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:53.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean her knee is just strategically blocking her Lavia her legs are wide open</v>

970
00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:55.670
<v Speaker 2>and she's hot as fuck.</v>

971
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.241
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the thing.</v>

972
00:27:56.241 --> 00:27:59.540
<v Speaker 2>If you put the Kyron right in front of the vagina,</v>

973
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.100
<v Speaker 2>then everybody would know the news.</v>

974
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.113
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

975
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.870
<v Speaker 2>We'd be a very informed country and women would get angry at you if you knew the</v>

976
00:28:05.871 --> 00:28:06.320
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>

977
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:06.501
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

978
00:28:06.501 --> 00:28:08.780
<v Speaker 2>you were looking at her vagina and you read the fucking news.</v>

979
00:28:08.781 --> 00:28:09.614
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

980
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.210
<v Speaker 13>This is like something that I liked that Ron doss has,</v>

981
00:28:12.211 --> 00:28:13.890
<v Speaker 13>which is like if you don't feel like meditating,</v>

982
00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:14.724
<v Speaker 13>don't meditate.</v>

983
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:15.781
<v Speaker 13>Don't force it.</v>

984
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 13>Don't impose this on yourself.</v>

985
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 13>Keep doing the thing you're doing that's upsetting you so much.</v>

986
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:23.790
<v Speaker 13>Have the balls to keep doing the fucking thing that you're doing.</v>

987
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.170
<v Speaker 13>Keep doing it.</v>

988
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.760
<v Speaker 13>If society is going to tell you,</v>

989
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:27.720
<v Speaker 13>don't be like this.</v>

990
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.890
<v Speaker 13>Stop being like this.</v>

991
00:28:28.891 --> 00:28:29.790
<v Speaker 13>You'd have to change.</v>

992
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 13>That's what your parents always say.</v>

993
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.000
<v Speaker 13>The idea is like no,</v>

994
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.570
<v Speaker 13>sink into what you are right now.</v>

995
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 13>Just be that thing.</v>

996
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:43.310
<v Speaker 13>Stop resisting exactly where you are right now is perfect.</v>

997
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.050
<v Speaker 13>And that's a hard truth to grasp.</v>

998
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.460
<v Speaker 13>I've been listening to a Dan Carlin and barbecue my ass.</v>

1032
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.190
<v Speaker 4>Mongols.</v>

1033

<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1038
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.200
<v Speaker 5>that's the best talking about armies that were coming towards China where the</v>

1039
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:54.520
<v Speaker 5>Mongols had been in the distance.</v>

1040
00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:56.860
<v Speaker 5>They thought they saw snow covered mountains,</v>

1041
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 5>but when they got close they realized they were mounds of bones.</v>

1042
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:01.810
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1043
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 5>And garlic and the garlic is just gangster,</v>

1045
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 5>Anybody that's anywhere,</v>

1046
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:08.770
<v Speaker 5>it's like the Mongol hoards.</v>

1047
00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.680
<v Speaker 5>It's like something out of ancient times that we have that,</v>

1048
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:12.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1049
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:12.580
<v Speaker 5>Jeff,</v>

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 5>it's like a Mongo whore.</v>

1051
00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.520
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1052
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.353
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1053
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:16.570
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty preposterous.</v>

1054
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.690
<v Speaker 5>The world has actually never been less violent than it is today.</v>

1055
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.541
<v Speaker 5>Look at Syria,</v>

1056
00:30:21.541 --> 00:30:24.310
<v Speaker 5>how 100,000 people like,</v>

1057
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:25.151
<v Speaker 5>and it's a lot,</v>

1058
00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 5>but I guess she used to be worried.</v>

1059
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Mongols killed a million and a half,</v>

1060
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1061
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.780
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot less murder.</v>

1062
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.200
<v Speaker 4>Then there was like in the fucking 12 hundreds back during the Mongol days and</v>

1063
00:30:35.201 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 4>shit like that.</v>

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Speaker 4>the Mongols came through Moscow in the winter.</v>

1074
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.311
<v Speaker 4>They came through the,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Did I tell you how they,</v>

1080
00:31:07.331 --> 00:31:09.280
<v Speaker 4>why they were so hard to follow into the desert?</v>

1081
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 4>Who the mom calls.</v>

1082

<v Speaker 4>I know a lot about them,</v>

1088
00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:17.381
<v Speaker 4>cause they were like,</v>

1089
00:31:17.381 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 4>if we get some Saturdays to get their arms together,</v>

1095
00:31:26.981 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 4>I think we talked last time about how there was,</v>

1096
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:29.640
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

1097
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.900
<v Speaker 4>there's pictures of,</v>

1098
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1099
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 4>of Afghanistan with,</v>

1100
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.740
<v Speaker 4>with Western ideal type Western idea type cultures.</v>

1101
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1102
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:36.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1103
00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:39.100
<v Speaker 4>there was a massive culture shift in terms of,</v>

1104
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1105
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.610
<v Speaker 4>women with education and your state of dress and,</v>

1106
00:31:43.611 --> 00:31:45.100
<v Speaker 4>and things wouldn't be allowed.</v>

1107
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:45.911
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1108
00:31:45.911 --> 00:31:50.500
<v Speaker 4>there was a fantastic episode of hardcore history and the Dan Carlin podcast</v>

1109
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.230
<v Speaker 4>where he talked about the Mongols invading Iraq.</v>

1110
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:53.411
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1111
00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.870
<v Speaker 4>this is the second time that someone has done that to Baghdad.</v>

1112
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1113
00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:00.400
<v Speaker 4>I've been listening to for the past couple of years.</v>

1114
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Dan Carlin's hardcore history.</v>

1115
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 4>When Baghdad was raided by the Mongols and they crushed the society,</v>

1116
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:11.410
<v Speaker 4>they basically started from scratch after that kills everyone and through all</v>

1117
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:14.020
<v Speaker 4>the literature away so that they save it today,</v>

1118
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:19.440
<v Speaker 4>they're just getting to the point like culturally of where they were in 2012 and</v>

1119
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 4>the Mongols were throwing trees at them.</v>

1120
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 4>They cut all their trees down and then they stacked them up with giant catapult</v>

1121
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.370
<v Speaker 4>and hurled them over the gates.</v>

1122
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 4>Just Shroyer everything in the city and what they would do is take the survivors</v>

1123
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 4>and put them in the front lines and use them.</v>

1124
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Oftentimes as the front.</v>

1125
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:42.350
<v Speaker 4>They would push an army into the town and people would be shooting arrows at</v>

1126
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:43.370
<v Speaker 4>their own friends.</v>

1127
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.790
<v Speaker 4>Thousands and thousands of people just be forced through the door of a,</v>

1128
00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:47.290
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1129
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:47.571
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>

1130
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:48.680
<v Speaker 4>of the gate of a,</v>

1131
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:49.820
<v Speaker 4>of a city.</v>

1132
00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:56.130
<v Speaker 2>I listened to your Mongo podcast at least four or five times what I called the</v>

1133
00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan stopped telling Joe Rogan to talk about your mom goal podcast on his</v>

1134
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:01.993
<v Speaker 2>shoe.</v>

1135
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.790
<v Speaker 2>You talked to this poor comedic woman about it and you said something and there</v>

1136
00:33:06.791 --> 00:33:07.240
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1137
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:07.901
<v Speaker 2>we went back to her.</v>

1138
00:33:07.901 --> 00:33:11.650
<v Speaker 2>There's this long dead silence where she tried to absorb what you just told her.</v>

1139
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Who was that?</v>

1140
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you think that would have been a female comedian?</v>

1141
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.880
<v Speaker 2>She said I've got a show on consumer.</v>

1142
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1143
00:33:17.111 --> 00:33:18.340
<v Speaker 2>that's most likely about it.</v>

1144
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.530
<v Speaker 2>There's this long pause like what do I say after that?</v>

1145
00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I can,</v>

1146
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Amy Schumer was some fucking crazy</v>

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:26.363
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.430
<v Speaker 4>There we go now.</v>

1152
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.040
<v Speaker 4>Now we're on ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1153
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 4>we're sort of on time.</v>

1154
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Ah</v>

1155
00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.390

1156
00:33:40.391 --> 00:33:43.750
<v Speaker 4>but every week we fucked something up and this week I made sure that I turned</v>

1157
00:33:43.751 --> 00:33:45.040
<v Speaker 4>off the sound on my computer.</v>

1158
00:33:45.041 --> 00:33:45.874
<v Speaker 4>The one over there,</v>

1159
00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.460
<v Speaker 4>I haven't even turned off the sound on this one yet.</v>

1160
00:33:47.461 --> 00:33:48.330
<v Speaker 4>So for you,</v>

1161
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.383
<v Speaker 4>he did four years.</v>

1162
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:50.280
<v Speaker 4>You got mine do mine.</v>

1163
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.790
<v Speaker 4>He didn't do yours pass the torch.</v>

1164
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.020
<v Speaker 4>It could've easily been me.</v>

1165
00:33:53.021 --> 00:33:53.741
<v Speaker 4>That just fucked up.</v>

1166
00:33:53.741 --> 00:33:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Which is,</v>

1167
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:55.570
<v Speaker 4>that's the reason why I fucked up.</v>

1168
00:33:55.571 --> 00:33:58.540
<v Speaker 4>It's cause cause I'm here cause I always fuck it up.</v>

1169
00:33:58.541 --> 00:34:01.720
<v Speaker 4>I fucked it up every week we'd done this God damn thing like 22 weeks in a row.</v>

1170
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.830
<v Speaker 4>I fuck it up every single time for this week.</v>

1171
00:34:05.831 --> 00:34:06.640
<v Speaker 4>It was Brian,</v>

1172
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1173
00:34:07.121 --> 00:34:07.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1174
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.370
<v Speaker 4>I've been thinking about this podcast a lot,</v>

1175
00:34:09.371 --> 00:34:11.410
<v Speaker 4>ladies and gentlemen and a,</v>

1176
00:34:11.411 --> 00:34:13.690
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've been thinking about it is I appreciate the fuck out of</v>

1177
00:34:13.691 --> 00:34:14.524
<v Speaker 4>everybody listening.</v>

1178
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:15.603
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1179
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:16.061
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1180
00:34:16.061 --> 00:34:20.260
<v Speaker 4>we do try our best to make this as interesting as possible and as smooth and</v>

1181
00:34:20.261 --> 00:34:21.250
<v Speaker 4>professional as possible.</v>

1182
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.920
<v Speaker 4>But I got admit that I've been too stressed out about this.</v>

1183
00:34:23.921 --> 00:34:25.270
<v Speaker 4>I've been taking it too seriously.</v>

1184
00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1185
00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:26.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1186
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.620
<v Speaker 4>taking seriously in a good way where as we improve the sound,</v>

1187
00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:31.020
<v Speaker 4>we've got a real mixer and we got to,</v>

1188
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're sitting on couches and shit and we're going to get it better</v>

1189
00:34:34.541 --> 00:34:35.290
<v Speaker 4>cameras,</v>

1190
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.760
<v Speaker 4>but that like,</v>

1191
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.610
<v Speaker 4>it's not like there's a part of it,</v>

1192
00:34:38.611 --> 00:34:39.251
<v Speaker 4>it's really fun,</v>

1193
00:34:39.251 --> 00:34:41.890
<v Speaker 4>but there's a part of it that wasn't fun and I don't think that should exist.</v>

1194
00:34:41.891 --> 00:34:44.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I should ever get too serious about this.</v>

1195
00:34:44.351 --> 00:34:47.170
<v Speaker 4>This is for people who are working,</v>

1196
00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.620
<v Speaker 4>who are being distracted that just wants something because they're doing</v>

1197
00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:51.340
<v Speaker 4>mindless shit.</v>

1198
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.430
<v Speaker 4>This is for people that are driving in their cars and you know,</v>

1199
00:34:54.431 --> 00:34:57.130
<v Speaker 4>wants up to now listen to this is for people on the train.</v>

1200
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.330
<v Speaker 4>This is for people at the gym,</v>

1201
00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.650
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it's for you guys.</v>

1202
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:00.400
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1203
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.390
<v Speaker 4>And if,</v>

1204
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.860
<v Speaker 4>if we take it too seriously,</v>

1205
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:04.630
<v Speaker 4>you stop being yourself and it starts,</v>

1206
00:35:04.631 --> 00:35:08.260
<v Speaker 4>starts being like this professional thing that you're trying real hard to do.</v>

1207
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:09.250
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1208
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:09.701
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1209
00:35:09.701 --> 00:35:09.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1210
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:11.980
<v Speaker 4>I think I've fallen prey to that a little bit.</v>

1211
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.670
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about it today after to took a little bit of the head of the weed</v>

1212
