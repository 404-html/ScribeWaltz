13
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton denounced it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she did now to Rog.</v>

14
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said something about deplorables.</v>

15
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>What'd she say about the frog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

16
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>it was part of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.400
<v Speaker 1>an article on a website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

18
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>they were saying how this causing frog </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a hate symbol and so you're a fucking</v>

19
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He come home with him.</v>

20
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>This is the best bit about the incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can make them,</v>

21
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look ridiculous on their own.</v>

22
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Every means day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just we're saying they were already</v>

23
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>like doing the bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lumping people into these groups.</v>

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>But it is a weird thing that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

25
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:13.254
<v Speaker 1>Like whoever gets upset at this does not</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how preposterous it is to </v>

26
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:21.501
<v Speaker 1>freak out about a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who the fuck is over at apple?</v>

27
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.733
<v Speaker 1>First of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the poor bastard that made </v>

28
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:29.391
<v Speaker 1>pepe the frog for totally non Keka Stan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh nine incident red pill reasons.</v>

29
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>This poor bastard just had this cartoon </v>
<v Speaker 1>frog did.</v>

00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.040
<v Speaker 1>He made feels bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

31
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden that poor guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to say,</v>

32
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm killing off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pepe did in the inner is like,</v>

34
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.840

<v Speaker 1>but everyone knows who pepe is.</v>

35
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't kill off something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

36
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It's silly to think that he could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved as well.</v>

37
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's so it's almost like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to denounce it.</v>

38
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

39
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they'll get lumped in with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporter.</v>

40
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Like he probably does think that he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think he's a supporter maybe.</v>

41
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do.</v>

42
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 1>I think he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

43
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on.</v>

44
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>SONA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan of it.</v>

45
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he looked in stuff too much.</v>

46
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>It's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like,</v>

47
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.213
<v Speaker 1>people think there'd been shadow banned </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Scott Adams had a big post the </v>

49
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're city's been shadow banned phobias.</v>

51
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>he said he talked to Jack at twitter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack said there's no shadow banning.</v>

52
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Joe Shuts Up Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know this show.</v>

53
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>This is Sargon speaking just full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

54
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>We know Jacksonville.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

55
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck it was like a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack.</v>

56
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.361
<v Speaker 1>Tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

57
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 1>why haven't I been verified?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>he's probably super busy with the 400 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people that are on twitter.</v>

59
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.243
<v Speaker 1>Probably super full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you tried three times and </v>

60
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>every time that just denied why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

61
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:52.380
<v Speaker 1>what is it then have enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many followers do you have?</v>

62
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.214
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to Claudia accounts by </v>

63
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:55.854
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends need to know who I am on </v>

64
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:57.534
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that's the reason that </v>

65
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:00.030
<v Speaker 1>for verification Jag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that</v>

66
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.883
<v Speaker 2>interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you were on a television </v>

67
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.124
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be expected that you would be </v>

68
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>verified by now with that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>

69
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>That's a giant following and your 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube.</v>

70
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of people.</v>

71
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Seems worth firefighting before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

72
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a badge of status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the verified Milo.</v>

73
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most ridiculous one.</v>

74
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 2>D verifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't do that,</v>

75
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.010
<v Speaker 2>but verify someone and then not milo </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore as it jack like the guy.</v>

76
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking lie.</v>

77
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a badge of status.</v>

78
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.443
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it to create some sort of </v>

79
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 2>privileged class on twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

80
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 2>they even get like a different function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't they?</v>

81
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.173
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only see some of the verified </v>

82
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:38.674
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every account on twitter should be </v>

83
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 2>verified thing you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

84
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to only see a counselor </v>
<v Speaker 2>verified.</v>

85
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a privilege.</v>

86
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 2>And he took it away from mine to punish </v>
<v Speaker 2>him for being a dissident.</v>

87
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 2>And he won't verify me to punish me for </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a dissident.</v>

88
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 2>And he knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a stranger.</v>

89
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking balls deep in this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel it?</v>

90
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 2>You're like very emotionally invested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

91
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

92
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 2>cause I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

93
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:02.840
<v Speaker 2>I've never had to play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

94
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm where I am now entirely on my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>merits.</v>

95
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had any industry connections.</v>

96
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I've never been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been to America before.</v>

97
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I've never spoken to any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

98
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.563
<v Speaker 2>They all knew who I am and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of me because I think because if </v>

99
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 2>I can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone can do it.</v>

100
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.120
<v Speaker 2>But why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think it's fear?</v>

101
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

102
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 2>we definitely don't need them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one needs anybody anymore.</v>

103
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.883
<v Speaker 2>But that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't create a system of </v>

104
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 2>privilege without interdependent </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections.</v>

105
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.503
<v Speaker 2>There is no system of privilege if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to rely on other people to </v>

106
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:35.344
<v Speaker 2>maintain a privilege class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have to maintain the </v>

107
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 2>privilege class and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to rely on other people,</v>

108
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.523
<v Speaker 2>then their status goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's break this down for people who </v>

109
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 2>don't know what the fuck we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how did you get involved?</v>

119
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you like,</v>

120
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:08.110

<v Speaker 2>is this a you and outright guy?</v>

121
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not right.</v>

122
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

123
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 2>they'll ride is an identitarian movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>for white people.</v>

124
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're heavily nationalist,</v>

125
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 2>protectionist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti interventionist.</v>

126
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 2>They're not like laissez faire free </v>
<v Speaker 2>market capitalist.</v>

127
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

128
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm like an English liberal as in I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal rights.</v>

129
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Laissez faire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>

130
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean socialized health care and a well</v>

131
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.443
<v Speaker 2>a welfare state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy with as long as it's </v>

132
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all done.</v>

133
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Just applied some as long as anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>could access it if they needed to.</v>

134
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just universal rights rule.</v>

135
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the,</v>

136
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I can't see a reason to discriminate </v>
<v Speaker 2>against someone when it comes to dealing</v>

137
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:43.781
<v Speaker 2>with rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

138
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:44.531
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

139
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:45.364
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like defining outright is it been </v>

140
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:48.964
<v Speaker 2>clearly defined now because it's so new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually relatively well defined </v>

141
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 2>now because the old right have asserted </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

142
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:55.391
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

143
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're for white people.</v>

144
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wipro while saying that,</v>

145
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which guys like,</v>

146
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.870
<v Speaker 2>he knows I'm like Ramsey pole as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive,</v>

147
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as someone like that says </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all right,</v>

148
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.364
<v Speaker 2>then everybody else just assumes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they like allows them to define it </v>

149
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.363
<v Speaker 2>because I think there's probably a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people considered the cells all </v>

150
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

151
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Where they were right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't racist.</v>

152
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.890
<v Speaker 2>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or white supremacists,</v>

153
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 2>they just didn't like this old man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

154
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.883
<v Speaker 2>That was in there for four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they call themselves the ultra </v>

155
00:06:27.101 --> 00:06:27.934
<v Speaker 2>lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

156
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether that's at a time of</v>
<v Speaker 2>disparagement or not.</v>

157
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I over new rights or something like </v>

158
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.484
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is I don't run in the </v>

159
00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 2>circles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually I actually don't really know</v>

160
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 2>very much about those guys out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>

161
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:39.104
<v Speaker 2>Jessie Watson's incentive itches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't find that particularly </v>

162
00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:41.944
<v Speaker 2>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just find them to be like a modern </v>

163
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:44.084
<v Speaker 2>form of conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Paul Joseph Watson is a very </v>

164
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 2>reasonable guy and he's very articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seems pretty smart.</v>

165
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

166
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 2>he does the opposite of what the media </v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

167
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.100
<v Speaker 2>but the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's it.</v>

168
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a criticism.</v>

169
00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Two points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

170
00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.580
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

171
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 2>I thought a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

172
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's necessary for him to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

173
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.130
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

174
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.200
<v Speaker 2>cause they both create narratives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

175
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not that these narratives aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

176
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 2>it's just that sometimes these </v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives sometimes leave things out.</v>

177
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 2>But always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't like a condemnation of either</v>

178
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:17.504
<v Speaker 2>side by saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just what they do and that's </v>

179
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

180
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 2>everyone's entitled to create their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

181
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to use the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda,</v>

182
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not using it in a derogatory sense.</v>

183
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

184
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

185
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make this point.</v>

186
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make your point,</v>

187
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're making your point.</v>

188
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make my point and the these</v>
<v Speaker 2>two points,</v>

189
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 2>we'll both stand in existence and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>both be true at the same time.</v>

190
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.333
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

191
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 2>And so it's okay if Paul Joseph Watson </v>
<v Speaker 2>to exist,</v>

192
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

193
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have,</v>

194
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't really have any criticisms of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest.</v>

195
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:46.784
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

197
00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:48.304
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wouldn't do what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is he doing that you wouldn't </v>

198
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:53.210
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets a bit harder than I would and he</v>

199
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:54.044
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he is as objective as I </v>

200
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:58.790
<v Speaker 2>would prefer having a new source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I prefer someone more like Philly d,</v>

201
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that an interesting thing?</v>

202
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 2>The objectivity is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a real,</v>

203
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 2>real problem when it comes to left </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus right or any of these groups.</v>

204
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 2>You get lumped into these categories and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you start defending your turf.</v>

205
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.180
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

206
00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be a huge issue today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet,</v>

207
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.393
<v Speaker 2>everybody just started digging their </v>
<v Speaker 2>heels in the sand and decides this is </v>

208
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 2>who I am.</v>

209
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 2>And those other p and you start using </v>
<v Speaker 2>they and them,</v>

210
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 2>which is what I try to avoid that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad guys.</v>

211
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they and they,</v>

212
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 2>what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the left wants.</v>

213
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.080
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

214
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 2>it's really tough actually because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

215
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 2>that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually done like channel.</v>

216
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:33.314
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually pulled my subscribers and </v>

217
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 2>stuff and I've got like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bit like a year ago,</v>

218
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:41.180
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a content hasn't really changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tena and I got like tens of thousands of</v>

219
00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>responses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was a really good sample size.</v>

220
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of,</v>

221
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 2>most of my subscribers are center left </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals who just lost,</v>

222
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then identitarian is,</v>

223
00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:50.510
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to sit there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.673
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at vidcon and they had so many </v>

225
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 2>panels and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me about me being a Latin x.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let me talk about me being in a Latina.</v>

227
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.340
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a Latinex lots of next year.</v>

228
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.060

<v Speaker 2>I'll come over and I'm not,</v>

229
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm joking.</v>

230
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.273
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't make anything up and I won't </v>

231
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

232
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm absolutely serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sort of,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Richard Reichard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

256
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I've made up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it is.</v>

257
00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 2>It's talking about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not to point real problems.</v>

258
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Is this what happens when you have too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many vaccines?</v>

259
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.523
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's what happens when you have </v>

260
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:10.380
<v Speaker 2>too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have people that are just too,</v>

261
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:12.310
<v Speaker 2>it's too easy to get by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a sim money,</v>

262
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 2>food lenzer thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

263
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.370
<v Speaker 2>people give a shit what I care what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of my genitals.</v>

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.653
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready.</v>

265
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Get Out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

266
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're sticking him in my face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't give a fuck.</v>

267
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

268
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 2>But then that's an interpersonal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a political problem.</v>

269
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a political problem.</v>

270
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I mean,</v>

271
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.890
<v Speaker 2>the politics of human interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

272
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit of that knows me most </v>

273
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.123
<v Speaker 2>is when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you about my blackness and </v>

274
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.163
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you mean by your </v>

275
00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:38.250
<v Speaker 2>blackness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

276
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet me as a black person.</v>

277
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.643
<v Speaker 2>You're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to start stereotyping </v>

278
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to tell you,</v>

279
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 2>you're going to give me a stereotype of </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people,</v>

280
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:45.894
<v Speaker 2>and then you're gonna say this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow representative nothing to you </v>

281
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:48.294
<v Speaker 2>but other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you're validating Richard </v>

282
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.581
<v Speaker 2>Spencer when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

283
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:53.300
<v Speaker 2>can I told her about my whiteness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your argument saying?</v>

284
00:10:53.301 --> 00:10:54.870
<v Speaker 2>They're not allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

285
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I know what's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

286
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.133
<v Speaker 2>You'll talk to me about your blackness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about my whiteness and all of </v>

287
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:02.230
<v Speaker 2>a sudden we're going to both realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

288
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking about ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is talking about ourselves.</v>

289
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we talk about something real </v>
<v Speaker 2>it did you see that woman,</v>

290
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.000
<v Speaker 2>the Delaware professor who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

291
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 2>was talking about that kid that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed in North Korea,</v>

292
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.050
<v Speaker 2>the kid who stole the propaganda poster </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about the kid.</v>

293
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen the professor talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

294
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each fall she just got fired today,</v>

295
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 2>which is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good sign.</v>

296
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

297
00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:25.064
<v Speaker 2>what she had said is essentially he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>it coming and that she's tired of rich </v>

298
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.454
<v Speaker 2>and blamers rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clueless white people who come to her </v>

299
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 2>class and then she just goes on these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this series of Straw Mans,</v>

300
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to do coke and have no problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>raping a girl at a Frat party.</v>

301
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

302
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.093
<v Speaker 2>Where'd that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy just got beaten to death in </v>

303
00:11:45.691 --> 00:11:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Korea and he shouldn't have raped girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't rape anybody.</v>

304
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 2>He did coke like this bitch.</v>

305
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.890
<v Speaker 2>No one should go fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

306
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 2>she's apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

307
00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just racist.</v>

308
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 2>She's racist towards white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

309
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:04.570
<v Speaker 2>you can be that and that's an oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the wonderful things about</v>

310
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:05.404
<v Speaker 2>the social justice warrior movement is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they've made it so it's impossible </v>

311
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 2>to be raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist towards white people.</v>

312
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 2>They believe they believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

313
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 2>This is a real belief that if you are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>white person,</v>

314
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:16.324
<v Speaker 2>you're personal privilege and racism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that a person of privilege </v>

315
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:22.560
<v Speaker 2>does to a person and a compromise group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

316
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.833
<v Speaker 2>Do you know he's pretty funny about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is they by saying it's a power plus </v>

317
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 2>prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make it,</v>

318
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 2>they say rice institutional and is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

319
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 2>But that means you're taking away the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word for interpersonal racism.</v>

320
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 2>So if like an Asian guy goes up to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>black guy and says,</v>

321
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enwood that copy racism,</v>

322
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.513
<v Speaker 2>because he doesn't have institutional </v>
<v Speaker 2>power and there is no word for racism </v>

323
00:12:41.471 --> 00:12:42.304
<v Speaker 2>between individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've redefined it to be </v>

324
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 2>institutional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is the word for interpersonal?</v>

325
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:48.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

326
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 2>I thought it will Chris rock bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>February.</v>

327
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Black Dude thinks he's tough as a native</v>
<v Speaker 2>American white and kick his ass.</v>

328
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.093
<v Speaker 2>I'm more marginalized group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says it is one of those things where </v>

329
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:03.320
<v Speaker 2>it's like people are seeking problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>

330
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.233
<v Speaker 2>they're also seeking to clearly identify</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as being from a more </v>

331
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 2>compromised group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics.</v>

332
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:10.894
<v Speaker 2>A victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

333
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.930
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the victim here at me.</v>

334
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Some special treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

335
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:15.070
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a victim.</v>

336
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.053
<v Speaker 2>You feel about the Trans racialism I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think there's no logical argument that </v>

337
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Kingston can identify as an Eskimo as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I can send you.</v>

338
00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:23.434
<v Speaker 2>Can they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a big Hoohah or in academia </v>

339
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 2>recently because someone published a </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper,</v>

340
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I'll come in the name of the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>published papers saying,</v>

341
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.830
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the argument against this?</v>

342
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.380
<v Speaker 2>If you can identify as another agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't you identify as another race?</v>

343
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:33.214
<v Speaker 2>St Logic is applied to a different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily because the argument of </v>

344
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:38.824
<v Speaker 2>you identify with another gender could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be based on some sort of a hormonal </v>

345
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.400
<v Speaker 2>issue or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some neurotransmitter misfire there.</v>

346
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 2>There could be some something that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be physically that could be,</v>

347
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.700
<v Speaker 2>if any of their arguments were hinges on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that that mattered,</v>

348
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

349
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:56.914
<v Speaker 2>well you can identify as anything you </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't cause it's all the social </v>

350
00:13:57.911 --> 00:13:59.530
<v Speaker 2>construct so you can do whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want with that.</v>

351
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets slippery,</v>

352
00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

353
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Where it gets really slippery is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex and gender are social constructs.</v>

354
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:05.321
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

355
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:07.780
<v Speaker 2>clearly that's not true in in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a district,</v>

356
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.160
<v Speaker 2>they all social constructs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is they're not sexy.</v>

357
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not a social construct to say let's</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

358
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:14.224
<v Speaker 2>Sex is based on your chromosomes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your agenda is a group of constructed </v>

359
00:14:18.371 --> 00:14:21.310
<v Speaker 2>behaviors around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Constructed for a good reason.</v>

360
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Men have got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 2>clinical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>superior,</v>

362
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:24.574
<v Speaker 2>natural advantage and things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and speed of women and women </v>

363
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:29.170
<v Speaker 2>need protection when they all say </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant.</v>

364
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're looking after kids,</v>

365
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:31.384
<v Speaker 2>they need society to look off to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have something that the </v>

366
00:14:34.221 --> 00:14:35.054
<v Speaker 2>needs protecting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we've got a whole and Inca </v>

367
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:37.853
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason you can tell that these are </v>

368
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.410
<v Speaker 2>actually social constructs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because every site is different.</v>

369
00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Saudi Arabia,</v>

370
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.533
<v Speaker 2>the men walk in front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women walk behind and they keep </v>

371
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:46.690
<v Speaker 2>their heads down and get and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>

372
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.630
<v Speaker 2>That's a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's agenda role,</v>

373
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

374
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 2>But that's a cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a gender role.</v>

375
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

376
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.611
<v Speaker 2>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't do it.</v>

377
00:14:54.611 --> 00:14:56.780
<v Speaker 2>But it's not just necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not like a,</v>

378
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:57.614
<v Speaker 2>so like a social construct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that this is something that </v>

379
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:02.840
<v Speaker 2>occurs all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in primates.</v>

380
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 2>males exhibit in nature.</v>

381
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Not saying there's no relation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology,</v>

382
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.140
<v Speaker 2>but saying the they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a social construct?</v>

383
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

384
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a behavior that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

385
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 2>it's not like something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent,</v>

386
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.653
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

387
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old man [inaudible] the Dicks is not</v>

388
00:15:20.251 --> 00:15:21.360
<v Speaker 2>a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

389
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.221
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every,</v>

390
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:25.850
<v Speaker 2>every man on earth does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not every woman on earth has to walk</v>

391
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:26.684
<v Speaker 2>behind her man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly 10 paces back because she's </v>

392
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 2>female in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually know the other way,</v>

393
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of opens door,</v>

394
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.014
<v Speaker 2>the wind goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

395
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.790
<v Speaker 2>there's agenda role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the same.</v>

396
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 2>So it can be changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a social construct,</v>

397
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:39.320
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda role.</v>

398
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.183
<v Speaker 2>There is always a gender role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always informed by biology because </v>

399
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:45.830
<v Speaker 2>men and women are fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different and they always will be.</v>

400
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.933
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where people get slippery with </v>

401
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

402
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.060
<v Speaker 2>That's where they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they like in that way,</v>

403
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 2>they like it in that way.</v>

404
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's the one feminist?</v>

405
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:55.970
<v Speaker 2>There's one really nutty young lady who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying that,</v>

406
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.863
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even physical strength is just because </v>

407
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:01.270
<v Speaker 2>men are encouraged to do physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

408
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Are you referring to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

409
00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 2>one and suck he's in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that her?</v>

410
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Did she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's definitely said that.</v>

411
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Did she say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

412
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

413
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I know she's loony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but did she go that far?</v>

414
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.340
<v Speaker 2>There is a school of feminist thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>that thinks this they the the,</v>

415
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fun one.</v>

416
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:16.783
<v Speaker 2>They really believe that the physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength differences between men and </v>

417
00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:20.924
<v Speaker 2>women are just because of the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>society treats women and as men are </v>

418
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 2>socialized to do sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>

419
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can't be real.</v>

420
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:27.563
<v Speaker 2>She just thinks that she said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know whether she believes and </v>

421
00:16:29.151 --> 00:16:29.984
<v Speaker 2>see if he can find that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd say she's from a video from like </v>

422
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:32.630
<v Speaker 2>2013 or something.</v>

423
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.500
<v Speaker 2>She seems quite the opportunist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

424
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.320
<v Speaker 2>She on the trust and verify galactic </v>
<v Speaker 2>counsel,</v>

425
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 2>what she seth and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was probably one of your wives and</v>

426
00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:44.750
<v Speaker 2>reasons Jack and then as she sent any </v>
<v Speaker 2>wells,</v>

427
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:46.060
<v Speaker 2>which is probably one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack,</v>

428
00:16:46.061 --> 00:16:48.670
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not verified you say she </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly was.</v>

429
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 2>She was still a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether she's still,</v>

430
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:55.520
<v Speaker 2>but I know that she's sending was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least a contact for them.</v>

431
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.923
<v Speaker 2>But there's been a bit of an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>development with ms sockies in if you'd </v>

432
00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:00.300
<v Speaker 2>like to hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

433
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 2>tell people who she is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

434
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.850
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even need no if I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most people don't know.</v>

435
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.080
<v Speaker 2>You'll live in a very insulated world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like straight ass.</v>

436
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.530
<v Speaker 2>My mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

437
00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:11.440

<v Speaker 2>incident.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

439
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

440
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.010
<v Speaker 2>You're mumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

441
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.871
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's stuck.</v>

442
00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:15.704
<v Speaker 2>He's in is an internet feminist who </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided the off the off the making a </v>

443
00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:20.234
<v Speaker 2>bunch of videos on our youtube channel </v>
<v Speaker 2>and late 2009 through to 2010 or </v>

444
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

445
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.200
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

446
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.463
<v Speaker 2>she ended up getting a favorable </v>
<v Speaker 2>reception with the progressive </v>

447
00:17:33.831 --> 00:17:34.700
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

448
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.640
<v Speaker 2>We're very feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very pro social justice.</v>

449
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.520
<v Speaker 2>And they liked her patter because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

450
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.590
<v Speaker 2>pretty stock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>

451
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.720
<v Speaker 2>pretty stuck in trade and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was,</v>

452
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:46.490
<v Speaker 2>she came across as being very </v>
<v Speaker 2>respectable.</v>

453
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's well presented,</v>

454
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 2>she's attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's well spoken.</v>

455
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knows</v>

456
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 3>her pastor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they promote her.</v>

457
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.060
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made a big deal over,</v>

458
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:59.750
<v Speaker 3>she sounds like a total bigot when she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about anything big it,</v>

459
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also because she'll just say,</v>

460
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:02.784
<v Speaker 3>well this is men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole premise of feminism is </v>

461
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:05.724
<v Speaker 3>that men are oppressing women and if men</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't oppressing women than feminism </v>

462
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:13.731
<v Speaker 3>has no argument and they also have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing they say to each other,</v>

463
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 3>you have the rights to hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your oppressor is right to do this.</v>

464
00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:20.911
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

465
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:23.350
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it's have a right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate even if you want.</v>

466
00:18:23.351 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 3>But this is something that she said </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>

467
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.510
<v Speaker 3>personally over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably has said it personally,</v>

468
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:30.330
<v Speaker 3>but this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of ideological thought.</v>

469
00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you read their papers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you read that,</v>

470
00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 3>if you read the new one that they them </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing again.</v>

471
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

472
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:37.830
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists.</v>

473
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.713
<v Speaker 3>We are talking about like a specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>sphere of academic feminists in her </v>

474
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:42.420
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex negative.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Xix neg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

476
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

477
00:18:44.841 --> 00:18:45.674
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like objectification or they </v>

478
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:49.650
<v Speaker 3>don't like sexy women in titties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sex negative.</v>

479
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't like sexy women.</v>

480
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 3>And the male gaze is oppressing women </v>
<v Speaker 3>Croft Tomb Raider.</v>

481
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.411
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

482
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:56.850
<v Speaker 3>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was part of the big issue,</v>

483
00:18:56.851 --> 00:18:57.684
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like sexist because of Lara </v>

484
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Croft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible,</v>

485
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 3>terrible oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how women can get over it,</v>

486
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 3>but a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he suck.</v>

487
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:06.470
<v Speaker 3>He's in stepped up and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

488
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.010
<v Speaker 3>it's wrong to look at these tits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone was like,</v>

489
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.210
<v Speaker 3>she's wearing a really tight top for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason and she's not real.</v>

490
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

491
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.503
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so basically any psyches and comes from </v>

492
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 3>a school of sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative feminism.</v>

493
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.350
<v Speaker 3>And she decided that she would take </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage of all this.</v>

494
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.183
<v Speaker 3>Now in 2010 there was a video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 2010 that the video was </v>

495
00:19:25.591 --> 00:19:26.424
<v Speaker 3>recorded in black and white of herney </v>
<v Speaker 3>university giving a speech where she </v>

496
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a Gamer.</v>

497
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.133
<v Speaker 3>I had to learn a lot about gaming to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into all this and then come 2012 I mean </v>

498
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:38.610
<v Speaker 3>that that video wasn't released until </v>
<v Speaker 3>after she did her tropes versus women in</v>

499
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 3>gaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kickstarter 2012 May,</v>

500
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.563
<v Speaker 3>2012 she starts as kickstarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I was in within the first few </v>

501
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:45.924
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she starts posting updates on that I'm </v>

502
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:49.080
<v Speaker 3>being harassed and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

503
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.770
<v Speaker 3>people generally react negatively to </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal bigots on the Internet.</v>

504
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.870
<v Speaker 3>They don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't like him.</v>

505
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean like when you say men are </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressing women and everything she says</v>

506
00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.273
<v Speaker 3>is a variant of men are oppressing women</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it is the male gaze is highly </v>

507
00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:03.264
<v Speaker 3>oppressive to women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Toxic masculinity is highly or preston </v>

508
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:05.520
<v Speaker 3>women's.</v>

509
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

510
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:08.400
<v Speaker 3>when come in legitimately look at women </v>
<v Speaker 3>in eater,</v>

511
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.230
<v Speaker 3>no answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

512
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 3>what is non toxic masculinity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing.</v>

513
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.003
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying is masculinity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>men checking out chicks is just bad and </v>

514
00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:18.144
<v Speaker 3>you hate it and the men are all bad for </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this and there are pressing the </v>

515
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.843
<v Speaker 3>women when they do miss well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I said it seems like she's a </v>

516
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:27.270
<v Speaker 3>bit of a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got an angle and she realizes that</v>

517
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of attention that goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards that angle and she runs with it.</v>

518
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I turned around and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well women,</v>

519
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.510
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of miniature manipulative slags </v>
<v Speaker 3>who will take your money and run,</v>

520
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.820
<v Speaker 3>they be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking massage,</v>

521
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.663
<v Speaker 3>but I got to stop you there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I don't think she's ever said all </v>

522
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she said that she doesn't,</v>

523
00:20:42.271 --> 00:20:45.810
<v Speaker 3>she just uses the term men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she does.</v>

524
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean I really don't think says she</v>

525
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.963
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy is her fucking head guy writes </v>

526
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:51.754
<v Speaker 2>for what Mecca is sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm just doing now nothing </v>

527
00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.360
<v Speaker 2>basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

528
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 2>this terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I want to,</v>

529
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I want to set the record straight if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks,</v>

530
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.890
<v Speaker 2>because this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something that really annoys me.</v>

531
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

532
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I went to vidcon recently and vidcon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

533
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 2>What does that youtube convention in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anaheim sounds a good time.</v>

534
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 2>It was a really good time for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't,</v>

535
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't for them that their panels </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like a bloody death march when they</v>

536
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:17.960
<v Speaker 2>spot a sing in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their life faces like,</v>

537
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 2>oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

538
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:20.410
<v Speaker 2>why did they get upset at you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

539
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Just cause we sat there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to what they had to say.</v>

540
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.200
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you heard about this dude,</v>

541
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm insulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh dude,</v>

542
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.630
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like easy.</v>

543
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she spots me sitting in the audience and</v>

544
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:34.990
<v Speaker 2>then she starts freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freaking out.</v>

545
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She starts,</v>

546
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.813
<v Speaker 2>she starts saying things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a constant harasser of mine </v>

547
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 2>called me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

548
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 2>she called me a shithead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

549
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 2>she called me a garbage human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a garbage human.</v>

550
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I did nothing to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say a word.</v>

551
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I just sat in the audience while she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>there cussing me out on the stage.</v>

552
00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:50.674
<v Speaker 2>And I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now she's on the stage with a </v>

553
00:21:51.791 --> 00:21:52.624
<v Speaker 2>microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just calling you a shithead and </v>

554
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:54.784
<v Speaker 2>the garbage human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was because you have made </v>

555
00:21:57.131 --> 00:21:58.450
<v Speaker 2>videos about her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

556
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Because I've made videos debunking her </v>
<v Speaker 2>points and she,</v>

557
00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 2>she's under the impression that all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my videos are about her.</v>

558
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 2>And I actually on the ride over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got people to like count up for me.</v>

559
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.221
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

560
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I've made around 30 videos and about </v>
<v Speaker 2>four years referring to,</v>

561
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.890
<v Speaker 2>and that's a lot.</v>

562
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:14.541
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

563
00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:15.700
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds nice.</v>

564
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.563
<v Speaker 2>Did it sounds like a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's less than 4% of the videos </v>

565
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:20.890
<v Speaker 2>I've made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've made 780 videos.</v>

566
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:22.750
<v Speaker 2>I work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you do.</v>

567
00:22:22.751 --> 00:22:23.584
<v Speaker 2>But that's still 30 videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you've made 100 million </v>

568
00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still make 30 videos about her.</v>

569
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.650
<v Speaker 2>That's a large number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a large number compared to an</v>

570
00:22:30.651 --> 00:22:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Ito who hardly does any bloody work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

571
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another interesting point.</v>

572
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.463
<v Speaker 2>But what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting about it is if </v>

573
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:40.090
<v Speaker 2>someone puts something out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

574
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.073
<v Speaker 2>you going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expect that someone is going to come </v>

575
00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:44.764
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a guy like you that is very </v>

576
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:47.884
<v Speaker 2>opinionated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if someone has very different </v>

577
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 2>opinions in yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a contrary point.</v>

578
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.403
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely not harassing but </v>

579
00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.093
<v Speaker 2>can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a scary position if that's </v>

580
00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.290
<v Speaker 2>exactly what fine.</v>

581
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.180
<v Speaker 2>So how are we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how will you harassing?</v>

582
00:23:01.181 --> 00:23:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the,</v>

583
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.223
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst thing you've ever said about </v>

584
00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she's wrong.</v>

585
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

586
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

587
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:09.323
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will never find someone who says </v>

588
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:12.460
<v Speaker 2>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a good critic.</v>

589
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 2>She's a terrible critic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she always has been.</v>

590
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.813
<v Speaker 2>She's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always been rightly pointed out to </v>

591
00:23:17.321 --> 00:23:20.830
<v Speaker 2>her that she's cherry picked every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one stands by her work.</v>

592
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:21.843
<v Speaker 2>She's become like a symbol of feminism </v>
<v Speaker 2>because will the harassment she's </v>

593
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:26.280
<v Speaker 2>received now that is a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

594
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

595
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Tim Culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>

596
00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:33.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't get any props unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's sending you horrible messages.</v>

597
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.590
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people have been caught</v>

598
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.320
<v Speaker 2>doing it to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really fucked up,</v>

599
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.193
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loads like the black lives matter </v>

600
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.500
<v Speaker 2>activists and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

601
00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 2>so basically she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her work sucks.</v>

602
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:44.950
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just bad.</v>

603
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody in the</v>

604
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.210
<v Speaker 3>video game industry will turn around </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

605
00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great criticism.</v>

606
00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Need to only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only like the progressive press.</v>

607
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.420
<v Speaker 3>What black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

608
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.183
<v Speaker 3>he's just got a protest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They basically run around and to the </v>

609
00:23:56.991 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 3>university's compute system logged into </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fake twitter account or something,</v>

610
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 3>send themselves a bomb threat and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>police tracked it down and they're like,</v>

611
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.400
<v Speaker 3>we have the video camera footage if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

612
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

613
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.290
<v Speaker 3>it was actually really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

614
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.153
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so funny with their need to be a </v>

615
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:14.240
<v Speaker 3>victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it validates them.</v>

616
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 3>It renewed just when you don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument and you need to be a victim.</v>

617
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.313
<v Speaker 3>Well does she expect that or know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's going to be able to put these </v>

618
00:24:21.231 --> 00:24:23.870
<v Speaker 3>points out and not have anybody dispute </v>
<v Speaker 3>these points?</v>

619
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing so.</v>

620
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:25.754
<v Speaker 3>And she always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she always conflates all criticism with </v>

621
00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:27.830
<v Speaker 3>harassment.</v>

622
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:28.663
<v Speaker 3>She's never addressed the critic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first time she was dressed as a </v>

623
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:33.140
<v Speaker 3>critic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's me and she's calling me names.</v>

624
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I go.</v>

625
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.690
<v Speaker 3>That's not sounding good level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

626
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.553
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not very good.</v>

627
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:37.890
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

628
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.773
<v Speaker 3>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm responsible for all of the </v>

629
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:41.780
<v Speaker 3>harassment now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of it.</v>

630
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Well at least definitely not hers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not her fault.</v>

631
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.150
<v Speaker 3>And then it's a controversial opinion </v>
<v Speaker 3>and someone disputes it.</v>

632
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:49.810
<v Speaker 3>That person disputes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is responsible for all the restaurant.</v>

633
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well basically I've,</v>

634
00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always said right from the get go,</v>

635
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:54.643
<v Speaker 3>don't have a contact them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't ever contact them because for a </v>

636
00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:57.340
<v Speaker 3>start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

637
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.273
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not interested in hearing your </v>

638
00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:02.420
<v Speaker 3>fucking opinion so that we're both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got nothing but contempt for you.</v>

639
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:04.820
<v Speaker 3>But secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't send a harassment because a,</v>

640
00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:08.690
<v Speaker 3>it's immoral and b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got the victim card that gives her</v>

641
00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:10.070
<v Speaker 3>money when she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go,</v>

642
00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:11.420
<v Speaker 3>when you send her a message saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

643
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:12.650
<v Speaker 3>neither,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a bitch.</v>

644
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.480
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chich Ching,</v>

645
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she runs off to the next </v>

646
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.203
<v Speaker 3>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll that she gets paid some of her </v>

647
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:21.050
<v Speaker 3>speeches at university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's been paid 20 grand a speech.</v>

648
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:22.520
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not joking.</v>

649
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>

650
00:25:23.721 --> 00:25:25.970
<v Speaker 3>and for her to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet is being mean to me.</v>

651
00:25:25.971 --> 00:25:26.804
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe if you want to be in a bigger </v>

652
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:28.370
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't be.</v>

653
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.353
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if you actually did some solid </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and didn't say video games are </v>

654
00:25:31.021 --> 00:25:33.680
<v Speaker 3>making everyone's sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which that obviously not,</v>

655
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.590
<v Speaker 3>this wouldn't be happening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

656
00:25:35.591 --> 00:25:36.424
<v Speaker 3>the thing that pisses me off most about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the accusations towards me of </v>

657
00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:40.004
<v Speaker 3>harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apart from the fact that I've never </v>

658
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:42.380
<v Speaker 3>harassed her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if there was any evidence,</v>

659
00:25:42.381 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 3>I'd harassed that it'd be all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet right now.</v>

660
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.741
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

661
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:46.574
<v Speaker 3>it would be nothing but twix bars </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they trying to paint me as a </v>

662
00:25:49.551 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 3>harasser when I'm actually just a critic</v>
<v Speaker 3>oppose.</v>

663
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 3>And I've always been completely against </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

664
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.240
<v Speaker 3>But what really annoys me is that her </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickstarter,</v>

665
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get go to it,</v>

666
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.040
<v Speaker 3>you can pull it up now and you can see </v>
<v Speaker 3>tropes versus women and like,</v>

667
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:02.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got to spill and then,</v>

668
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.410
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the terrible messages,</v>

669
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.400
<v Speaker 3>the harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the harassment.</v>

670
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.653
<v Speaker 3>That was in May,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2012 I didn't make a video on Youtube </v>

671
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.923
<v Speaker 3>until July,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2013 this has been happening to her her </v>

672
00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:14.390
<v Speaker 3>whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing to do with me.</v>

673
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.610
<v Speaker 3>It's to do with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because she's a dick.</v>

674
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Everyone can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like God Guy Pussy.</v>

675
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm culinary Dick.</v>

676
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.390

<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

677
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looked into the cam.</v>

678
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to know something?</v>

679
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:33.110
<v Speaker 3>I've spoken to a lot of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>people recently since I've been here,</v>

680
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.500
<v Speaker 3>lots of people who know you personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an eater and they say everyone hates you</v>

681
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.670
<v Speaker 3>because you're a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>me today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>calling me all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

686
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.331
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a dick.</v>

687
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:49.164
<v Speaker 2>Anita.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did you find a video of her saying </v>

688
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 2>that there's no biological difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the sexes and that strength will</v>

689
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:56.950
<v Speaker 2>be buried in the middle of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he really,</v>

690
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I really think that it was her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm thinking about,</v>

691
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:00.861
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

692
00:27:00.861 --> 00:27:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I've looked at it as like maybe she took</v>
<v Speaker 2>it down with something,</v>

693
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:04.150
<v Speaker 2>so I remember seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I'd saved,</v>

694
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:04.993
<v Speaker 2>someone's got to save it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone on the Internet will be able to </v>

695
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 2>tweet to ass or something because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so hilarious because it's so contrary to</v>

696
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 2>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just actual science.</v>

697
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Everything she says is contrary to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

698
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:17.454
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll sit there and she'll pick out </v>

699
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:18.714
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the game hit man in her video she </v>

700
00:27:19.861 --> 00:27:20.840
<v Speaker 2>said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

701
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.020
<v Speaker 2>you're incentivized to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill the woman then then stuff a body</v>

702
00:27:25.021 --> 00:27:27.640
<v Speaker 2>in the trunk and the footage she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>using,</v>

703
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:28.543
<v Speaker 2>she didn't take herself obviously and </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't credit whoever took it in the </v>

704
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 2>footage she's using.</v>

705
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Speaker 2>You see the guy go up and kill the go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see them lose points.</v>

706
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a disincentive realization.</v>

707
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:39.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not incentivizing you.</v>

708
00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:42.260
<v Speaker 2>They're saying penalizing you for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anita Uj.</v>

709
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.343
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought my very first video was two </v>

710
00:27:45.211 --> 00:27:46.350
<v Speaker 2>and Easter as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

711
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.440
<v Speaker 2>you very first in like July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2013 and I ice the,</v>

712
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.900
<v Speaker 2>the soulless started off because of her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were inspired,</v>

713
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

714
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:57.900
<v Speaker 2>but there was a lot of things that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

715
00:27:57.901 --> 00:27:59.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were going on.</v>

716
00:27:59.320 --> 00:27:59.981
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

717
00:27:59.981 --> 00:28:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel the need to say something just a,</v>

718
00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.710
<v Speaker 2>but apart from the quality being </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

719
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm bewildered at her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it the other day and I was</v>

720
00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:09.241
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

721
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

722
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

723
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 2>I think you're just wrong on this.</v>

724
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.060
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you understand like the,</v>

725
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 2>there is a lot to this that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've left,</v>

726
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 2>you've left out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should've said Cherry picked,</v>

727
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

728
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:23.694
<v Speaker 2>that's something that's dogs are hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>creek because that's all she's ever </v>

729
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:25.614
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her Christmas was terrible and everyone </v>

730
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 2>knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes it because she's a divisive</v>

731
00:28:29.161 --> 00:28:31.890
<v Speaker 2>bitch and all she does is play the </v>
<v Speaker 2>victim.</v>

732
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.440
<v Speaker 2>She's got nothing she has nothing else </v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

733
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.730
<v Speaker 2>As long as it's not talking about hurts </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically because we're,</v>

734
00:28:36.731 --> 00:28:37.564
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of beating her down here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to think of anything </v>

735
00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:42.840
<v Speaker 2>genuinely good about her talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

736
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:43.674
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I'm saying is about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas instead of concentrating on </v>

737
00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:46.614
<v Speaker 2>her as a person that had been debunked a</v>
<v Speaker 2>million times all over the internet by </v>

738
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.020
<v Speaker 2>everyone and their mother at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

739
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

740
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.670
<v Speaker 2>why I want to get to what's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me is like what is causes?</v>

741
00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:57.893
<v Speaker 2>What causes these people to group up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these weird sort of echo chambers </v>

742
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.760
<v Speaker 2>reiterating things that don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>work or make sense.</v>

743
00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no biological difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between men and women,</v>

744
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.653
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to strength and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the tropes about video games and </v>

745
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 2>also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the other thing,</v>

746
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.790
<v Speaker 2>like when that Gamergate thing happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

747
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.653
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really fascinating to me that </v>

748
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:20.843
<v Speaker 2>everybody wanted to absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To lump people in one or two categories </v>

749
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.540
<v Speaker 2>and the two categories of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are appalled to it,</v>

750
00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 2>appalled by it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that think that,</v>

751
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism is a boren and all this stuff is </v>

752
00:29:32.131 --> 00:29:34.890
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other people who supposedly</v>

753
00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:35.724
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted some sexy images in video </v>

754
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to be a piece of shit.</v>

755
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you sex negative feminists.</v>

756
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that it got into this weird </v>

757
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:47.380
<v Speaker 2>category where people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

758
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:50.170
<v Speaker 2>we don't want you meddling with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with art.</v>

759
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 2>And whether it's a Frank Frazetta </v>
<v Speaker 2>censoring it.</v>

760
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

761
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.663
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at some of Frazetta stuff </v>

762
00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:58.780
<v Speaker 2>with the girls in the bikinis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>familiar,</v>

763
00:29:58.781 --> 00:29:59.614
<v Speaker 2>but I mean how famous fantasy artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well we sold like talking about like </v>

764
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:06.120
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautifully painted.</v>

765
00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:06.954
<v Speaker 2>It's like these oil barbarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a celebration of the human fizzy </v>

766
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Speaker 2>cause there's first perfect zenith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

767
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:12.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

768
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:17.791
<v Speaker 2>It's all Robert Howard's book on Conan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And frazetta was like the most famous of</v>

769
00:30:18.911 --> 00:30:19.570
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah it was.</v>

770
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.660
<v Speaker 2>But it's very cartoonish depictions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

771
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with giant tits and Brian blood all</v>

772
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:27.220
<v Speaker 2>over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

773
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:30.370
<v Speaker 2>it's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you hate women.</v>

774
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:31.543
<v Speaker 2>That's what's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just like looking at Fabio and the </v>

775
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:36.340
<v Speaker 2>cover of a romance novel doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>you hate men.</v>

776
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

777
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

778
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 2>it seems you're kind of lionizing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

779
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:40.774
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the perfect depiction of what </v>

780
00:30:42.221 --> 00:30:43.360
<v Speaker 2>the artist wanted.</v>

781
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.213
<v Speaker 2>See like a man look like in a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>rippling hero carrying the median or </v>

782
00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:48.184
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it becomes this weird thing when </v>

783
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:51.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't have a problem with it.</v>

784
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.713
<v Speaker 2>No one says that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It demonizes the male figure and that </v>

785
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:56.463
<v Speaker 2>you know that you have set these </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnatural standards so you fucked with </v>

786
00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 2>the self esteem of all these young men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you absolutely have and the same way</v>

787
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 2>you do it with women like body shaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

788
00:31:06.251 --> 00:31:10.750
<v Speaker 2>having ridiculous standards for bodies </v>
<v Speaker 2>for females that works with men too.</v>

789
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:12.110
<v Speaker 2>It's the same claims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

790
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.033
<v Speaker 2>of course does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they don't care because feminists </v>

791
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.033
<v Speaker 2>dichotomize the world is women being </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed and the oppressors and it's </v>

792
00:31:18.071 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your oppressor.</v>

793
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the root of old feminist tool.</v>

794
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.613
<v Speaker 2>But that's why I want to talk about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the ideas because I think </v>

795
00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of the same thing as the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus the left.</v>

796
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.170
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's all like a symptom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human psychology.</v>

797
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.080
<v Speaker 2>The right versus the left is tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribalism.</v>

798
00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:37.410
<v Speaker 2>But so it's female versus male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

799
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.263
<v Speaker 2>it's these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at this blind allegiance </v>

800
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:41.314
<v Speaker 2>towards anyone with a vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar to someone who was </v>

801
00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:45.670
<v Speaker 2>blind allegiance to is anyone who is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a red state.</v>

802
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

803
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:48.064
<v Speaker 2>the people in the red site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they say that the blue states were </v>

804
00:31:49.271 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 2>oppressing them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

805
00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that for sure.</v>

806
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe it is.</v>

807
00:31:54.381 --> 00:31:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Hey Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a communist.</v>

808
00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:58.360
<v Speaker 2>He came from Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to ruin America.</v>

809
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>He wants to kill it from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

810
00:32:00.101 --> 00:32:00.934
<v Speaker 2>that was the big narrative forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not them saying he's holding them </v>

811
00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:04.990
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

812
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:08.620
<v Speaker 2>there was always like a thing that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was holding him down with the economy or</v>

813
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:09.454
<v Speaker 2>that he was holding them down with </v>
<v Speaker 2>obamacare and he was ruining so many </v>

814
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:13.360
<v Speaker 2>different factors.</v>

815
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 2>It takes in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hates America.</v>

816
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.890
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't sound exactly the same to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>

817
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:19.763
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminists are essentially what was </v>

818
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:25.390
<v Speaker 2>called Neo Marxist and they take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of Marxist dichotomy of the economy</v>

819
00:32:25.391 --> 00:32:28.450
<v Speaker 2>with the bourgeoisie personally </v>
<v Speaker 2>proletariat through the American systems</v>

820
00:32:28.451 --> 00:32:29.284
<v Speaker 2>and their wealth and apply it to men </v>
<v Speaker 2>being the bourgeoisie and women being </v>

821
00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 2>the proletariat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

822
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Which is highly ironic given the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidently privileged status in society.</v>

823
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Women hold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

824
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 2>that's when it got weird when everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeating that fucking wage gap thing.</v>

825
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the most frustrating </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking points.</v>

826
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:45.314
<v Speaker 2>Even Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Goddamn president of the United </v>

827
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.910
<v Speaker 2>States on tv reiterating something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows is not true.</v>

828
00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was very frustrating.</v>

829
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I just,</v>

830
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.163
<v Speaker 2>I feel like human beings are inclined </v>
<v Speaker 2>very naturally to form a group to stay </v>

831
00:32:59.001 --> 00:32:59.834
<v Speaker 2>tribal and then I think it works with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a part of what's </v>

832
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:05.490
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Neil Marxism that's collect</v>

833
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:06.523
<v Speaker 2>connected to it or what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something that's happening with </v>

834
00:33:08.601 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 2>feminism versus masculine people.</v>

835
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an enemy,</v>

836
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:13.783
<v Speaker 2>but there's no like masculinist so he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to say masculine [inaudible] silly </v>

837
00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:19.650
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

838
00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:20.670
<v Speaker 2>that'd be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

839
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:21.523
<v Speaker 2>This apparently a feminism is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you have mechanism that </v>

840
00:33:24.111 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 2>sounds dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

841
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.880
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

842
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.800
<v Speaker 2>well then that's how feminism sounds to </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

843
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:28.663
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the most amazing thing that it's </v>

844
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:33.320
<v Speaker 2>taken so long for male feminists to die </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

845
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.513
<v Speaker 2>Like that's finally like rotting away </v>
<v Speaker 2>after a few of them have been outed as </v>

846
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:40.640
<v Speaker 2>being creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say that it's a honey.</v>

847
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank the baby Jesus.</v>

848
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 2>They got caught because look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

849
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:45.224
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with being male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just because you're a human with a </v>

850
00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:48.254
<v Speaker 2>Dick doesn't mean you're a bad person if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think there's something wrong with </v>

851
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.053
<v Speaker 2>being male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

852
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.033
<v Speaker 2>we only do because they want to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>those girls and they don't have any </v>

853
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:55.910
<v Speaker 2>other way to fuck us.</v>

854
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's probably the roots of it,</v>

855
00:33:57.261 --> 00:34:00.020
<v Speaker 2>but that's 100% of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately you see male feminists,</v>

856
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:01.700
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to win any fights.</v>

857
00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm saying.</v>

858
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 2>They gonna do they even need to shave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them do.</v>

859
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.033
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be receding hairlines </v>

860
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:11.240
<v Speaker 2>and Fedoras and they'll like molesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the place,</v>

861
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because instead of the best,</v>

862
00:34:12.681 --> 00:34:14.670
<v Speaker 2>he said they're sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had definitely not.</v>

863
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.620
<v Speaker 2>But they're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid of like men like you,</v>

864
00:34:16.621 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 2>you know they're never going to compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>

865
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

866
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.260
<v Speaker 2>But they don't have to compete with </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

867
00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:22.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what they don't see that right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

868
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:23.773
<v Speaker 2>They got fucked by genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them love and got fucked by </v>

869
00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:29.120
<v Speaker 2>genetics and so they're taking the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary strategy they've got.</v>

870
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.133
<v Speaker 2>You can hardly blame him but they need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do is get to the lab and figure out </v>

871
00:34:32.331 --> 00:34:33.164
<v Speaker 2>crisper.</v>

872
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:37.550
<v Speaker 2>We're work on re reengineering yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>to look like for the fucking gym.</v>

873
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what they to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

874
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.880
<v Speaker 2>If you're a male feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shut up.</v>

875
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Stop talking about feminism on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>years time you'll be a bit bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be a bit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

895
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:25.993
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I understand the motivation wipe </v>

896
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:31.640
<v Speaker 2>someone becomes a male feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] the word allies,</v>

<v Speaker 2>with creepy harasser.</v>

899
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

900
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.063
<v Speaker 1>you kind of knew it all from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning that that was what it was </v>

901
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:42.480
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew it.</v>

902
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Like especially heterosexual men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

905
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 1>One guy read his twitter profile and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about,</v>

906
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.350
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in his twitter post.</v>

908
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:55.284
<v Speaker 1>Rather he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop calling myself a </v>

909
00:35:57.871 --> 00:36:01.620
<v Speaker 1>feminist until feminists decide that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing feminism right.</v>

910
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.573
<v Speaker 1>I'll make women respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that he put it out on </v>

<v Speaker 1>twitter like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put that at like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>people in general,</v>

915
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.453
<v Speaker 1>women being people respect boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the people who will enforce her </v>

916
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.510
<v Speaker 1>own boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's literally said,</v>

917
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:19.321
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no boundaries.</v>

918
00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:20.610
<v Speaker 1>You tell me what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be a slave.</v>

919
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.440
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

920
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll be a willing servant and keep </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop saying I'm a feminist </v>

923
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 1>until feminists telling me I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminism.</v>

924
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:33.534
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason that they call them </v>

925
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:35.034
<v Speaker 1>cooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>

926
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:36.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a good word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

927
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a good word to know what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant.</v>

928
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I thought it always meant like a cock </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold like a porn film.</v>

929
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kinda did originally,</v>

930
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:47.520
<v Speaker 1>but now it's just kind of being someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to end up themselves.</v>

931
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really good use for it.</v>

932
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also subtle.</v>

933
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not just someone who won't stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for themselves.</v>

934
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Someone who is pandering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

935
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 1>like you're pandering to the laughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>pant.</v>

936
00:36:57.091 --> 00:36:57.924
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to paint yourself out as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being very sort of hoping that the </v>

937
00:37:01.141 --> 00:37:02.640
<v Speaker 1>person you're selling yourself out.</v>

938
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.940
<v Speaker 1>So we'll treat you linearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

939
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.150
<v Speaker 1>so instead of talking about individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm,</v>

940
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:11.180
<v Speaker 1>what I'm really fascinated about is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology behind what's going on now in</v>

941
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 1>this culture of free expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

942
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 1>The fact that a guy like you can not see</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong with you,</v>

943
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:17.994
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the guy was just a gentleman </v>
<v Speaker 1>from England who doesn't have a </v>

944
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:26.481
<v Speaker 1>connection to the media owner can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>by virtue of your ability to communicate</v>

945
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.000
<v Speaker 1>and put out some youtube videos and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>some really good points,</v>

946
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.000
<v Speaker 1>you can have this massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive following.</v>

947
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:37.830
<v Speaker 1>This is an n the these ideas that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are spreading back and forth.</v>

948
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Even the weird ones like the Kec Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frog and all that shit.</v>

949
00:37:40.921 --> 00:37:43.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just a Jag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting to me.</v>

950
00:37:43.681 --> 00:37:45.900
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

951
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.033
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I feel like is like Fox News and </v>

952
00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:50.514
<v Speaker 1>CNN and even major networks when </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially all the ones that are trying </v>

953
00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:55.620
<v Speaker 1>to portray narratives.</v>

954
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.050
<v Speaker 1>All the ones that are talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way life is and you know,</v>

955
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.233
<v Speaker 1>they seem to me to be like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these huddled up executives at the top </v>

956
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:10.740
<v Speaker 1>of like a giant pile of crocodiles </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapping at them.</v>

957
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like they've completely lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over what people talk about.</v>

958
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:20.721
<v Speaker 1>They were on the spire of rock and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the oceans slowly eroding.</v>

959
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.060
<v Speaker 1>It's snapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was nothing there.</v>

960
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.510
<v Speaker 1>There was no water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no crocodiles.</v>

961
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:31.170
<v Speaker 1>The only information that got away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the only information got</v>

962
00:38:31.171 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was through mass media.</v>

963
00:38:32.461 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Mass media was controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations and we like for the</v>

964
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.440
<v Speaker 2>longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the only way.</v>

965
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And they still operate like that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only way.</v>

966
00:38:41.771 --> 00:38:42.604
<v Speaker 2>It's really quite fascinating narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hedger mooney social media has </v>

967
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 2>demolished them and we're not going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

968
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not going back.</v>

969
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

970
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I think the only companies that truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that or uh,</v>

971
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Internet based companies that are trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to manage it,</v>

972
00:38:57.191 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 2>like whether it's youtube or google or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even Netflix,</v>

973
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand it,</v>

974
00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:02.843
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to manage it in some </v>

975
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 2>weird ways that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really bummed out about Netflix.</v>

976
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:07.594
<v Speaker 2>Thumbs up versus thumbs down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you know what you should </v>

977
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:12.910
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have 100% thing.</v>

978
00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 2>So give them one to a hundred the more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more range you give someone,</v>

979
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:18.730
<v Speaker 2>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But up and down,</v>

980
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:21.730
<v Speaker 2>it's just fucking silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I were going to review things,</v>

981
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

982
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.043
<v Speaker 2>Recommended not recommended and it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be quite subjective to my personal </v>

983
00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:25.770
<v Speaker 2>taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

984
00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:26.603
<v Speaker 2>it'll be able to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

985
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.753
<v Speaker 2>if you've been following me for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I like and I'd give my </v>

986
00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:30.634
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to explain it as accurately </v>

987
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:33.310
<v Speaker 2>and concisely and as objective as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

988
00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:34.410
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

989
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the largest sweep of people watching the</v>

990
00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 2>video could understand why I felt the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way I did.</v>

991
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Speaker 2>And so the end of [inaudible] would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would I recommend it?</v>

992
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:43.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

993
00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:43.894
<v Speaker 2>your mileage may vary or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to watch this or something </v>

994
00:39:45.731 --> 00:39:46.564
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

995
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.640
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate the star system.</v>

996
00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:49.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

997
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

998
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.740
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

999
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.510
<v Speaker 2>it makes it sound objective when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>

1000
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's objective,</v>

1001
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.080
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be,</v>

1002
00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not perfect though.</v>

1003
00:39:57.371 --> 00:39:58.204
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

1004
00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.230
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1005
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of this little stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about aesthetics and tastes.</v>

1006
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 2>So for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1007
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I loved the movie hardcore Henry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1008
00:40:06.461 --> 00:40:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

1009
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:08.103
<v Speaker 2>and I realized that I irrationally love </v>
<v Speaker 2>this note was the single person who had </v>

1010
00:40:11.241 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first person.</v>

1011
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot about it.</v>

1012
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I've said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1013
00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:18.110
<v Speaker 2>you'll love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure like it looks like guy like</v>

1014
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.310
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1015
00:40:19.311 --> 00:40:20.830
<v Speaker 2>it's not for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for,</v>

1016
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:21.693
<v Speaker 2>it's for the sort of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lizard brain who likes </v>

1017
00:40:22.961 --> 00:40:24.310
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lizard brain.</v>

1018
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what you think about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were an MMA fighter.</v>

1019
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:29.783
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kickbox I did taekwondo and there was </v>

1020
00:40:33.401 --> 00:40:35.950
<v Speaker 2>no mma when I was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But did you enjoy finding other people?</v>

1021
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very complicated question </v>

1022
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.930
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1023
00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 2>And did you enjoy for many years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know,</v>

1024
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's complicated in that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was important for me,</v>

1025
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.060
<v Speaker 2>but I don't necessarily know if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed it.</v>

1026
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.400
<v Speaker 2>I definitely enjoyed winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1027
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:52.630
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1028
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.060
<v Speaker 2>it was such a like how call him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a task,</v>

1029
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll like it when you get,</v>

1030
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.500
<v Speaker 2>when you get past the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1031
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe the beginning of it is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaking the rest of it.</v>

1032
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.983
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1033
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.600
<v Speaker 2>when you get past the initial sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is weird to look at,</v>

1034
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:05.600
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1035
00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.720
<v Speaker 2>it's fast paced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's action packed,</v>

1036
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:11.050
<v Speaker 2>and it definitely taps into that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>lizard brain,</v>

1037
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:11.884
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the male desire to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy at the end of the film that </v>

1038
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:17.800
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's literally in like a fist brawl with</v>

1039
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:21.690
<v Speaker 2>like 30 other dudes and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the most insane and he's just,</v>

1040
00:41:21.691 --> 00:41:22.524
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all coming at him and he's just </v>

1041
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:23.351
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>

1042
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how get,</v>

1043
00:41:24.961 --> 00:41:26.790
<v Speaker 2>get stoned and watch it and get drunk or</v>
<v Speaker 2>watches.</v>

1044
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just the best thing if you're into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>

1045
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.110
<v Speaker 2>But if you're not into that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't like it at all.</v>

1046
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.120
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't anytime an inch that</v>

1047
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like John Wick,</v>

1048
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:36.590
<v Speaker 3>he's not always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1049
00:41:36.591 --> 00:41:37.424
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1050
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.170
<v Speaker 3>John Wick two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about that?</v>

1051
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.460
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even that good.</v>

1052
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:41.361
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1053
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:41.781
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1054
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:42.614
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for a certain kind of person in a </v>

1055
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:45.050
<v Speaker 3>certain kind of mood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it hits,</v>

1056
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:47.690
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was the first film in a long,</v>

1057
00:41:47.691 --> 00:41:49.060
<v Speaker 3>long time that I was just sat in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cinema,</v>

1058
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Speaker 3>just enjoy it with a smile on my face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just enjoying this.</v>

1059
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:53.270
<v Speaker 3>This was great fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1060
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.480
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I presented it,</v>

1061
00:41:54.481 --> 00:41:55.314
<v Speaker 3>it was just like tapping into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>primordial desire to defeat your </v>

1062
00:41:58.401 --> 00:42:00.030
<v Speaker 3>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought it was interesting.</v>

1063
00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.390
<v Speaker 3>They shot at like a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like quake,</v>

1064
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:07.540
<v Speaker 3>first person shooter and stuffing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this vidcon thing that you went to,</v>

1065
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 3>who puts this together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hank and John Green.</v>

1066
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 3>And who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vlog brothers.</v>

1067
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.400
<v Speaker 3>They're famous youtubers.</v>

1068
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:17.743
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it very interesting when Anita </v>

1069
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 3>was calling me a shithead and garbage </v>
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

1070
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.860
<v Speaker 3>that's a direct violation of that code </v>
<v Speaker 3>of conduct.</v>

1071
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:27.150
<v Speaker 3>And did they do anything about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1072
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.800
<v Speaker 3>I know because she's a feminist because </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a woman.</v>

1073
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because she gets special cause she's in,</v>

1074
00:42:33.971 --> 00:42:34.804
<v Speaker 3>he suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in because she gets special </v>

1075
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 3>treatment because at this point she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically become the avatar feminism.</v>

1076
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.960
<v Speaker 3>If she fails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God in that.</v>

1077
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.040
<v Speaker 3>But I mean she respected in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1078
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.420
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1079
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Everyone hates her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did they still prop her up?</v>

1080
00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Because she's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in.</v>

1081
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.740
<v Speaker 3>If she doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't,</v>

1082
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:50.583
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1083
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.640
<v Speaker 3>there's a myth os that's built up around</v>
<v Speaker 3>her and get word.</v>

1084
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.740
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

1085
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.820
<v Speaker 3>and they've all propped her up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've all propped her up level,</v>

1086
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.730
<v Speaker 3>said good things about her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've all defended her.</v>

1087
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.030
<v Speaker 3>And if it turns out that she is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>an abuser,</v>

1088
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:11.390
<v Speaker 3>which she did according to the Vidcon </v>
<v Speaker 3>code of conduct,</v>

1089
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.250
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the code of conduct?</v>

1090
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:13.751
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1091
00:43:13.751 --> 00:43:16.340
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember it verbatim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I read down a video.</v>

1092
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of my latest videos.</v>

1093
00:43:17.901 --> 00:43:18.734
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a quick message to hank and </v>

1094
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:20.414
<v Speaker 3>John Green and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that thousands of people email </v>

1095
00:43:22.491 --> 00:43:23.151
<v Speaker 3>them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>

1096
00:43:23.151 --> 00:43:23.984
<v Speaker 3>she did violate your code of conduct </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a position of institutional </v>

1097
00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:28.490
<v Speaker 3>privilege at Vidcon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was on the panel.</v>

1098
00:43:28.491 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had a microphone,</v>

1099
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.660
<v Speaker 3>she's calling me names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's accusing me of things on true.</v>

1100
00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was doing that while you were in</v>

1101
00:43:34.821 --> 00:43:38.000
<v Speaker 3>the audience directly looking me in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eye and it was like,</v>

1102
00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:39.320
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

1103
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.960
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not right.</v>

1104
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:45.410
<v Speaker 3>And they've done nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have done nothing.</v>

1105
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:46.900
<v Speaker 3>They've said nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talk.</v>

1106
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.250
<v Speaker 3>And then afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all I got from her fans and,</v>

1107
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.220
<v Speaker 3>and I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1108
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:53.054
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and hundreds of messages and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just retweeted them all night with </v>

1109
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:59.500
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same language she uses when </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's displaying.</v>

1110
00:43:59.501 --> 00:44:00.334
<v Speaker 3>I'll look of the nasty messages I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>guessing of people calling me eight </v>

1111
00:44:02.381 --> 00:44:04.340
<v Speaker 3>garbage human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what she called me.</v>

1112
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.610
<v Speaker 3>And so she has done absolutely nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1113
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 3>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1114
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:11.060
<v Speaker 3>hank and John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's violated your code of conduct.</v>

1115
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.013
<v Speaker 3>Her fans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's incited a submodel of harasses </v>

1116
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:17.720
<v Speaker 3>exactly as she claims I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she has actually done this.</v>

1117
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:23.230
<v Speaker 3>Then on the Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was due to be on a panel about cyber</v>

1118
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:24.343
<v Speaker 3>harassment c but it can't be harassment </v>
<v Speaker 3>when she's a woman and you're a man </v>

1119
00:44:30.051 --> 00:44:34.940
<v Speaker 3>because you are the oppressor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the same thing as racism and the</v>

1120
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.270
<v Speaker 3>black person being raised against a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white person.</v>

1121
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.153
<v Speaker 3>It possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason to do this then to not </v>

1122
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:45.441
<v Speaker 3>to take no action is if you are highly </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological and interesting.</v>

1123
00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.320
<v Speaker 3>So you feel like they're high Dhea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Highly ideological.</v>

1124
00:44:49.321 --> 00:44:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredibly biased.</v>

1125
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.860
<v Speaker 3>But why are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're youtube stars,</v>

1126
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:54.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean aren't they like don't they </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand?</v>

1127
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.640
<v Speaker 3>They're very progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very progressive.</v>

1128
00:44:56.641 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 3>But you're fairly progressive too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a liberal.</v>

1129
00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.513
<v Speaker 3>I'm not progressing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the difference between a </v>

1130
00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a liberal and progressive ones?</v>

1131
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:05.050
<v Speaker 3>Quality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality of outcomes,</v>

1132
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.113
<v Speaker 3>complete night and day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really drives what the problem with </v>

1133
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.790
<v Speaker 3>liberals and progressives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1134
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.673
<v Speaker 3>This is by definition is that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>always thought progressive means that </v>

1135
00:45:13.591 --> 00:45:17.550
<v Speaker 3>you support gay rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you support a women's right comes forth.</v>

1136
00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the outcome of gays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With non gays,</v>

1137
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.530
<v Speaker 3>they won't case that non games we case </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have the same.</v>

1138
00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1139
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm done the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want that too.</v>

1140
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.863
<v Speaker 3>And this is what I was gonna say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of open overlapping </v>

1141
00:45:26.251 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 3>magisterial when it comes to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1142
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:28.554
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Areas of interest,</v>

1145
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.823
<v Speaker 3>things that they won't have domains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worry of sounds so much better than </v>

1146
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:39.150
<v Speaker 3>areas of interest though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So write that down.</v>

<v Speaker 3>gay rights from a liberal perspective.</v>

1153
00:45:50.101 --> 00:45:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Cause liberals want universal rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1154
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.520
<v Speaker 3>if some people can get married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay should be up to get married.</v>

1155
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 3>So it's the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1156
00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:56.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm Christine get fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an atheist,</v>

1157
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.360
<v Speaker 3>not argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1158
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Where's the progressive they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>because someone else has it.</v>

1159
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:01.523
<v Speaker 3>Someone else has this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore they want this because they </v>

1160
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:03.000
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1161
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.780
<v Speaker 3>And then whose definition by there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>yours a year defining them.</v>

1162
00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.540
<v Speaker 3>That's what they define as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1163
00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.433
<v Speaker 3>they are the ones saying all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like affirmative action is the </v>

1164
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or example of this.</v>

1165
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:16.763
<v Speaker 3>A liberal would never ask for FM to </v>
<v Speaker 3>action because in the liberal worldview </v>

1166
00:46:19.081 --> 00:46:21.300
<v Speaker 3>people should be free to pursue their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own goals.</v>

1167
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.403
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the liberals and usually very </v>

1168
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 3>anti racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a,</v>

1169
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:28.440
<v Speaker 3>that's not a cancer in which you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>judge someone him sex.</v>

1170
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never turn around and say,</v>

1171
00:46:29.881 --> 00:46:31.740
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay well you'll see these were the kid.</v>

1172
00:46:31.741 --> 00:46:32.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1173
00:46:32.491 --> 00:46:35.040
<v Speaker 3>you clean know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got some tents so get out.</v>

1174
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be ridiculous.</v>

1175
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.720
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a,</v>

1176
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.690
<v Speaker 3>not a reason to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1177
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.000
<v Speaker 3>but the progressive we'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a man,</v>

1178
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 3>the progressive will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm sorry,</v>

1179
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:44.460
<v Speaker 3>we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1180
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:45.294
<v Speaker 3>we want equality and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we define a quality of </v>

1181
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:48.360
<v Speaker 3>different years.</v>

1182
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 3>I call it equality of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call it quality of outcome.</v>

1183
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Cause they'll turn around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1184
00:46:51.691 --> 00:46:54.150
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've already got like a 70% men.</v>

1185
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.073
<v Speaker 3>So I mean you'll see you might be great </v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got a deck so we can't take </v>

1186
00:46:57.451 --> 00:46:58.284
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to take that unqualified </v>

1187
00:46:58.921 --> 00:46:59.754
<v Speaker 3>woman instead because we need to get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>parity because they want a quality of </v>

1188
00:47:02.431 --> 00:47:03.480
<v Speaker 3>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were 50% men,</v>

1189
00:47:03.481 --> 00:47:06.260
<v Speaker 3>50% women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who was a,</v>

1190
00:47:06.261 --> 00:47:07.094
<v Speaker 3>a big wig at a big internet company and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to deal with that shit all the </v>

1191
00:47:10.381 --> 00:47:11.214
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where going to have men who were far </v>

1192
00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:13.644
<v Speaker 3>more qualified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who they were getting pressured of push </v>

1193
00:47:16.621 --> 00:47:17.454
<v Speaker 3>out to make room for my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they were specifically looking for </v>

1194
00:47:20.941 --> 00:47:21.774
<v Speaker 3>qualified black woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like going out of their way </v>

1195
00:47:24.361 --> 00:47:26.820
<v Speaker 3>because they wanted to give out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>appearance of diversity.</v>

1196
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:27.683
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's because they're also scared </v>

1197
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 3>of criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1198
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:30.993
<v Speaker 2>So they're scared of being attacked for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the of activists and by race pimps and </v>

1199
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:36.730
<v Speaker 2>there's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of race pimps,</v>

1200
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:38.050
<v Speaker 2>which is like Drm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

1201
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Penn Plaza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1202
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1203
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:41.880
<v Speaker 2>they use it for Jesse Jackson back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>

1204
00:47:41.881 --> 00:47:44.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's been outed as a race pamper.</v>

1205
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.394
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've talked to people's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like famously come to organizations and </v>

1206
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:54.280
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am going to give you diversity courses</v>

1207
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:55.443
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to pay me a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money or we're going to </v>

1208
00:47:56.981 --> 00:47:58.450
<v Speaker 2>protest to the religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1209
00:47:58.570 --> 00:47:59.950
<v Speaker 2>And they're in the priesthood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1210
00:47:59.951 --> 00:48:04.000
<v Speaker 2>it's people who like criticized and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want it to hurt their business.</v>

1211
00:48:04.001 --> 00:48:04.834
<v Speaker 2>And when you get fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're dealing with an </v>

1212
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:09.130
<v Speaker 2>internet business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet based businesses,</v>

1213
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.200
<v Speaker 2>you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1214
00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.700
<v Speaker 2>like Google for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple,</v>

1215
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.950
<v Speaker 2>classically liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1216
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:16.920
<v Speaker 2>You would say bluegrass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1217
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:21.800
<v Speaker 2>So very loving in in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal actually means and liberal in,</v>

1218
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.860
<v Speaker 2>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal means progressive.</v>

1219
00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Well though I hate all these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>arms is a nightmare.</v>

1220
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:32.470
<v Speaker 2>It's taken me a long time to really be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to hammer out the,</v>

1221
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ins and outs ideologically of it.</v>

1222
00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:38.020
<v Speaker 2>And so I can explain it quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiently now because it's difficult.</v>

1223
00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:41.900
<v Speaker 2>It's really dark about something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive thinking into,</v>

1224
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.813
<v Speaker 2>well not progressive thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rather affirmative action is that </v>

1225
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.053
<v Speaker 2>you're going to create a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of racism by putting someone who's </v>

1226
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:54.100
<v Speaker 2>qualified in a position just because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their color in it is racist.</v>

1227
00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:54.630
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1228
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 2>you're being discriminatory on the basis</v>
<v Speaker 2>of race white person.</v>

1229
00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's racism by a racist.</v>

1230
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 2>But you go to the deep root of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to realize,</v>

1231
00:49:04.481 --> 00:49:06.070
<v Speaker 2>well there's some people that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1232
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 2>they're given a terrible hand of cards.</v>

1233
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 2>We've got to be able to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix that hand of cards,</v>

1234
00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 2>how to make it a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>balanced in our,</v>

1235
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.350
<v Speaker 2>in our cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How to make,</v>

1236
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:15.050
<v Speaker 2>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1237
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one way to do it,</v>

1238
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.770
<v Speaker 2>but that's where it gets really crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

1239
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if the people that are born in these</v>

1240
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:24.514
<v Speaker 2>crime ridden communities and then get no</v>
<v Speaker 2>assistance whatsoever from the very </v>

1241
00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:28.834
<v Speaker 2>government that sending billions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars overseas to assist these other </v>

1242
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.330
<v Speaker 2>cops helping them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1243
00:49:34.331 --> 00:49:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Not against helping him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like the,</v>

1244
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:38.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you know what you go hang</v>

1245
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.303
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1246
00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:43.360
<v Speaker 2>but anything you do has to start with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them saying,</v>

1247
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I want to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1248
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.310
<v Speaker 2>And if they can't stop the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's not damaged,</v>

1249
00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:50.860
<v Speaker 2>they're going to start with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can do nothing for them.</v>

1250
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're happy where they on how they are</v>

1251
00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:55.270
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can't change anything.</v>

1252
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.110
<v Speaker 2>All you'll do is throw good money off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bat and they'll know it that,</v>

1253
00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean like think about people who win </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lottery.</v>

1254
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Did they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they happy?</v>

1255
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most days they ruins our lives,</v>

1256
00:50:04.061 --> 00:50:05.560
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they say.</v>

1257
00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Relationships feel like the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>write those articles are always sad.</v>

1258
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:11.380
<v Speaker 2>They didn't run the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you could talk to shit.</v>

1259
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.653
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably a lot of dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there that are just straight ball </v>

1260
00:50:15.461 --> 00:50:16.294
<v Speaker 2>and having a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new thing that you will have </v>

1261
00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.350
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's always true.</v>

1262
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.453
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes 100 person and it may </v>

1263
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:25.750
<v Speaker 2>me if it's like a super amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you,</v>

1264
00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.230
<v Speaker 2>maybe you just got to ease into it.</v>

1265
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's one of those things and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>went $100 million and you just like,</v>

1266
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:33.830
<v Speaker 2>pretend you only want a hundred grand </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend that.</v>

1267
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.530
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to start slow.</v>

1268
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Don't get a Ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we don't have a Camaro,</v>

1269
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:39.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to help these people.</v>

1270
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:40.784
<v Speaker 2>But they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to begin from a position where </v>

1271
00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:42.561
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1272
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:44.530
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to help because if,</v>

1273
00:50:44.531 --> 00:50:46.820
<v Speaker 2>if there's something going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to change,</v>

1274
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.330
<v Speaker 2>well then they're not going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I understand that.</v>

1275
00:50:49.331 --> 00:50:50.164
<v Speaker 2>But I meet a lot of them change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even understand how they would go </v>

1276
00:50:52.761 --> 00:50:53.594
<v Speaker 2>about changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're constantly surrounded and </v>

1277
00:50:56.001 --> 00:50:56.834
<v Speaker 2>reinforced by all these people around </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that are in jail or committing </v>

1278
00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.330
<v Speaker 2>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black Youtube is occasionally in,</v>

1279
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:03.190
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1280
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:05.180
<v Speaker 2>they do blame a lot of stuff on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>white man.</v>

1281
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 2>They said the white man will keep you </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and stuff like that.</v>

1282
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:08.920
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1283
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.313
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this was a white guy and he was at </v>

1284
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:14.630
<v Speaker 2>the Black Man's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold me down,</v>

1285
00:51:14.631 --> 00:51:15.464
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut up,</v>

1286
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:17.420
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't accept it.</v>

1287
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.980
<v Speaker 2>And if you'll get to accept that from </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1288
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:19.814
<v Speaker 2>that's you being a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Treat them like you would treat white </v>

1289
00:51:21.801 --> 00:51:22.634
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this was white people sitting around </v>

1290
00:51:23.751 --> 00:51:24.920
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna do anything.</v>

1291
00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to join the gang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what the black man's,</v>

1292
00:51:27.471 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 2>all the Jews are trying to hold me down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and something.</v>

1293
00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't let me finish.</v>

1294
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't saying that white people are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact holding black people down.</v>

1295
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.650
<v Speaker 2>I was saying that idea of the white man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have this mandate,</v>

1296
00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.500
<v Speaker 2>we've got to hold the black people sound</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably dressed.</v>

1297
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a standard argument.</v>

1298
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a coalition of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1299
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the hedge.</v>

1300
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sad thought.</v>

1301
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.823
<v Speaker 2>This option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there absolutely was </v>

1302
00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:51.643
<v Speaker 2>certain times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's absolutely neighborhoods </v>

1303
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:54.980
<v Speaker 2>at black people were not allowed to buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>real estate.</v>

1304
00:51:54.981 --> 00:51:55.814
<v Speaker 2>There's absolutely a systematic racism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was still a little racist </v>

1305
00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.320
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1306
00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's not justified.</v>

1307
00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.350
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1308
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:03.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's not justified and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1309
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:04.304
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where like the argument </v>

1310
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:06.464
<v Speaker 2>goes off the rails because they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean all this stuff's </v>

1311
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:08.241
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1312
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:09.074
<v Speaker 2>it has happened and they're all racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to let that hold you </v>

1313
00:52:12.231 --> 00:52:13.120
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1314
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.170
<v Speaker 2>you definitely don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is up to it.</v>

1315
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they need examples.</v>

1316
00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:18.243
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more examples and more role </v>

1317
00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 2>models in that direction.</v>

1318
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I've actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen,</v>

1319
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember seeing this,</v>

1320
00:52:23.211 --> 00:52:24.044
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this black doctor doing a speaking </v>

1322
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:27.643
<v Speaker 2>was he a real doctor or a chiropractor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then all of the differences then </v>

1323
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:34.930
<v Speaker 2>chiropractors aren't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors just found that out recent.</v>

1324
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's real.</v>

1325
00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't go to medical school.</v>

1326
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that fucking crazy.</v>

1327
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.450
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about that until I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>having her on the podcast.</v>

1328
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:45.350
<v Speaker 2>The woman who wrote that article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1329
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.520
<v Speaker 2>they kill people died from that and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

1330
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.360
<v Speaker 2>There was some recent thing that a red </v>
<v Speaker 2>band sent me about some playboy playmate</v>

1331
00:52:53.361 --> 00:52:54.194
<v Speaker 2>who died because the doctor or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractor adjusted her neck and she </v>

1332
00:52:56.871 --> 00:52:58.430
<v Speaker 2>fucking died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1333
00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:00.860
<v Speaker 2>People die every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it to babies,</v>

1334
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:02.450
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had just babies.</v>

1335
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:05.300
<v Speaker 2>There's people that do like chiropractic</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjustments on babies.</v>

1336
00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.313
<v Speaker 2>Their bones aren't even fully formed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their bones are soft and these assholes </v>

1337
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.890
<v Speaker 2>are manipulating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad you told me that.</v>

1338
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Cause I got two and a half year old son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing wrong.</v>

1339
00:53:15.441 --> 00:53:16.274
<v Speaker 2>Playboy model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Katie May's death caused by </v>

1340
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 2>chiropractor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Autopsy fines.</v>

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Scroll up so I could read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking this nonsense.</v>

1342
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought when a doctor tells</v>

1343
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.580
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1344
00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.650
<v Speaker 1>when you say Doctor Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a doctor who died.</v>

1345
00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.770
<v Speaker 1>You went to medical school and learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to be a chiropractor.</v>

1346
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you're allowed to do and</v>

1347
00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.330
<v Speaker 1>don't settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready for this.</v>

1348
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.910
<v Speaker 1>The guy who invented it was a magnetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>healer.</v>

1349
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy invented Cairo.</v>

1350
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this like subluxation is all</v>

1351
00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:45.010
<v Speaker 1>these words they use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have cleared a total.</v>

1352
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Entirely fake.</v>

1353
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:47.663
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guy who invented it very </v>

1354
00:53:49.561 --> 00:53:52.370
<v Speaker 1>possibly was murdered by his son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a suspicion.</v>

1355
00:53:52.371 --> 00:53:56.130
<v Speaker 1>His son ran him over for sure and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think he might've done it on purpose and</v>

1356
00:53:56.131 --> 00:53:56.964
<v Speaker 1>then his son ran him over with a car and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then took over the business and his son </v>

1357
00:53:59.461 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 1>was totally shady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pieces of shit.</v>

1358
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:03.260
<v Speaker 1>We'll call it a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1359
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you could have been an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tragic accident and the love dad,</v>

1360
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:06.773
<v Speaker 1>but the allegation is that he ran over </v>
<v Speaker 1>his dad to take over the family </v>

1361
00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:11.214
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1362
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.340
<v Speaker 1>It is not real at all and that is not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real science.</v>

1363
00:54:14.341 --> 00:54:17.170
<v Speaker 1>There's no science to support it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no it's,</v>

1364
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:22.020
<v Speaker 1>but the crazy thing is it's so accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>that insurance pays for this shit.</v>

1365
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:23.213
<v Speaker 1>She had some clotting and went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital where they tried to do super </v>

1366
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.110
<v Speaker 1>cheap procedures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she passed away.</v>

1367
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:33.470
<v Speaker 1>So this guy adjusting her her neck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they tore her verbal,</v>

1368
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:37.500
<v Speaker 1>her vertebral artery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you haven't look ahead local.</v>

1369
00:54:37.501 --> 00:54:39.510
<v Speaker 1>So no man,</v>

1370
00:54:39.511 --> 00:54:40.344
<v Speaker 1>you to understand there's bones in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as violent jutting if you're a </v>

1371
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.430
<v Speaker 1>tender person or if you have some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of vulnerability.</v>

1372
00:54:47.431 --> 00:54:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

1373
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:53.850
<v Speaker 1>They tore her fucking article or artery </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than article and subsequently cut</v>

1374
00:54:53.851 --> 00:54:58.290
<v Speaker 1>off blood flow to her brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her death was ruled accidental.</v>

1375
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.450
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we,</v>

1376
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.760

<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>

1377
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:06.900
<v Speaker 1>If a doctor does is this is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>confuses the shit out of him.</v>

1378
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.180

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1393
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.193
<v Speaker 1>it was actually synchronicity because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a conversation that I was having </v>

1394
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:47.363
<v Speaker 1>with Steve Rinella as a friend of mine a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks ago when he was talking </v>

1395
00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:51.714
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>his brother has got some issue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>atrophy and have his arm.</v>

1397
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:56.190
<v Speaker 1>He's been going to a chiropractor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1398
00:55:56.191 --> 00:55:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I think chiropractors are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so after the podcast,</v>

1399
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I smoked a joint and I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what it was.</v>

1400
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I being too hard on Chiropractors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in a deck.</v>

1401

<v Speaker 3>watched this guy doing the speaking tour</v>

1435
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.820
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a black doctor,</v>

<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

1438
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:34.150

1442
00:57:39.551 --> 00:57:41.440
<v Speaker 3>bunch of kids in school cause he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just saying,</v>

1443
00:57:41.441 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you drop outs,</v>

1444
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:45.520
<v Speaker 3>you won't get to where you want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1445
00:57:45.521 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 3>you've got to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just look at sensible.</v>

1446
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.510
<v Speaker 3>You just look at it through in like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>Aristotelian Lens.</v>

1447
00:57:49.511 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 3>You are what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1448
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:52.450
<v Speaker 3>what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do you want to end up?</v>

1449
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:54.520
<v Speaker 3>You will end up as a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1450
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 3>well if you drop out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that goal off the table.</v>

1451
00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:58.930
<v Speaker 3>You can't just have a scientist by </v>
<v Speaker 3>training at school.</v>

1452
00:57:58.931 --> 00:58:02.500
<v Speaker 3>So no matter how much you hate school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just got to fucking stick it out.</v>

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:03.833
<v Speaker 3>You've got to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to do something that's </v>

1454
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.770
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get,</v>

1455
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.210
<v Speaker 3>if you want to get their scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you plot it on,</v>

1456
00:58:07.211 --> 00:58:07.630
<v Speaker 3>get her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1457
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:10.480
<v Speaker 3>so I've got to get to college and go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know university,</v>

1458
00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:12.730
<v Speaker 3>get phd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I've got to make sure that I've,</v>

1459
00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:13.564
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done all the right courses to get </v>

1460
00:58:14.201 --> 00:58:16.000
<v Speaker 3>to the right field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to plot the sale.</v>

1461
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 3>If you drop out at any point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1462
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:18.521
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1463
00:58:18.521 --> 00:58:19.354
<v Speaker 3>you screwed your life plan there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to have to figure out </v>

1464
00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:22.144
<v Speaker 3>something to do know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know because I did exactly the same </v>

1465
00:58:23.231 --> 00:58:24.750
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no getting around it.</v>

1466
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:26.590
<v Speaker 3>No one can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one can give that to you.</v>

1467
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.650
<v Speaker 3>You've got to give it to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what empowerment is.</v>

1468
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be empowered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've just got to go,</v>

1469
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.030
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

1470
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:33.760
<v Speaker 3>let's just assume the white man hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1471
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:34.833
<v Speaker 3>Let's just assume he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every white men just assume we're all </v>

1472
00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:39.010
<v Speaker 3>fucking racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you assume that?</v>

1473
00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.570
<v Speaker 3>That gets a foolish thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

1474
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 3>This is worst case stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's think about worst case scenario.</v>

1475
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:44.800
<v Speaker 3>Every one person's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't hold you back,</v>

1476
00:58:44.801 --> 00:58:48.280
<v Speaker 3>but legally they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might be thinking,</v>

1477
00:58:48.281 --> 00:58:50.200
<v Speaker 3>where I came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to be some bigotry,</v>

1478
00:58:50.201 --> 00:58:52.000
<v Speaker 3>so well you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to work harder.</v>

1479
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:53.043
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get what if you want to get to </v>

1480
00:58:54.641 --> 00:58:55.474
<v Speaker 3>where you got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to work kind of living in a </v>

1481
00:58:56.861 --> 00:59:00.610
<v Speaker 3>paranoid world where you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want person hates you.</v>

1482
00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm not suggesting shot really even at </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

1483
00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:04.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm not suggesting you should actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

1484
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:05.763
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't bring it up because that's the </v>

1485
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:08.020
<v Speaker 3>worst case scenario for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

1486
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.700
<v Speaker 3>that's what let's say the White Man's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to hold me back.</v>

1487
00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:10.191
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

1488
00:59:10.191 --> 00:59:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just take that as a premise.</v>

1489
00:59:11.861 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1490
00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:14.200
<v Speaker 3>But does he actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1491
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:15.850
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they do actually have affirmative</v>

1492
00:59:15.851 --> 00:59:16.684
<v Speaker 3>action for your university and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if we still assume that this is </v>

1493
00:59:19.571 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 3>somehow owe him being racist and hating</v>

1494
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:23.780
<v Speaker 2>black people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still go,</v>

1495
00:59:23.781 --> 00:59:24.614
<v Speaker 2>well I can still take advantage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If what I need is these grades in the </v>

1496
00:59:26.971 --> 00:59:29.780
<v Speaker 2>subjects go and get those grades in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those subjects.</v>

1497
00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 2>In fact Yuma thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Christ,</v>

1498
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.233
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually good for the great up just </v>
<v Speaker 2>in case the white man tries to screw me </v>

1499
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:35.450
<v Speaker 2>even harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1500
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work even harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>

1501
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Well Christ that means you got to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

1502
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to work hard.</v>

1503
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I love the term the white man is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're usually white man,</v>

1504
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:42.591
<v Speaker 2>the white man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1505
00:59:42.591 --> 00:59:45.080
<v Speaker 2>they're not unified in anything other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than keeping black people down.</v>

1506
00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Like there's people brother down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>

1507
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:48.344
<v Speaker 2>I mean like when he gets to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidency clearly are like in dispute </v>

1508
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:53.540
<v Speaker 2>over everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1509
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Like everything from top to bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't the new center,</v>

1510
00:59:58.840 --> 00:59:59.673
<v Speaker 2>but it's the new thing that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the woke centrists the </v>

1511
01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:04.190
<v Speaker 2>centrists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new center,</v>

1512
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:05.103
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extremes of cancer and we should </v>

1513
01:00:05.871 --> 01:00:06.704
<v Speaker 2>just ignore them.</v>

1514
01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the center.</v>

1515
01:00:08.841 --> 01:00:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Sounds ridiculous to every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all sounds ridiculous,</v>

1516
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.063
<v Speaker 2>but ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather towards the bench Pero </v>

1517
01:00:14.151 --> 01:00:16.880
<v Speaker 2>of Richard Spencer Bench Bureau.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1518
01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:19.120
<v Speaker 2>We'd rather talk to me or need suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in.</v>

1519
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe not need somebody to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

1520
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:21.743
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's bad example route me or someone </v>

1521
01:00:23.451 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 2>who says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1522
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:26.630
<v Speaker 2>all white people oppressing our black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1523
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I always want to talk to someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>like has these extreme beliefs.</v>

1524
01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I believe she doesn't mean people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that go on.</v>

1525
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I want to know like what goes on in her </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1526
01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:37.244
<v Speaker 2>I want to know why she thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with being </v>

1527
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:42.780
<v Speaker 2>mailed to the point where like every </v>
<v Speaker 2>male has toxic.</v>

1528
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm talking about for the plug </v>
<v Speaker 2>political candidates,</v>

1529
01:00:46.641 --> 01:00:47.474
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather,</v>

1530
01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.790
<v Speaker 2>would you rather have two people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively moderate,</v>

1531
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.890
<v Speaker 2>relatively close to the center you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about political candidates took,</v>

1532
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:53.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1533
01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should specified you get there.</v>

1534
01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the,</v>

1535
01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:57.401
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1536
01:00:57.401 --> 01:01:00.320
<v Speaker 2>the center is the political sphere is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1537
01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:01.183
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's an ideology more than </v>

1538
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:05.750
<v Speaker 2>it is a political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you live your life more than how you</v>

1539
01:01:05.751 --> 01:01:06.540
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.373
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ideology in and of itself and you've </v>

1541
01:01:08.781 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 2>got like center left center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1542
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:10.694
<v Speaker 2>They've got similar but different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological traditions and I mean it's </v>

1543
01:01:13.881 --> 01:01:17.090
<v Speaker 2>like it's basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is when you say it's someone</v>

1544
01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:17.924
<v Speaker 2>else's fault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the worst thing you can do </v>

1545
01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:20.403
<v Speaker 2>because you're disempowering yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except when it clearly is someone </v>

1546
01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 2>else's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it is.</v>

1547
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time it's not.</v>

1548
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time it's your own fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1549
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:28.423
<v Speaker 2>Like the victim mentality that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about when we're talking about </v>

1550
01:01:30.501 --> 01:01:33.260
<v Speaker 2>like hardcore feminists that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly blame men for thing.</v>

1551
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.530
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is like what is it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a chick?</v>

1552
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:38.750
<v Speaker 2>It's probably fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably,</v>

1553
01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:39.584
<v Speaker 2>and not always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the terms when the term that </v>

1554
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.910
<v Speaker 2>you didn't let me finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1555
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:49.200
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is when women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly worried about being victims,</v>

1556
01:01:49.821 --> 01:01:51.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like women are worried.</v>

1557
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You show him.</v>

1558
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to some that talked about </v>

1559
01:01:54.441 --> 01:01:56.020
<v Speaker 2>like driving home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're scared.</v>

1560
01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:59.060
<v Speaker 2>They get nervous when they're walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>into certain areas at night.</v>

1561
01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.043
<v Speaker 2>And the way that a man doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is interesting cause that's the </v>

1562
01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>same opinion that Saudi Arabians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of the West,</v>

1563
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.143
<v Speaker 2>the house would you mean you've given me</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminist narrative that all women </v>

1564
01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:08.360
<v Speaker 2>are constantly afraid of men?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1565
01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of women are though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not saying they're not,</v>

1566
01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.150
<v Speaker 2>but like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let you know when you say right,</v>

1567
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.400
<v Speaker 2>the other women talk to women are afraid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of men.</v>

1568
01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:17.423
<v Speaker 2>That's also a feminist narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also the Wahhabi narrative from </v>

1569
01:02:21.151 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they have to go,</v>

1570
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:24.930
<v Speaker 2>well that means all women aren't allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and they go wet burgers.</v>

1571
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:26.360
<v Speaker 2>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got to reflect.</v>

1572
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:28.280
<v Speaker 2>We become invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I men aren't going to predict.</v>

1573
01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:31.710
<v Speaker 2>We have a very ancient culture and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that culture,</v>

1574
01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:34.500
<v Speaker 2>women are treated ridiculously different</v>
<v Speaker 2>than what you need.</v>

1575
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:39.501
<v Speaker 2>They don't Wahhabism arrived in the 18th</v>
<v Speaker 2>century with Abdul Wahab.</v>

1576
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old 1700.</v>

1577
01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:44.430
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty ancient to an American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1578
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.020
<v Speaker 2>And not to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm American man.</v>

1579
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not a snitch culture.</v>

1580
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.290
<v Speaker 2>My point is old as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point is,</v>

1581
01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.710
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point 1776.</v>

1582
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1583
01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of this was what like 17,</v>

1584
01:02:57.631 --> 01:03:01.110
<v Speaker 2>18 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see it's older by four years.</v>

1585
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 2>This country is older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By four years,</v>

1586
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.630
<v Speaker 2>country exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the full 70,</v>

1587
01:03:03.631 --> 01:03:04.464
<v Speaker 2>76.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't worth nothing I'm saying </v>

1588
01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:08.040
<v Speaker 2>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same people here,</v>

1589
01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:10.470
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of fucking campers hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years before that.</v>

1590
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Like the people that walk the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Appalachian trail.</v>

1591
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.333
<v Speaker 2>I have so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is way newer and way more </v>

1592
01:03:15.271 --> 01:03:18.230
<v Speaker 2>cancerous as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of great stuff about point</v>

1593
01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:23.290
<v Speaker 2>being there is a very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>classification of women versus men in,</v>

1594
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.890
<v Speaker 2>in Wahhabi Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1595
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:28.680
<v Speaker 2>It's the same theory behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say exactly the same woods.</v>

1596
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.753
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

1597
01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some women are,</v>

1598
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.133
<v Speaker 2>I mean like in certain circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to get at is that the </v>

1599
01:03:37.771 --> 01:03:38.604
<v Speaker 2>way women think about men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very different than the way men </v>

1600
01:03:40.321 --> 01:03:41.154
<v Speaker 2>think about women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A man does not walk to a group of women </v>

1601
01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:44.124
<v Speaker 2>and worry about being raped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A man does not walk through the streets </v>

1602
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:47.874
<v Speaker 2>at night and worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some woman's going to come out of the </v>

1603
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:49.883
<v Speaker 2>darkness and grab his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a woman doesn't walk into a </v>

1604
01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.850
<v Speaker 2>courthouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a divorce proceeding and think,</v>

1605
01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna lose everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1606
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.650
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're Roseanne and you're dating</v>

1607
01:03:58.651 --> 01:03:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Tom Arnold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1608
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's still paying that again,</v>

1609
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:03.523
<v Speaker 2>one for the team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for that one exception that </v>

1610
01:04:04.681 --> 01:04:06.450
<v Speaker 2>proves the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then 90% of the time,</v>

1611
01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:07.680
<v Speaker 2>the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not,</v>

1612
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit horrific.</v>

1613
01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:12.450
<v Speaker 2>So he told some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get some horror stories where,</v>

1614
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean the women's men's rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>activists,</v>

1615
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I know these terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm immersed in it all day,</v>

1616
01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.440
<v Speaker 2>but people aren't.</v>

1617
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:21.750
<v Speaker 2>They listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have listened to us,</v>

1618
01:04:21.751 --> 01:04:24.030
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are not getting your ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the sofa.</v>

1619
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Stop watching tv or go online and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>be immersed in that world.</v>

1620
01:04:28.411 --> 01:04:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Now go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1621
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be an,</v>

1622
01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:35.370
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be knowing that Mra </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of pounds to come here to tell</v>

1623
01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:37.680
<v Speaker 2>you what an MRI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is this thing,</v>

1624
01:04:37.681 --> 01:04:38.461
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1625
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:39.294
<v Speaker 2>this is on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say this with the greatest respect </v>

1626
01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.073
<v Speaker 2>from the more venerable generations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mine who are more used to the </v>

1627
01:04:45.391 --> 01:04:46.224
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't watch TV anymore and they </v>

1628
01:04:47.701 --> 01:04:48.960
<v Speaker 2>won't get back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1629
01:04:48.961 --> 01:04:49.794
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's dying and we've got the </v>

1630
01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:52.710
<v Speaker 2>statistics to prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done videos on it.</v>

1631
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>We've got all the stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sources in the stats.</v>

1632
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:56.520
<v Speaker 2>It's only the older generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like in Britain,</v>

1633
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.550
<v Speaker 2>all of the TV channels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>channel full was the young hip,</v>

1634
01:04:59.551 --> 01:05:03.720
<v Speaker 2>cool TV channel when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average age of the vns 44 well,</v>

1635
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.810
<v Speaker 2>once they found out that old dude had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been fucking kids for all those years,</v>

1636
01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy savile think that lost a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>

1637
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:13.770
<v Speaker 2>That's not the reason there's TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

1638
01:05:13.771 --> 01:05:15.000
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the reason.</v>

1639
01:05:15.001 --> 01:05:17.300
<v Speaker 2>The reason is it's not the real Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

1640
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1641
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to say,</v>

1642
01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 2>I've been dealing with some people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were fucking idiots.</v>

1643
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1644
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:24.250
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had to be like really,</v>

1645
01:05:24.251 --> 01:05:25.084
<v Speaker 2>really specific because they were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a group of people online who </v>

1646
01:05:27.581 --> 01:05:29.530
<v Speaker 2>know that I'm right and they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm right.</v>

1647
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:30.540
<v Speaker 2>They don't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1648
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hate that.</v>

1649
01:05:31.931 --> 01:05:32.764
<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about Anita Sarkeesian </v>

1650
01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have fun.</v>

1651
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:38.770
<v Speaker 2>They hate me and I don't want to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>them anymore ammunition.</v>

1652
01:05:38.771 --> 01:05:39.301
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1653
01:05:39.301 --> 01:05:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Bad that she's not defending herself or </v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't have the opportunity to,</v>

1654
01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.673
<v Speaker 2>she when she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she called me a piece of shit in </v>

1655
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:48.310
<v Speaker 2>the garbage human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had said nothing up until that point.</v>

1656
01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:49.720
<v Speaker 2>She yelled back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to talk.</v>

1657
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:50.650
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1658
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:51.483
<v Speaker 2>whatever dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like I came all this way </v>

1659
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.990
<v Speaker 2>to hear what you had to say and all you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do is insult me.</v>

1660
01:05:55.991 --> 01:06:00.991
<v Speaker 2>That was the rehash this Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1661
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I've been personally slighted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1662
01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.321
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1663
01:06:05.321 --> 01:06:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm being defamed all across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet now.</v>

1664
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.133
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a narrative going around the </v>

1665
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:12.100
<v Speaker 2>progressive journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those already been debunked by an actual</v>

1666
01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:16.150
<v Speaker 2>journalist called Tim Pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the video evidence of the event that</v>

1667
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I personally took that the ice storm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stage and started screaming abuse.</v>

1668
01:06:21.171 --> 01:06:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Or they're saying that they'll probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was saying that journalists and like</v>

1669
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:28.020
<v Speaker 2>the journalists like pull up of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual artwork.</v>

1670
01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Tell me an actual article that said </v>
<v Speaker 2>there probably aren't any yet,</v>

1671
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.983
<v Speaker 2>but I bet you tomorrow or going on there</v>
<v Speaker 2>articles about me and some of them will </v>

1672
01:06:35.711 --> 01:06:37.330
<v Speaker 2>say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I abused her.</v>

1673
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Pause some hobbies and pause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you not understand the irony of,</v>

1674
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:42.994
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about people labeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as victims and you are </v>

1675
01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:49.150
<v Speaker 2>labeling yourself as victim of a crime </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has not occurred.</v>

1676
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:50.103
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about articles that are </v>

1677
01:06:50.831 --> 01:06:53.800
<v Speaker 2>being written by journalists and videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are being made,</v>

1678
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 2>but they have not been made yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're saying just watch.</v>

1679
01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:58.090
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1680
01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.230
<v Speaker 2>but unless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I've been doing this red.</v>

1681
01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you not see it?</v>

1682
01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:01.943
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be able to see that a little </v>

1683
01:07:02.821 --> 01:07:06.160
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I'm not like a victim.</v>

1684
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:09.090
<v Speaker 2>This is something that happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you get that you,</v>

1685
01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:13.180
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking about right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is saying that you were stormed,</v>

1686
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:16.480
<v Speaker 2>that you stormed the stage and you tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>me journalists and I say,</v>

1687
01:07:16.481 --> 01:07:17.800
<v Speaker 2>where are these articles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

1688
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:19.510
<v Speaker 2>just wait and watch the moment.</v>

1689
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:21.490
<v Speaker 2>At the moment we're talking about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>rumors,</v>

1690
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1691
01:07:22.331 --> 01:07:24.430
<v Speaker 2>like a it tim pool said that a friend of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1692
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I think she's an actress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know it's,</v>

1693
01:07:25.921 --> 01:07:27.070
<v Speaker 2>it's the same sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1694
01:07:27.071 --> 01:07:30.190
<v Speaker 2>but that's a la circles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's someone gossiping.</v>

1695
01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that someone actually,</v>

1696
01:07:32.741 --> 01:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>a journalist wrote an article about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>half storming the staff.</v>

1697
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:37.203
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think they would social </v>

1698
01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:39.334
<v Speaker 2>media?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you even concentrate on that </v>

1699
01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:43.000
<v Speaker 2>if it has not occurred?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1700
01:07:43.001 --> 01:07:43.834
<v Speaker 2>isn't this sort of like a little black </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy complaining about the man holding </v>

1701
01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:48.100
<v Speaker 2>you back when there is no man holding </v>
<v Speaker 2>you back?</v>

1702
01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's analogous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is.</v>

1703
01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:53.920
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about being a victim of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime that hasn't occurred.</v>

1704
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I knew what these people are like up</v>

1705
01:07:56.461 --> 01:07:57.670
<v Speaker 2>in dealing with them for long enough.</v>

1706
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Now I know what those white people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1707
01:07:59.591 --> 01:08:00.424
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been dealing with them my whole </v>

1708
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:01.361
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1709
01:08:01.361 --> 01:08:03.400
<v Speaker 2>But when we actually have a precedent </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them doing this as well.</v>

1710
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're not doing it right now.</v>

1711
01:08:04.811 --> 01:08:05.644
<v Speaker 2>And you're saying they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are their own social media right </v>

1712
01:08:07.151 --> 01:08:09.280
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like you go like generalists like</v>

1713
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Ian Miles Chung who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1714
01:08:10.661 --> 01:08:11.494
<v Speaker 2>So the prevailing narrative among </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists at the moment is that song </v>

1715
01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>gone stone stage and abused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The knees suck.</v>

1716
01:08:16.221 --> 01:08:17.850
<v Speaker 2>He's in one video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evidence says the exact,</v>

1717
01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.730
<v Speaker 2>this is something that she posted </v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

1718
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he posted,</v>

1719
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.340
<v Speaker 2>there's no articles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a twitter,</v>

1720
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.713
<v Speaker 2>you can tell that it's coming up there </v>
<v Speaker 2>at gun towers and then it was brewing </v>

1721
01:08:26.991 --> 01:08:28.640
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is how these rumors start.</v>

1722
01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:29.503
<v Speaker 2>And then someone starts reporting it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then suddenly you get a narrative going </v>

1723
01:08:32.331 --> 01:08:32.540
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1724
01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.373
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a victim of this because I've </v>

1725
01:08:33.951 --> 01:08:36.180
<v Speaker 2>got a large enough reach to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say let's switch the video.</v>

1726
01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:37.143
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think people listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have no idea who the fuck I need to </v>

1727
01:08:39.171 --> 01:08:41.390
<v Speaker 2>start teasing is and don't even know who</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

01:08:41.391 --> 01:08:43.250
<v Speaker 2>They like there's a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to this.</v>

1729
01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I would like to get to more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>

1742
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 2>but it was half intellectual integrity </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the most important thing.</v>

1743
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.843
<v Speaker 2>And the great thing about this and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great thing about the way the Internet </v>

1744
01:09:21.381 --> 01:09:22.610
<v Speaker 2>works is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1745
01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.473
<v Speaker 2>look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the people who are at the top </v>

1746
01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:28.730
<v Speaker 2>look like something like Cutie Pie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man of outstanding moral character.</v>

1747
01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:30.440
<v Speaker 2>He who know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you hang with them?</v>

1748
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.333
<v Speaker 2>I've spoken to him a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't need to hang with them </v>

1749
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 2>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at what he does.</v>

1750
01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:36.560
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't go around bullying people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't go around lying about people,</v>

1751
01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:37.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't he does,</v>

1752
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:39.020
<v Speaker 2>you guys aren't doing charity and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1753
01:09:39.021 --> 01:09:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Hey Bros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1754
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:41.900
<v Speaker 2>and being nice to people and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration.</v>

1755
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:43.240
<v Speaker 2>What happened with him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>

1756
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:44.360
<v Speaker 2>would you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1757
01:09:44.361 --> 01:09:44.970
<v Speaker 2>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1758
01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:47.300
<v Speaker 2>let's go over the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1759
01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.430
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is affected me.</v>

1760
01:09:49.650 --> 01:09:54.650
<v Speaker 2>It affected a lot of youtube people </v>
<v Speaker 2>where their youtube videos used to have,</v>

1761
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:59.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much freer monetization.</v>

1762
01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.960
<v Speaker 2>Meaning that for people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if Sargon puts out a youtube video,</v>

1763
01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:06.133
<v Speaker 2>you could have ads on that youtube video</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your youtube videos get a lot of </v>

1764
01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:10.850
<v Speaker 2>downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1765
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be very lucrative for you.</v>

1766
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:13.873
<v Speaker 2>And then with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our youtube money was cut by more than </v>

1767
01:10:18.771 --> 01:10:23.771
<v Speaker 2>60% I think to retain 40% of your income</v>
<v Speaker 2>was pretty good as well.</v>

1768
01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the anything controversial,</v>

1769
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:29.893
<v Speaker 2>anything having to do with anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing is deemed not not friendly </v>

1770
01:10:35.031 --> 01:10:35.864
<v Speaker 2>for advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that has drugs in the title is </v>

1771
01:10:39.471 --> 01:10:40.304
<v Speaker 2>deemed not friendly for advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we've literally been able to </v>

1772
01:10:43.191 --> 01:10:44.024
<v Speaker 2>change the title of things and re upload</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and then they ads they that balls </v>

1773
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:49.663
<v Speaker 2>just so the same content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what all this came from is pooty pie </v>

1774
01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 2>who has an enormous youtube presence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1775
01:10:57.801 --> 01:10:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't he have like 50 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>followers?</v>

1776
01:10:59.711 --> 01:11:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1777
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he made some videos that the,</v>

1778
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:06.650
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Washington Post?</v>

1779
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Cause I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't Wall Street Journal.</v>

1780
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I tell you about it?</v>

1781
01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>

1782
01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure much did.</v>

1783
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.950
<v Speaker 2>I did a bunch of videos on this and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the funniest thing in the world.</v>

1784
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I love the language they use as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a scoop?</v>

1785
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.640
<v Speaker 2>A scoop is a news story that other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are not aware of yet.</v>

1786
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 2>And can you sign it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got it first.</v>

1787
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.130
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1788
01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:26.963
<v Speaker 2>if tens of millions of people have seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and then if I'm a Wall Street </v>

1789
01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:32.184
<v Speaker 2>journalist and I come along and I find </v>
<v Speaker 2>something with tens of millions of </v>

1790
01:11:34.231 --> 01:11:37.290
<v Speaker 2>people have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I rightly call that a scoop?</v>

1791
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:38.603
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can definitely call it a news story </v>

1792
01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.320
<v Speaker 2>and you could definitely say that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in see that.</v>

1793
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.450
<v Speaker 2>This goes back to what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about before,</v>

1794
01:11:45.451 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 2>whereas they have a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewership.</v>

1795
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:50.783
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

1796
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.860
<v Speaker 2>what is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real network?</v>

1797
01:11:52.861 --> 01:11:53.694
<v Speaker 2>What does a real newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is real journalism like in their </v>

1798
01:11:56.221 --> 01:11:57.054
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the Wall Street Journal </v>

1799
01:11:58.831 --> 01:12:03.220
<v Speaker 2>considers themselves to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy versus someone who has helped,</v>

1800
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.880
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have 55 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>downloads.</v>

1801
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:07.260
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1802
01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:08.094
<v Speaker 2>there's no way if the w if no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a street journal puts out a video </v>

1803
01:12:10.661 --> 01:12:11.640
<v Speaker 2>of a million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1804
01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:13.560
<v Speaker 2>If they put out a video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they got a vit,</v>

1805
01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.900
<v Speaker 2>a million hits on their video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a big deal.</v>

1806
01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be thrilled.</v>

1807
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.660
<v Speaker 2>If pewdie pie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how only a million hits,</v>

1808
01:12:18.661 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be super depressed.</v>

1809
01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 2>He is a much bigger entity than them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in their mind,</v>

1810
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:29.880
<v Speaker 2>like a scoop is them the legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>

1811
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 2>So pointing out something in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegitimate,</v>

1812
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.460
<v Speaker 2>this new weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city logos,</v>

1813
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically pd pie,</v>

1814
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.830
<v Speaker 2>he's a comedian and he makes jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's uh,</v>

1815
01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:42.813
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a man of good character and he's </v>

1816
01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:44.853
<v Speaker 2>parents should be thanking Pewdie Pie </v>
<v Speaker 2>for being the person he is because he's </v>

1817
01:12:47.311 --> 01:12:48.144
<v Speaker 2>talking to their kids and their kids are</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna grow up being decent people </v>

1818
01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:51.360
<v Speaker 2>because of his influence.</v>

1819
01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.790
<v Speaker 2>But the Wall Street Journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Fritz and Rolfe Winkler clan,</v>

1820
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:55.350
<v Speaker 2>there was another one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name at the moment.</v>

1821
01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:57.240
<v Speaker 2>They decided what they were going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1822
01:12:57.241 --> 01:12:59.040
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know who put them up to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

1823
01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.173
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to watch about six </v>

1824
01:13:00.721 --> 01:13:01.554
<v Speaker 2>months of his video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go through and find any antisemitic </v>

1825
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.330
<v Speaker 2>jokes that he had made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1826
01:13:06.331 --> 01:13:09.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean by definition is a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's not six months.</v>

1827
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:10.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1828
01:13:10.291 --> 01:13:11.124
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sat together a video every day and </v>

1829
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:13.343
<v Speaker 2>they got about and like two minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>footage or something with him making </v>

1830
01:13:16.201 --> 01:13:19.410
<v Speaker 2>jokes at the expense of the Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively and they were like,</v>

1831
01:13:19.411 --> 01:13:21.810
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's promoting antisemitism to see</v>

1832
01:13:21.811 --> 01:13:24.060
<v Speaker 2>those jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I've heard about them.</v>

1833
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:27.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the actual jokes that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said that they were saying,</v>

1834
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:27.931
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1835
01:13:27.931 --> 01:13:29.220
<v Speaker 2>but here's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get to it.</v>

1836
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.233
<v Speaker 2>They were saying that he is making light</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being a Nazi or pretending to be a </v>

1837
01:13:34.981 --> 01:13:35.814
<v Speaker 2>Nazi and that this is what's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was promoting antisemitism by </v>

1838
01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.453
<v Speaker 2>parodying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Nazis tried to explain to people is </v>

1839
01:13:43.321 --> 01:13:46.950
<v Speaker 2>that it's Hogan's heroes work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't a mel brooks a bit.</v>

1840
01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of an old antique Jesus Christ.</v>

1841
01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:51.930
<v Speaker 2>He must be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh God.</v>

1842
01:13:51.931 --> 01:13:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1843
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean springtime for Hitler you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>say was somehow or another humanizing.</v>

1844
01:13:57.701 --> 01:13:58.534
<v Speaker 2>I imagine it created a lot of Nazis can </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if somebody made the argument </v>

1845
01:14:03.931 --> 01:14:07.070
<v Speaker 2>that Mel Gibson created Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how far we've come.</v>

1846
01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Mel Brooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mel Brooks,</v>

1847
01:14:08.401 --> 01:14:09.270
<v Speaker 2>what'd I say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mel Gibson.</v>

1848
01:14:09.271 --> 01:14:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he my website today.</v>

1849
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.653
<v Speaker 1>That was clearly a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had only ever think about when </v>

1850
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:16.234
<v Speaker 1>someone says Mel Gibson drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of him yelling about Jews and </v>

1851
01:14:18.611 --> 01:14:21.670
<v Speaker 1>cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I a big bid.</v>

1852
01:14:21.671 --> 01:14:23.960
<v Speaker 1>And everything's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Jews.</v>

1853
01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Jesus smells the smell</v>

1854
01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:30.613
<v Speaker 2>poster boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1855
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he is.</v>

1856
01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a serious like nine 11 conspiracies</v>

1857
01:14:34.691 --> 01:14:37.030
<v Speaker 2>the lever and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's that Charlie Sheen,</v>

1858
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably lumping them together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got my pain.</v>

1859
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.081
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1860
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:41.950
<v Speaker 2>these videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1861
01:14:41.951 --> 01:14:44.560
<v Speaker 2>one of them was the funniest thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were taking,</v>

1862
01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.513
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1863
01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:46.690
<v Speaker 2>the jokes were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1864
01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:50.020
<v Speaker 2>like I'm there like 20 seconds of joke </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken out like a 10 minute video,</v>

1865
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:51.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's just,</v>

1866
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:54.960
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a cutaway skipped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1867
01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:55.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wah Wah Wah.</v>

1868
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:56.913
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1869
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.943
<v Speaker 2>one of them was a joke about how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>media takes his jokes out of context to </v>

1870
01:15:03.731 --> 01:15:04.564
<v Speaker 2>try and frame him as something new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they cut that out of context and </v>

1871
01:15:08.261 --> 01:15:09.790
<v Speaker 2>used it and it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1872
01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:11.200
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is amazing.</v>

1873
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:12.063
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that they had the balls to </v>

1874
01:15:14.141 --> 01:15:14.974
<v Speaker 2>do it and they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would not only proud of what they </v>

1875
01:15:15.971 --> 01:15:16.540
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1876
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:20.140
<v Speaker 2>They called it a scoop and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>went to advertisers and said,</v>

1877
01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:20.974
<v Speaker 2>look at this hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do they get away with doing </v>

1878
01:15:23.891 --> 01:15:25.420
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did they go and collect them too?</v>

1879
01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:28.930
<v Speaker 2>How come no one from the Wall Street </v>
<v Speaker 2>Journal sat them down and said,</v>

1880
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:29.764
<v Speaker 2>well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is definitely not him saying that </v>

1881
01:15:32.891 --> 01:15:35.380
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take something out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>context and then doing it.</v>

1882
01:15:35.381 --> 01:15:36.214
<v Speaker 2>Is it because of it is and then you took</v>
<v Speaker 2>it out of context and did exactly what </v>

1883
01:15:38.831 --> 01:15:42.100
<v Speaker 2>he's saying you shouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of crazy.</v>

1884
01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:43.960
<v Speaker 2>It's mental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is mental.</v>

1885
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.863
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they feel like they can get away </v>

1886
01:15:46.391 --> 01:15:47.224
<v Speaker 2>with it because they're in the hallowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>halls of actual media and they're </v>

1887
01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:51.370
<v Speaker 2>putting this stuff out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jvc,</v>

1888
01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.990
<v Speaker 2>do you define it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what,</v>

1889
01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:54.853
<v Speaker 2>see what you can be the terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial jokes that pooty pie said </v>

1890
01:15:57.670 --> 01:15:58.503
<v Speaker 2>there were supposedly the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing though is that if you </v>

1891
01:16:00.731 --> 01:16:02.350
<v Speaker 2>look at their numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look like that.</v>

1892
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:04.630
<v Speaker 2>The Wall Street Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at his numbers,</v>

1893
01:16:04.631 --> 01:16:06.160
<v Speaker 2>they look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's so strange,</v>

1894
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.850
<v Speaker 2>he's making hand gestures down for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street Journal up for Pooty Pie.</v>

1895
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:11.163
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's so strange about it though is </v>

1896
01:16:12.341 --> 01:16:14.590
<v Speaker 2>that Peter Pie isn't that competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1897
01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:15.730
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

1898
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's let some of them.</v>

1899
01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what we got here.</v>

1900
01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:22.480
<v Speaker 2>My name is Pia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1901
01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Dan,</v>

1902
01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:25.720
<v Speaker 2>27 year old</v>

1903
01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.750
<v Speaker 1>playing video games on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Typical nuts.</v>

1904
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:37.700
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>53 million subscriber.</v>

1905
01:16:37.701 --> 01:16:41.740
<v Speaker 4>You still 55 now Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The biggest star in the site by far.</v>

1906
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:43.540
<v Speaker 4>If you go inside the stories,</v>

1907
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:45.993
<v Speaker 2>scoop is better.</v>

1908
01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's get into the latest scoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's him.</v>

1909
01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:56.400
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the one recently.</v>

1910
01:16:56.401 --> 01:16:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Some of his videos are brief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Nazi messages,</v>

1911
01:16:58.921 --> 01:17:02.520
<v Speaker 1>images of Edof Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and explicit antisemitic commentary.</v>

1912
01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.450
<v Speaker 4>So this is the Washington Post's </v>
<v Speaker 4>version.</v>

1913
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.580
<v Speaker 4>It will follow the Wall Street turned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or rather sorry,</v>

1914
01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 4>following a request for from the Wall </v>
<v Speaker 4>Street Journal.</v>

1915
01:17:09.981 --> 01:17:10.814
<v Speaker 4>Disney said the videos are inappropriate</v>
<v Speaker 4>and cut ties to Pewdiepie who ran his </v>

1916
01:17:13.701 --> 01:17:14.534
<v Speaker 4>business cost of millions of dollars of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Disney subsidiary maker studios cost </v>

1917
01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:21.470
<v Speaker 4>pooty pie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>millions in a January 11th video,</v>

1918
01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Mr Blah Blah Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feature two men holding,</v>

1919
01:17:24.021 --> 01:17:28.000
<v Speaker 4>assigned reading death to all Jews after</v>
<v Speaker 4>hiring them from a freelance</v>

1920
01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:31.150
<v Speaker 5>website.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked the editing.</v>

1921
01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 2>So the joke is his reaction to it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you could subscribe to Kim</v>

1922
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Star who's like another big youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was mocking it.</v>

1923
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:44.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they would actually do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel partially responsible,</v>

1924
01:17:44.671 --> 01:17:49.671
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't think they would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might just be my sense of crude,</v>

1925
01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:50.874
<v Speaker 5>sense of humor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's something funny </v>

1926
01:17:52.441 --> 01:17:53.274
<v Speaker 5>about that and I don't fire back in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>media for miss characterizing him about </v>

1927
01:17:57.241 --> 01:17:57.840
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1928
01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.673
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 5>joke and actual like fucking death to </v>

1929
01:18:02.821 --> 01:18:05.010
<v Speaker 5>all Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I made a video saying,</v>

1930
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:06.150
<v Speaker 5>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1931
01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:09.240
<v Speaker 5>Peter Piot here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>death to all Jews,</v>

1932
01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:14.310
<v Speaker 5>I want you to say after me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>death to all Jews.</v>

1933
01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:15.900
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1934
01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:20.610
<v Speaker 5>Hitler was right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really opened my eyes to why power.</v>

1935
01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:24.000
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's time that we did </v>
<v Speaker 5>something about it.</v>

1936
01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:25.163
<v Speaker 5>That's essentially how they're reporting</v>
<v Speaker 5>this as if that's what I was saying or </v>

1937
01:18:27.841 --> 01:18:28.800
<v Speaker 5>some shit like that.</v>

1938
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:32.310
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how popular it is with such</v>
<v Speaker 4>a shitty grasp of English.</v>

1939
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:33.623
<v Speaker 4>He's Swedish apologists can camouflage </v>
<v Speaker 4>messages that may still be received and </v>

1940
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:40.140
<v Speaker 4>celebrated by hate groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The southern poverty law center says,</v>

1941
01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:41.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if,</v>

1942
01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.070
<v Speaker 2>if the southern poverty law center </v>
<v Speaker 2>condemns you,</v>

1943
01:18:44.071 --> 01:18:45.720
<v Speaker 2>it's becoming a bit of a badge of honor </v>
<v Speaker 2>these days.</v>

1944
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:46.583
<v Speaker 2>In the video since removed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he posted a video of a man dressed as </v>

1945
01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.033
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love how they have like since removed </v>

1946
01:18:51.901 --> 01:18:55.080
<v Speaker 2>is bold and then Jesus Christ is both </v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice guys.</v>

1947
01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:56.240
<v Speaker 2>The Jesus guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:18:56.490 --> 01:19:00.540
<v Speaker 6>What the F I want it to act upon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God's will.</v>

1949
01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:05.250
<v Speaker 6>Don't worry though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He stands beside God now he isn't.</v>

1950
01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.700
<v Speaker 6>That's all folks Jesus out.</v>

1951
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.140
<v Speaker 5>And I wasn't the one who made him say it</v>
<v Speaker 5>or was it?</v>

1952
01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:13.250
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't.</v>

1953
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:14.083
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He set up a go fund me page and his own </v>

1954
01:19:17.151 --> 01:19:20.960
<v Speaker 5>website so you can take orders from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus himself.</v>

1955
01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:23.450
<v Speaker 5>And also can I just point out</v>

1956
01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.040
<v Speaker 2>this is not what I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

1957
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:30.820
<v Speaker 2>where are the actual videos of him doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the Nazi shit?</v>

1958
01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:33.160
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 100% it.</v>

1959
01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:34.023
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there an article that led to all of </v>

1960
01:19:35.801 --> 01:19:37.150
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1961
01:19:37.151 --> 01:19:37.984
<v Speaker 2>but what we're looking at here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the Wall Street Journal's </v>

1962
01:19:40.031 --> 01:19:40.940
<v Speaker 2>version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

1964
01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:42.933
<v Speaker 2>these are the clips and they said this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the actual clips that they're saying </v>

1965
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:47.050
<v Speaker 2>are the thing that shows him to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitic.</v>

1966
01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The W I thought it was way better than,</v>

1967
01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:55.060
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just a little theo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got made off fiverr.</v>

1968
01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:56.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just him prancing around on the </v>

1969
01:19:57.491 --> 01:19:58.061
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1970
01:19:58.061 --> 01:20:00.610
<v Speaker 2>it's just silly childish jokes and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>all who see?</v>

1971
01:20:00.611 --> 01:20:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many Nazis do you think this </v>
<v Speaker 2>made?</v>

1972
01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1973
01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.460
<v Speaker 2>That's how I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think three is too high.</v>

1974
01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Just stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't,</v>

1975
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take a lot to like turn them.</v>

1976
01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:15.450
<v Speaker 2>There was the really bad thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this though is the fact that they didn't</v>

1977
01:20:15.451 --> 01:20:16.284
<v Speaker 2>put this article out until they had like</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken these clips and dobbed him in to </v>

1978
01:20:20.051 --> 01:20:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Disney and Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disney obviously new shit.</v>

1979
01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:24.840
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a shit storm about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1980
01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:28.440
<v Speaker 2>So they tried to do this political </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack,</v>

1981
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it making money?</v>

1982
01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Losing money is politics or not that </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics as well.</v>

1983
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:34.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He mocks like,</v>

1984
01:20:34.890 --> 01:20:36.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he mocks feminism,</v>

1985
01:20:36.011 --> 01:20:37.650
<v Speaker 2>you know smocks social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>

1986
01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a liberal.</v>

1987
01:20:38.911 --> 01:20:41.010
<v Speaker 2>He's not a progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference.</v>

1988
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Why would they think that they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>just do that though?</v>

1989
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Because they've got the power to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1990
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.950
<v Speaker 2>No one can stop it and you couldn't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1991
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cost him millions of dollars.</v>

1992
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:48.413
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's now costing them their </v>

1993
01:20:50.941 --> 01:20:52.260
<v Speaker 2>reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm [inaudible].</v>

1994
01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't just do that.</v>

1995
01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Like Eric Street journals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1996
01:20:56.790 --> 01:21:00.150
<v Speaker 2>they took a big hit from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that unbelievably arrogant.</v>

1997
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Well actually do you know it was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

1998
01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:03.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a off after all of this shit,</v>

1999
01:21:03.831 --> 01:21:04.664
<v Speaker 2>so blue over there was a bunch of polls </v>
<v Speaker 2>done of like 13 to 18 year olds and it </v>

2000
01:21:08.101 --> 01:21:12.090
<v Speaker 2>was really fascinating how you had like </v>
<v Speaker 2>favorability and what,</v>

2001
01:21:12.091 --> 01:21:15.330
<v Speaker 2>how well known things where and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube was really well known,</v>

2002
01:21:15.331 --> 01:21:16.164
<v Speaker 2>really favorable with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know and then you had the Wall </v>

2003
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Street Journal which was really well </v>
<v Speaker 2>known but really unfavorable with kids.</v>

2004
01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:23.513
<v Speaker 2>How do the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the kids know what the Wall Street </v>

2005
01:21:24.241 --> 01:21:25.074
<v Speaker 2>journalist because of Cutie Pie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now their strings with the Wall </v>

2006
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.153
<v Speaker 2>Street Journal in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the millions of people that are his </v>

2007
01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:31.080
<v Speaker 2>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2008
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a big mistake to a guy with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a platform like that.</v>

2009
01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.980
<v Speaker 2>It's of this time when their voters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2010
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:39.930
<v Speaker 2>their reading you consuming news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Wall Street Journal will continue to</v>

2011
01:21:39.931 --> 01:21:40.430
<v Speaker 2>be there.</v>

2012
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:43.320
<v Speaker 2>They'll continue to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beauty pounds still be doing well.</v>

2013
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:44.243
<v Speaker 2>But what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's crazy is I never thought of the </v>

2014
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:47.183
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street Journal is that what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought of the Wall Street Journal as </v>

2015
01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:52.530
<v Speaker 2>being like informative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective information about my business.</v>

2016
01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 2>When if you asked me like what is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street Journal?</v>

2017
01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:58.660
<v Speaker 2>That's how I've always thought of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to see the,</v>

2018
01:21:58.661 --> 01:22:00.960
<v Speaker 2>see this video pretty shocking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2019
01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Well it is disturbing because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing there.</v>

2020
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:05.760
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make the death to all Jews thing.</v>

2021
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:06.594
<v Speaker 2>The fact that city did he pay those guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold up that sign I $5 to write on </v>

2022
01:22:10.931 --> 01:22:14.020
<v Speaker 2>the side so he could go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh cause you know it kisses taboo.</v>

2023
01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just breaking it to be.</v>

2024
01:22:15.501 --> 01:22:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2025
01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:19.200
<v Speaker 2>If nobody had said anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing would come.</v>

2026
01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:21.390
<v Speaker 2>It's in poor taste and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>representing Disney,</v>

2027
01:22:21.391 --> 01:22:23.480
<v Speaker 2>you can't fuck with that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all that is.</v>

2028
01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.950
<v Speaker 2>That he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been,</v>

2029
01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

2030
01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.750
<v Speaker 2>my point is I'm defending I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not evidence of antisemitism.</v>

2031
01:22:28.751 --> 01:22:29.071
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2032
01:22:29.071 --> 01:22:29.904
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just saying something fucked up </v>

2033
01:22:30.661 --> 01:22:32.550
<v Speaker 2>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to be shocking.</v>

2034
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just think that Hitler stuff like </v>

2035
01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:35.574
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing there and that's so </v>

2036
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:38.093
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the stupidest thing in the </v>

2037
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:39.541
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2038
01:22:39.541 --> 01:22:41.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the thing where I look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Keck stony flag.</v>

2039
01:22:41.881 --> 01:22:45.450
<v Speaker 2>What I love about this is it's a parody </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Nazi flag,</v>

2040
01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:46.800
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of a swastika.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's in there.</v>

2042

<v Speaker 2>But is it a k in there?</v>

2043

<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

2046
01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.753
<v Speaker 2>I can't say when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have to explain any of this to </v>

2047
01:22:57.841 --> 01:22:58.674
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a stupid thing in works </v>

2048
01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.373
<v Speaker 2>is Internet humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love planting that you would dream </v>

2049
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:02.250

<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2052
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:07.830

<v Speaker 2>exact.</v>

2053
01:23:07.831 --> 01:23:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2054
01:23:08.731 --> 01:23:10.390

<v Speaker 2>somebody put up about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2059
01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:19.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a you and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2060
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Milo and a bunch of other people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a red pill and it says,</v>

2061
01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.053
<v Speaker 2>get in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normies we're going to save </v>

2062
01:23:26.531 --> 01:23:30.520
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's gotta do it like Watts.</v>

2063
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck thinks that?</v>

2064
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:35.620
<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anyone takes that seriously,</v>

2065
01:23:35.621 --> 01:23:36.940
<v Speaker 2>they're a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2066
01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:38.600
<v Speaker 2>That's basic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the,</v>

2067
01:23:38.601 --> 01:23:39.341
<v Speaker 2>that's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2068
01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:41.380
<v Speaker 2>It's about people who can't laugh at </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2069
01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:44.250
<v Speaker 2>If you can't laugh at yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we must appointment.</v>

2070
01:23:44.251 --> 01:23:46.360
<v Speaker 2>But there's also so many layers to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2071
01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:48.280
<v Speaker 2>You have to be paying attention to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

2072
01:23:48.281 --> 01:23:49.114
<v Speaker 2>Like you to be able to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even I have to ask you questions </v>

2073
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:51.791
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2074
01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>

2075
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2076
01:23:55.391 --> 01:23:58.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a complex subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the idea of this,</v>

2077
01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:59.103
<v Speaker 2>the thing like the southern poverty law </v>
<v Speaker 2>center of course came out and condemned </v>

2078
01:24:01.211 --> 01:24:02.044
<v Speaker 2>Keck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stan,</v>

2079
01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:04.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're fucking idea.</v>

2080
01:24:04.261 --> 01:24:05.860
<v Speaker 2>But it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I exactly,</v>

2081
01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I just check a stance supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

2082
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:09.340
<v Speaker 2>is that supposed to be all right though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is no,</v>

2083
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.671
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2084
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:11.230
<v Speaker 2>of course it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>

2085
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:12.363
<v Speaker 2>it's an identity for people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want an identity because I'm not an </v>

2086
01:24:15.191 --> 01:24:17.270
<v Speaker 2>identitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say it's very non binary.</v>

2087
01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like Latinex kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2088
01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's none of,</v>

2089
01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:20.793
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2090
01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:25.180
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound like when they say I'm a Latin X,</v>

2091
01:24:25.181 --> 01:24:26.014
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2092
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.680
<v Speaker 2>let me talk to you about my work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blackness and stuff like that.</v>

2093
01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:31.650
<v Speaker 2>A while to be a woke black person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can be a is donny was,</v>

2094
01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 2>that's why this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you about my work.</v>

2095
01:24:33.611 --> 01:24:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Blackness is one of the coolest things </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could ever say,</v>

2096
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:36.790
<v Speaker 2>but that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is though.</v>

2097
01:24:36.791 --> 01:24:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Cause when someone comes to you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their identity,</v>

2098
01:24:38.151 --> 01:24:38.984
<v Speaker 2>is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this isn't a conversation I want to </v>

2099
01:24:39.971 --> 01:24:40.804
<v Speaker 2>have with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not politics as usual and it's </v>

2100
01:24:42.491 --> 01:24:43.324
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't have an ethnicity or like </v>

2101
01:24:44.381 --> 01:24:45.000
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2102
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an identity,</v>

2103
01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't play identity politics.</v>

2104
01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.753
<v Speaker 2>They played entity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keka Stan is a parody of identity </v>

2105
01:24:51.371 --> 01:24:53.730
<v Speaker 2>politics and every identity politician </v>
<v Speaker 2>hates it.</v>

2106
01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Everyone who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone who gets into bed with identity</v>

2107
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:57.370
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2108
01:24:57.370 --> 01:25:00.640
<v Speaker 2>One of my blackness or Latina or white </v>
<v Speaker 2>whiteness or my Jewishness,</v>

2109
01:25:00.641 --> 01:25:01.990
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2110
01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.840
<v Speaker 2>what am I Keka stylishness you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're just like,</v>

2111
01:25:04.841 --> 01:25:05.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>

2112
01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.130
<v Speaker 2>That's not real well done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You finally got it right.</v>

2113
01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit about your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

2114
01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:14.350
<v Speaker 2>You don't give a shit about mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about the issues,</v>

2115
01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.270
<v Speaker 2>the issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot,</v>

2116
01:25:16.271 --> 01:25:17.104
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot.</v>

2117
01:25:17.650 --> 01:25:18.560
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2118
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:20.770
<v Speaker 2>where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does he stand now?</v>

2119
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he lost this Disney deal.</v>

2120
01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:23.643
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Wall Street Journal or the </v>

2121
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:25.573
<v Speaker 2>finalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how many people were actually aware </v>

2122
01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:31.570
<v Speaker 2>of the real content?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you actually did,</v>

2123
01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.513
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is how many people are </v>

2124
01:25:33.311 --> 01:25:36.460
<v Speaker 2>aware of versus the magazine Article?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2125
01:25:36.461 --> 01:25:37.294
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about the type of people who are </v>

2126
01:25:37.991 --> 01:25:39.370
<v Speaker 2>aware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I wasn't aware,</v>

2127
01:25:39.371 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 2>of course I knew who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd heard his name.</v>

2128
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:43.083
<v Speaker 2>And when I heard the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard a bunch of different </v>

2129
01:25:45.731 --> 01:25:46.564
<v Speaker 2>accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to sift between the two and the </v>

2130
01:25:48.641 --> 01:25:53.110
<v Speaker 2>middle seem to be that he was doing like</v>
<v Speaker 2>typical internet stuff being silly,</v>

2131
01:25:53.111 --> 01:25:55.100
<v Speaker 2>but none of it was really antisemitic </v>
<v Speaker 2>close.</v>

2132
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:57.910
<v Speaker 2>But that's even milder than what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it was.</v>

2133
01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.073
<v Speaker 2>These that's insanely milder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're using the clips </v>

2134
01:26:02.321 --> 01:26:05.480
<v Speaker 2>of him saying if I was taken out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

2135
01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2136
01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:07.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely pathetic.</v>

2137
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's obviously the,</v>

2138
01:26:09.771 --> 01:26:11.540
<v Speaker 2>the audience of the Wall Street Journal </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

2139
01:26:11.610 --> 01:26:14.720
<v Speaker 2>the elites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intelligentsia smarts,</v>

2140
01:26:14.730 --> 01:26:15.563
<v Speaker 2>rich people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that don't have a good Internet </v>

2141
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2142
01:26:18.081 --> 01:26:18.914
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now that we've got the best </v>

2143
01:26:21.321 --> 01:26:22.154
<v Speaker 2>internet connections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not going to live very long </v>

2144
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:26.660
<v Speaker 2>because they're old PD pause audience is</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up.</v>

2145
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:29.300
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be the ones who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially taking over the world.</v>

2146
01:26:29.301 --> 01:26:30.134
<v Speaker 2>And pewdie pie is the one who's showing </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that look at the things these </v>

2147
01:26:32.601 --> 01:26:35.090
<v Speaker 2>people are saying they're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2148
01:26:35.091 --> 01:26:36.770
<v Speaker 2>because they're attacking me and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know me,</v>

2149
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2150
01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:41.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't trust these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are going to come after you.</v>

2151
01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.430
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can go off to Pewdie Pie,</v>

2152
01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:47.180
<v Speaker 2>the biggest youtuber in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can go off to anyone.</v>

2153
01:26:47.630 --> 01:26:52.340
<v Speaker 2>But it's really dangerous to frame </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that way because it's dishonest.</v>

2154
01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:53.413
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you do something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you make a dishonest </v>

2155
01:26:55.851 --> 01:26:56.684
<v Speaker 2>representation of this guy of pooty pie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately every other thing that you </v>

2156
01:27:00.711 --> 01:27:01.760
<v Speaker 2>print,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go,</v>

2157
01:27:01.761 --> 01:27:02.594
<v Speaker 2>well suspect guys already made that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about Pootie by and that was </v>

2158
01:27:04.821 --> 01:27:05.654
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do you add it to a lot of work to </v>

2159
01:27:07.581 --> 01:27:11.330
<v Speaker 2>make that like to to cherry pick that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hard.</v>

2160
01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:12.253
<v Speaker 2>Oh they went through six months of video</v>
<v Speaker 2>and got like two minutes of footage and </v>

2161
01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:16.190
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he does a video everyday.</v>

2162
01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:17.563
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I mean you saw the quality of the </v>

2163
01:27:18.531 --> 01:27:19.520
<v Speaker 2>visual craft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2164
01:27:19.630 --> 01:27:20.463
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was funded that the Wall Street Journal </v>

2165
01:27:22.221 --> 01:27:24.680
<v Speaker 2>funded that like that had to cost a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of money.</v>

2166
01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well similar,</v>

2167
01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:29.450
<v Speaker 2>you're paying these guys by the hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working on that to what,</v>

2168
01:27:29.451 --> 01:27:30.284
<v Speaker 2>what's your bunch of youtube videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe millions of people have already </v>

2169
01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:32.774
<v Speaker 2>watched and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at the scope we've got and try </v>

2170
01:27:34.221 --> 01:27:38.670
<v Speaker 2>to find one or two Jewish jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

2171

2174
01:27:45.471 --> 01:27:47.000
<v Speaker 2>male privilege so you can't do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2175
01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:48.473
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you have to recognize your </v>

2176
01:27:49.941 --> 01:27:51.740
<v Speaker 2>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suture important.</v>

2177
01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Check your privilege at the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2178
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:54.743
<v Speaker 2>it's a wonderful way for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control your original sin to tell you </v>

2179
01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.630
<v Speaker 2>yes it is a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

2180
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.733
<v Speaker 2>These people are creating a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>priesthood that if you look at the </v>

2181
01:28:02.721 --> 01:28:03.554
<v Speaker 2>diversity officers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like in Britain and the BBC is </v>

2182
01:28:05.301 --> 01:28:06.134
<v Speaker 2>the prime example they've started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they actually have job positions </v>

2183
01:28:08.901 --> 01:28:09.734
<v Speaker 2>where they hire on the basis of race and</v>
<v Speaker 2>against people on the basis of race for </v>

2184
01:28:13.051 --> 01:28:13.280
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

2185
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Not even for like if it was like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of the camera,</v>

2186
01:28:15.501 --> 01:28:16.334
<v Speaker 2>I can understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2187
01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't like the,</v>

2188
01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.330
<v Speaker 2>we need more black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need more brown people,</v>

2189
01:28:20.331 --> 01:28:22.310
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I could at least go,</v>

2190
01:28:22.311 --> 01:28:25.310
<v Speaker 2>well I mean like you were saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good to have examples.</v>

2191
01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

2192
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I can accept that I don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not the,</v>

2193
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:28.623
<v Speaker 2>not because I don't want see Brown </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because it's discriminatory on </v>

2194
01:28:30.921 --> 01:28:31.754
<v Speaker 2>the basis of race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I can at least accept it for a good </v>

2195
01:28:33.231 --> 01:28:36.200
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for this,</v>

2196
01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.500
<v Speaker 2>it's just a research position behind the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenes.</v>

2197
01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.970
<v Speaker 2>18 grand a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2198
01:28:40.971 --> 01:28:41.804
<v Speaker 2>making nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all you're doing is typing into </v>

2199
01:28:43.131 --> 01:28:44.420
<v Speaker 2>google and finding things and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2200
01:28:44.421 --> 01:28:45.254
<v Speaker 2>white people can't apply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have to fund that with my TV </v>

2201
01:28:48.501 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 2>license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that white people can apply.</v>

2202
01:28:51.171 --> 01:28:52.004
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No whites allowed so racist and they're </v>

2203
01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:55.940
<v Speaker 2>wondering why the outrights are doing so</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2204
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why so many people just like,</v>

2205
01:28:57.501 --> 01:28:58.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get fucked.</v>

2206
01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that you could say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like your melon content is</v>

2207
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.440
<v Speaker 1>going to prohibit you from getting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

2208
01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:05.933
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you paid attention to the </v>

2209
01:29:06.691 --> 01:29:09.450
<v Speaker 1>evergreen state college fiasco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein.</v>

2210
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Did you listen to Brett when he was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast?</v>

2211
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.280
<v Speaker 1>From that time I've been busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He analysts,</v>

2212
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>he's a very shockingly progressive map </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2213
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:17.223
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a super liberal and essentially </v>

2214
01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:22.740
<v Speaker 1>really Nepalese can all you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a really nice guy and yeah,</v>

2215
01:29:22.741 --> 01:29:25.380
<v Speaker 1>he seemed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seemed to and the poor guys in hiding</v>

2216
01:29:25.381 --> 01:29:26.890
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2217
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:27.900
<v Speaker 1>he's in hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is,</v>

2218
01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:31.200
<v Speaker 1>he like literally he had to remove his </v>
<v Speaker 1>family from,</v>

2219
01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:33.240
<v Speaker 1>from there and kind of put them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding.</v>

2220
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:36.950
<v Speaker 1>He um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the schools essentially almost shut</v>

2221
01:29:36.951 --> 01:29:37.531
<v Speaker 1>down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2222
01:29:37.531 --> 01:29:38.364
<v Speaker 1>they took over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thing is chaos and now </v>

2223
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:41.514
<v Speaker 1>they're voting to remove funding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into a private school because </v>

2224
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.370
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are out of your mind.</v>

2225
01:29:47.371 --> 01:29:48.210
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>

2226
01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 1>that's type of tax dollars.</v>

2227
01:29:50.210 --> 01:29:51.043
<v Speaker 1>But they told him that he should stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>home because they wanted a day of </v>

2228
01:29:54.421 --> 01:29:56.940
<v Speaker 1>absence where white people were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to go to work.</v>

2229
01:29:56.941 --> 01:29:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

2230
01:29:58.650 --> 01:30:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That not only that,</v>

2231
01:30:00.331 --> 01:30:02.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

2232
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.113
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your race without the woman at one of </v>

2233
01:30:05.551 --> 01:30:08.580
<v Speaker 1>the women who was responsible for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>called his wife are racist.</v>

2234
01:30:08.581 --> 01:30:11.760
<v Speaker 1>And without saying that white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he called,</v>

2235
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:12.623
<v Speaker 1>she called for it on a facebook post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She called for white women to take this </v>

2236
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:18.990
<v Speaker 1>racist white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take her rice,</v>

2237
01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:19.853
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist white ass out or something like </v>

2238
01:30:21.181 --> 01:30:23.250
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then think about this old hall or out,</v>

2239
01:30:23.290 --> 01:30:24.123
<v Speaker 1>maybe calling out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about all of this really </v>

2240
01:30:25.771 --> 01:30:27.270
<v Speaker 1>dangerous because at some point white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

2241
01:30:27.271 --> 01:30:28.104
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2242
01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:30.810
<v Speaker 1>but she's calling her white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's calling her a racist white.</v>

2243
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:32.103
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just because someone doesn't agree </v>

2244
01:30:33.181 --> 01:30:37.170
<v Speaker 1>with you on something that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist doesn't mean they're racist.</v>

2245
01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:38.003
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's dangerous to do this because I </v>

2246
01:30:40.081 --> 01:30:40.914
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to use this as a weapon </v>

2247
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:43.170
<v Speaker 1>against the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2248
01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:44.580
<v Speaker 1>this is an attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:46.680
<v Speaker 1>He's refusing to cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're attacking him.</v>

2250
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a control.</v>

2251
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:48.623
<v Speaker 1>It's without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about control because this is 100% </v>

2252
01:30:50.581 --> 01:30:52.790
<v Speaker 1>about people trying to control other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's political,</v>

2253
01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:54.063
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a political attack and if </v>

2254
01:30:55.591 --> 01:30:56.424
<v Speaker 1>you're going right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be a racist d at some </v>

2255
01:30:58.081 --> 01:31:00.360
<v Speaker 1>point the white people just going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm racist.</v>

2256
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:01.223
<v Speaker 1>Did you see where they had the president</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking to him and the </v>

2257
01:31:03.781 --> 01:31:04.614
<v Speaker 1>president was addressing these students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were being fucking completely </v>

2258
01:31:06.901 --> 01:31:07.734
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they told him to put his hands down </v>

2259
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:11.910
<v Speaker 1>because his hands were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>microaggression.</v>

2260
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.863
<v Speaker 1>And then a kid stood up next to him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a threatening manner and told him </v>

2261
01:31:16.251 --> 01:31:18.120
<v Speaker 1>to put his hands down and he put his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands down.</v>

2262
01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:20.100
<v Speaker 1>They started laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started laughing.</v>

2263
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:23.460
<v Speaker 1>It's clearly game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're playing ping pong.</v>

2264
01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:25.950
<v Speaker 1>They're playing checkers and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullied him knowing him.</v>

2265
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:27.480
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that,</v>

2266
01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:30.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not just bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like them grouping up.</v>

2267
01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:31.553
<v Speaker 1>It's theresa toward each other and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>he feels or he was saying that he </v>

2268
01:31:34.951 --> 01:31:38.520
<v Speaker 1>believes it's like a mass psychosis that</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>

2269
01:31:38.521 --> 01:31:39.354
<v Speaker 1>it's like a mass hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people losing their minds in </v>

2270
01:31:42.241 --> 01:31:43.090
<v Speaker 1>this large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing the,</v>

2271
01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:45.960
<v Speaker 1>amongst all that being given undue power</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't deserve.</v>

2272
01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.113
<v Speaker 1>They have an end all of this pile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing something with that </v>

2273
01:31:48.601 --> 01:31:49.920
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they gave you that power,</v>

2274
01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:53.010
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is some sort of a psychosis.</v>

2275
01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

2276
01:31:54.650 --> 01:31:55.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2277
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:58.470
<v Speaker 1>they're not being held to an account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right then I'll be told,</v>

2278
01:31:58.770 --> 01:31:59.220
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2279
01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 1>when you earn power,</v>

2280
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:02.350
<v Speaker 2>you Germany happiness a karate kid,</v>

2282
01:32:03.391 --> 01:32:04.690

<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

2283
01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:08.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's what a good leader is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are just being given power.</v>

2284
01:32:08.651 --> 01:32:11.110
<v Speaker 2>They haven't earned it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been given it and they are being</v>

2285
01:32:11.111 --> 01:32:13.720
<v Speaker 2>told they can't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they think,</v>

2286
01:32:13.721 --> 01:32:15.520
<v Speaker 2>well fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do whatever the fuck I like them.</v>

2287
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:16.383
<v Speaker 2>They're also told that like you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>always step up and talk about your </v>

2288
01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:22.300
<v Speaker 2>blackness or whatever and everyone has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of shut the fuck up.</v>

2289
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have like there's these carp launch.</v>

2290
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's these subjects that you can sort</v>

2291
01:32:29.381 --> 01:32:32.320
<v Speaker 2>of do like intersect or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or um,</v>

2292
01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inject your,</v>

2293
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:34.623
<v Speaker 2>your race into or your gender or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that you're trans or the fact that </v>

2294
01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:38.873
<v Speaker 2>your allies and marginalized in any way </v>
<v Speaker 2>Latino and you can kind of shut down </v>

2295
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:43.660
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

2296
01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:44.493
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of the things that you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>when this president is addressing the </v>

2297
01:32:47.471 --> 01:32:49.360
<v Speaker 2>students and the students step up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're asking,</v>

2298
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:52.120
<v Speaker 2>there's this long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a hostage negotiator.</v>

2299
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:55.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get up and they start talking about</v>

2300
01:32:55.571 --> 01:32:59.920
<v Speaker 2>their own individual identity and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>told you about the color of my skin.</v>

2301
01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.330
<v Speaker 2>That's not my business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever it is,</v>

2302
01:33:01.331 --> 01:33:02.164
<v Speaker 2>the my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I have a vagina and the </v>

2303
01:33:03.251 --> 01:33:04.084
<v Speaker 2>fact that I would like to hear about my </v>
<v Speaker 2>exams and it's that my wife's going to </v>

2304
01:33:07.121 --> 01:33:09.850
<v Speaker 2>complain to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes the thing,</v>

2305
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:10.713
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes the thing that you're </v>

2306
01:33:11.261 --> 01:33:14.230
<v Speaker 2>discussing rather than whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual thing you're discussing is.</v>

2307
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:17.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem of identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a form of politics.</v>

2308
01:33:17.711 --> 01:33:20.620
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's designed to grind to the dialog,</v>

2309
01:33:20.621 --> 01:33:21.454
<v Speaker 2>to a halt and to give the person making </v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument control of everyone else </v>

2310
01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:25.630
<v Speaker 2>around them.</v>

2311
01:33:25.630 --> 01:33:28.390
<v Speaker 2>That's where it unjustly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person hasn't earned this.</v>

2312
01:33:28.391 --> 01:33:29.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it is,</v>

2313
01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:30.004
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have a total control of </v>

2314
01:33:32.231 --> 01:33:33.064
<v Speaker 2>the conversation now and you have set </v>
<v Speaker 2>like these very clear parameters and </v>

2315
01:33:37.331 --> 01:33:39.710
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that sensor.</v>

2316
01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:41.800
<v Speaker 2>It is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not healthy.</v>

2317
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:46.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just bizarre that that would fly in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a university setting and have his lattus</v>

2318
01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.170
<v Speaker 2>or agrees with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2319
01:33:48.190 --> 01:33:49.510
<v Speaker 2>the Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>

2320
01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:53.020
<v Speaker 2>but also they don't want to lose their </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs and students coming in,</v>

2321
01:33:53.021 --> 01:33:53.854
<v Speaker 2>you know they're going to change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world or they'll click a mob that look </v>

2322
01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:00.250
<v Speaker 2>an enemy faction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Ami within these things.</v>

2323
01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:01.031
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2324
01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:03.520
<v Speaker 2>this is the reason that I'm so good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>identifying this cause unwell.</v>

2325
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Really well read in like power politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you want to read,</v>

2326
01:34:05.911 --> 01:34:07.870
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to do is read the prints,</v>

2327
01:34:07.871 --> 01:34:09.190
<v Speaker 2>read Lindt scan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read Robert Greene,</v>

2328
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:13.470
<v Speaker 2>that'll teach you how to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people and these people are the,</v>

2329
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything they're doing is about</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and control.</v>

2330
01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:16.173
<v Speaker 2>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about influence over what's going </v>

2331
01:34:18.131 --> 01:34:18.964
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at any point you can break this </v>

2332
01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:23.140
<v Speaker 2>influenced by just simply understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>how the gaining it.</v>

2333
01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:24.213
<v Speaker 2>I think Jordan Peterson has got some </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty unique insight into it because </v>

2334
01:34:26.681 --> 01:34:30.310
<v Speaker 2>he's been dealing with it for several </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and in a very high profile way.</v>

2335
01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:33.370
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that he said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he believes it's about revenge,</v>

2336
01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:34.713
<v Speaker 2>he says he thinks that a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are so active on campus and </v>

2337
01:34:37.481 --> 01:34:39.850
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in this fever pitch,</v>

2338
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:40.953
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them were bullied and pushed </v>

2339
01:34:42.311 --> 01:34:43.144
<v Speaker 2>around when they were younger and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were socially awkward and not in the </v>

2340
01:34:47.141 --> 01:34:47.974
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool groups and now they want revenge </v>

2341
01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.633
<v Speaker 2>and this is why they want to label </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone who plays sports as being some </v>

2342
01:34:55.001 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 2>sort of a massage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enos woman raper you know,</v>

2343
01:34:58.071 --> 01:34:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

2344
01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone who's in a frat house is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2345
01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:06.380
<v Speaker 2>as a massage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis homophobic rapists like is no way</v>

2346
01:35:06.381 --> 01:35:07.430
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in a frat.</v>

2347
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:08.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like the full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2348
01:35:08.761 --> 01:35:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I like that woman who thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay to say that that guy who got killed</v>

2349
01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:13.573
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do coke and rape girls in a </v>

2350
01:35:15.521 --> 01:35:16.490
<v Speaker 2>frat party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2351
01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a caricature.</v>

2352
01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:19.060
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2353
01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.650
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if someone did a,</v>

2354
01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:23.960
<v Speaker 2>an equal caricature about a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so racist counts.</v>

2355
01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievably racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is racist,</v>

2356
01:35:26.511 --> 01:35:28.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also redefined racism and what this</v>

2357
01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.473
<v Speaker 2>will mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guy's dead fucking got beaten to </v>

2358
01:35:32.481 --> 01:35:34.970
<v Speaker 2>death taking a poster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all he did.</v>

2359
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.923
<v Speaker 2>But you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're putting all these straw man </v>

2360
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:42.050
<v Speaker 2>definitions on this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all this guy did is andy young guys,</v>

2361
01:35:42.051 --> 01:35:43.760
<v Speaker 2>dumb thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to steal this poster.</v>

2362
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:45.050
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's dead now.</v>

2363
01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took the,</v>

2364
01:35:46.230 --> 01:35:49.460
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the regime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got no sympathy for him whatsoever.</v>

2365
01:35:49.461 --> 01:35:50.780
<v Speaker 2>What the Fuck's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Cool.</v>

2366
01:35:50.781 --> 01:35:53.450
<v Speaker 2>If he was Columbian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he was a Colombian American,</v>

2367
01:35:53.451 --> 01:35:55.520
<v Speaker 2>they beat him to death like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that be okay?</v>

2368
01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:57.440
<v Speaker 2>How would you feel then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you,</v>

2369
01:35:57.470 --> 01:36:00.200
<v Speaker 2>would you come up with some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombian,</v>

2370
01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced that he's got that you don't </v>

2371
01:36:02.151 --> 01:36:04.100
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he's got some sort of a Colombian</v>

2372
01:36:04.101 --> 01:36:05.090
<v Speaker 2>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

2373
01:36:05.091 --> 01:36:06.200
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is this not going,</v>

2374
01:36:06.201 --> 01:36:08.300
<v Speaker 2>not being hideously oppressed anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been captured,</v>

2375
01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:09.134
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll take them by the North Koreans </v>

2376
01:36:09.621 --> 01:36:10.660
<v Speaker 2>had been beaten to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2377
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.863
<v Speaker 2>Then they will literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll proof that your white male </v>

2378
01:36:12.711 --> 01:36:14.870
<v Speaker 2>privilege isn't universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2379
01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:15.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2380
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:16.430
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2381
01:36:16.431 --> 01:36:17.990
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be a fucking moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say that.</v>

2382
01:36:17.991 --> 01:36:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Because everything about the ideology </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself is contextual.</v>

2383
01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.960
<v Speaker 2>It's power plus privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're full.</v>

2384
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:24.943
<v Speaker 2>It must have a context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There must be more white people around </v>

2385
01:36:27.321 --> 01:36:28.400
<v Speaker 2>for it to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And therefore,</v>

2386
01:36:28.401 --> 01:36:29.234
<v Speaker 2>if we go to Zimbabwe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white people are hideously oppressed by </v>

2387
01:36:31.191 --> 01:36:32.024
<v Speaker 2>that definition in Zimbabwe when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>white foam is getting the funds </v>

2388
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:36.550
<v Speaker 2>appropriated by black African Pan monks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort,</v>

2389
01:36:36.610 --> 01:36:38.690
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then of course,</v>

2390
01:36:38.691 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 2>they're being oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2391
01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:41.210
<v Speaker 2>It's not universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2392
01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.870
<v Speaker 2>it's contextual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most asinine thing to say,</v>

2393
01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not universal.</v>

2394
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Fucking de [inaudible] also universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you were talking about.</v>

2395
01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm drinking up cause I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated and don't worry about it.</v>

2396
01:36:53.010 --> 01:36:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to hydrate myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apologize for drinking water.</v>

2397
01:36:56.061 --> 01:36:56.894
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know I'm consistently doing it </v>

2398
01:36:58.311 --> 01:37:00.080
<v Speaker 2>and it's like don't worry about it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.033
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's also what you were </v>

2400
01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:04.370
<v Speaker 2>talking about where they want to make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about them.</v>

2401
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:05.203
<v Speaker 2>Like here this woman has taken this </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation which is horribly tragic and </v>

2402
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:10.423
<v Speaker 2>now she's talking about students that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she has to deal with that are white men </v>

2403
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
<v Speaker 2>that are doing coke and raping girls at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Frat parties and just like this guy.</v>

2404
01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:20.300
<v Speaker 2>What is this a horrible generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>

2405
01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:21.523
<v Speaker 2>they keep making it the stories as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's making about her and her </v>

2406
01:37:24.111 --> 01:37:24.944
<v Speaker 2>classes and the guys that she had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clueless guy's that she has to deal </v>

2407
01:37:27.981 --> 01:37:28.814
<v Speaker 2>with in her classes and she's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>deciding that this guy is that without </v>

2408
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:36.710
<v Speaker 2>any personal knowledge of him at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she's a future.</v>

2409
01:37:36.711 --> 01:37:37.544
<v Speaker 2>We've gone and she's turning it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself and she's a victim because she </v>

2410
01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:43.280
<v Speaker 2>has to deal with these students and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these clueless white,</v>

2411
01:37:43.281 --> 01:37:46.100
<v Speaker 2>rich male students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

2412
01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His note twats out there.</v>

2413
01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.073
<v Speaker 2>They're a bunch of dudes who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitheads and for sure there are just </v>

2414
01:37:52.881 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 2>like there's women that suck to humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>that suck.</v>

2415
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.173
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with gender or race</v>
<v Speaker 2>or that's racist to categorize them in </v>

2416
01:38:01.351 --> 01:38:03.990
<v Speaker 2>that particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of humans that are,</v>

2417
01:38:03.991 --> 01:38:05.940
<v Speaker 2>that happened to be white males that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

2418
01:38:05.941 --> 01:38:07.830
<v Speaker 2>that happened to be black women that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

2419
01:38:07.831 --> 01:38:08.664
<v Speaker 2>that Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of people that are cool </v>

2420
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:14.760
<v Speaker 2>across the board in every single gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>race of course.</v>

2421
01:38:14.761 --> 01:38:17.620
<v Speaker 2>How you treat people as equals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shunts of the character.</v>

2422
01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:18.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we send mean that's the right way to do </v>

2423
01:38:19.711 --> 01:38:20.544
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most disturbing thing about </v>

2424
01:38:21.931 --> 01:38:24.510
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a fucking professor who's teaching</v>

2425
01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:25.344
<v Speaker 2>young people is generalizing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrendous way and she thinks it's okay </v>

2426
01:38:29.611 --> 01:38:33.270
<v Speaker 2>because this kid stole a poster and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he think was going to happen?</v>

2427
01:38:33.271 --> 01:38:35.130
<v Speaker 2>What did he think was going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2428
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:37.440
<v Speaker 2>When you're 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking,</v>

2429
01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.040
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck does this dummy not know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2430
01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:45.300
<v Speaker 2>How does she not understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just the science of the development</v>

2431
01:38:45.301 --> 01:38:46.134
<v Speaker 2>of the human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has been clearly established over </v>

2432
01:38:47.521 --> 01:38:50.080
<v Speaker 2>the past 2030 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 when it finally,</v>

<v Speaker 2>step five is the frontal cortex this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even develops.</v>

2434

<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad way.</v>

2510
01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Describe</v>

2511
01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:41.260
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how they define these things.</v>

2512
01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:41.731
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>

2513
01:41:41.731 --> 01:41:44.290
<v Speaker 3>if they have a different definition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they say where it's structural,</v>

2514
01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:45.401
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2515
01:41:45.401 --> 01:41:46.234
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2516
01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.650
<v Speaker 3>institution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk about racism.</v>

2517
01:41:47.690 --> 01:41:50.020
<v Speaker 3>It's an easier way of framing it and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2518
01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:50.411
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2519
01:41:50.411 --> 01:41:51.244
<v Speaker 3>I think a racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the structures are </v>

2520
01:41:52.631 --> 01:41:54.420
<v Speaker 3>actually racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the individuals,</v>

2521
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:56.680
<v Speaker 3>certain individuals within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures are racist.</v>

2522
01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.680
<v Speaker 3>Then what you're doing is undermining </v>
<v Speaker 3>their entire philosophy.</v>

2523
01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:00.813
<v Speaker 3>And if you're undermining their entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy by effectively </v>

2524
01:42:04.121 --> 01:42:05.920
<v Speaker 3>individualizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>robin collectivizing it,</v>

2525
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:08.910
<v Speaker 3>then they have to consider you an enemy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what you'll,</v>

2526
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.150
<v Speaker 3>if everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go,</v>

2527
01:42:10.151 --> 01:42:11.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then someone else goes,</v>

2528
01:42:11.351 --> 01:42:12.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good way of looking at,</v>

2529
01:42:12.391 --> 01:42:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't look at that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a lot of people got,</v>

2530
01:42:14.471 --> 01:42:15.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a great point.</v>

2531
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Then suddenly their philosophy is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to collapse.</v>

2532
01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:21.250
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to believe what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying and they can be like,</v>

2533
01:42:21.251 --> 01:42:22.084
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I'm being horribly </v>

2534
01:42:23.171 --> 01:42:23.730
<v Speaker 3>oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

2535
01:42:23.730 --> 01:42:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2536
01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.630
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some racist,</v>

2537
01:42:25.631 --> 01:42:26.990
<v Speaker 3>but we deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got the balls,</v>

2538
01:42:27.190 --> 01:42:28.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got laws against racism,</v>

2539
01:42:28.751 --> 01:42:29.584
<v Speaker 3>we've got laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the affirmative action laws to bring </v>

2540
01:42:31.301 --> 01:42:32.134
<v Speaker 3>black people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the system is actually as </v>

2541
01:42:33.521 --> 01:42:34.354
<v Speaker 3>racist as you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that maybe there were a few bad </v>

2542
01:42:35.411 --> 01:42:37.810
<v Speaker 3>actors and when we see when we can spot </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and get them,</v>

2543
01:42:38.050 --> 01:42:38.883
<v Speaker 3>get them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2544
01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:39.993
<v Speaker 3>then what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how these people going to play the </v>

2545
01:42:40.751 --> 01:42:41.584
<v Speaker 3>victim when they get to play the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's real racism and there's also </v>

2546
01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:47.260
<v Speaker 3>real people playing the victim and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's bolt,</v>

2547
01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.000
<v Speaker 3>of course there's real racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're vigilant.</v>

2548
01:42:49.001 --> 01:42:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are racist?</v>

2549
01:42:50.561 --> 01:42:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Just tolerated well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh the president now.</v>

2550
01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The president,</v>

2551
01:42:54.911 --> 01:42:55.900
<v Speaker 3>that company's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2552
01:42:55.901 --> 01:42:57.610
<v Speaker 3>Well we're just going to leave him </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

2553
01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.290
<v Speaker 3>he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2554
01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.153
<v Speaker 3>he sees all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still didn't get jump and of course </v>

2555
01:43:01.211 --> 01:43:02.044
<v Speaker 3>he's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be out of the door for </v>

2556
01:43:03.251 --> 01:43:04.084
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They frame Pewdie Pie as being someone </v>

2557
01:43:06.491 --> 01:43:08.440
<v Speaker 3>who may have been spreading </v>
<v Speaker 3>antisemitism,</v>

2558
01:43:08.441 --> 01:43:10.900
<v Speaker 3>which he always got some like millions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of followers though.</v>

2559
01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Well they did like two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>3 million,</v>

2560
01:43:12.251 --> 01:43:13.960
<v Speaker 3>but they constantly were millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

2561
01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:17.020
<v Speaker 3>But I think ultimately it'll probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>balances itself out.</v>

2562
01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.860
<v Speaker 3>It's already gone in his favor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone fuck themselves.</v>

2563
01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:20.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's only because there was a </v>

2564
01:43:21.131 --> 01:43:23.620
<v Speaker 3>credible alternative media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like pd Pie.</v>

2565
01:43:23.621 --> 01:43:24.131
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2566
01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:25.470
<v Speaker 3>there's me and another youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nickel,</v>

2567
01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.313
<v Speaker 3>crowns and TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both made videos about what's his name </v>

2568
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:28.990
<v Speaker 3>was talking so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to add overall?</v>

2569
01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:29.951
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2570
01:43:29.951 --> 01:43:31.090
<v Speaker 3>there's so much I need to tell you.</v>

2571
01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:32.013
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably not going to be here again </v>

2572
01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:33.970
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot you need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2573
01:43:33.971 --> 01:43:34.804
<v Speaker 3>You coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to know what I've had it been </v>

2574
01:43:37.301 --> 01:43:38.640
<v Speaker 3>most sleep as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do anything.</v>

2575
01:43:38.890 --> 01:43:42.370
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a youtube called crowds and t crowds and</v>

2576
01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 3>t,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a German guy,</v>

2577
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:46.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kraut and t o t like the,</v>

2578
01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:48.730
<v Speaker 3>cause he's half English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half German.</v>

2579
01:43:49.150 --> 01:43:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2580
01:43:49.810 --> 01:43:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2581
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did a video about this as well.</v>

2582
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:54.403
<v Speaker 3>I did a video about this and p Dubai did</v>
<v Speaker 3>a video using the information as the </v>

2583
01:43:57.651 --> 01:43:58.484
<v Speaker 3>systems we've compiled to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do his own video and used us as </v>

2584
01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:01.964
<v Speaker 3>sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>St Let the smoke got this information </v>

2585
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.040
<v Speaker 3>and he'd swing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2586
01:44:04.041 --> 01:44:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really nice of him.</v>

2587
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.160
<v Speaker 3>But it's really interesting how we </v>
<v Speaker 3>helped him fight back because he's not,</v>

2588
01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:11.000
<v Speaker 3>he's a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2589
01:44:11.001 --> 01:44:12.530
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't do all this professionally.</v>

2590
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:14.330
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know what to look for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2591
01:44:14.331 --> 01:44:15.310
<v Speaker 3>new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would he,</v>

2592
01:44:15.311 --> 01:44:16.144
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

2593
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:19.130
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't expend too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but luckily this was a house speciality.</v>

2594
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:20.293
<v Speaker 3>We've been going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the media since day one because we </v>

2595
01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:23.930
<v Speaker 3>know there are a bunch of liars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know they are.</v>

2596
01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:27.230
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be not all of them.</v>

2597
01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:30.270
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be good journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's no excuse.</v>

2598
01:44:30.271 --> 01:44:32.360
<v Speaker 3>So you now have a platform where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street Journal,</v>

2599
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:35.300
<v Speaker 3>if you want to maintain your reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't publish shit like that.</v>

2600
01:44:35.950 --> 01:44:36.783
<v Speaker 3>Unaccepted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is their response that then Kevin </v>

2601
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:39.590
<v Speaker 3>don't address it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>

2602
01:44:39.591 --> 01:44:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems so crazy.</v>

2603
01:44:41.121 --> 01:44:41.954
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't,</v>

2604
01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:45.680
<v Speaker 3>they should address that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2605
01:44:45.681 --> 01:44:46.514
<v Speaker 3>The ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no sue them and now I </v>

2606
01:44:48.201 --> 01:44:49.760
<v Speaker 3>don't think he sued them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2607
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:51.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he wants the trouble.</v>

2608
01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.610
<v Speaker 3>If he sued the monk back in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

2609
01:44:54.630 --> 01:44:55.880
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you would win?</v>

2610
01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't see how he could lose,</v>

2611
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.843
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can you prove they cost you money </v>

2612
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:01.380
<v Speaker 3>easily?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2613
01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Is this actual antisemitism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously not.</v>

2614
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they take you out of context?</v>

2615
01:45:06.981 --> 01:45:07.814
<v Speaker 3>Clearly and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the jokes was that they would </v>

2616
01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:13.370
<v Speaker 3>take him out of context?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could he lose this?</v>

2617
01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well some it is possible.</v>

2618
01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:18.393
<v Speaker 3>What he should do is find out how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Wall Street Journal cost to buy and </v>

2619
01:45:20.511 --> 01:45:25.490
<v Speaker 3>then crowdfunded and I donate to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spread it around.</v>

2620
01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>

2621
01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:27.083
<v Speaker 3>there was a lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recent lawsuit that I couldn't believe </v>

2622
01:45:30.110 --> 01:45:31.400
<v Speaker 3>was thrown out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>

2623
01:45:31.401 --> 01:45:33.990
<v Speaker 3>And I can't remember it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh.</v>

2624
01:45:35.150 --> 01:45:37.340
<v Speaker 3>And I remember laying a few hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars,</v>

2625
01:45:37.341 --> 01:45:38.174
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's got 55 million subscribers </v>

2626
01:45:39.891 --> 01:45:40.724
<v Speaker 3>and he's a very influential man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there are a lot of people who like </v>

2627
01:45:42.081 --> 01:45:44.540
<v Speaker 3>him who would love to support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's possible.</v>

2628
01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:46.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he could speak to,</v>

2629
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.400
<v Speaker 3>I know some nice wealthy benefactors who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>

2630
01:45:49.401 --> 01:45:50.480
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate these people.</v>

2631
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Like Peter Teal Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he did with Hulk Hogan versus,</v>

2632
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:55.290
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2633
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:56.203
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing </v>

2634
01:45:57.441 --> 01:45:58.360
<v Speaker 3>in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>CPD pies,</v>

2635
01:45:58.370 --> 01:46:02.690
<v Speaker 3>the owner of the Wall Street Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just be hilarious.</v>

2636
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:03.583
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2637
01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:04.753
<v Speaker 3>and it wouldn't be the wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>billionaires who happened to be </v>

2638
01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:08.930
<v Speaker 3>obviously wealthy having to be watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and you know what?</v>

2639
01:46:08.931 --> 01:46:09.764
<v Speaker 3>We could get one over on these bitches </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that we don't have to just let them </v>

2640
01:46:11.991 --> 01:46:12.824
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to just let them when we </v>

2641
01:46:14.121 --> 01:46:14.954
<v Speaker 3>could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might feel like the New York Times </v>

2642
01:46:16.341 --> 01:46:18.970
<v Speaker 3>feels incredibly challenged right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jenna,</v>

2643
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:21.080
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the New York Times,</v>

2644
01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:23.470
<v Speaker 3>just making sure I was going to say with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2645
01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.340
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just so ready to go.</v>

2646
01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.500
<v Speaker 3>I am just so much words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>

2647
01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:30.110
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't have much time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but about us.</v>

2648
01:46:30.111 --> 01:46:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2649
01:46:31.581 --> 01:46:32.470
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had.</v>

2650
01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Was there any way you could reschedule </v>
<v Speaker 3>or schedule your flight?</v>

2651
01:46:35.210 --> 01:46:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Do you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could just,</v>

2652
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to carry on,</v>

2653
01:46:37.281 --> 01:46:38.114
<v Speaker 3>I could just cancel 10 if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to make sure you don't get </v>

2654
01:46:40.251 --> 01:46:41.240
<v Speaker 3>stuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2655
01:46:41.241 --> 01:46:44.290
<v Speaker 3>I can just buy another ticket tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure it will cost me a fortune,</v>

2656
01:46:44.291 --> 01:46:45.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2657
01:46:45.351 --> 01:46:48.540
<v Speaker 3>a fortune for an hour of podcasting </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems one over it.</v>

2658
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:50.003
<v Speaker 3>You've only got an hour.</v>

2659
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.820
<v Speaker 2>I've got another hour and Japan probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

2660
01:46:53.821 --> 01:46:55.230
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a thousand pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably shouldn't.</v>

2661
01:46:55.231 --> 01:46:57.780
<v Speaker 2>What's a thousand pounds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>$1,200</v>

2662
01:46:58.050 --> 01:46:59.700
<v Speaker 2>will take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2663
01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll put it on the budget.</v>

2664
01:47:01.111 --> 01:47:02.430
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck am I gonna do for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the day?</v>

2665
01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:03.300
<v Speaker 2>We're going to hang out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2668
01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:10.050

<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're going to do,</v>

2669
01:47:10.051 --> 01:47:10.884
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to do another hour of </v>

2670
01:47:12.161 --> 01:47:12.994
<v Speaker 2>podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>

2671
01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:15.300
<v Speaker 2>We should just say we were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start at nine.</v>

2672
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 2>We're a little late because of traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>here is insane.</v>

2673
01:47:17.851 --> 01:47:18.684
<v Speaker 2>My wife's gonna kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You was going to kill if you don't come </v>

2674
01:47:19.951 --> 01:47:21.090
<v Speaker 2>home think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>

2675
01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.610
<v Speaker 2>She'll understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sure?</v>

2676
01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mixed messages.</v>

2677
01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:26.820
<v Speaker 2>She understand she's going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This Sheila.</v>

2678
01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:27.910
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we keep going.</v>

2679
01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:29.693
<v Speaker 2>So where were we?</v>

2680
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:32.490
<v Speaker 2>We were wasting money by buying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wallstreet journal with Keith teals.</v>

2681
01:47:32.491 --> 01:47:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2682
01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:34.463
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was saying is that the New York </v>

2683
01:47:35.731 --> 01:47:36.564
<v Speaker 2>Times feels very challenged by donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's dismissal of them is fake news </v>

2684
01:47:40.771 --> 01:47:43.650
<v Speaker 2>and all these different attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of that they sort of doubled</v>

2685
01:47:43.651 --> 01:47:44.484
<v Speaker 2>down on the ethics of journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried really hard to be better at </v>

2686
01:47:47.731 --> 01:47:48.890
<v Speaker 2>what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2687
01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:49.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>

2688
01:47:49.650 --> 01:47:50.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually,</v>

2689
01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:52.830
<v Speaker 2>but that's a real indictment of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of journalism,</v>

2690
01:47:52.831 --> 01:47:54.110
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they have to do is a little bit,</v>

2691
01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.700
<v Speaker 2>we're going to recommit ourselves to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually being journalists.</v>

2692
01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Good thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll stay in Houston,</v>

2693
01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:03.540
<v Speaker 2>New York Times called out in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never been called out before.</v>

2694
01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Of course they did lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2695
01:48:04.921 --> 01:48:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the president.</v>

2696
01:48:05.881 --> 01:48:08.040
<v Speaker 2>They became political activists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't generalists.</v>

2697
01:48:08.041 --> 01:48:10.740
<v Speaker 2>They rise and they were on the losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

2698
01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:12.210
<v Speaker 2>get ranked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2699
01:48:12.211 --> 01:48:13.530
<v Speaker 2>of course you've got to suddenly go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2700
01:48:13.531 --> 01:48:14.081
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

2701
01:48:14.081 --> 01:48:14.330
<v Speaker 2>hands up.</v>

2702
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2703
01:48:15.090 --> 01:48:19.290
<v Speaker 2>let's try not being a lie as anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that trickle down from?</v>

2704
01:48:19.291 --> 01:48:20.124
<v Speaker 2>Is it from the editors who lost sight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the writers themselves that they </v>

2705
01:48:22.981 --> 01:48:23.814
<v Speaker 2>hire?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the ethics behind the business of </v>

2706
01:48:25.141 --> 01:48:27.780
<v Speaker 2>the magazine or the of the newspaper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunate.</v>

2707
01:48:27.781 --> 01:48:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the ins and outs of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if he had a Spec,</v>

2708
01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had to speculate,</v>

2709
01:48:32.081 --> 01:48:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably say it's coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top and they're just like,</v>

2710
01:48:33.781 --> 01:48:35.580
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2711
01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Like we're seeing with these tech </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>

2712
01:48:38.370 --> 01:48:39.203
<v Speaker 2>like we're seeing with these people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like uber progressive in Google or </v>

2713
01:48:41.911 --> 01:48:43.580
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2714
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing,</v>

2715
01:48:45.091 --> 01:48:45.541
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

2716
01:48:45.541 --> 01:48:47.820
<v Speaker 2>we're dealing with a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2717
01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I hate to use the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the real word.</v>

2718
01:48:49.741 --> 01:48:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Cultural War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Block culture warriors.</v>

2721
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:57.570

<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2722

<v Speaker 2>He's just bragging on this cause it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid shit.</v>

2739
01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:42.073
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the sort of stupid shit like we've </v>

2740
01:49:42.781 --> 01:49:46.800
<v Speaker 2>been talking about and rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is bollocks and it's good that he's</v>

2741
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:47.703
<v Speaker 2>telling kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2742
01:49:47.890 --> 01:49:50.710
<v Speaker 2>this is crap t just treat people well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2743
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.190
<v Speaker 2>like just treat people as an individual.</v>

2744
01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:55.033
<v Speaker 2>of course it is crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't even think it's being sort </v>

2745
01:49:56.861 --> 01:50:00.220
<v Speaker 2>of like it's eroding the same way male </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism is eroding.</v>

2746
01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.540
<v Speaker 2>That term is a very derogatory term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call someone a male feminist.</v>

2747
01:50:04.930 --> 01:50:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Most people just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ugh,</v>

2748
01:50:06.490 --> 01:50:08.350
<v Speaker 2>if you call someone a social justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior,</v>

2749
01:50:08.351 --> 01:50:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is a term now that term is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not something that someone carries.</v>

2750
01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.320
<v Speaker 2>There was a while where people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2751
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:15.760
<v Speaker 2>I read quotes like,</v>

2754
01:50:18.581 --> 01:50:20.230
<v Speaker 2>they were like embracing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not a an sjw on the Joe </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2758
01:50:26.690 --> 01:50:28.110

<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you how to check your </v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege show.</v>

2761
01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:32.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had one of those on.</v>

2762
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be fascinated.</v>

2763
01:50:34.630 --> 01:50:36.890
<v Speaker 2>You should get one on just to pick the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

2764
01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:37.960
<v Speaker 2>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Studio is,</v>

2765
01:50:37.961 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 2>and you have to talk to them for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

2766
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

2767
01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've spoken to him.</v>

2768
01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so pete,</v>

2769
01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:45.140
<v Speaker 2>that's a cop out because the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have looked,</v>

2770
01:50:45.141 --> 01:50:47.620
<v Speaker 2>you're your bird show bolts was your </v>
<v Speaker 2>boss was like,</v>

2771
01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:49.180
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I shouldn't.</v>

2772
01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I should just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not interested in you.</v>

2773
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:52.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you're creepy and weird and you've </v>

2774
01:50:53.970 --> 01:50:55.780
<v Speaker 2>probably harass someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's some,</v>

2775
01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:56.973
<v Speaker 2>there's some merit to having these </v>
<v Speaker 2>volatile discussions with people that </v>

2776
01:50:59.981 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 2>you disagree with.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever every time,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I am.</v>

2787
01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:18.640
<v Speaker 2>If you refer to him like we all know who</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about.</v>

2788
01:51:18.641 --> 01:51:19.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2789
01:51:19.301 --> 01:51:21.240

<v Speaker 2>she's actually really good talking about</v>

2790
01:51:21.370 --> 01:51:22.470
<v Speaker 2>call row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2792
01:51:24.041 --> 01:51:24.874
<v Speaker 2>but she's actually great and people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be surprised to hear me say </v>

2793
01:51:26.921 --> 01:51:28.290
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never done a video,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

2795
01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:31.473
<v Speaker 2>She's just an identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tarian but that doesn't mean that she's </v>

2796
01:51:33.370 --> 01:51:34.203
<v Speaker 2>bad or anything like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just means she talks about herself </v>

2797
01:51:36.311 --> 01:51:37.144
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2800
01:51:42.401 --> 01:51:43.234
<v Speaker 2>these people run like lemmings off cliff</v>

<v Speaker 2>I like this guy and he's actually making</v>
<v Speaker 2>some really good points that like your </v>

2854
01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:27.620
<v Speaker 2>sex ed stuff sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You suck everything you've ever done,</v>

2855
01:53:27.621 --> 01:53:28.700
<v Speaker 2>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get out of [inaudible].</v>

2856
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:31.400
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she gets death threats and things</v>

2857
01:53:31.401 --> 01:53:33.140
<v Speaker 2>like that and she used to get them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2858
01:53:33.170 --> 01:53:35.980
<v Speaker 2>I guess like I'll write a types who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the basements or something who hate,</v>

2859
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.370
<v Speaker 2>but now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she gets it from stw Thomas.</v>

2860
01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I with people would just not send </v>
<v Speaker 2>threats and shit.</v>

2861
01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.350
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just makes,</v>

2862
01:53:42.351 --> 01:53:44.840
<v Speaker 2>it's just nasty for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well definitely is that,</v>

2863
01:53:44.841 --> 01:53:48.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so sad that someone can't just date</v>

2864
01:53:48.201 --> 01:53:49.950
<v Speaker 2>someone that they don't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2865
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:50.803
<v Speaker 2>Fuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she obviously likes the guy of </v>

2866
01:53:53.031 --> 01:53:55.370
<v Speaker 2>course is you can't change your opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2867
01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:00.550
<v Speaker 2>You're cleaning can't evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be a flip flopper yeah.</v>

2868
01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:03.590
<v Speaker 2>In like can you even control what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe?</v>

2869
01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I believe that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then and what did I just say?</v>

2870
01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Believe that I believe that I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>control what I believe.</v>

2871
01:54:11.890 --> 01:54:12.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2872
01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:14.540
<v Speaker 2>So now you don't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2873
01:54:14.541 --> 01:54:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Cause you've just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that.</v>

2874
01:54:16.161 --> 01:54:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to believe I can change </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2875
01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Well I believe that people do change for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

2876
01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:24.050
<v Speaker 2>but none of their ideas is all like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a conscious choice to say,</v>

2877
01:54:24.051 --> 01:54:24.771
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day,</v>

2878
01:54:24.771 --> 01:54:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm an atheist so one day I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be like,</v>

2879
01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:28.720
<v Speaker 2>actually yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to choose to believe in God.</v>

2880
01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you either believe or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in?</v>

2881
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I could see what you're saying,</v>

2882
01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:37.810
<v Speaker 2>but I think that when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're going over the possibilities</v>

2883
01:54:38.301 --> 01:54:39.134
<v Speaker 2>of any subject in your mind you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're influenced by a host of factors </v>

2884
01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.400
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you physically feel,</v>

2885
01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:48.140
<v Speaker 2>where you are in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2886
01:54:48.141 --> 01:54:50.420
<v Speaker 2>what kind of relationship you have with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your family,</v>

2887
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:53.240
<v Speaker 2>like where your job is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where are you?</v>

2888
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:54.343
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that hit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bottom and then all of a sudden </v>

2889
01:54:56.721 --> 01:54:58.730
<v Speaker 2>they became religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that's a,</v>

2890
01:54:58.790 --> 01:55:00.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not a coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2891
01:55:00.411 --> 01:55:01.244
<v Speaker 2>It's like at that stage in your life you</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to believe something and that </v>

2892
01:55:04.641 --> 01:55:06.830
<v Speaker 2>helped you and helped you to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>

2893
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:08.240
<v Speaker 2>And maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2894
01:55:08.241 --> 01:55:09.074
<v Speaker 2>how many dudes find Jesus where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting their dick sucked and the </v>

2895
01:55:10.851 --> 01:55:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Jacuzzi.</v>

2896
01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:12.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2897
01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:14.060
<v Speaker 2>That's probably pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2898
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.923
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2899
01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:16.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless it's like really bad blow job and</v>

2900
01:55:16.851 --> 01:55:21.620
<v Speaker 2>you just feel sad and you actually could</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause terrible at everywhere.</v>

2901
01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Anytime Jesus help me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help me,</v>

2902
01:55:24.741 --> 01:55:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2903
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:27.223
<v Speaker 2>people find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find love and happiness in weird </v>

2904
01:55:30.711 --> 01:55:33.350
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find depression weird places.</v>

2905
01:55:33.351 --> 01:55:34.184
<v Speaker 2>So it's really a lot of like what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe depends on where you're at in </v>

2906
01:55:36.801 --> 01:55:40.310
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can very well be influenced where you</v>

2907
01:55:40.311 --> 01:55:44.280
<v Speaker 2>go one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once someone has an opinion,</v>

2908
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:46.860
<v Speaker 2>whether it's God is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our God is fake,</v>

2909
01:55:47.250 --> 01:55:52.250
<v Speaker 2>they fucking fight that to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that is their stance and they can't</v>

2910
01:55:53.251 --> 01:55:54.840
<v Speaker 2>change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't move it around.</v>

2911
01:55:54.841 --> 01:55:55.674
<v Speaker 2>And if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're off flip flopper if he didn't </v>

2912
01:55:57.271 --> 01:55:59.490
<v Speaker 2>resign yourself into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can be reasoned out to it.</v>

2913
01:55:59.850 --> 01:56:00.630
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2914
01:56:00.630 --> 01:56:01.463
<v Speaker 2>Well that term flip flopper so fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so stupid because it's a more </v>

2915
01:56:05.401 --> 01:56:09.900
<v Speaker 2>chronic political term and really only </v>
<v Speaker 2>existed because politicians did not have</v>

2916
01:56:09.901 --> 01:56:13.050
<v Speaker 2>a forum to defend the evolution of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas before.</v>

2917
01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Now they can go online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders as a fucking podcast,</v>

2918
01:56:16.381 --> 01:56:17.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now let's see.</v>

2919
01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does listen to,</v>

2920
01:56:18.951 --> 01:56:23.130
<v Speaker 2>they can go on youtube or facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't need to be in some sort of a,</v>

2921
01:56:23.131 --> 01:56:24.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2922
01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:27.830
<v Speaker 2>political forum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a formal debate.</v>

2923
01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

2924
01:56:28.710 --> 01:56:30.150
<v Speaker 2>they can just talk about their idea was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2925
01:56:30.151 --> 01:56:32.970
<v Speaker 2>this is what I used to believe and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is why I changed my mind.</v>

2926
01:56:32.971 --> 01:56:35.610
<v Speaker 2>And they could do that over the course </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an hour and a youtube video.</v>

2927
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:39.690
<v Speaker 2>And it's clearly as the mind could </v>
<v Speaker 2>decipher,</v>

2928
01:56:40.570 --> 01:56:43.380
<v Speaker 2>state their opinions on things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because people couldn't in the past,</v>

2929
01:56:43.381 --> 01:56:47.220
<v Speaker 2>like he used to be tough on crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's a flip flopper yeah,</v>

2930
01:56:47.221 --> 01:56:48.180
<v Speaker 2>you'll politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2931
01:56:48.181 --> 01:56:49.920
<v Speaker 2>it might not be what happened.</v>

2932
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:50.753
<v Speaker 2>He might used to be tough on crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he was given evidence of </v>

2933
01:56:53.551 --> 01:56:56.940
<v Speaker 2>systematic racism that he realized how </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt the police department is.</v>

2934
01:56:56.941 --> 01:56:57.774
<v Speaker 2>And then he realized that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandated quotas where they have to </v>

2935
01:57:00.151 --> 01:57:02.670
<v Speaker 2>arrest a certain amount of people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is probably the best place to do it</v>

2936
01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:05.400
<v Speaker 2>because those people don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money for legal representation and like,</v>

2937
01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:09.720
<v Speaker 2>so that's why my opinion evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you couldn't do that in the past.</v>

2938
01:57:09.810 --> 01:57:12.000
<v Speaker 2>So someone would just call you a flip </v>
<v Speaker 2>flopper yeah,</v>

2939
01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:14.850
<v Speaker 2>the Internet has changed everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the better,</v>

2940
01:57:14.970 --> 01:57:16.530
<v Speaker 2>by a long shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like we,</v>

2941
01:57:16.531 --> 01:57:17.364
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not discrediting real flip </v>

2942
01:57:18.181 --> 01:57:19.014
<v Speaker 2>flopping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2943
01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Obviously if something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone,</v>

2944
01:57:20.461 --> 01:57:21.630
<v Speaker 2>if someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2945
01:57:21.631 --> 01:57:22.464
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really hold a position and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just doing it because it's a </v>

2946
01:57:24.151 --> 01:57:25.650
<v Speaker 2>popular thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Hillary Clinton,</v>

2947
01:57:25.651 --> 01:57:26.130
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

2948
01:57:26.130 --> 01:57:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton and trump own gay marriage.</v>

2949
01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best.</v>

2950
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Trump has been consistent on that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades now.</v>

2951
01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:34.313
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton 2008 was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I believe it's men and a woman </v>

2952
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:40.560
<v Speaker 2>until 2013 it wasn't until 2013 she </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally came clean and when,</v>

2953
01:57:40.561 --> 01:57:41.850
<v Speaker 2>when?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When gay marriage,</v>

2954
01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:44.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that there's not 2017</v>

2955
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:45.263
<v Speaker 2>I believe that in this video of her from</v>
<v Speaker 2>2013 in fact saying that marriage is </v>

2956
01:57:48.751 --> 01:57:50.370
<v Speaker 2>between a man and a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course she would.</v>

2957
01:57:50.670 --> 01:57:52.070
<v Speaker 2>And then suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

2958
01:57:52.530 --> 01:57:54.000
<v Speaker 2>you've got to change the position that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's like,</v>

2959
01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:56.131
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2960
01:57:56.131 --> 01:57:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't give a shit cause I'm Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton.</v>

2961
01:57:57.481 --> 01:57:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2962
01:57:58.741 --> 01:57:59.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>

2963
01:57:59.371 --> 01:58:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm a careerist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2964
01:58:01.090 --> 01:58:01.923
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be the first woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>president because I have to fuck Bill </v>

2965
01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Clinton.</v>

<v Speaker 2>speeches.</v>

2968
01:58:11.010 --> 01:58:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I would love to know the transcripts </v>
<v Speaker 2>that she won't release.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is a hemispheric open borders where</v>

2974
01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:28.200
<v Speaker 2>like one hemisphere is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2975
01:58:28.201 --> 01:58:29.034
<v Speaker 2>free and open and another one is free </v>
<v Speaker 2>and open and t to eventually get like a </v>

2976
01:58:32.650 --> 01:58:36.020
<v Speaker 2>united globalized world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know the Anderson,</v>

2977
01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:37.260
<v Speaker 2>there's loads of stuff in there that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2978
01:58:37.261 --> 01:58:39.840
<v Speaker 2>and she's saying how she holds a public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bankers,</v>

2979
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:43.330
<v Speaker 2>she said that in the speech that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>holds a public and a private position.</v>

2980
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:44.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2981
01:58:44.061 --> 01:58:45.340
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't,</v>

2982
01:58:45.341 --> 01:58:49.750
<v Speaker 2>that Bernie Sanders ever discussed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty since he's,</v>

2983
01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done.</v>

2984
01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:53.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even a cook.</v>

2985
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not considered Bernie Sanders.</v>

2986
01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a very nice man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a cook.</v>

2987
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:59.110
<v Speaker 2>He's a bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2988
01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean you saw black lives matter take </v>
<v Speaker 2>over stage,</v>

2989
01:59:01.091 --> 01:59:02.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2990
01:59:02.051 --> 01:59:04.300
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was sad.</v>

2991
01:59:04.330 --> 01:59:06.380
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie a man.</v>

2992
01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:07.233
<v Speaker 2>These little bullies have got no right </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your platform and they're literally </v>

2993
01:59:08.981 --> 01:59:11.410
<v Speaker 2>squeezing him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are being reasonable screaming in his</v>

2994
01:59:11.411 --> 01:59:12.244
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Bernie.</v>

2995
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as some of the minus side,</v>

2996
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:17.530
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

2997
01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.580
<v Speaker 2>That lost me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't approve of I,</v>

2998
01:59:19.650 --> 01:59:20.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2999
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:21.520
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at that point,</v>

3000
01:59:21.521 --> 01:59:22.900
<v Speaker 2>a supporter of Bernie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Bernie.</v>

3001
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3002
01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:26.580
<v Speaker 2>he's maybe maybe a little further left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

3003
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:27.520
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

3004
01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:31.660
<v Speaker 2>He took a chance and having them go up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and then I liked that though.</v>

3005
01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took the chance to let them,</v>

3006
01:59:33.371 --> 01:59:34.204
<v Speaker 2>todd and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should be able to do </v>

3007
01:59:36.311 --> 01:59:37.144
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it does give you a sense of </v>

3008
01:59:38.831 --> 01:59:40.840
<v Speaker 2>who he is that he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

3009
01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:42.010
<v Speaker 2>tell me what you want.</v>

3010
01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he's just like standing at the side</v>

3011
01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:46.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

3012
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:47.260
<v Speaker 2>you're not a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>

3013
01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he moves his hands there.</v>

3014
01:59:48.611 --> 01:59:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Microaggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3015
01:59:49.810 --> 01:59:50.710
<v Speaker 2>We've learned that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

3016
01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:53.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should've had your boundaries.</v>

3017
01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't immediately capitulate,</v>

3018
01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:57.460
<v Speaker 2>so that was your boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't stick to it.</v>

3019
01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

3020
01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:59.860
<v Speaker 2>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should've said,</v>

3021
01:59:59.861 --> 02:00:00.940
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3022
02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:02.073
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be a school to the way </v>

3023
02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:04.713
<v Speaker 2>maybe we could discuss it in future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone comes up to you and stuff </v>

3024
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:09.520
<v Speaker 2>screeching your face that they're being </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>

3025
02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:14.530
<v Speaker 2>You draw the line and you stick to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not let that person bully you out</v>

3026
02:00:14.531 --> 02:00:16.210
<v Speaker 2>of your podium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's yours,</v>

3027
02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:17.860
<v Speaker 2>not theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got no right to it.</v>

3028
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:18.903
<v Speaker 2>Tell them to get fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's being investigated now they're </v>

3029
02:00:22.511 --> 02:00:24.280
<v Speaker 2>going after I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't looked into it.</v>

3030
02:00:24.490 --> 02:00:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Financial dealings with his wife and him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a small university where,</v>

3031
02:00:29.381 --> 02:00:30.214
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she made some decisions that ultimately </v>

3032
02:00:32.981 --> 02:00:37.360
<v Speaker 2>didn't pan out financially and it caused</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university to go under.</v>

3033
02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:38.363
<v Speaker 2>Oh Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They acquired a bunch of new land and </v>

3034
02:00:40.331 --> 02:00:41.164
<v Speaker 2>they were going to expand the university</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they got a lot of loans and they </v>

3035
02:00:43.791 --> 02:00:45.340
<v Speaker 2>started construction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this jazz.</v>

3036
02:00:45.730 --> 02:00:47.980
<v Speaker 2>And apparently it just wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable.</v>

3037
02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:49.650
<v Speaker 2>And so now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3038
02:00:49.810 --> 02:00:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I think there's allegations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course whenever something fails</v>

3039
02:00:53.141 --> 02:00:53.974
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's allegations that someone ms </v>

3040
02:00:54.871 --> 02:00:55.704
<v Speaker 2>handle something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've been forced her to this </v>

3041
02:00:57.380 --> 02:00:59.380
<v Speaker 2>lawyer dump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3042
02:00:59.381 --> 02:01:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I do not know it's been the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3043
02:01:01.811 --> 02:01:04.990
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really deeply gone into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

3044
02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:06.280
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3045
02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:10.510
<v Speaker 2>the basics of the story are she worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this university.</v>

3046
02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:14.560
<v Speaker 2>She wanted it to expand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got spend a lot of money expanding.</v>

3047
02:01:14.590 --> 02:01:19.410
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work out so it doesn't sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the face of it.</v>

3048
02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:21.370
<v Speaker 2>And like malfeasance was necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

3049
02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:26.700
<v Speaker 2>The worry is that he used his influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make some certain things happen.</v>

3050
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:31.130
<v Speaker 2>The allowed to take place perhaps while </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3051
02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:33.850
<v Speaker 2>that's the allegation I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still think Rome,</v>

3052
02:01:33.851 --> 02:01:36.280
<v Speaker 2>polk and wind to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might,</v>

3053
02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:37.631
<v Speaker 2>he's old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3054
02:01:37.631 --> 02:01:38.940
<v Speaker 2>he's waiting to open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's way too old.</v>

3055
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.770
<v Speaker 2>They're always talking about if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>

3056
02:01:40.771 --> 02:01:43.850
<v Speaker 2>So old days because it takes that long </v>
<v Speaker 2>for trust.</v>

3057
02:01:43.851 --> 02:01:45.020
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sad though,</v>

3058
02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:46.573
<v Speaker 2>isn't there like some guy in his forties</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's basically saying the same thing as </v>

3059
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders who hasn't liked any </v>
<v Speaker 2>stills still gets bonners.</v>

3060
02:01:52.131 --> 02:01:53.850
<v Speaker 2>We don't trust him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

3061
02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:55.720
<v Speaker 2>He gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fuck.</v>

3062
02:01:55.721 --> 02:01:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Is this the thing that Bill Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3063
02:01:56.871 --> 02:01:59.660
<v Speaker 2>it really pissed me off site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think shit people do.</v>

3064
02:01:59.690 --> 02:02:00.523
<v Speaker 2>It's weird if it's because they can find</v>
<v Speaker 2>out about it and they couldn't find out </v>

3065
02:02:03.261 --> 02:02:04.094
<v Speaker 2>about it before.</v>

3066
02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:05.113
<v Speaker 2>So you got a guy like jfk was a total </v>
<v Speaker 2>pussy hound who people revere is a </v>

3067
02:02:08.241 --> 02:02:09.074
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

3068
02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:10.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll push the hand.</v>

3069
02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3070
02:02:12.381 --> 02:02:15.550
<v Speaker 2>he was smoking hot fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who called?</v>

3071
02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Who knows the thing like why do we care </v>
<v Speaker 2>under a question?</v>

3072
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:21.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's a problem with him and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife.</v>

3073
02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:23.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nothing to do with writing,</v>

3074
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:24.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't surprise me.</v>

3075
02:02:24.381 --> 02:02:27.200
<v Speaker 2>It's all great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men always get women flinging themselves</v>

3076
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:29.330
<v Speaker 2>at them and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many human,</v>

3077
02:02:29.331 --> 02:02:31.490
<v Speaker 2>if you've got some really attractive </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman flinging herself out,</v>

3078
02:02:31.491 --> 02:02:33.830
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go and we can just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's going to go wrong.</v>

3079
02:02:33.831 --> 02:02:35.010
<v Speaker 2>And that'll be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one died.</v>

3080
02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:37.070
<v Speaker 2>No fucking surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3081
02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:38.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not a judgment on their character </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

3082
02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:40.970
<v Speaker 2>That's just them being a bit weak in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>

3083
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.900
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3084
02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:43.670
<v Speaker 2>They know it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know they shouldn't have done it.</v>

3085
02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:44.901
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3086
02:02:44.901 --> 02:02:45.734
<v Speaker 2>the culture is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different and the culture of </v>

3087
02:02:48.081 --> 02:02:48.914
<v Speaker 2>politics was very different back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People knew about the president's </v>

3088
02:02:52.671 --> 02:02:54.050
<v Speaker 2>affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was that?</v>

3089
02:02:54.051 --> 02:02:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the president that had polio?</v>

3090
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:57.623
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the president had polio and other </v>

3091
02:02:59.530 --> 02:03:00.770
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a wheelchair.</v>

3092
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:03.830
<v Speaker 2>What does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it Roosevelt?</v>

3093
02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:06.130
<v Speaker 2>He is he the guy who he's got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

3094
02:03:06.131 --> 02:03:10.460
<v Speaker 2>little round glasses and smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a roosevelt had polio.</v>

3095
02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3096
02:03:12.110 --> 02:03:12.920
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3097
02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:13.753
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3098
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Teddy Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Franklin,</v>

3099
02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3100
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:18.283
<v Speaker 2>he had polio and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the press knew it and they hid it from </v>

3101
02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:22.550
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

3102
02:03:22.551 --> 02:03:23.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one.</v>

3103
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:24.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird,</v>

3104
02:03:24.531 --> 02:03:25.310
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3105
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:26.143
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was the thing with JFK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing of Lyndon Johnson </v>

3106
02:03:28.221 --> 02:03:30.620
<v Speaker 2>famously held a press conference while </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was taking a shit.</v>

3107
02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:34.910
<v Speaker 2>He was literally taking a shit with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door open in the stall when he's talking</v>

3108
02:03:34.911 --> 02:03:37.910
<v Speaker 2>to the press because there was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries,</v>

3109
02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:39.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't say,</v>

3110
02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of code of honor.</v>

3111
02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:41.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy was taking a horrible student </v>

3112
02:03:42.161 --> 02:03:42.994
<v Speaker 2>and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3113
02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:43.913
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3114
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that once Watergate broke,</v>

3115
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:48.920
<v Speaker 2>once you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3116
02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:51.860
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty obvious this president is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking liar.</v>

3117
02:03:51.861 --> 02:03:55.400
<v Speaker 2>And a crook and we need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we have any responsibility,</v>

3118
02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:56.980
<v Speaker 2>we need to expose this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3119
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:59.360
<v Speaker 2>once you expose that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you open up that door.</v>

3120
02:03:59.390 --> 02:04:00.223
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People find out the genie's out of the </v>

3121
02:04:01.941 --> 02:04:04.100
<v Speaker 2>bottle and then they want to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you'd want to know.</v>

3122
02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:04.993
<v Speaker 2>As soon as it becomes permissible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're saying it's up to </v>

3123
02:04:06.681 --> 02:04:07.490
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to camp,</v>

3124
02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:08.870
<v Speaker 2>it's up to people to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3125
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:10.263
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are the person who is making the </v>

3126
02:04:11.511 --> 02:04:12.344
<v Speaker 2>difference and it's a small difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we all agree that we're all </v>

3127
02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:15.440
<v Speaker 2>making small difference than when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>working,</v>

3128
02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to act in a way that I find </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally responsible.</v>

3129
02:04:18.051 --> 02:04:18.711
<v Speaker 2>If we will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3130
02:04:18.711 --> 02:04:20.810
<v Speaker 2>well we're going to act in ways that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>fund pestering responsible,</v>

3131
02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:21.883
<v Speaker 2>they'll just end up with the best of </v>
<v Speaker 2>worlds without having to change </v>

3132
02:04:23.571 --> 02:04:24.404
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3133
02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No heads.</v>

3134
02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that today is probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder than ever the to manage like what</v>

3135
02:04:29.571 --> 02:04:30.920
<v Speaker 2>you're paying attention to and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not?</v>

3136
02:04:31.010 --> 02:04:31.641
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

3137
02:04:31.641 --> 02:04:32.001
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3138
02:04:32.001 --> 02:04:32.834
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're thinking about like fake news </v>

3139
02:04:33.381 --> 02:04:36.000
<v Speaker 2>and like pots and I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real problem.</v>

3140
02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 2>The social media is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there've been</v>

3141
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.540
<v Speaker 1>studies done that showed like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

3142
02:04:39.541 --> 02:04:42.120
<v Speaker 1>it's more on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also very much on the right,</v>

3143
02:04:42.121 --> 02:04:42.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3144
02:04:42.650 --> 02:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like 70,</v>

3145
02:04:44.130 --> 02:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>60 or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3146
02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's slightly more on the left where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just essentially,</v>

3147
02:04:48.290 --> 02:04:51.440
<v Speaker 1>essentially get one political viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that the,</v>

3148
02:04:51.441 --> 02:04:52.274
<v Speaker 1>the social media is just a stream of </v>
<v Speaker 1>content that's all telling you the same </v>

3149
02:04:55.381 --> 02:04:56.214
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the story that just came out </v>

3150
02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:01.860
<v Speaker 1>about a fake news story that costs some </v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

3151
02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>some untold millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might've been even been,</v>

3152
02:05:06.691 --> 02:05:09.540
<v Speaker 1>they might've even said be $1 billion in</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock.</v>

3153
02:05:09.930 --> 02:05:12.720
<v Speaker 1>And it just came out today like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound that,</v>

3154
02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:16.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a company was extremely devalued because</v>

3155
02:05:16.441 --> 02:05:18.900
<v Speaker 1>of a fake news story that is a danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3156
02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big danger.</v>

3157
02:05:20.190 --> 02:05:21.023
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you trade in the stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>market and then all of a sudden it </v>

3158
02:05:23.341 --> 02:05:24.174
<v Speaker 1>causes a cascade of panic and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>just start dumping their stock and </v>

3159
02:05:26.461 --> 02:05:27.060
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

3160
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>It's all turns colby face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3161
02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:30.113
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea would be that it would balance </v>

3162
02:05:30.991 --> 02:05:33.240
<v Speaker 1>out eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it was a fragile company,</v>

3163
02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:35.940
<v Speaker 1>who knows what this will damage that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have done to them.</v>

3164
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Did you find it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really recent news story.</v>

3165
02:05:39.570 --> 02:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It just came out like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the today or yesterday.</v>

3166
02:05:42.361 --> 02:05:44.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the flip side of like being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold people accountable.</v>

3167
02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>

3168
02:05:46.230 --> 02:05:47.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't hold,</v>

3169
02:05:47.070 --> 02:05:49.290
<v Speaker 1>the Internet's fantastic in social media</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fantastic.</v>

3170
02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>

3171
02:05:50.580 --> 02:05:51.391
<v Speaker 1>And you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3172
02:05:51.391 --> 02:05:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I think you could make real arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these things are now,</v>

3173
02:05:53.431 --> 02:05:56.880
<v Speaker 1>but like critical to free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3174
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean land and there should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this should be understood,</v>

3175
02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:01.163
<v Speaker 1>but on the flip side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could say something that's not </v>

3176
02:06:02.611 --> 02:06:03.840
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's free speech.</v>

3177
02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

3178
02:06:05.081 --> 02:06:05.914
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing when you really think </v>

3179
02:06:08.461 --> 02:06:09.780
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how rare it is.</v>

3180
02:06:10.170 --> 02:06:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's fairly common,</v>

3181
02:06:12.091 --> 02:06:17.091
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about 7 billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even phony happened once a day.</v>

3182
02:06:17.730 --> 02:06:20.040
<v Speaker 1>That's still only one thing a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>

3183
02:06:20.250 --> 02:06:22.230
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it is up to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the,</v>

3184
02:06:22.231 --> 02:06:23.850
<v Speaker 1>they'll probably have to educate kids in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

3185
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:24.451
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3186
02:06:24.451 --> 02:06:25.830
<v Speaker 1>When you see something going around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>

3187
02:06:25.831 --> 02:06:26.664
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to fact check it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be much more </v>

3188
02:06:29.431 --> 02:06:33.210
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated ways of understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not someone's being honest.</v>

3189
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.313
<v Speaker 1>And I think what we're looking at now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like when people started reading </v>

3190
02:06:38.581 --> 02:06:39.414
<v Speaker 1>books that were written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never imagined that someone was </v>

3191
02:06:41.671 --> 02:06:44.280
<v Speaker 1>going to have a printing press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when people had a printing press,</v>

3192
02:06:44.281 --> 02:06:45.114
<v Speaker 1>no one was ever going to imagine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to put that on the </v>

3193
02:06:46.531 --> 02:06:47.364
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's probably something </v>

3194
02:06:48.811 --> 02:06:49.644
<v Speaker 1>around the band right now for us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to radically change the </v>

3195
02:06:53.521 --> 02:06:56.700
<v Speaker 1>factual interpretation of information.</v>

3196
02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to know what's real </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's not.</v>

3197
02:06:59.521 --> 02:07:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably going to be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not even going to understand</v>

3198
02:07:02.911 --> 02:07:06.330
<v Speaker 1>what it's about now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that as technology evolves and it's</v>

3199
02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:08.370
<v Speaker 1>bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an exponential way,</v>

3200
02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:12.870
<v Speaker 1>they're going to reach some new critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of distributing information and then</v>

3201
02:07:12.871 --> 02:07:13.704
<v Speaker 1>things are going to get very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the way they're strange now where </v>

3202
02:07:16.621 --> 02:07:20.790
<v Speaker 1>we have this radical new ability to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>out content like you do or I do.</v>

3203
02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:21.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the future there's going to </v>

3204
02:07:23.191 --> 02:07:24.024
<v Speaker 1>be another change that's just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>monumental and justice huge and it's </v>

3205
02:07:27.271 --> 02:07:30.000
<v Speaker 1>probably going to deal with how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>interface with that data.</v>

3206
02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Like some sort of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3207
02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:36.400
<v Speaker 1>but wearable thing or a mind thing where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can recognize patterns</v>

3208
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.233
<v Speaker 2>as being true or untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Recognize humans is being honest or </v>

3209
02:07:41.381 --> 02:07:43.030
<v Speaker 2>dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're going to be able to see,</v>

3210
02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:45.070
<v Speaker 2>you're going to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3211
02:07:45.071 --> 02:07:45.940
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get to,</v>

3212
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:46.863
<v Speaker 2>you know what people are really worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the lack of privacy now I feel </v>

3213
02:07:51.431 --> 02:07:54.820
<v Speaker 2>like that is just step one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell this ultimate,</v>

3214
02:07:54.821 --> 02:07:59.210
<v Speaker 2>very bizarre symbiotic relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have with each other and,</v>

3215
02:07:59.211 --> 02:08:00.044
<v Speaker 2>and technology where we're going to beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside each other's heads in a very </v>

3216
02:08:03.101 --> 02:08:04.360
<v Speaker 2>simple way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes back.</v>

3217
02:08:04.361 --> 02:08:05.680
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of what I was saying about </v>
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

3265
02:09:34.961 --> 02:09:35.700
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know I have that devalued story.</v>

3271
02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Like someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely something,</v>

3272
02:09:48.191 --> 02:09:49.380
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't not,</v>

3273
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:50.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is this,</v>

3274
02:09:50.311 --> 02:09:51.144
<v Speaker 2>this is the point in like if we got into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a future where literally everyone's </v>

3275
02:09:52.421 --> 02:09:53.254
<v Speaker 2>going to know everything about everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then nothing's really going to matter </v>

3276
02:09:55.061 --> 02:09:56.110
<v Speaker 2>about any person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3277
02:09:56.111 --> 02:09:56.741
<v Speaker 2>they seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3278
02:09:56.741 --> 02:09:57.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So it's not gonna be shameful.</v>

3281
02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to be shameful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing and be shocking.</v>

3282
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would just know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows everything about everyone</v>

<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3309
02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Some legitimacy point being that a fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>news story wiped out the value of it,</v>

3310
02:11:10.041 --> 02:11:12.650
<v Speaker 1>but maybe now's the time to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3311
02:11:12.710 --> 02:11:13.543
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's got no value and it's probably </v>

3312
02:11:14.481 --> 02:11:17.640
<v Speaker 1>going to go back up cause this wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real thing about it again in ground pool</v>

3313
02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:19.280
<v Speaker 1>dive in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a chance.</v>

3314
02:11:19.281 --> 02:11:22.730
<v Speaker 1>I didn't make it well that you got it.</v>

3315
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:26.180
<v Speaker 1>What does it take story about the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that created it died in a car crash.</v>

3316
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:27.163
<v Speaker 1>Oh everybody panel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then everyone panicked because the </v>

3317
02:11:29.781 --> 02:11:30.351
<v Speaker 1>creator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3318
02:11:30.351 --> 02:11:34.160
<v Speaker 1>it's controlling the money in the market</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it supposedly died.</v>

3319
02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Well that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3320
02:11:36.011 --> 02:11:39.440
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still hot attack for him though.</v>

3321
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:40.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3324
02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Can you even imagine the other weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>part?</v>

3325
02:11:45.351 --> 02:11:46.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not stock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3326
02:11:46.890 --> 02:11:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the value of marketing?</v>

3327
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:52.160
<v Speaker 1>That's another one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories of the last year.</v>

3328
02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:53.870
<v Speaker 1>The Fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh story.</v>

3329
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:54.883
<v Speaker 1>That woman who was a pretending to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the news female Steve Jobs and she had </v>

3330
02:11:59.391 --> 02:12:00.224
<v Speaker 1>the look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everybody went with it and she had </v>

3331
02:12:01.881 --> 02:12:04.910
<v Speaker 1>this blood testing procedure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally didn't work.</v>

3332
02:12:04.911 --> 02:12:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Didn't look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great story.</v>

3333
02:12:07.070 --> 02:12:10.430
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was touted as being the next genius.</v>

3334
02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:12.530
<v Speaker 1>She dressed exactly like Steve Jobs.</v>

3335
02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:13.573
<v Speaker 1>She wore black turtlenecks and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hilarious and she gave this </v>

3336
02:12:16.721 --> 02:12:19.550
<v Speaker 1>speech to like women in something or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

3337
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:20.623
<v Speaker 1>but the speech was so like jumbled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty and there's so much poverty of </v>

3338
02:12:26.391 --> 02:12:28.250
<v Speaker 1>words in our sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

3339
02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:30.350
<v Speaker 1>the content was just so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3340
02:12:30.351 --> 02:12:31.970
<v Speaker 1>this is a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3341
02:12:31.971 --> 02:12:32.804
<v Speaker 1>maybe she's like super awkward and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous and maybe she just didn't </v>

3342
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:37.610
<v Speaker 1>prepare this speech at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3343
02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:38.593
<v Speaker 1>turns out choosing massive fraud things </v>
<v Speaker 1>at massive fraud and her $34 billion </v>

3344
02:12:42.831 --> 02:12:43.664
<v Speaker 1>company vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the company had a product that they </v>

3345
02:12:47.601 --> 02:12:48.434
<v Speaker 1>were using where they were doing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood tests and a whistle blower from </v>

3346
02:12:52.041 --> 02:12:53.450
<v Speaker 1>inside the company said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person,</v>

3347
02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:54.313
<v Speaker 1>they're ignoring all the bad data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were ignoring all the failed tasks </v>

3348
02:12:57.321 --> 02:12:59.600
<v Speaker 1>that they're pretending it's much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient than it is.</v>

3349
02:12:59.950 --> 02:13:00.741
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

3350
02:13:00.741 --> 02:13:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Not only did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not work,</v>

3351
02:13:02.090 --> 02:13:05.240
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of people who took</v>
<v Speaker 1>these tests,</v>

3352
02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:06.113
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're exposed to potential health </v>

3353
02:13:07.071 --> 02:13:08.330
<v Speaker 1>threats because they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3354
02:13:08.331 --> 02:13:09.140
<v Speaker 1>this is Heston.</v>

3355
02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:11.120
<v Speaker 1>They know what I know where my blood is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3356
02:13:11.121 --> 02:13:13.210
<v Speaker 1>So you could have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3357
02:13:13.211 --> 02:13:17.510
<v Speaker 1>a more cautious or less cautious based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this or got treatment that you didn't</v>

3358
02:13:17.511 --> 02:13:18.344
<v Speaker 1>need based on this or didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment that you probably did need </v>

3359
02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:22.880
<v Speaker 1>based on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3360
02:13:23.010 --> 02:13:23.843
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they imagined the kind of person who </v>

3361
02:13:24.651 --> 02:13:26.950
<v Speaker 1>does that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's standing there bullshitting.</v>

3362
02:13:26.951 --> 02:13:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm sociopath was at risk sociopath in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sort of a way.</v>

3363
02:13:30.450 --> 02:13:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some or unless she was lied to too.</v>

3364
02:13:34.170 --> 02:13:35.003
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows exactly what the actual story </v>

3365
02:13:36.601 --> 02:13:38.400
<v Speaker 1>is you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

3366
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:39.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whistleblower saying no,</v>

3367
02:13:39.781 --> 02:13:42.030
<v Speaker 1>she's absolutely aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now she's,</v>

3368
02:13:42.270 --> 02:13:47.270
<v Speaker 1>she went from being like the number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>self made female entrepreneur ever where</v>

3369
02:13:48.001 --> 02:13:53.001
<v Speaker 1>she was worth like $34 billion or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something crazy to massive debt.</v>

3370
02:13:53.130 --> 02:13:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Now our company is worth nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>

3371
02:13:55.651 --> 02:13:59.580
<v Speaker 1>So she fired a shit load of people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the company still exists as an entity,</v>

3372
02:13:59.581 --> 02:14:00.414
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like one of those really tortured </v>

3373
02:14:01.621 --> 02:14:01.920
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3374
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:04.470
<v Speaker 1>There's lawsuits are flying around left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and right now,</v>

3375
02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:07.950
<v Speaker 1>but the whole story is a cautionary tale</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like what,</v>

3376
02:14:08.070 --> 02:14:10.860
<v Speaker 1>what we're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking for this thing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't know.</v>

3382
02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:24.720
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even have a background in </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical science.</v>

3383
02:14:24.721 --> 02:14:26.340
<v Speaker 1>She's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't have a degree.</v>

3384
02:14:26.630 --> 02:14:27.463

3409
02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:23.813
<v Speaker 1>it's not discrediting women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not discrediting the idea of a </v>

3410
02:15:26.101 --> 02:15:26.934
<v Speaker 1>genius woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not discrediting the idea of a </v>

3411
02:15:28.501 --> 02:15:29.334
<v Speaker 1>genius entrepreneurial woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this is fascinating to me is a </v>

3412
02:15:32.611 --> 02:15:37.611
<v Speaker 1>person who fits all of these categories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are clearly looking for.</v>

<v Speaker 1>answer is.</v>

3415
02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because confirmation bias,</v>

3416
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:45.420
<v Speaker 1>and we love the fact that it's strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman is doing this.</v>

3417

02:15:56.521 --> 02:15:57.001
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3424
02:15:57.001 --> 02:15:57.721
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3425
02:15:57.721 --> 02:16:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I know that she's the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm filling for Alexander macron.</v>

3426
02:16:00.331 --> 02:16:01.164
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Yo,</v>

02:16:01.230 --> 02:16:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm with her on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3428
02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:03.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3429
02:16:03.151 --> 02:16:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm with her when she thinks wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that she's a woman,</v>

3430
02:16:05.671 --> 02:16:09.390
<v Speaker 1>it's the way she fucking thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we just be honest about this?</v>

3431

<v Speaker 1>I can't believe the judge Germany get </v>

3434
02:16:15.361 --> 02:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>rid of Merkel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

3436
02:16:18.810 --> 02:16:21.300
<v Speaker 1>She's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I know about her,</v>

3437
02:16:21.330 --> 02:16:22.163
<v Speaker 1>if I know who's running Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gentleman's just can't help </v>

3438
02:16:25.471 --> 02:16:27.360
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing over there?</v>

3439
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with wall with her.</v>

3440
02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:33.430
<v Speaker 2>That's an Ma Ma Merkel's I speak to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

3441
02:16:33.431 --> 02:16:35.080
<v Speaker 2>My friend crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tells me about these things.</v>

3442
02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:38.470
<v Speaker 2>She's famous for her and I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say flip flopping,</v>

3443
02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:39.603
<v Speaker 2>but I would like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would actually be a little more </v>

3444
02:16:40.681 --> 02:16:41.890
<v Speaker 2>charitable than say her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3445
02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:47.800
<v Speaker 2>her navigation of the political wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary in that way,</v>

3446
02:16:47.801 --> 02:16:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I guess why she uses is an opportunist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one.</v>

3447
02:16:51.170 --> 02:16:54.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it's unfair to call opportunists</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's sailors really,</v>

3448
02:16:54.731 --> 02:16:56.080
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's being a smart politician,</v>

3449
02:16:56.081 --> 02:16:56.920
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's saying well,</v>

3450
02:16:57.250 --> 02:16:58.083
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

3451
02:16:58.090 --> 02:17:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are people going that's important,</v>

3452
02:17:00.341 --> 02:17:02.440
<v Speaker 2>that smarter anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3453
02:17:02.441 --> 02:17:03.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

3454
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:04.023
<v Speaker 2>I think it means you lack credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you look like you don't stand </v>

3455
02:17:06.791 --> 02:17:07.720
<v Speaker 2>for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

3456
02:17:08.050 --> 02:17:08.883
<v Speaker 2>as much as trump lies and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lied all the 600 plus times in the </v>

3457
02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:15.820
<v Speaker 2>hundred plus times that he was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

3458
02:17:15.821 --> 02:17:19.480
<v Speaker 2>They did a count of all the times he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said things that weren't true publicly.</v>

3459
02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:22.690
<v Speaker 2>As much as he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows that's what he does.</v>

3460
02:17:23.210 --> 02:17:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Like they know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know what he does.</v>

3461
02:17:25.661 --> 02:17:26.494
<v Speaker 2>They know he tweets all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if he tweets something </v>

3462
02:17:28.841 --> 02:17:30.820
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know who that is.</v>

3463
02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:33.070
<v Speaker 2>That's that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's him.</v>

3464
02:17:33.071 --> 02:17:34.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what he really thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's saying it.</v>

3465
02:17:35.290 --> 02:17:39.340
<v Speaker 2>You never got that with Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you got is these weird boiled down</v>

3466
02:17:39.341 --> 02:17:42.070
<v Speaker 2>messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like they were put together in</v>

3467
02:17:42.071 --> 02:17:45.370
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a of a writer's room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3468
02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:46.061
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3469
02:17:46.061 --> 02:17:48.340
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't control its twitter account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3470
02:17:48.670 --> 02:17:49.503
<v Speaker 2>Doubtedly but trump undoubtedly is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>control of his and 200% it's so </v>

3471
02:17:53.081 --> 02:17:54.760
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was hilarious.</v>

3472
02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:56.800
<v Speaker 2>She wrote to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>delete your account.</v>

3473
02:17:57.210 --> 02:17:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

3474
02:17:58.900 --> 02:18:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Legit banter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

3475
02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:02.710
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to give it up to her there,</v>

3476
02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:05.320
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know who wrote that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably some 20 year old kid somewhere.</v>

3477
02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:06.630
<v Speaker 2>She probably wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3478
02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Gursky's work at four 12 guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3479
02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:10.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She for the social media manager at </v>

3480
02:18:11.351 --> 02:18:12.184
<v Speaker 2>Wendy's tweeted out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pepe the of the Wendy's icon as a peppy </v>

3481
02:18:15.490 --> 02:18:16.750
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3482
02:18:16.751 --> 02:18:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute shit on.</v>

3483
02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:20.290
<v Speaker 2>They were forced to delete it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who knows what?</v>

3484
02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:21.124
<v Speaker 2>That person still has a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people who think that pepe is </v>

3485
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:25.630
<v Speaker 2>outright and you're saying Pepsi's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>outright.</v>

3486
02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:26.650
<v Speaker 2>They all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use pam pay.</v>

3487
02:18:26.651 --> 02:18:29.920
<v Speaker 2>But everyone uses pepe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pepe is a ubiquitous internet symbol,</v>

3488
02:18:30.670 --> 02:18:34.510
<v Speaker 2>sort of dissonance and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More importantly,</v>

3489
02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:36.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disrespect,</v>

3490
02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:41.280
<v Speaker 2>but isn't keck like the god of chaos or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensate up,</v>

3491
02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:42.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little made up,</v>

3492
02:18:42.801 --> 02:18:45.010
<v Speaker 2>made up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think is makeup.</v>

3493
02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:47.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you die and you meet Keck?</v>

3494
02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Would you be feeling bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you said he was made up.</v>

3495
02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll be quite surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

3496
02:18:52.721 --> 02:18:53.554
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to work with me </v>

3497
02:18:54.371 --> 02:18:55.420
<v Speaker 2>here because let's be honest.</v>

3498
02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Would you have believed it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3499
02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:00.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

3500
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:03.700
<v Speaker 2>that would be so shocked if he let her </v>
<v Speaker 2>gold robe.</v>

3501
02:19:03.890 --> 02:19:06.940
<v Speaker 2>It was a frog and you got to have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>oncology and there's,</v>

3502
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:07.833
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it literally looks like pepe then that </v>

3503
02:19:10.470 --> 02:19:12.940
<v Speaker 2>he's got a gold robe on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I piss off?</v>

3504
02:19:12.941 --> 02:19:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Like literally everyone who believes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a religion,</v>

3505
02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:18.520
<v Speaker 2>why would you want to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what about hope?</v>

3506
02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:20.013
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it just struck you as in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>childish fucking thing that depends on </v>

3507
02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:23.333
<v Speaker 2>what I'm going to go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Nino not scientology that that's </v>

3508
02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.790
<v Speaker 2>starting to make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell actually,</v>

3509
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:30.200
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said up,</v>

3510
02:19:30.210 --> 02:19:31.880
<v Speaker 2>been watching but said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

3511
02:19:31.881 --> 02:19:32.714
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously wishful thinking and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious because you're afraid of dying </v>

3512
02:19:34.131 --> 02:19:35.690
<v Speaker 2>and it's obviously that you just want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it.</v>

3513
02:19:35.691 --> 02:19:36.524
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking might just want that gold </v>

3514
02:19:37.941 --> 02:19:39.080
<v Speaker 2>metal and that is not true.</v>

3515
02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I want that scientology gold medal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave Tom cruise the big one,</v>

3516
02:19:44.811 --> 02:19:45.644
<v Speaker 2>like a laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like flavor flavor up there </v>

3517
02:19:47.331 --> 02:19:48.164
<v Speaker 2>with that fucking gold medal on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it so arrogant to think that </v>

3518
02:19:50.901 --> 02:19:53.060
<v Speaker 2>humans are so important that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go to an afterlife?</v>

3519
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:55.720
<v Speaker 2>It might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

3520
02:19:55.721 --> 02:19:56.554
<v Speaker 2>the afterlife isn't that arrogant to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's the idea is that like </v>

3521
02:20:00.890 --> 02:20:04.280
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to just pass on life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3522
02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:08.750
<v Speaker 2>And the mind understands that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a few tile effort.</v>

3523
02:20:08.780 --> 02:20:11.060
<v Speaker 2>You're temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a finite life,</v>

3524
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:12.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

3525
02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:13.460
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

3526
02:20:13.461 --> 02:20:14.294
<v Speaker 2>why even bother?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just end this now you're constantly </v>

3527
02:20:16.161 --> 02:20:17.960
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just jump off a building.</v>

3528
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.981
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3529
02:20:18.981 --> 02:20:19.814
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't do that because there's a </v>

3530
02:20:20.181 --> 02:20:22.880
<v Speaker 2>greater good waiting for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a greater thing.</v>

3531
02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:26.540
<v Speaker 2>There's another level of the video game </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make sense if,</v>

3532
02:20:26.541 --> 02:20:28.880
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to go to heaven when you</v>

3533
02:20:28.890 --> 02:20:30.560
<v Speaker 2>dunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill yourself,</v>

3534
02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:32.270
<v Speaker 2>but you can't.</v>

3535
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:35.240
<v Speaker 2>That's a loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't go to heaven.</v>

3536
02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill yourself.</v>

3537
02:20:36.861 --> 02:20:39.470
<v Speaker 2>You make the people around you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>loved you suffer.</v>

3538
02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:41.420
<v Speaker 2>So you don't go to heaven when you kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

3539
02:20:41.421 --> 02:20:43.650
<v Speaker 2>That's convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or it's God's plan.</v>

3540
02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:44.720
<v Speaker 2>They kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Richard?</v>

3542
02:20:46.191 --> 02:20:47.180
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3543
02:20:47.190 --> 02:20:50.460

<v Speaker 2>the prism cooling and kill cells.</v>

3544
02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they answered that with Jesus.</v>

3545
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Jesus on the cross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we still do this.</v>

3546
02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:55.273
<v Speaker 2>We literally make the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the cross sign that the thing that </v>

3547
02:20:58.881 --> 02:20:59.714
<v Speaker 2>killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>B Bill Hicks had a great joke about </v>

3548
02:21:01.431 --> 02:21:02.151
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3549
02:21:02.151 --> 02:21:04.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like going up to Jackie on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assets with a rifle on.</v>

3550
02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:06.113
<v Speaker 2>He was just thinking of John Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you'd like a pagan or </v>

3551
02:21:08.721 --> 02:21:11.240
<v Speaker 2>something back in like the seventh </v>
<v Speaker 2>century or whatever and you're,</v>

3553
02:21:11.691 --> 02:21:12.524
<v Speaker 2>northern European Lithuanian or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and then these Germans coming </v>

3554
02:21:14.551 --> 02:21:15.384
<v Speaker 2>in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3555
02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:17.420
<v Speaker 2>we've got this religion about dead guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

3558
02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:24.680
<v Speaker 2>it's really sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really sad story.</v>

3559
02:21:24.681 --> 02:21:26.090
<v Speaker 2>But he died for your sins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3560
02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:28.940
<v Speaker 2>every way you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy just being killed on the cross.</v>

3561
02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:29.811
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3562
02:21:29.811 --> 02:21:33.440
<v Speaker 2>my religion is way more fun than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3563
02:21:33.441 --> 02:21:34.274
<v Speaker 2>You have the original sin too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the great thing that you brought </v>

3564
02:21:36.441 --> 02:21:37.274
<v Speaker 2>up earlier about being white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's sort of like just being a </v>

3565
02:21:40.041 --> 02:21:41.390
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The original sin,</v>

3566
02:21:41.391 --> 02:21:42.224
<v Speaker 2>the only way they can have complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>total control over you is to say that </v>

3567
02:21:44.181 --> 02:21:45.014
<v Speaker 2>you are guilty no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just by virtue of being born believing </v>

3568
02:21:47.651 --> 02:21:50.350
<v Speaker 2>of guilty if then it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3569
02:21:50.390 --> 02:21:51.223
<v Speaker 2>It starts from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this all knowing infinite thing </v>

3570
02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:56.000
<v Speaker 2>that looks over the universe is </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly petty.</v>

3571
02:21:56.001 --> 02:21:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Very jealous if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

3572
02:21:58.620 --> 02:22:00.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go well that's worship.</v>

3573
02:22:00.201 --> 02:22:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other false idols?</v>

3574
02:22:02.090 --> 02:22:05.030
<v Speaker 2>DEF You wear two different types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes.</v>

3575

3577
02:22:06.980 --> 02:22:07.813
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting cause there there've </v>

3578
02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:11.270
<v Speaker 2>been religions in the past that thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was an evil God,</v>

3579
02:22:11.650 --> 02:22:12.483
<v Speaker 2>the crate to the earth and everything in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the F is created by an evil God and </v>

3580
02:22:15.381 --> 02:22:16.214
<v Speaker 2>there is a loving God beyond it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't pray to it and has no </v>

3581
02:22:18.861 --> 02:22:19.694
<v Speaker 2>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3582
02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:20.533
<v Speaker 2>The Yoni,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get past earth yet basically </v>

3583
02:22:22.071 --> 02:22:23.670
<v Speaker 2>you have to live a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And eventually Ocala,</v>

3584
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:24.703
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's like this is a level of the </v>

3585
02:22:25.771 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>video</v>

3586
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:26.840
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3587
02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get past those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3588
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:31.800
<v Speaker 1>What if it did you get through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

3589
02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:32.753
<v Speaker 1>I'll put money on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth anything in the </v>

3590
02:22:34.321 --> 02:22:35.340
<v Speaker 1>afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3593
02:22:37.381 --> 02:22:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And in the US I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it's true in the afterlife,</v>

3594
02:22:39.871 --> 02:22:40.704
<v Speaker 1>all blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the absolute no one has in the </v>

<v Speaker 1>afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're like in a few real being,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3601
02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:54.953

<v Speaker 1>Look at the quote.</v>

3652
02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I just want to bless everyone with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

3653
02:25:13.021 --> 02:25:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I had talked with Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

3654
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.903
<v Speaker 1>Showed me a lot of love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to get back up there with </v>

3655
02:25:19.231 --> 02:25:20.064
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3656
02:25:24.660 --> 02:25:26.770
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You met the king of kings.</v>

3657
02:25:26.771 --> 02:25:31.390
<v Speaker 3>You met the son of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You met her and this is what he says.</v>

3658
02:25:31.450 --> 02:25:35.140
<v Speaker 3>He says he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He showed me a lot of love.</v>

3659
02:25:35.170 --> 02:25:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well for sure.</v>

3660
02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:39.400
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like you had a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent experience with Jesus.</v>

3661
02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:43.450
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pictures on his galaxy smartphone.</v>

3662
02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:48.720
<v Speaker 3>He brought his fucking Samsung up into </v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven was Paul.</v>

3663
02:25:49.970 --> 02:25:50.803
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's basically [inaudible] stories </v>

3664
02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:53.200
<v Speaker 3>based on a lot of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3665
02:25:53.201 --> 02:25:54.770
<v Speaker 3>so someone was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3666
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:59.790
<v Speaker 3>like Enoch was taken up into the crystal</v>
<v Speaker 3>ship of God or Holy Shit,</v>

3667
02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:03.550
<v Speaker 3>it's just whole shit made up by idiots </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years ago.</v>

3668
02:26:03.770 --> 02:26:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't explain what's going on,</v>

3669
02:26:06.281 --> 02:26:08.020
<v Speaker 3>but they are kind of scared of getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

3670
02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:11.230
<v Speaker 3>And that's because it might really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen really fucking soon.</v>

3671
02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Let's get rid of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3672
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:14.590
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about an oral tradition.</v>

3673
02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Like those todd talked for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and then by the time someone wrote</v>

3674
02:26:19.271 --> 02:26:20.104
<v Speaker 3>it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3675
02:26:20.170 --> 02:26:21.003
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't the original Bible like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand years old by the time anybody </v>

3676
02:26:23.291 --> 02:26:25.750
<v Speaker 3>wrote it down a well and validly that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

3677
02:26:25.751 --> 02:26:27.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean we don't know how old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause there was an old,</v>

3678
02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:28.213
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3679
02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:29.053
<v Speaker 3>Come from anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3680
02:26:29.770 --> 02:26:30.603
<v Speaker 3>will also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you hear like the similarities </v>

3681
02:26:31.811 --> 02:26:34.390
<v Speaker 3>between like the Sumerian tech stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>like oh yeah,</v>

3682
02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:36.400
<v Speaker 3>the epic of Gilgamesh is smear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3683
02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:38.980
<v Speaker 3>Really similar to Noah's Ark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3684
02:26:38.981 --> 02:26:40.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pitched him who,</v>

3685
02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:41.321
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3686
02:26:41.321 --> 02:26:43.450
<v Speaker 3>survived the flood and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

3687
02:26:43.451 --> 02:26:45.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like really so similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the,</v>

3688
02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:47.020
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost the same words,</v>

3689
02:26:47.021 --> 02:26:51.040
<v Speaker 3>just replacing God with gods while they </v>
<v Speaker 3>oversee from by God's with God.</v>

3690
02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:51.933
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the things we can even pinpoint the </v>

3691
02:26:53.171 --> 02:26:54.004
<v Speaker 3>sort of time there's likely to have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>adopted into the religion during the </v>

3692
02:26:57.551 --> 02:26:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Babylonian Exxon.</v>

3693
02:26:58.450 --> 02:27:02.950
<v Speaker 3>When the Assyrians conquered the nation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Israel and left Judah,</v>

3694
02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:03.933
<v Speaker 3>they undoubtedly that they took them </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to all the series of Babylonians </v>

3695
02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:09.153
<v Speaker 3>under Nebuchadnezzar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took them back to Babylon and then </v>

3696
02:27:10.871 --> 02:27:13.240
<v Speaker 3>they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the smart Jews were the elite,</v>

3697
02:27:13.241 --> 02:27:16.150
<v Speaker 3>the educated people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And unsurprisingly,</v>

3698
02:27:16.151 --> 02:27:18.860
<v Speaker 3>suddenly the myths includes loads of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamia.</v>

3699
02:27:18.861 --> 02:27:20.320
<v Speaker 3>My ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3700
02:27:20.321 --> 02:27:21.700
<v Speaker 3>what did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genius.</v>

3701
02:27:21.701 --> 02:27:22.534
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they go back and so all of a </v>

3702
02:27:23.501 --> 02:27:24.161
<v Speaker 3>sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3703
02:27:24.161 --> 02:27:25.240
<v Speaker 3>it's cool incorporated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3704
02:27:25.241 --> 02:27:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3705
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.903
<v Speaker 3>this is a whole shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all bull shit and there's no </v>

3706
02:27:28.421 --> 02:27:29.254
<v Speaker 3>benefit into really trying to include </v>
<v Speaker 3>the older stuff that they find each </v>

3707
02:27:31.790 --> 02:27:34.540
<v Speaker 3>other and try to like figure out whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not these are connected.</v>

3708
02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:36.100
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

3709
02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:38.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are so many golds.</v>

3710
02:27:38.321 --> 02:27:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Why that one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why that one?</v>

3711
02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:42.100
<v Speaker 3>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably cause you grew up with it,</v>

3712
02:27:42.101 --> 02:27:42.760
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3713
02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:44.290
<v Speaker 3>You weren't reasoned until that ability </v>
<v Speaker 3>you went,</v>

3714
02:27:44.291 --> 02:27:45.400
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you weren't reasonable and positioning,</v>

3715
02:27:45.401 --> 02:27:46.360
<v Speaker 3>you didn't send anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3716
02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:49.970
<v Speaker 3>I've had a think and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>melodic.</v>

3717
02:27:50.060 --> 02:27:52.060
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about it.</v>

3718
02:27:52.090 --> 02:27:54.170
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking Tmr yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was wild.</v>

3719
02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:56.860
<v Speaker 3>It tame amount you couldn't really have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause that's like a primordial God.</v>

3720
02:27:57.010 --> 02:27:58.600
<v Speaker 3>But that's how I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the old ones.</v>

3721
02:27:58.720 --> 02:27:59.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they don't then,</v>

3722
02:27:59.580 --> 02:28:00.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't pray Tim outside Krom No </v>

3723
02:28:02.210 --> 02:28:03.440
<v Speaker 3>pray to crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't listen.</v>

3724
02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:04.720
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

3725
02:28:05.290 --> 02:28:07.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean I like Asher to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3726
02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:08.780
<v Speaker 3>wished her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3727
02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:10.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

3728
02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:12.460
<v Speaker 3>it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all nonsense.</v>

3729
02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:15.160
<v Speaker 3>It's all a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's fascinating.</v>

3730
02:28:15.161 --> 02:28:15.994
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting to me is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>historical idea that these people were </v>

3731
02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:22.880
<v Speaker 3>living by these stories like thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>of years ago.</v>

3732
02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:25.280
<v Speaker 2>And like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you try to put it in context.</v>

3733
02:28:25.281 --> 02:28:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what it would be like living </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years ago with no science,</v>

3734
02:28:29.511 --> 02:28:33.290
<v Speaker 2>with no education and limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the world around you.</v>

3735
02:28:33.291 --> 02:28:37.370
<v Speaker 2>And then there you are abiding by these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient stories.</v>

3736
02:28:37.371 --> 02:28:40.610
<v Speaker 2>And it's a fascinating thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>

3737
02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:41.444
<v Speaker 2>That's really fascinating stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been dave and deciphering that </v>

3738
02:28:44.421 --> 02:28:45.254
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they don't incorporate it into the </v>

3739
02:28:46.341 --> 02:28:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Christian doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3740
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:49.063
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a party to codify to Kong </v>

3741
02:28:50.430 --> 02:28:52.760
<v Speaker 2>revisit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they do about that?</v>

3742
02:28:52.761 --> 02:28:53.594
<v Speaker 2>Because if they know that that's ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious text and it's as old as </v>

3743
02:28:56.631 --> 02:28:58.280
<v Speaker 2>anything that they've found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3744
02:28:58.310 --> 02:29:01.670
<v Speaker 2>It's the oldest version of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's old as fuck.</v>

3745
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these,</v>

3746
02:29:03.530 --> 02:29:04.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't use it.</v>

3747
02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:05.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3748
02:29:05.541 --> 02:29:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let's,</v>

3749
02:29:06.471 --> 02:29:07.304
<v Speaker 2>cause they'd have to change the beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they went reasoned into these </v>

3750
02:29:09.111 --> 02:29:09.980
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're gonna be like,</v>

3751
02:29:09.981 --> 02:29:10.814
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have,</v>

3752
02:29:10.930 --> 02:29:11.600
<v Speaker 2>they just ignore it.</v>

3753
02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:12.920
<v Speaker 2>They've got a narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just ignore it.</v>

3754
02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:13.843
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the official position of like the </v>

3755
02:29:15.861 --> 02:29:18.830
<v Speaker 2>Catholic church is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>

3756
02:29:18.831 --> 02:29:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit with the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Church says I'm fascinating.</v>

3757
02:29:21.530 --> 02:29:22.011
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3758
02:29:22.011 --> 02:29:23.690
<v Speaker 2>but one thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3759
02:29:24.510 --> 02:29:25.231
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna say,</v>

3760
02:29:25.231 --> 02:29:27.670
<v Speaker 2>one thing that bugs me about fit is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3761
02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna say answering,</v>

3762
02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:31.100
<v Speaker 2>how does this pull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you brought the Catholic church.</v>

3763
02:29:31.270 --> 02:29:32.103
<v Speaker 2>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we blew a fuse and my brother Catholic </v>

3764
02:29:33.430 --> 02:29:34.200
<v Speaker 2>churches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3765
02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:35.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

3771
02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:49.580
<v Speaker 2>This is one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't talking about a problem that's</v>

3778
02:29:58.851 --> 02:30:01.070
<v Speaker 2>external to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying I have a problem.</v>

3779
02:30:01.071 --> 02:30:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I believe something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in God.</v>

3780
02:30:04.221 --> 02:30:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I believe that black people are this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that white people this,</v>

3781
02:30:06.680 --> 02:30:06.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me,</v>

3784
02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:09.193
<v Speaker 2>tell me about the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>external to you that actually are </v>

3785
02:30:10.461 --> 02:30:11.294
<v Speaker 2>affecting things you know in you rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than things that are in you that are </v>

3786
02:30:13.671 --> 02:30:14.840
<v Speaker 2>coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about that.</v>

3787
02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:15.973
<v Speaker 2>You've got this the wrong way round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just find it fascinating that there's </v>

3788
02:30:18.441 --> 02:30:23.150
<v Speaker 2>like a certain level of like when you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in time,</v>

3789
02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:24.013
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain level of history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they way you just ignore those </v>

3790
02:30:26.511 --> 02:30:29.630
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you get past 4,000</v>

3791
02:30:29.631 --> 02:30:32.390
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an epic of Gilgamesh is no one just</v>

3792
02:30:32.391 --> 02:30:34.900
<v Speaker 2>trying to live by the Sumerian texts.</v>

3793
02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:36.500
<v Speaker 2>There's no one as treating that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

3794
02:30:36.501 --> 02:30:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3795
02:30:36.980 --> 02:30:40.890
<v Speaker 2>The ancient Mesopotamian stories are </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically thought of is purely myths.</v>

3796
02:30:40.891 --> 02:30:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like Odin and thor and zoom,</v>

3797
02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:45.620
<v Speaker 2>that's all abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at one point in time,</v>

3798
02:30:45.621 --> 02:30:46.454
<v Speaker 2>that was the ideology to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the way that God's never really </v>

3799
02:30:49.041 --> 02:30:49.874
<v Speaker 2>get resurrected and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really believe the neo pagans </v>

3800
02:30:52.851 --> 02:30:54.710
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I actually believe in this night.</v>

3801
02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Don't you just think it's cool?</v>

3806
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:06.470
<v Speaker 2>That was like 19th century or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>to allow that was invented.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll show you where it is.</v>

3826
02:31:43.050 --> 02:31:45.000
<v Speaker 3>The angels knew we were coming and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>took it away.</v>

<v Speaker 3>getting lost.</v>

3834
02:32:01.861 --> 02:32:03.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite thing about the Quran</v>

3835
02:32:03.451 --> 02:32:06.280

<v Speaker 3>basically,</v>

3836

<v Speaker 3>he used to pull these fucking dictates </v>
<v Speaker 3>from God,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paraphrasing,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>convenient times for you,</v>

3844
02:32:25.111 --> 02:32:25.944
<v Speaker 3>magnet because it's obvious you pulling </v>
<v Speaker 3>this shit out of your ass for your own </v>

3845
02:32:29.191 --> 02:32:30.750
<v Speaker 3>convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

3846
02:32:31.230 --> 02:32:33.420
<v Speaker 3>and there were some really gross things </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Mohammed as well.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I better not go and took some will </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably kill me.</v>

3848
02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:36.653
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That you believe would have to worry </v>

3849
02:32:37.741 --> 02:32:38.700
<v Speaker 3>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3850
02:32:38.701 --> 02:32:39.534
<v Speaker 3>Legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3851
02:32:40.170 --> 02:32:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3852
02:32:41.011 --> 02:32:44.540
<v Speaker 3>people who have a mocked since we've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>some time anyway,</v>

3853
02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:46.950
<v Speaker 3>we were on the subject of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's worth talking about.</v>

3854
02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Wahhabism I've been learning about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

3855
02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3856
02:32:50.640 --> 02:32:55.380
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy and Muslims hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the sjws of the Muslim world.</v>

3857
02:32:55.890 --> 02:32:56.723
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if the country was taken over by</v>
<v Speaker 3>rabid sjws who had access to weaponry </v>

3858
02:33:02.410 --> 02:33:02.670
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

3859
02:33:02.670 --> 02:33:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Scary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3860
02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:04.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if they had in every city like </v>

3861
02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:07.020
<v Speaker 3>sjw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>police,</v>

3862
02:33:07.380 --> 02:33:08.460
<v Speaker 3>he went around saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3863
02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:10.110
<v Speaker 3>blacks over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whites over there,</v>

3864
02:33:10.290 --> 02:33:11.700
<v Speaker 3>men over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women over here.</v>

3865
02:33:11.970 --> 02:33:16.140
<v Speaker 3>And if you were even caught fraternizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the opposite race or sex,</v>

3866
02:33:16.410 --> 02:33:17.243
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get the lash or maybe </v>

3867
02:33:18.031 --> 02:33:19.760
<v Speaker 3>you get your hand chopped off for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3868
02:33:19.770 --> 02:33:20.603
<v Speaker 3>whatever punishment in sexual social </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice would meet out if given the </v>

3869
02:33:23.461 --> 02:33:24.294
<v Speaker 3>option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's basically what it was like in </v>

3870
02:33:26.371 --> 02:33:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia that under isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it really is in a lot of ways,</v>

3871
02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:32.370
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things that we've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about today,</v>

3872
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:33.383
<v Speaker 3>they're very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if these were deep grooves that are </v>

3873
02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:37.893
<v Speaker 3>human to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I imagine the kind of person who </v>

3874
02:33:40.051 --> 02:33:43.830
<v Speaker 3>wants to be the person who enforces that</v>
<v Speaker 3>right piece of shit.</v>

3875
02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:45.260
<v Speaker 3>That's why these social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>warriors,</v>

3876
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:47.760
<v Speaker 3>a piece of shit that's control freaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a control,</v>

3877
02:33:47.761 --> 02:33:49.310
<v Speaker 3>fixed moral busybodies.</v>

3878
02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:50.153
<v Speaker 3>I've got no real morals at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people who lack a certain amount of </v>

3879
02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:53.993
<v Speaker 3>objectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why that certain lady you kept </v>

3880
02:33:55.951 --> 02:34:00.951
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier feels like she can</v>
<v Speaker 3>say those terrible things about you.</v>

3881
02:34:02.250 --> 02:34:04.500
<v Speaker 3>But she caught herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3882
02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wrote ugly.</v>

3883
02:34:05.881 --> 02:34:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Everything they're saying is projection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3884
02:34:07.171 --> 02:34:08.940
<v Speaker 3>who's who's doing the abusing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's doing all of this?</v>

3885
02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.070
<v Speaker 3>It's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3886
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:12.810
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of this is really true.</v>

3887
02:34:13.350 --> 02:34:14.400
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3888
02:34:14.420 --> 02:34:15.300
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Islamic world,</v>

3889
02:34:15.301 --> 02:34:16.200
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the well hobbies.</v>

3890
02:34:16.470 --> 02:34:19.900
<v Speaker 3>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read a fulsome fanaticism by Sunday</v>

3891
02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:20.733
<v Speaker 3>Ross Valentine and English professor who</v>
<v Speaker 3>went and lived down Saudi Arabia for </v>

3892
02:34:22.751 --> 02:34:24.970
<v Speaker 3>three years to learn about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radiology.</v>

3893
02:34:25.330 --> 02:34:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

3894
02:34:25.930 --> 02:34:27.770
<v Speaker 3>really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3895
02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:29.193
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most fascinating things is </v>

3896
02:34:30.191 --> 02:34:32.910
<v Speaker 3>how much other Muslims don't like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hobbies.</v>

3897
02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:36.660
<v Speaker 3>And I'm using the term a hobby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

3898
02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:40.600
<v Speaker 3>it's a school of Islamic thought called </v>
<v Speaker 3>Salafism and it can best be described as</v>

3899
02:34:40.601 --> 02:34:41.770
<v Speaker 3>autistic screeching.</v>

3900
02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:46.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like taking a really hard line </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation,</v>

3901
02:34:46.330 --> 02:34:49.810
<v Speaker 3>ignoring other arguments against this </v>
<v Speaker 3>line interpretation and going,</v>

3902
02:34:49.811 --> 02:34:50.644
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just no,</v>

3903
02:34:50.730 --> 02:34:51.563
<v Speaker 3>not even listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just carrying on and seeing </v>

3904
02:34:52.991 --> 02:34:53.824
<v Speaker 3>where that train of logic guests you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly it gets to religious police </v>

3905
02:34:56.141 --> 02:34:56.974
<v Speaker 3>Sunday guess to throwing gays off </v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings and stuff on the regular </v>

3906
02:34:58.931 --> 02:35:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Muslims don't need to do because </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you know,</v>

3907
02:35:01.181 --> 02:35:02.014
<v Speaker 3>they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3908
02:35:02.290 --> 02:35:03.700
<v Speaker 3>not pro gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3909
02:35:04.090 --> 02:35:06.730
<v Speaker 3>this is another ent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Mohammed says,</v>

3910
02:35:06.731 --> 02:35:08.020
<v Speaker 3>don't kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3911
02:35:08.060 --> 02:35:10.240
<v Speaker 3>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some point in the Koran he says,</v>

3912
02:35:10.241 --> 02:35:11.200
<v Speaker 3>and so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of say,</v>

3913
02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:11.501
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3914
02:35:11.501 --> 02:35:13.240
<v Speaker 3>well I'm not going to kill someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3915
02:35:13.241 --> 02:35:13.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3916
02:35:13.930 --> 02:35:14.763
<v Speaker 3>maybe the gay thing was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of Muslims [inaudible] pro </v>

3917
02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:19.420
<v Speaker 3>death centers for sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3918
02:35:19.450 --> 02:35:19.930
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3919
02:35:19.930 --> 02:35:21.070
<v Speaker 3>they'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3920
02:35:21.071 --> 02:35:23.350
<v Speaker 3>everything's reasoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is argumentation,</v>

3921
02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:24.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3922
02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:25.053
<v Speaker 3>And so the important thing is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that they are persuaded into </v>

3923
02:35:28.391 --> 02:35:31.240
<v Speaker 3>becoming jehad jihadis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not,</v>

3924
02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:33.520
<v Speaker 3>and this is one thing the West has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

3925
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:36.850
<v Speaker 3>It is not that we're at war with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3926
02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:40.450
<v Speaker 3>You can go to isis is like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they produce magazines.</v>

3927
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one called Dabiq,</v>

3928
02:35:43.090 --> 02:35:46.540
<v Speaker 3>which was a city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they owned a but they lost it.</v>

3929
02:35:46.541 --> 02:35:48.580
<v Speaker 3>So they created a new one called </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

3930
02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:50.620
<v Speaker 3>which is Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they,</v>

3931
02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Arabic for Rome that they have conquered</v>
<v Speaker 3>before and not isis,</v>

3932
02:35:53.831 --> 02:35:56.780
<v Speaker 3>but Islam and want to conquer again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3933
02:35:56.781 --> 02:35:57.614
<v Speaker 3>then they literally say in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't really think it was like </v>

3934
02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:03.070
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They literally turn around and say,</v>

3935
02:36:03.370 --> 02:36:05.980
<v Speaker 3>we do not fight you because your bond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Middle East,</v>

3936
02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:09.160
<v Speaker 3>we fight you because you are not Muslims</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no,</v>

3937
02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:11.320
<v Speaker 3>it's not because you bombed the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>East.</v>

3938
02:36:11.350 --> 02:36:12.183
<v Speaker 3>Even if you stopped bombing Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will fight you until we become </v>

3939
02:36:14.741 --> 02:36:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Muslims.</v>

3940
02:36:15.370 --> 02:36:17.440
<v Speaker 3>This is why we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>

3941
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:19.900
<v Speaker 3>you bombing the Middle East isn't making</v>
<v Speaker 3>us like you anymore.</v>

3942
02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:23.470
<v Speaker 3>You know we're going to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We find you because you insult Muhammad,</v>

3943
02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:25.170
<v Speaker 3>we find you because you don't believe in</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowing.</v>

3944
02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:27.790
<v Speaker 3>There's profit in the last day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why we fight.</v>

3945
02:36:27.791 --> 02:36:28.624
<v Speaker 3>You do not misunderstand and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally address the liberal or the </v>

3946
02:36:31.151 --> 02:36:33.160
<v Speaker 3>progressive's or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you'd like to call them.</v>

3947
02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:35.290
<v Speaker 3>They're literally talking to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people saying,</v>

3948
02:36:35.291 --> 02:36:37.450
<v Speaker 3>don't think that we're crazy and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know.</v>

3949
02:36:37.451 --> 02:36:39.070
<v Speaker 3>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we believe.</v>

3950
02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:42.550
<v Speaker 3>You are cancer and we want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exterminate you basically,</v>

3951
02:36:42.940 --> 02:36:45.220
<v Speaker 3>and you get the sjws going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3952
02:36:45.221 --> 02:36:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of went bowling.</v>

3953
02:36:46.211 --> 02:36:48.580
<v Speaker 3>The music man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American foreign policy knows nothing to</v>

3954
02:36:48.581 --> 02:36:50.740
<v Speaker 3>do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about the argumentation.</v>

3955
02:36:51.010 --> 02:36:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Even if we will just peaceful peace </v>
<v Speaker 3>loving people who did nothing,</v>

3956
02:36:54.730 --> 02:36:56.110
<v Speaker 3>they would still be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I lost,</v>

3957
02:36:56.111 --> 02:36:57.010
<v Speaker 3>told me to cut your head off.</v>

3958
02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:57.873
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

3959
02:36:58.030 --> 02:37:02.590
<v Speaker 3>this is a small minority who are widely </v>
<v Speaker 3>despised by other Muslims.</v>

3960
02:37:02.591 --> 02:37:03.424
<v Speaker 3>I mean the like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you went to a Christian school and </v>

3961
02:37:05.921 --> 02:37:08.350
<v Speaker 3>everyone would probably be fairly chill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3962
02:37:08.530 --> 02:37:09.550
<v Speaker 3>you still going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3963
02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Catholic school or something and most </v>
<v Speaker 3>people you talk to,</v>

3964
02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:12.773
<v Speaker 3>they'll be fairly chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in every group of people you'd have </v>

3965
02:37:14.681 --> 02:37:15.514
<v Speaker 3>a couple people who would be the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people watching you and if you start </v>

3966
02:37:18.321 --> 02:37:20.500
<v Speaker 3>doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd go and get the nuns and,</v>

3967
02:37:20.501 --> 02:37:21.560
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get whack,</v>

3968
02:37:21.561 --> 02:37:22.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a day,</v>

3969
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:26.450
<v Speaker 3>you know that they are those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just for Islam.</v>

3970
02:37:26.810 --> 02:37:29.690
<v Speaker 3>They ended up going and killing things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in Islam you told right,</v>

3971
02:37:29.691 --> 02:37:30.830
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you die,</v>

3972
02:37:30.831 --> 02:37:32.360
<v Speaker 3>and this is another thing that drives me</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

3973
02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:33.290
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3974
02:37:33.290 --> 02:37:35.810
<v Speaker 3>the nine 11 hijackers with drinking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>carousing and,</v>

3975
02:37:36.020 --> 02:37:38.060
<v Speaker 3>and doing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're obviously not real Muslims now.</v>

3976
02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:38.893
<v Speaker 3>You fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think they're having all of their </v>

3977
02:37:41.451 --> 02:37:45.320
<v Speaker 3>sins expunged the second they die in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface of a lot.</v>

3978
02:37:45.321 --> 02:37:48.380
<v Speaker 3>This is what martyrdom is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter what you've done,</v>

3979
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:53.590
<v Speaker 3>you go to heaven and get your virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why wouldn't you do whatever the fuck</v>

3980
02:37:54.681 --> 02:37:55.514
<v Speaker 3>you like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a free pass because they know </v>

3981
02:37:56.291 --> 02:37:57.740
<v Speaker 3>they've got a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3982
02:37:57.741 --> 02:37:59.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when they're like,</v>

3983
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.830
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isis aren't ready,</v>

3984
02:38:00.831 --> 02:38:02.600
<v Speaker 3>Islamic cause look at they're doing at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least on his long things.</v>

3985
02:38:02.601 --> 02:38:04.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know they're going to die and they,</v>

3986
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:05.383
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the logic of the theology that they </v>

3987
02:38:07.581 --> 02:38:08.640
<v Speaker 3>live under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3988
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:09.523
<v Speaker 3>they think they get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to die and that they're </v>

3989
02:38:10.821 --> 02:38:13.610
<v Speaker 3>going to get out of rescinded Alyson </v>
<v Speaker 3>remission of sins.</v>

3990
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:14.503
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the most fascinating?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of it is just the things that </v>

3991
02:38:16.521 --> 02:38:19.910
<v Speaker 3>people are willing to believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] had been rezoned into it by.</v>

3992
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:21.170
<v Speaker 3>If you take like say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3993
02:38:21.171 --> 02:38:23.780
<v Speaker 3>I believe that the crime is the word of </v>
<v Speaker 3>God and I believe that her deaths in the</v>

3994
02:38:23.781 --> 02:38:24.614
<v Speaker 3>center of the actual sayings and doings </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the habit and you believe these </v>

3995
02:38:27.141 --> 02:38:32.120
<v Speaker 3>things true then then you're building </v>
<v Speaker 3>from certain base and you need to,</v>

3996
02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:32.993
<v Speaker 3>and basically it's how you construct </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments and if you start leaving out </v>

3997
02:38:35.151 --> 02:38:35.984
<v Speaker 3>parts of what otherwise is like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular Muslim sort of theological </v>

3998
02:38:39.651 --> 02:38:40.630
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3999
02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:42.920
<v Speaker 3>then you ended up building like a weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>tower over here.</v>

4000
02:38:42.921 --> 02:38:44.070
<v Speaker 3>This starts going off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4001
02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:44.953
<v Speaker 3>the arguments are constructing </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves off to the left rather than </v>

4002
02:38:47.541 --> 02:38:48.770
<v Speaker 3>staying reasonably central.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4003
02:38:48.771 --> 02:38:49.604
<v Speaker 3>like most Muslims are never going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become terrorists because they don't </v>

4004
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:52.543
<v Speaker 3>artistically believe that a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things just aren't true just because </v>

4005
02:38:54.831 --> 02:38:56.540
<v Speaker 3>they don't want them to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4006
02:38:56.541 --> 02:38:57.374
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not cherry picking from the </v>

4007
02:38:58.071 --> 02:38:58.904
<v Speaker 3>Koran as much as the way to the extent </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the wahabiists or Salafis and they </v>

4008
02:39:03.651 --> 02:39:04.320
<v Speaker 3>will build it in general.</v>

4009
02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:05.600
<v Speaker 3>Do y'all know they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hate,</v>

4010
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:08.810
<v Speaker 3>do you know what the watchword is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the dumbest thing in the world?</v>

4011
02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:13.940
<v Speaker 3>There'll be no more innovations wide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more innovations.</v>

4012
02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:17.480
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed was the perfect man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We must live like Mohammed.</v>

4013
02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like you,</v>

4014
02:39:18.741 --> 02:39:21.510
<v Speaker 3>you would not believe how dumb this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

4015
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.320
<v Speaker 3>this is really part of their doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4016
02:39:24.350 --> 02:39:28.850
<v Speaker 3>It's called Bita.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be bid a,</v>

4017
02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it might have an h on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

4018
02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't speak Arabic.</v>

4019
02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:34.870
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is that there are no </v>
<v Speaker 3>vacation,</v>

4020
02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:36.620
<v Speaker 3>not have any innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4021
02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:38.540
<v Speaker 3>What about the innovation that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>already use?</v>

4022
02:39:38.541 --> 02:39:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Like Toyota trucks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4023
02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:40.311
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4024
02:39:40.311 --> 02:39:41.144
<v Speaker 3>the like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the King King of sound had a hell of a </v>

4025
02:39:43.251 --> 02:39:44.690
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4026
02:39:44.691 --> 02:39:45.524
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Saudi Arabia was founded by the even </v>

4027
02:39:48.291 --> 02:39:52.280
<v Speaker 3>sowed family in conjunction with Abdul </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hub.</v>

4028
02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:56.390
<v Speaker 3>It was a known in light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the late 18th century.</v>

4029
02:39:56.780 --> 02:40:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was unknown a theologian and he was,</v>

4030
02:40:00.531 --> 02:40:01.970
<v Speaker 3>he was a brilliant man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was,</v>

4031
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:04.820
<v Speaker 3>I come from a better way of putting it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in an autistic because he,</v>

4032
02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:06.350
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was very focused,</v>

4033
02:40:06.351 --> 02:40:10.280
<v Speaker 3>hyper focused on a single sort of stress</v>
<v Speaker 3>strand of thought and everything that he</v>

4034
02:40:10.281 --> 02:40:12.470
<v Speaker 3>thought was either black or white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no gray in between.</v>

4035
02:40:12.471 --> 02:40:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm,</v>

4036
02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:14.603
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally mean he may well have had </v>

4037
02:40:15.691 --> 02:40:16.580
<v Speaker 3>autism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4038
02:40:16.750 --> 02:40:17.583
<v Speaker 3>Just use it as an insult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He may well have literally had awesome </v>

4039
02:40:19.561 --> 02:40:21.330
<v Speaker 3>zero those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either this or nothing at all.</v>

4040
02:40:21.331 --> 02:40:24.240
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he ends up building this theology</v>

4041
02:40:24.241 --> 02:40:26.100
<v Speaker 3>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not bad.</v>

4042
02:40:26.130 --> 02:40:26.701
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met,</v>

4043
02:40:26.701 --> 02:40:28.200
<v Speaker 3>and I know that's a little wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of those not,</v>

4044
02:40:28.201 --> 02:40:30.000
<v Speaker 3>there's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that,</v>

4045
02:40:30.001 --> 02:40:30.834
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that there isn't an argument </v>

4046
02:40:32.491 --> 02:40:33.324
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There obviously must be an argument </v>

4047
02:40:34.111 --> 02:40:35.250
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise people wouldn't believe it.</v>

4048
02:40:35.310 --> 02:40:38.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're getting me really confused.</v>

4049
02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:39.953
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What might be an argument otherwise </v>

4050
02:40:40.921 --> 02:40:42.590
<v Speaker 3>people won't believe what he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

4051
02:40:42.591 --> 02:40:45.100
<v Speaker 3>his interpretation of the Koran and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam and you know,</v>

4052
02:40:45.210 --> 02:40:47.640
<v Speaker 3>all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a particular interpretation and</v>

4053
02:40:47.641 --> 02:40:48.540
<v Speaker 3>he says to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

4054
02:40:48.541 --> 02:40:49.374
<v Speaker 3>you should follow my interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam cause I'm actually got the right </v>

4055
02:40:51.661 --> 02:40:53.370
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4056
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:54.743
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4057
02:40:55.630 --> 02:40:57.120
<v Speaker 3>and most people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4058
02:40:57.930 --> 02:40:59.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

4059
02:40:59.311 --> 02:41:01.080
<v Speaker 3>you're ignoring almost everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4060
02:41:01.350 --> 02:41:02.183
<v Speaker 3>and that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what does that have to do with </v>

4061
02:41:03.391 --> 02:41:04.560
<v Speaker 3>innovation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4062
02:41:04.561 --> 02:41:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing like Beeda is ha,</v>

4063
02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:07.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>harmful innovations and but they don't </v>

4064
02:41:10.111 --> 02:41:12.330
<v Speaker 3>run harmful innovations are bad by </v>
<v Speaker 3>definition.</v>

4065
02:41:12.570 --> 02:41:15.690
<v Speaker 3>But there were also good innovations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the telephone,</v>

4066
02:41:15.691 --> 02:41:16.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cars,</v>

4067
02:41:16.321 --> 02:41:17.154
<v Speaker 3>all that sort of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kids are good innovations are so </v>

4068
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:21.330
<v Speaker 3>the Muslims are free to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hobbies,</v>

4069
02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:23.693
<v Speaker 3>I imagine now this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been persuaded that they are </v>

4070
02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:26.273
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4071
02:41:26.490 --> 02:41:28.770
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when like for example,</v>

4072
02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:29.633
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even salad first tried to explain to </v>

4073
02:41:31.321 --> 02:41:32.154
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4074
02:41:32.430 --> 02:41:34.440
<v Speaker 3>we need guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

4075
02:41:34.441 --> 02:41:35.274
<v Speaker 3>we ended up at a maximum gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We planes we need when he bombs and </v>

4076
02:41:38.911 --> 02:41:39.744
<v Speaker 3>bullets and cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these now televisions and </v>

4077
02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:44.520
<v Speaker 3>satellite dishes and all the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

4078
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.910
<v Speaker 3>They were actively resistant to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the whole,</v>

4079
02:41:47.911 --> 02:41:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed didn't have this and he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things called I warriors.</v>

4080
02:41:52.050 --> 02:41:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably pronouncing that horribly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So apologies.</v>

4081
02:41:54.690 --> 02:41:55.523
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who knows how to pronounce these </v>
<v Speaker 3>words cause I haven't ever seen written </v>

4082
02:41:57.331 --> 02:41:58.440
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4083
02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:00.880
<v Speaker 3>but these guys were like Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4084
02:42:00.890 --> 02:42:01.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4085
02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:05.640
<v Speaker 3>the way Saudi Arabia was formed is </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same way as isis has been.</v>

4086
02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:08.400
<v Speaker 3>The Islamic state has been formed now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly the same.</v>

4087
02:42:08.401 --> 02:42:10.350
<v Speaker 3>These guys were the most brutal man </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've ever seen.</v>

4088
02:42:10.770 --> 02:42:12.690
<v Speaker 3>And they would just go in and murder </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire villages,</v>

4089
02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:13.290
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4090
02:42:13.290 --> 02:42:15.450
<v Speaker 3>He had 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these people,</v>

4091
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:16.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

4092
02:42:16.951 --> 02:42:18.990
<v Speaker 3>He used to conquer what is now Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arabia.</v>

4093
02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:22.860
<v Speaker 3>And eventually he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a car.</v>

4094
02:42:24.210 --> 02:42:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I think planes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good idea.</v>

4095
02:42:25.710 --> 02:42:26.543
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4096
02:42:26.730 --> 02:42:28.380
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they revolted against him.</v>

4097
02:42:28.650 --> 02:42:29.483
<v Speaker 3>And the British seeing him as a useful </v>
<v Speaker 3>client decided to help him out with a </v>

4098
02:42:33.061 --> 02:42:34.550
<v Speaker 3>few macs and guns and if you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4099
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:35.463
<v Speaker 3>biplanes or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they revolted against him because he </v>

4100
02:42:37.381 --> 02:42:38.760
<v Speaker 3>wanted a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4101
02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:40.310
<v Speaker 3>because it's on Islamic Ma'am and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevada.</v>

4102
02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:41.770
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4103
02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:45.900
<v Speaker 3>the British killed mill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was probably,</v>

4104
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:46.743
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was probably a good thing for the </v>

4105
02:42:47.311 --> 02:42:48.300
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>

4106
02:42:48.301 --> 02:42:50.580
<v Speaker 3>because these guys were nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would regularly just,</v>

4107
02:42:50.610 --> 02:42:51.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the thing that,</v>

4108
02:42:51.850 --> 02:42:54.390
<v Speaker 3>it's another thing they've got is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tech theory doctrine.</v>

4109
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:57.480
<v Speaker 3>You're not a real Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting thing,</v>

4110
02:42:57.481 --> 02:42:58.230
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

4111
02:42:58.230 --> 02:43:00.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting how we do that to them.</v>

4112
02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:01.403
<v Speaker 3>We tack fear them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not a real must be the wind on a </v>

4113
02:43:03.691 --> 02:43:05.730
<v Speaker 3>position to tell anyone who's a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim or not.</v>

4114
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:06.983
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they consider themselves Muslims and </v>

4115
02:43:07.941 --> 02:43:08.774
<v Speaker 3>Muslim and let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like literally they are the most </v>

4116
02:43:10.381 --> 02:43:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Muslim in their opinion and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

4117
02:43:12.431 --> 02:43:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Nobody else's a real Muslim and </v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore it's okay to kill them.</v>

4118
02:43:15.610 --> 02:43:16.443
<v Speaker 3>You can only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only have to give a shit about </v>

4119
02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:20.260
<v Speaker 3>actual Muslims under this doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

4120
02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:21.123
<v Speaker 3>this is not what most Muslims think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the antithesis of what most </v>

4121
02:43:23.291 --> 02:43:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Muslims actually think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these guys used to like in a huge</v>

4122
02:43:27.090 --> 02:43:30.790
<v Speaker 3>rating that you have to qualify that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to stand up and say,</v>

4123
02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:31.653
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the other nutty shit is not as </v>

4124
02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:34.630
<v Speaker 3>naughty as this nutty shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4125
02:43:34.631 --> 02:43:35.464
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just just while we're on the </v>

4126
02:43:35.981 --> 02:43:37.060
<v Speaker 3>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4127
02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:38.073
<v Speaker 3>Islam is Towsley in liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Western liberal country should never </v>

4128
02:43:42.041 --> 02:43:45.610
<v Speaker 3>defend Islam in it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sounds very islamophobic of you.</v>

4129
02:43:45.611 --> 02:43:47.330
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's been used a lot.</v>

4130
02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:48.910
<v Speaker 3>Phobic comps and Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never,</v>

4131
02:43:48.911 --> 02:43:51.310
<v Speaker 3>I would hate you would hate to live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharia law.</v>

4132
02:43:51.550 --> 02:43:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might not want,</v>

4133
02:43:52.661 --> 02:43:53.494
<v Speaker 3>not you personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as a man you would to an entirely </v>

4134
02:43:55.451 --> 02:43:57.130
<v Speaker 3>benefit from living on the shelf for </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

4135
02:43:57.131 --> 02:43:57.964
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The girls have to walk around like </v>

4136
02:43:59.021 --> 02:44:00.100
<v Speaker 3>beekeepers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4137
02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:02.770
<v Speaker 3>Not always that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually not,</v>

4138
02:44:02.771 --> 02:44:04.390
<v Speaker 3>how do you know what they really look?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually,</v>

4139
02:44:04.391 --> 02:44:06.820
<v Speaker 3>that's actually not in the Koran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just says be modest.</v>

4140
02:44:06.821 --> 02:44:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4141
02:44:08.230 --> 02:44:10.750
<v Speaker 3>you could just wear a headscarf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

4142
02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:14.020
<v Speaker 3>If you like an internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ho monist is like chance shorts.</v>

4143
02:44:14.021 --> 02:44:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're,</v>

4144
02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:15.633
<v Speaker 3>if you're an autistic isis member that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>full on burger with a grill of your </v>

4145
02:44:18.851 --> 02:44:19.120
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

4146
02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:19.953
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting about this </v>

4147
02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:22.030
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4148
02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:25.420
<v Speaker 3>the thing would be like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the legal system,</v>

4149
02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:27.610
<v Speaker 3>directly out to the Quran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

4150
02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:31.010
<v Speaker 3>a woman's testimony is worth half of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man's in the legal system,</v>

4151
02:44:31.030 --> 02:44:31.863
<v Speaker 3>in the legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that they use that legal system like </v>

4152
02:44:33.521 --> 02:44:36.790
<v Speaker 3>they use the Koran forced the losses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's based on sharia.</v>

4153
02:44:36.820 --> 02:44:38.830
<v Speaker 3>So if a woman says something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4154
02:44:38.831 --> 02:44:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Sargon raped me and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pitch and we need a female witness.</v>

4155
02:44:42.701 --> 02:44:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has two point you didn't,</v>

4156
02:44:44.061 --> 02:44:45.560
<v Speaker 3>you'd need more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4157
02:44:45.570 --> 02:44:47.210
<v Speaker 3>we did another female witness to testify</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

4158
02:44:47.211 --> 02:44:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even then it was pop by,</v>

4159
02:44:50.430 --> 02:44:52.570
<v Speaker 3>she had a half a woman for the west of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

4160
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:53.543
<v Speaker 3>This is entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely possible that the judge would </v>

4161
02:44:54.781 --> 02:44:56.590
<v Speaker 3>punish her for tempting me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4162
02:44:56.591 --> 02:44:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Because like if she has a half an </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion and then the other chickens that</v>

4163
02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:02.260
<v Speaker 3>half an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's still only like one person.</v>

4164
02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:04.270
<v Speaker 3>One person's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4165
02:45:04.271 --> 02:45:05.104
<v Speaker 3>This one's for the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean about women are entitled to half </v>

4166
02:45:06.431 --> 02:45:08.930
<v Speaker 3>of the inheritance money managers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>title.</v>

4167
02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:12.680
<v Speaker 3>That was the other half go to the any </v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers will,</v>

4168
02:45:12.730 --> 02:45:15.650
<v Speaker 3>you know anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a lone sibling then you,</v>

4169
02:45:15.651 --> 02:45:16.810
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my only child then.</v>

4170
02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fine obviously.</v>

4171
02:45:18.430 --> 02:45:21.040
<v Speaker 3>But like if you've got a male sibling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get half of what he goes.</v>

4172
02:45:21.670 --> 02:45:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Pretty horrible isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

4173
02:45:24.161 --> 02:45:25.520
<v Speaker 3>And this is just like the most moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

4174
02:45:25.521 --> 02:45:26.354
<v Speaker 3>And like the legal system is basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a bounce as useful as Hammurabi's </v>

4175
02:45:30.821 --> 02:45:33.130
<v Speaker 3>code of laws where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an eye for an eye tooth for a tooth.</v>

4176
02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:37.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was outdated 2000 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>in West,</v>

4177
02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:38.950
<v Speaker 3>you know with the infant Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been,</v>

4178
02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:39.311
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4179
02:45:39.311 --> 02:45:39.911
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see.</v>

4180
02:45:39.911 --> 02:45:40.744
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really brutal stuff and it's just </v>

4181
02:45:41.591 --> 02:45:42.970
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4182
02:45:42.971 --> 02:45:43.804
<v Speaker 3>well I mean any progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever advocates for anything positive </v>

4183
02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:51.160
<v Speaker 3>about Islam is an idiot and doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand Islam.</v>

4184
02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:52.360
<v Speaker 3>They've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've,</v>

4185
02:45:52.361 --> 02:45:54.820
<v Speaker 3>I've seen them going Islams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ms feminist religion.</v>

4186
02:45:54.850 --> 02:45:55.683
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be made a second class </v>

4187
02:45:56.111 --> 02:45:57.280
<v Speaker 3>citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is absolutely.</v>

4188
02:45:57.400 --> 02:45:58.233
<v Speaker 3>If that's what you want feminism to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the installation of a systemic </v>

4189
02:46:01.810 --> 02:46:03.850
<v Speaker 3>oppression against women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4190
02:46:04.450 --> 02:46:05.283
<v Speaker 3>That can be feminism if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that really is revealing about </v>

4191
02:46:07.391 --> 02:46:08.224
<v Speaker 3>feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

4192
02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:10.340
<v Speaker 3>What is going lately with this</v>

4193
02:46:10.430 --> 02:46:15.020
<v Speaker 1>weird sort of acceptance of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you say,</v>

4194
02:46:15.021 --> 02:46:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Hey job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you say that the head gear head,</v>

4195
02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:19.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offends me more than anything.</v>

4196
02:46:19.131 --> 02:46:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's going on with that?</v>

4197
02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:24.440
<v Speaker 1>There's this weird thing where women are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being empowered.</v>

4198
02:46:24.470 --> 02:46:27.290
<v Speaker 1>They're pretend I'm the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretending they're empowered</v>

4199
02:46:27.291 --> 02:46:28.940
<v Speaker 1>by this and that this is their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

4200
02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:31.910
<v Speaker 1>This is a feminist value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably stupid,</v>

4201
02:46:31.930 --> 02:46:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you seen it.</v>

4202
02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:36.440
<v Speaker 1>One thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

4203
02:46:36.890 --> 02:46:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I never really saw myself as sole person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gets offended,</v>

4204
02:46:38.931 --> 02:46:40.940
<v Speaker 1>but when I see an American flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his job,</v>

4205
02:46:41.150 --> 02:46:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I find that offense come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have those.</v>

4206
02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4207
02:46:44.391 --> 02:46:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I let you look at and get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4208
02:46:45.261 --> 02:46:47.340
<v Speaker 1>this is the antithesis of what these </v>
<v Speaker 1>files.</v>

4209
02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:49.850
<v Speaker 1>That seems like something a biker would </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear.</v>

4210
02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:53.420
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a parody,</v>

4211
02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:55.850
<v Speaker 1>but then American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is.</v>

4212
02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like one of them duck dynasty </v>
<v Speaker 1>phase.</v>

4213
02:46:58.380 --> 02:46:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

4214
02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

4215
02:47:00.111 --> 02:47:00.944
<v Speaker 1>I've been fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God is not just the symbol of </v>

4216
02:47:03.501 --> 02:47:04.850
<v Speaker 1>liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cover yourself up.</v>

4217
02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:08.890
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

4218
02:47:09.070 --> 02:47:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Cover your fucking hair up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

4219
02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:14.320
<v Speaker 1>So she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wearing that to show that she's very</v>

4220
02:47:14.321 --> 02:47:18.610
<v Speaker 1>American when trump is saying that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to shut down mosques.</v>

4221
02:47:18.611 --> 02:47:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that whole Megan Kelly thing</v>

4222
02:47:20.921 --> 02:47:23.580
<v Speaker 1>with Alex Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that a,</v>

4223
02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:25.990
<v Speaker 1>he scooped a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be fair,</v>

4224
02:47:25.991 --> 02:47:26.824
<v Speaker 1>I mean Alex probably did say a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit and he'd probably say they </v>

<v Speaker 1>sandy hook and,</v>

02:47:34.391 --> 02:47:37.240
<v Speaker 1>but she was saying he never expected to </v>

<v Speaker 1>run with it.</v>

4236
02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:58.060
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about children's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>

02:47:58.061 --> 02:48:00.520
<v Speaker 1>it's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible,</v>

4238
02:48:00.970 --> 02:48:04.270
<v Speaker 1>you better have some bloody convincing </v>
<v Speaker 1>proof and he's abandoned.</v>

4239
02:48:04.900 --> 02:48:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Abandoned that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4240
02:48:05.961 --> 02:48:09.460
<v Speaker 1>But he hasn't abandoned it and apologize</v>
<v Speaker 1>for saying it.</v>

4241
02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:12.580
<v Speaker 1>He's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's done is like made this sort of</v>

4242
02:48:12.581 --> 02:48:13.414
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4244
02:48:18.340 --> 02:48:19.173
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some video where he's talking to the </v>

4245
02:48:22.121 --> 02:48:26.470
<v Speaker 1>parents directly and saying that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't imagine he feels their pain and</v>

4247
02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:32.890

<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I supported a hoax.</v>

4248
02:48:33.220 --> 02:48:34.053
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That says you were liars and your </v>

4249
02:48:36.101 --> 02:48:37.270
<v Speaker 1>children were never killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a really crazy story that I </v>

4251
02:48:39.281 --> 02:48:40.114
<v Speaker 1>read about a guy who was a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorist and then his own son was </v>

4252
02:48:43.271 --> 02:48:45.880
<v Speaker 1>murdered and then he realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

4253
02:48:46.270 --> 02:48:48.250
<v Speaker 1>in Sandy Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he realized like,</v>

4254
02:48:48.251 --> 02:48:49.084
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how insane these conspiracy </v>

<v Speaker 1>There's people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

4257
02:48:53.111 --> 02:48:53.944
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole movement right now where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that polio was a massive </v>

4258
02:48:57.630 --> 02:49:02.630
<v Speaker 1>hopes and that what polio was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was them injecting people with the polio</v>

4259
02:49:03.551 --> 02:49:07.950
<v Speaker 1>vaccine because there was no polio and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then injecting with as the vaccine,</v>

4260
02:49:07.951 --> 02:49:11.190
<v Speaker 1>they hurt all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As someone who has been fooled before,</v>

4261
02:49:11.191 --> 02:49:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any solution is education.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can't just tell these people that </v>

4264
02:49:15.441 --> 02:49:17.520
<v Speaker 1>are idiots and never told to them cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just think,</v>

4265
02:49:17.521 --> 02:49:19.760
<v Speaker 1>well you don't have anything to rebut me</v>

<v Speaker 1>The floods,</v>

4268
02:49:20.791 --> 02:49:22.080
<v Speaker 1>you've got engaged with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4269
02:49:22.081 --> 02:49:25.830
<v Speaker 1>that's way it'd be popular these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the fuck do you think the</v>

4270
02:49:25.831 --> 02:49:28.540
<v Speaker 1>satellites are for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why put that Elan Musk thing up and they</v>

4271
02:49:28.541 --> 02:49:30.570
<v Speaker 1>seen that Ilan Mustang I put on </v>

<v Speaker 1>They're shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can shoot something in the space </v>

4275
02:49:38.611 --> 02:49:42.240
<v Speaker 1>now and then land it on a pad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to do that.</v>

4276
02:49:42.241 --> 02:49:46.800
<v Speaker 1>And so they sped up a sped up version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of taking an hour or whatever</v>

4277

<v Speaker 1>it takes to get up there and get back.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But look at that fucking video of the </v>

4289
02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:18.120
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

4290
02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:18.953
<v Speaker 1>So all these dip shits in the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was going to put it up cause </v>

4291
02:50:23.881 --> 02:50:25.680
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

4292
02:50:25.681 --> 02:50:26.514
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not dipshits think the earth </v>

4293
02:50:28.231 --> 02:50:29.250
<v Speaker 1>is flat or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

4294
02:50:29.251 --> 02:50:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you clearly see the fucking circle these</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the curve of the earth and um,</v>

4295
02:50:34.380 --> 02:50:35.213
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people in the comments </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could see George Foods really </v>

4296
02:50:37.441 --> 02:50:38.071
<v Speaker 1>believed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

4297
02:50:38.071 --> 02:50:40.640
<v Speaker 1>you're such a solo show out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

4298
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have satellites?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the point?</v>

4299
02:50:42.481 --> 02:50:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no salary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think their satellites,</v>

4300
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:46.410
<v Speaker 1>but you can see them loans you've done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4301
02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:46.771
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4302
02:50:46.771 --> 02:50:47.604
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4303
02:50:47.700 --> 02:50:50.010
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're flying around in planes.</v>

4304
02:50:50.130 --> 02:50:50.963
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you see the sun at anytime of </v>

4305
02:50:51.751 --> 02:50:53.850
<v Speaker 1>the day or night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you?</v>

4306
02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:54.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the sun goes around behind the </v>

4307
02:50:55.801 --> 02:50:57.540
<v Speaker 1>flat earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4308
02:50:59.580 --> 02:51:02.470
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you saying it like,</v>

4309
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:05.020
<v Speaker 1>like you were looking for a rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation,</v>

4310
02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:05.910
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

4311
02:51:05.910 --> 02:51:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Because if let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4312
02:51:07.221 --> 02:51:08.640
<v Speaker 1>this is the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice wall,</v>

4313
02:51:09.450 --> 02:51:12.270
<v Speaker 1>they say about it like it's like a under</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking,</v>

4314
02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:13.500
<v Speaker 1>like a spotlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4315
02:51:13.501 --> 02:51:15.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's for some reason rotating around</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4316
02:51:15.271 --> 02:51:15.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4317
02:51:15.810 --> 02:51:16.910
<v Speaker 1>at any point I should be able to put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

4318
02:51:16.930 --> 02:51:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Got to look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun is just shining downwards.</v>

4319
02:51:19.321 --> 02:51:20.154
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a poor understanding of flat </v>

4320
02:51:21.721 --> 02:51:22.501
<v Speaker 1>earth theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

4321
02:51:22.501 --> 02:51:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I think I probably do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all that is.</v>

4322
02:51:24.181 --> 02:51:25.100
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

4323
02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:27.510
<v Speaker 1>the only way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any way to get rid of these things,</v>

4324
02:51:27.511 --> 02:51:30.030
<v Speaker 1>just to educate people you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridicule because they're not,</v>

4325
02:51:30.060 --> 02:51:31.380
<v Speaker 1>they're not necessarily being </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational,</v>

4326
02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:34.020
<v Speaker 1>that just dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like everything else.</v>

4327
02:51:34.021 --> 02:51:34.854
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about what people have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea in their head and then they dig </v>

4328
02:51:37.261 --> 02:51:39.480
<v Speaker 1>their heels in the sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing.</v>

4329
02:51:39.660 --> 02:51:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Once you've publicly said you think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth is flat,</v>

4330
02:51:43.810 --> 02:51:47.700
<v Speaker 1>and once you've said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to sort of stick with your</v>

4331
02:51:47.701 --> 02:51:48.380
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

4332
02:51:48.380 --> 02:51:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause if you come out and say,</v>

4333
02:51:49.501 --> 02:51:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so stupid.</v>

4334
02:51:51.810 --> 02:51:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I really did believe these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiots on youtube.</v>

4335
02:51:54.540 --> 02:51:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Instead of believing actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>astrophysicist,</v>

4336
02:51:57.270 --> 02:52:00.450
<v Speaker 1>actual people who were involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields of cartography,</v>

4337
02:52:00.451 --> 02:52:02.310
<v Speaker 1>airline travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shipping routes.</v>

4338
02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:03.593
<v Speaker 1>I mean Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go on and on and on about </v>

4339
02:52:05.501 --> 02:52:06.820
<v Speaker 1>satellites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aerospace,</v>

4340
02:52:06.821 --> 02:52:07.654
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different people that probably </v>

4341
02:52:10.181 --> 02:52:11.014
<v Speaker 1>would have to be in cahoots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let me tell you about the wall of </v>

4342
02:52:13.121 --> 02:52:13.954
<v Speaker 1>ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The walls,</v>

4343
02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:15.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a photo of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone sent to me.</v>

4344
02:52:15.911 --> 02:52:17.770
<v Speaker 1>You fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the wall.</v>

4345
02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:21.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's 10 feet high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good piece of shit.</v>

4346
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I watched the video by some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by some of the Youtube App and uh,</v>

4347
02:52:26.350 --> 02:52:28.150
<v Speaker 1>some here too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the problem man,</v>

4348
02:52:28.151 --> 02:52:30.640
<v Speaker 1>fucking youtubers is a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a part of the bone.</v>

4349
02:52:30.641 --> 02:52:31.630
<v Speaker 1>But when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

4350
02:52:31.631 --> 02:52:33.040
<v Speaker 1>why do we believe in a flat earth?</v>

4351
02:52:33.540 --> 02:52:36.490
<v Speaker 1>And I was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know,</v>

4352
02:52:36.491 --> 02:52:38.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was legitimately exact scenes.</v>

4353
02:52:38.520 --> 02:52:40.940
<v Speaker 1>One Chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually it was the hope big.</v>

4354
02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:42.010
<v Speaker 1>It was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives us,</v>

4355
02:52:42.090 --> 02:52:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I remember we'll talk about big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hope.</v>

4356
02:52:44.351 --> 02:52:45.640
<v Speaker 1>They get it home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives them hope,</v>

4357
02:52:45.641 --> 02:52:46.474
<v Speaker 1>like hope beyond the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice wall that are better land </v>

4358
02:52:48.941 --> 02:52:49.661
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

4359
02:52:49.661 --> 02:52:51.130
<v Speaker 1>why would it be any better than what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got now?</v>

4360
02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Don't you have a photo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd dump cons.</v>

4361
02:52:53.560 --> 02:52:56.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not one guy leaked to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera over to that ice wall.</v>

4362
02:52:56.621 --> 02:52:58.470
<v Speaker 1>You piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we fly a drone over?</v>

4363
02:52:58.720 --> 02:53:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Show me that edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Showing the outside.</v>

4364
02:53:00.791 --> 02:53:01.624
<v Speaker 1>It's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it looks a conspiracy to keep </v>

4365
02:53:03.461 --> 02:53:05.560
<v Speaker 1>hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No can was what it is.</v>

4366
02:53:05.710 --> 02:53:10.060
<v Speaker 1>People love to know things that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know.</v>

4367
02:53:10.090 --> 02:53:10.923
<v Speaker 1>They love when they uncovered truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there's a secret that someone is </v>

4368
02:53:14.531 --> 02:53:17.920
<v Speaker 1>hiding about something as monumental as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shape of the earth.</v>

4369
02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:20.020
<v Speaker 1>People love to be the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

4370
02:53:20.021 --> 02:53:24.640
<v Speaker 1>They love to be Hashtag woke that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

4371
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And they don't like to read books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4372
02:53:27.131 --> 02:53:27.521
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4373
02:53:27.521 --> 02:53:29.290
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think for some of them though,</v>

4374
02:53:29.650 --> 02:53:30.483
<v Speaker 1>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy who was saying that it </v>

4375
02:53:31.391 --> 02:53:35.050
<v Speaker 1>gives us hope and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because you don't have any hope.</v>

4376
02:53:35.051 --> 02:53:37.090
<v Speaker 1>You need something and you're honestly </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a religious person.</v>

4377
02:53:37.330 --> 02:53:39.220
<v Speaker 1>And so you take on this as kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious belief.</v>

4378
02:53:39.250 --> 02:53:39.640
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4379
02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:40.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

4380
02:53:40.330 --> 02:53:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are religious.</v>

4381
02:53:41.591 --> 02:53:42.424
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the whole thing is that </v>

4382
02:53:44.171 --> 02:53:45.004
<v Speaker 1>evolution is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the big parts of flat </v>

4383
02:53:47.171 --> 02:53:48.004
<v Speaker 1>earth theory is that the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The firmament breaking the conditioning </v>

4384
02:53:51.100 --> 02:53:51.761
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4385
02:53:51.761 --> 02:53:52.594
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen is a big religious part of this </v>

4386
02:53:54.641 --> 02:53:56.040
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evolution.</v>

4387
02:53:56.041 --> 02:53:56.740
<v Speaker 1>This is a lie.</v>

4388
02:53:56.740 --> 02:54:01.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge part of the flat earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement is a belief in creationism.</v>

4389
02:54:01.870 --> 02:54:06.040
<v Speaker 1>I believe that whole space is not real </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then above us is heaven.</v>

4390
02:54:06.190 --> 02:54:08.350
<v Speaker 1>That we live in a dome now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

4391
02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:11.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different factions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flat earth movement.</v>

4392
02:54:11.051 --> 02:54:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

4393
02:54:13.691 --> 02:54:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

4394
02:54:15.221 --> 02:54:18.780
<v Speaker 1>this is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big part of this is a deep belief in,</v>

4395
02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:21.160
<v Speaker 1>in creationism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4396
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:23.320
<v Speaker 1>so it's like it's an American Christine </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

4397
02:54:23.350 --> 02:54:24.183
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones who believe in it also don't </v>

4398
02:54:25.361 --> 02:54:28.450
<v Speaker 1>believe in dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think dinosaurs are fake.</v>

4399
02:54:29.260 --> 02:54:30.310
<v Speaker 1>This is wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4400
02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:33.850
<v Speaker 1>The main guy believes that dinosaurs are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed by the way.</v>

4401
02:54:33.851 --> 02:54:34.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

4402
02:54:34.271 --> 02:54:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear bombs or hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4403
02:54:36.611 --> 02:54:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear bombs or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4404
02:54:37.610 --> 02:54:38.570
<v Speaker 1>what did we drop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bom,</v>

4405
02:54:38.830 --> 02:54:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Bom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bom Bom.</v>

4406
02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a really a bomb.</v>

4407
02:54:42.460 --> 02:54:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hoax.</v>

4408
02:54:44.180 --> 02:54:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this massive hoax,</v>

4409
02:54:46.001 --> 02:54:47.040
<v Speaker 1>they spent a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

4410
02:54:47.130 --> 02:54:49.710
<v Speaker 1>just really big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs are hooks to bro.</v>

4411
02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:50.793
<v Speaker 1>Chem trails are real though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there probably could be real </v>

4412
02:54:55.541 --> 02:54:57.200
<v Speaker 1>jail engineering is a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4413
02:54:57.260 --> 02:54:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it could actually be right.</v>

4414
02:54:58.961 --> 02:54:59.794
<v Speaker 1>And I could see the rationale from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's point of view if they're </v>

4415
02:55:00.971 --> 02:55:01.591
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4416
02:55:01.591 --> 02:55:03.980
<v Speaker 1>a global warming is happening and if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>like put extra</v>

4417
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:04.813
<v Speaker 2>clouds in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it'll deflect an excessive amount </v>

4418
02:55:07.581 --> 02:55:09.590
<v Speaker 2>of the sun's rays and coolio if done </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

4419
02:55:09.591 --> 02:55:10.520
<v Speaker 2>It does do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4420
02:55:10.521 --> 02:55:11.150
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4421
02:55:11.150 --> 02:55:13.100
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean it was a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

4422
02:55:13.101 --> 02:55:14.160
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

4423
02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:15.080
<v Speaker 2>it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the,</v>

4424
02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:16.150
<v Speaker 2>they're not trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they,</v>

4425
02:55:16.330 --> 02:55:17.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the capture thing.</v>

4426
02:55:17.301 --> 02:55:19.440
<v Speaker 2>They think what they're trying to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>poison people do.</v>

4427
02:55:19.450 --> 02:55:23.720
<v Speaker 2>So from our stand that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when a jet engine goes through.</v>

4428
02:55:23.721 --> 02:55:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Condensation in the air creates these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fake clouds.</v>

4429
02:55:26.330 --> 02:55:27.163
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fake clouds can cool the earth </v>

4430
02:55:28.821 --> 02:55:29.654
<v Speaker 2>down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact they've put them out on </v>

4431
02:55:31.401 --> 02:55:32.234
<v Speaker 2>purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not putting them out on </v>

4432
02:55:32.871 --> 02:55:34.880
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just a side effect of air travel.</v>

4433
02:55:34.881 --> 02:55:35.714
<v Speaker 2>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making these assumptions based </v>

4434
02:55:37.881 --> 02:55:40.700
<v Speaker 2>on seeing something that sky and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking someone's spraying something.</v>

4435
02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:41.573
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't there actually like a Geo </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering thing that was actually </v>

4436
02:55:43.251 --> 02:55:44.750
<v Speaker 2>something they're doing or planning to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

4437
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:45.703
<v Speaker 2>There is definitely the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>one day us having no real protection </v>

4438
02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:53.930
<v Speaker 2>what no ozone layer there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

4439
02:55:53.931 --> 02:55:54.764
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>have speculated is that suspending some </v>

4440
02:55:57.741 --> 02:56:01.280
<v Speaker 2>sort of reflective particles in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere,</v>

4441
02:56:01.281 --> 02:56:06.281
<v Speaker 2>like satellites that would somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another protect us from solar radiation.</v>

4442
02:56:06.820 --> 02:56:08.300
<v Speaker 2>So there's something that people thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>of him,</v>

4443
02:56:08.740 --> 02:56:11.810
<v Speaker 2>but for the doing it well for sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone has thought about doing it.</v>

4444
02:56:11.811 --> 02:56:14.750
<v Speaker 2>If that's the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're missing some sort of atmosphere</v>

4445
02:56:14.900 --> 02:56:15.230
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4446
02:56:15.230 --> 02:56:17.210
<v Speaker 2>can we create an atmosphere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes we can.</v>

4447
02:56:17.270 --> 02:56:19.190
<v Speaker 2>How would we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd spray chemicals in the sky.</v>

4448
02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:20.053
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what you're seeing when </v>

4449
02:56:21.171 --> 02:56:24.080
<v Speaker 2>you see those clouds behind jets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really simple science.</v>

4450
02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:26.120
<v Speaker 2>The heat of the jet engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4451
02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Craig on blocks with a constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4452
02:56:27.651 --> 02:56:30.000
<v Speaker 2>The condensation in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It creates a vape.</v>

4453
02:56:30.060 --> 02:56:33.140
<v Speaker 2>The these artificial clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look like clouds because they are a</v>

4454
02:56:33.150 --> 02:56:33.983
<v Speaker 2>cloud.</v>

4455
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to the armchair conspiracy theorist,</v>

4456
02:56:38.841 --> 02:56:39.531
<v Speaker 2>it looks up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>

4457
02:56:39.531 --> 02:56:40.640
<v Speaker 2>they're spraying us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4458
02:56:40.900 --> 02:56:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spray.</v>

4459
02:56:41.540 --> 02:56:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Nice Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4460
02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Come on and defend Alex turns for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

4461
02:56:44.450 --> 02:56:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I love Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4462
02:56:46.330 --> 02:56:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defend them about sandy hook.</v>

4463
02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:48.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4464
02:56:48.740 --> 02:56:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to defend about the frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the frogs?</v>

4465
02:56:51.410 --> 02:56:52.830
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They telling me folks.</v>

4466
02:56:52.831 --> 02:56:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4467
02:56:53.721 --> 02:56:54.560
<v Speaker 2>they turned frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4468
02:56:54.561 --> 02:56:55.394
<v Speaker 2>it was really ironic as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The globalists are telling the frogs </v>

4469
02:56:57.171 --> 02:56:57.951
<v Speaker 2>gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4470
02:56:57.951 --> 02:56:58.970
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4471
02:56:58.971 --> 02:56:59.804
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually being literally serious </v>

4472
02:57:00.521 --> 02:57:01.251
<v Speaker 2>when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4473
02:57:01.251 --> 02:57:02.540
<v Speaker 2>this pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4474
02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pollution actually does make the fries.</v>

4475
02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:05.373
<v Speaker 2>It's corporate malfeasance and it's any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain kind of frog and a certain </v>

4476
02:57:08.481 --> 02:57:09.314
<v Speaker 2>kind of pesticide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually read through the study and </v>

4477
02:57:10.690 --> 02:57:12.960
<v Speaker 2>you played my video on his channel </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I have,</v>

4478
02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:16.270
<v Speaker 2>my video was on my old trying to look </v>
<v Speaker 2>and taken down by a metal channel.</v>

4479
02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:17.113
<v Speaker 2>Got taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a little ship hosty channel </v>

4480
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:19.191
<v Speaker 2>Dory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

4481
02:57:19.191 --> 02:57:22.730
<v Speaker 2>but I'm the shit post each channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We mean just put bullshit on the,</v>

4482
02:57:22.930 --> 02:57:23.763
<v Speaker 2>Oh bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found funny and one of the lovely </v>

4483
02:57:24.711 --> 02:57:26.580
<v Speaker 2>thing was looking into this study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones's sighting.</v>

4484
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:28.910
<v Speaker 2>So I thought I'd go and get the study </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually read it.</v>

4485
02:57:28.911 --> 02:57:32.090
<v Speaker 2>And he's right kind of right here for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

4486
02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:35.210
<v Speaker 2>these people aren't actually globalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a multinational corporation.</v>

4487
02:57:35.450 --> 02:57:38.150
<v Speaker 2>People who are actually open borders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are pro open borders.</v>

4488
02:57:38.151 --> 02:57:39.170
<v Speaker 2>They're pro pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4489
02:57:39.171 --> 02:57:42.440
<v Speaker 2>corporate influence around the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they run a giant corporation.</v>

4490
02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:43.783
<v Speaker 2>The chemicals they're putting in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water technically where actually he </v>

4491
02:57:45.861 --> 02:57:46.694
<v Speaker 2>wasn't even going far enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These chemicals were making frogs trans </v>

4492
02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:53.720
<v Speaker 2>like they would for 90% of the frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was only a certain chemical,</v>

4493
02:57:53.780 --> 02:57:56.810
<v Speaker 2>a certain pesticide and it was affecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain kind of frog.</v>

4494
02:57:57.170 --> 02:57:57.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

4495
02:57:57.950 --> 02:57:59.840
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't made them trans.</v>

4496
02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Well I identify the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>

4497
02:58:01.951 --> 02:58:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

4498
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:03.120
<v Speaker 1>not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

4499
02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:06.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if 90 days of finding one and</v>

4500
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:09.090
<v Speaker 1>it literally for 90% of the frogs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were touched,</v>

4501
02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:11.220
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to check the numbers,</v>

4502
02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:12.293
<v Speaker 1>but for a large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the majority of the folks touched </v>

4503
02:58:13.810 --> 02:58:14.643
<v Speaker 1>it would make them behave in like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>soft feminine wave male frogs and make </v>

4504
02:58:18.271 --> 02:58:21.690
<v Speaker 1>them behave in a feminine way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for 10% of the frogs touched by this</v>

4505
02:58:21.691 --> 02:58:24.060
<v Speaker 1>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would actually send through a process</v>

4506
02:58:24.061 --> 02:58:28.320
<v Speaker 1>to transform into a fertile female frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4507
02:58:28.350 --> 02:58:30.510
<v Speaker 1>So it wouldn't be making gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was lucy thinking trends.</v>

4508
02:58:30.511 --> 02:58:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not even trans.</v>

4509
02:58:32.371 --> 02:58:33.204
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's literally like changing your </v>

4510
02:58:34.501 --> 02:58:35.940
<v Speaker 1>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your actual sex.</v>

4511
02:58:35.970 --> 02:58:36.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4512
02:58:36.301 --> 02:58:38.670
<v Speaker 1>It's literally like transitioning into </v>
<v Speaker 1>an actual female.</v>

4513
02:58:38.671 --> 02:58:41.220
<v Speaker 1>That's actually first I'll say it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than we can do for human beings.</v>

4514
02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:42.311
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

4515
02:58:42.311 --> 02:58:44.610
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was actually a real thing.</v>

4516
02:58:44.970 --> 02:58:45.803
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like an intentional plan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try and turn people into gays or trans </v>

4517
02:58:49.801 --> 02:58:51.120
<v Speaker 1>or whatever though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't,</v>

4518
02:58:51.121 --> 02:58:53.490
<v Speaker 1>it was done by people who are globalists</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

4519
02:58:53.790 --> 02:58:55.920
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't done as part of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nefarious plot.</v>

4520
02:58:56.040 --> 02:58:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It was dumb because it was cheaper to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just dump the chemicals,</v>

4521
02:58:58.411 --> 02:58:59.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

4522
02:58:59.070 --> 02:59:00.450
<v Speaker 1>And it was just an unintended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

4523
02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:02.370
<v Speaker 1>it's just ironic going Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones says,</v>

4524
02:59:02.371 --> 02:59:02.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4525
02:59:02.771 --> 02:59:03.604
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the globalist supporting chemicals into </v>

4526
02:59:04.801 --> 02:59:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the water than make friends gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4527
02:59:05.941 --> 02:59:06.900
<v Speaker 1>he ease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4528
02:59:07.170 --> 02:59:08.003
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during Desert Storm there was a project </v>

4529
02:59:10.141 --> 02:59:13.710
<v Speaker 1>that they put together where they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out a gay bomb.</v>

4530
02:59:14.060 --> 02:59:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about that?</v>

4531
02:59:15.460 --> 02:59:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I had about like the soldiers were about</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting like you,</v>

4532
02:59:17.781 --> 02:59:18.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4533
02:59:18.331 --> 02:59:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not feeling very horny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I've decided,</v>

4534
02:59:20.401 --> 02:59:21.530
<v Speaker 1>I like men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

4535
02:59:21.570 --> 02:59:24.900
<v Speaker 1>they would blow this stuff in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blow it up,</v>

4536
02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:25.793
<v Speaker 1>and it would land down on them and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would transfer them into gay people and </v>

4537
02:59:28.351 --> 02:59:31.500
<v Speaker 1>they'd be so ashamed that they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop fighting and lose morale.</v>

4538
02:59:31.650 --> 02:59:33.370
<v Speaker 1>This was a real consideration they </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent,</v>

4539
02:59:34.040 --> 02:59:35.610
<v Speaker 1>came about the Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they?</v>

4540
02:59:35.970 --> 02:59:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

4541
02:59:36.960 --> 02:59:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Cause these guys have fearsomely gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

4542
02:59:38.701 --> 02:59:39.534
<v Speaker 1>with that was a super power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thebesians scientists develop gay bomb </v>

4543
02:59:42.691 --> 02:59:45.390
<v Speaker 1>to make enemy soldiers stop fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make love,</v>

4544
02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:47.100
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

4547
02:59:48.990 --> 02:59:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Two scientists at right laboratory in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dayton,</v>

4548
02:59:51.511 --> 02:59:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Ohio working to make America's military </v>
<v Speaker 1>even mightier made the discovery in 1994</v>

4549
02:59:56.281 --> 02:59:58.980
<v Speaker 1>according to the detailed page papers on</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

4550
02:59:58.981 --> 02:59:59.814
<v Speaker 1>through a freedom of information request</v>
<v Speaker 1>and last night they were finally </v>

4551
03:00:04.111 --> 03:00:09.111
<v Speaker 1>rewarded within what does that Igg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iga or LG ignoble awards.</v>

4552
03:00:09.630 --> 03:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prize for peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A spoof of the Nobel prize.</v>

4553
03:00:12.520 --> 03:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Due to be announced next week,</v>

4554
03:00:14.911 --> 03:00:15.744
<v Speaker 1>Marc Abrahams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a editor of the animals of the </v>

4555
03:00:17.431 --> 03:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>improbable research and the man behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ignoble awards explained,</v>

4556
03:00:21.450 --> 03:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>we don't know if this document was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>start and end of it or whatever.</v>

4557
03:00:26.130 --> 03:00:26.963
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this project continued and perhaps </v>

4558
03:00:28.531 --> 03:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>continues to this day.</v>

4559
03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

4560
03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:32.193
<v Speaker 1>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to this day they might be working on </v>

4561
03:00:33.331 --> 03:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>the gay bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think trump puts a stop to that?</v>

4562
03:00:35.910 --> 03:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't waste per necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending.</v>

4563
03:00:37.650 --> 03:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>He's pro gay then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4564
03:00:38.641 --> 03:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't want to be too </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated change people.</v>

4565
03:00:41.881 --> 03:00:42.714
<v Speaker 1>What if a regular guy like him gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitten by that spider I radioactive gay </v>

4566
03:00:45.541 --> 03:00:46.374
<v Speaker 1>spider?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about how that tick that </v>

4567
03:00:47.521 --> 03:00:52.521
<v Speaker 1>turns people into vegans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Count down was a tick bite.</v>

4568
03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>This tick bites you and you develop a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat allergy.</v>

4569
03:00:55.860 --> 03:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

4570
03:00:56.810 --> 03:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Well it's called the lone star tick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether they,</v>

4571
03:00:59.590 --> 03:01:00.423
<v Speaker 1>where they live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably taxes cause it's called the </v>

4572
03:01:01.691 --> 03:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>lone star tick actually guesser but I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they're spreading.</v>

4573
03:01:05.020 --> 03:01:08.840
<v Speaker 1>But it would be ironic if it was in like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat eating capital of the world and</v>

4574
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:09.703
<v Speaker 1>lone star tick making people allergic to</v>
<v Speaker 1>red meat that eat the fuck out of some </v>

4575
03:01:13.001 --> 03:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>

4576
03:01:13.410 --> 03:01:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll tell you that Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was engineered by the government.</v>

4577
03:01:17.470 --> 03:01:18.303
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's just nature deciding </v>

4578
03:01:20.651 --> 03:01:22.480
<v Speaker 1>we're tired of their bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4579
03:01:22.510 --> 03:01:23.343
<v Speaker 1>it's been recorded as far north as Maine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the way to central Texas and </v>

4580
03:01:26.141 --> 03:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4581
03:01:27.820 --> 03:01:28.653
<v Speaker 1>The ticks are found in the dense </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergrowth and wooded areas as well as </v>

4582
03:01:31.571 --> 03:01:33.700
<v Speaker 1>around animal resting areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4583
03:01:33.701 --> 03:01:34.534
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about this man </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I run in the hills where this </v>

4584
03:01:36.491 --> 03:01:37.324
<v Speaker 1>ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw tick like Ari and I did a podcast </v>

4585
03:01:39.611 --> 03:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>the other day that we will release on </v>
<v Speaker 1>July 18th,</v>

4586
03:01:42.041 --> 03:01:44.470
<v Speaker 1>which is the day that Ariz Netflix </v>
<v Speaker 1>special comes out.</v>

4587
03:01:44.770 --> 03:01:48.160
<v Speaker 1>But we did a podcast where we went on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hike and I put on a weighted vest and we</v>

4588
03:01:48.161 --> 03:01:48.994
<v Speaker 1>went through the woods and did the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that I do when I run and I'm a </v>

4589
03:01:51.821 --> 03:01:56.260
<v Speaker 1>tick landed on Ari and we knocked it off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we started talking about it and</v>

4590
03:01:56.261 --> 03:01:56.710
<v Speaker 1>like go on.</v>

4591
03:01:56.710 --> 03:01:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Like is there a way to stop ticks from </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming on you?</v>

4592
03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Is there like an effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they have a spray?</v>

4593
03:02:03.070 --> 03:02:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Like ticks are not like mosquitoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4594
03:02:05.130 --> 03:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there an effective tick spray?</v>

4595
03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:09.520
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you should know?</v>

4596
03:02:09.521 --> 03:02:10.354
<v Speaker 1>Do you're so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know that ticks and I'm the </v>

<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing.</v>

4603

<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know that his thermos </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells in a,</v>

4604
03:02:30.581 --> 03:02:35.581
<v Speaker 1>a piece of equipment that people take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>hikes and camping and hunting it.</v>

4605
03:02:37.021 --> 03:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4606
03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:42.130
<v Speaker 1>there's this chemical that screws into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom and then it has an element.</v>

4607
03:02:42.190 --> 03:02:44.740
<v Speaker 1>You Click it and heats on and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

4608
03:02:44.740 --> 03:02:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Mist through this element and this fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>mist.</v>

4609
03:02:49.930 --> 03:02:54.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't smell bad to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mosquitoes cannot fuck with it.</v>

4610
03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just vanish like,</v>

4611
03:02:56.831 --> 03:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

4612
03:02:57.430 --> 03:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>it's not poisonous to let alone the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I don't know,</v>

4613
03:02:59.951 --> 03:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

4614
03:03:01.060 --> 03:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be saying doing this.</v>

4615
03:03:03.341 --> 03:03:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And then five years later you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>dementia and I heard you.</v>

4616
03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4617
03:03:07.451 --> 03:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm panicking now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

4618
03:03:09.010 --> 03:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Some things I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be good for them.</v>

4619
03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:12.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about him?</v>

4620

<v Speaker 1>I've seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

4621
03:03:14.141 --> 03:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I definitely have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I went looking.</v>

4622
03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Did Ya?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4623
03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I did a whole TV show about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4624
03:03:18.311 --> 03:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4625
03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this,</v>

4626
03:03:20.891 --> 03:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>a show that I used to do on the Scifi </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel that made me,</v>

4627
03:03:24.550 --> 03:03:25.383
<v Speaker 1>this is get made a lot of people mad at </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and it also made me realize what </v>

4628
03:03:29.111 --> 03:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theories really we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

4629
03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>And the show's called Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

4630
03:03:32.891 --> 03:03:33.724
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would go and I would embed myself </v>

4631
03:03:35.201 --> 03:03:36.034
<v Speaker 1>with these people and hang out with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I embedded myself with these big </v>

4632
03:03:37.991 --> 03:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>foot people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I said at the end of it was,</v>

4633
03:03:41.080 --> 03:03:41.913
<v Speaker 1>here's one thing that you don't find </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go looking for bigfoot black </v>

4634
03:03:44.741 --> 03:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to find big foot than</v>

4635
03:03:47.441 --> 03:03:49.100
<v Speaker 1>you are black people looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigfoot.</v>

4636
03:03:49.570 --> 03:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of unfuckable white guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>out camping.</v>

4637
03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.760
<v Speaker 1>It's true black people to want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with it.</v>

4638
03:03:58.761 --> 03:04:02.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a goofy white obsession and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

4639
03:04:02.841 --> 03:04:05.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no one that I talked to her.</v>

4640
03:04:05.871 --> 03:04:07.970
<v Speaker 1>This is like one lady that had a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good story.</v>

4641
03:04:09.110 --> 03:04:11.060
<v Speaker 1>She believed that she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

4642
03:04:11.061 --> 03:04:13.850
<v Speaker 1>black bears are huge and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4643
03:04:13.860 --> 03:04:14.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a black beard seven feet </v>

4644
03:04:15.411 --> 03:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>tall easily and they walk on their hind </v>
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>

4645
03:04:17.691 --> 03:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they just do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows they do.</v>

4646
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:21.440
<v Speaker 1>There's video of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a mystery.</v>

4647
03:04:22.010 --> 03:04:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Black bears walking through the woods on</v>
<v Speaker 1>hind legs are seven feet tall.</v>

4648
03:04:24.921 --> 03:04:25.754
<v Speaker 1>You would think that's big for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really just telling him our shops </v>

4649
03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:28.091
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

4650
03:04:28.091 --> 03:04:29.570
<v Speaker 1>if there's no big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the earth is flat,</v>

4651
03:04:29.571 --> 03:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>we'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

4652
03:04:31.010 --> 03:04:32.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the earth is flat either.</v>

4653
03:04:32.751 --> 03:04:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just everything's aligned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4654
03:04:35.660 --> 03:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>This is all psy ops thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4655
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:39.890
<v Speaker 1>there are so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really convincing stories.</v>

4656
03:04:39.950 --> 03:04:41.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third one,</v>

4657
03:04:42.350 --> 03:04:43.790
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard one of them.</v>

4658
03:04:43.820 --> 03:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>convincing stories of big foot.</v>

4659
03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:46.191
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4663
03:04:48.261 --> 03:04:50.090
<v Speaker 1>five feet away from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4664
03:04:50.091 --> 03:04:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's saying and it didn't have like,</v>

4665
03:04:51.501 --> 03:04:52.334
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have the best price and a </v>

4666
03:04:52.761 --> 03:04:54.590
<v Speaker 1>man's face and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be like,</v>

4667
03:04:54.591 --> 03:04:55.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

4668

<v Speaker 1>it was looking at me and stuff with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

4669
03:04:56.930 --> 03:04:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nobody's ever gold.</v>

4670
03:04:58.461 --> 03:04:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Good picture of any of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4671
03:04:59.960 --> 03:05:00.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really goes to the woods on a </v>

4672
03:05:02.931 --> 03:05:05.420
<v Speaker 1>regular other than Les Stroud Survivor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

4673
03:05:05.421 --> 03:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>He believes that you thinks one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>

4674
03:05:07.241 --> 03:05:09.470
<v Speaker 1>there are never any bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never any feces.</v>

4675
03:05:09.620 --> 03:05:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I've heard bears makeup fucking monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>noise too.</v>

4676
03:05:12.350 --> 03:05:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I heard him say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4677
03:05:14.121 --> 03:05:16.220
<v Speaker 1>it made it sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4678
03:05:16.960 --> 03:05:19.520

<v Speaker 1>but I've heard,</v>

4679
03:05:19.521 --> 03:05:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I've seen in my own eyes in the woods a </v>

<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

4690
03:05:46.700 --> 03:05:47.533
<v Speaker 1>There's enough people looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is when they found out </v>

4691
03:05:50.121 --> 03:05:55.121
<v Speaker 1>that like that about that Hobbit Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know the hollow Homo Floresiensis</v>

4692
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:58.600
<v Speaker 1>for instances?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

4693
03:05:58.700 --> 03:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I know the thing you talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the island of Flores.</v>

4694
03:06:01.220 --> 03:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Indonesia they found within the last</v>

4695
03:06:03.951 --> 03:06:04.784
<v Speaker 1>14,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years there was absolutely a little </v>

4696
03:06:07.281 --> 03:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>person that was like two and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three feet tall look like,</v>

4697
03:06:11.541 --> 03:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4698
03:06:12.200 --> 03:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>But they look 100% human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4699
03:06:14.571 --> 03:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>this thing is did not look 100% human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a new car.</v>

4700
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:21.570
<v Speaker 1>It was another type or an offshoot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Homo sapiens.</v>

4701
03:06:22.310 --> 03:06:23.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4702
03:06:23.001 --> 03:06:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they classified it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they have DNA on it.</v>

4703
03:06:26.791 --> 03:06:27.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4704
03:06:27.090 --> 03:06:30.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a relation of hume that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a type of human,</v>

4705
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's not neanderthal tall and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not homosapien.</v>

4706
03:06:33.740 --> 03:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>And this thing was 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

4707
03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>So they know that gigantic [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a real animal in the net.</v>

4708
03:06:39.950 --> 03:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It lived on hundred per 100% alongside </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings as recently as 100,000</v>

4709
03:06:45.711 --> 03:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

4710
03:06:47.811 --> 03:06:49.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just nonsense.</v>

4711
03:06:49.100 --> 03:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I was big for thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4712
03:06:50.181 --> 03:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>that Orang pen deck is much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

4713
03:06:52.730 --> 03:06:57.630
<v Speaker 1>The orange pen deck is a small Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like man that lived,</v>

4714
03:06:57.660 --> 03:06:58.493
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that might've been Indonesia as </v>

4715
03:06:59.461 --> 03:07:00.360
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4716
03:07:00.390 --> 03:07:03.120
<v Speaker 1>But what is the Vietnam?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

4717
03:07:03.450 --> 03:07:04.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's these,</v>

4718
03:07:04.500 --> 03:07:05.333
<v Speaker 1>some of these tropical jungle climates </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there might have been as recently </v>

4719
03:07:08.761 --> 03:07:09.121
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4720
03:07:09.121 --> 03:07:09.954
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years ago or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might have been a few of those </v>

4721
03:07:12.121 --> 03:07:14.250
<v Speaker 1>fuckers remaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

4722
03:07:14.640 --> 03:07:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean when someone dies in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4723
03:07:16.381 --> 03:07:18.300
<v Speaker 1>do you know how many people we lose in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States?</v>

4724

<v Speaker 1>Loads thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every year.</v>

4725

<v Speaker 1>I watched David polite all the time on </v>

4726
03:07:23.191 --> 03:07:25.940
<v Speaker 1>like art bell and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's great and he's,</v>

4727
03:07:26.090 --> 03:07:26.821
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

4728
03:07:26.821 --> 03:07:27.654
<v Speaker 1>He's like such clean coal American guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he never goes into like the wild </v>

4729
03:07:30.181 --> 03:07:32.070
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory angle to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

4730
03:07:32.071 --> 03:07:33.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always hinting that,</v>

4731
03:07:33.571 --> 03:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably painful.</v>

4732

<v Speaker 1>So Santiago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was a book,</v>

4748
03:08:18.760 --> 03:08:20.790
<v Speaker 1>A suit as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another part of my bit,</v>

4749
03:08:20.791 --> 03:08:21.624
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you see something that looks </v>

4750
03:08:22.351 --> 03:08:24.430
<v Speaker 1>like a person in a suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a person in a suit.</v>

03:08:24.640 --> 03:08:27.570
<v Speaker 1>There's not a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot lose a person in a suit.</v>

4752
03:08:27.571 --> 03:08:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

4753
03:08:29.130 --> 03:08:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I just wanna know the conversation was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look if we,</v>

4754
03:08:31.440 --> 03:08:32.273
<v Speaker 1>if we get mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it means he's going to look like </v>

4755
03:08:33.900 --> 03:08:34.733
<v Speaker 1>person to suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we get a female so they can be </v>

4756
03:08:36.031 --> 03:08:37.050
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would they,</v>

03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:39.313

4759
03:08:41.041 --> 03:08:41.874
<v Speaker 1>would be smaller than male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of it being an eight foot </v>

4760
03:08:45.151 --> 03:08:45.984
<v Speaker 1>tall thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a six foot tall thing and it's </v>

4761
03:08:47.970 --> 03:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>like a regular size dude with some nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>tits and you're like,</v>

4762
03:08:51.120 --> 03:08:52.200

<v Speaker 1>like a big seven foot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the big food.</v>

4765

<v Speaker 1>live youtube the grade and it's always </v>

4766
03:08:59.791 --> 03:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>like done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it in a suit.</v>

4767
03:09:01.170 --> 03:09:02.003
<v Speaker 1>It was a Wiki leaks that was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>released today about NASA knowing about </v>

4768
03:09:05.490 --> 03:09:08.870
<v Speaker 1>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Railey yes.</v>

4769
03:09:10.620 --> 03:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

4770
03:09:12.990 --> 03:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>NASA knows about aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have information on Wiki leaks,</v>

4771
03:09:16.471 --> 03:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>knows if they're going to spill the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beans.</v>

4772
03:09:19.470 --> 03:09:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I tell you when it comes out somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it really is true.</v>

4773
03:09:22.141 --> 03:09:22.974
<v Speaker 1>And then there's like an alien </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambassador on the White House lawn or </v>

4774
03:09:24.601 --> 03:09:25.434
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be like,</v>

4775
03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:26.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4776

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4777
03:09:27.841 --> 03:09:28.674
<v Speaker 1>it's anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was much more likely to be </v>

4778
03:09:32.371 --> 03:09:33.320
<v Speaker 1>pranksters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4780
03:09:35.580 --> 03:09:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Much more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's anonymous.</v>

4781
03:09:38.641 --> 03:09:42.420
<v Speaker 1>A global hacking collected the leads </v>
<v Speaker 1>that alien life exists and thanks.</v>

4782
03:09:42.421 --> 03:09:45.480
<v Speaker 1>NASA is about to confirm it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shadowy group.</v>

4783
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>on Tuesday,</v>

4790
03:09:58.331 --> 03:10:02.680
<v Speaker 1>the video centers around recent findings</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the American space organization,</v>

4791
03:10:02.681 --> 03:10:07.330
<v Speaker 1>including the discovery of 219 new </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet candidates,</v>

4792
03:10:07.331 --> 03:10:08.164

<v Speaker 1>to Earth by NASA's Kepler space </v>

4793
03:10:12.011 --> 03:10:12.844
<v Speaker 1>telescope team in June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as comments made by a senior </v>

4794
03:10:16.211 --> 03:10:18.280
<v Speaker 1>NASA official.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the real thing,</v>

4795
03:10:18.430 --> 03:10:19.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe in,</v>

4796
03:10:19.391 --> 03:10:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I believe as well that it's entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that some life exists somewhere</v>

4797
03:10:22.811 --> 03:10:25.330
<v Speaker 1>in the infinite universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't believe it doesn't.</v>

4798
03:10:25.450 --> 03:10:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're on the same page.</v>

4799
03:10:27.310 --> 03:10:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Why are we so skeptical about skeptical </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it visiting us?</v>

4800
03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very difficult to visit us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4801
03:10:31.930 --> 03:10:33.760
<v Speaker 1>But if it's like way more advanced than </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

4802
03:10:33.940 --> 03:10:36.130
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't it be able to figure it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like we could figure out how to get</v>

4803
03:10:36.131 --> 03:10:36.964
<v Speaker 1>a probe to Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why can't it figure out how to </v>

4804
03:10:38.291 --> 03:10:39.100
<v Speaker 1>visit?</v>

4805
03:10:39.100 --> 03:10:42.300
<v Speaker 1>But then we've got a government </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy and cover.</v>

4806
03:10:42.750 --> 03:10:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Do we or are they just people and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know any more than you are?</v>

4807
03:10:46.271 --> 03:10:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know shit.</v>

4808
03:10:47.651 --> 03:10:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Why would the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if aliens came here?</v>

4809
03:10:49.301 --> 03:10:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they would like go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's an elected official.</v>

4810
03:10:51.820 --> 03:10:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Clearly that guy's the mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me talk to him.</v>

4811
03:10:54.640 --> 03:10:56.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd look at this fucking ant hill and</v>

4812
03:10:56.741 --> 03:10:58.810
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one of these dip should we tell?</v>

4813
03:10:58.960 --> 03:10:59.793
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno it just pick that guy up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stick some stuff up his ass and do </v>

4814
03:11:02.621 --> 03:11:05.870
<v Speaker 1>some run some tests on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bullocks though cause we,</v>

4815
03:11:05.980 --> 03:11:06.813
<v Speaker 1>and listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten really offended and we've </v>

4816
03:11:08.711 --> 03:11:10.850
<v Speaker 1>got a friends online forever and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a call the counselor.</v>

4817
03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>

4818
03:11:11.891 --> 03:11:14.020
<v Speaker 1>we can distinguish between from one end </v>
<v Speaker 1>to another.</v>

4819
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see the workers,</v>

4820
03:11:15.070 --> 03:11:16.570
<v Speaker 1>we can see the soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see the queen.</v>

4821
03:11:16.900 --> 03:11:17.800
<v Speaker 1>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can tell.</v>

4822
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:18.663
<v Speaker 1>They would surely be smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But does the queen or physically shaped </v>

4823
03:11:22.391 --> 03:11:23.224
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>

4824
03:11:24.120 --> 03:11:24.953
<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>

4825
03:11:25.130 --> 03:11:29.060
<v Speaker 1>They're different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this big one makes all the babies.</v>

4826
03:11:29.330 --> 03:11:32.080
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty obvious that a queen bee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

4827
03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:32.983
<v Speaker 1>she has a giant Stinger that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>detach and she goes and kills all the </v>

4828
03:11:36.201 --> 03:11:38.810
<v Speaker 1>baby bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is trying to kill the women.</v>

4829
03:11:39.350 --> 03:11:41.210
<v Speaker 1>They speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably can,</v>

4830
03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:42.473
<v Speaker 1>but if they say Mr President,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to think that if something is </v>

4831
03:11:46.041 --> 03:11:46.874
<v Speaker 1>alien that it could be so alien that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our concepts of culture are so </v>

4832
03:11:51.411 --> 03:11:55.520
<v Speaker 1>bizarre that there's no context for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to relate to send a language.</v>

4833
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:59.480
<v Speaker 1>They've just know what we're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what we're saying based on the</v>

4834
03:11:59.481 --> 03:12:03.080
<v Speaker 1>fact that it's fairly simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can understand the language then</v>

4835
03:12:03.081 --> 03:12:06.610
<v Speaker 1>they must have real relatable or similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts in their own board.</v>

4836
03:12:06.830 --> 03:12:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be able to translate,</v>

4837
03:12:08.781 --> 03:12:10.910
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily then the continents </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

4838
03:12:10.940 --> 03:12:11.773
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's putting them into a limitation </v>

4839
03:12:14.001 --> 03:12:14.834
<v Speaker 1>that we currently have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't understand dolphin </v>

4840
03:12:16.371 --> 03:12:18.720
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know they have a language we can,</v>

4841
03:12:18.890 --> 03:12:22.130
<v Speaker 1>we can appreciate the dolphins probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a concept for eating.</v>

4842
03:12:23.520 --> 03:12:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4843
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:25.690
<v Speaker 1>So like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the dolphins,</v>

4844
03:12:25.691 --> 03:12:26.524
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what dolphin temperature </v>

4845
03:12:28.460 --> 03:12:31.790
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like who's the queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the mayor hierarchical,</v>

4846
03:12:31.800 --> 03:12:32.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have like an Alpha Dolphin </v>

4847
03:12:34.180 --> 03:12:35.013
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dolphins will have some like clicks </v>

4848
03:12:38.020 --> 03:12:38.853
<v Speaker 1>that mean the person in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they must have some concept of </v>

4849
03:12:41.861 --> 03:12:44.740
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy because they have a concept </v>
<v Speaker 1>for see them operate under.</v>

4850
03:12:44.741 --> 03:12:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

4851
03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:49.300
<v Speaker 1>if we could don't really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphin language will know.</v>

4852
03:12:49.301 --> 03:12:52.130
<v Speaker 1>But I mean we can surely pick out like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

4853
03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:52.993
<v Speaker 2>concepts themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they must be the concept of the </v>

4854
03:12:55.691 --> 03:12:56.524
<v Speaker 2>Leda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I though they just count on send the </v>

4855
03:12:57.831 --> 03:12:58.664
<v Speaker 2>concept of labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is widely understood </v>

4856
03:13:02.871 --> 03:13:04.700
<v Speaker 2>what dolphins are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

4857
03:13:04.710 --> 03:13:08.600
<v Speaker 2>when I translate dolphin to humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't even recreate it.</v>

4858
03:13:08.730 --> 03:13:09.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4859
03:13:09.270 --> 03:13:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't recreate their,</v>

4860
03:13:11.241 --> 03:13:13.700
<v Speaker 2>sounds like we don't know what their </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds mean.</v>

4861
03:13:13.820 --> 03:13:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Like if we set a bunch of shit to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphin,</v>

4862
03:13:18.010 --> 03:13:19.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we can talk to dolphins </v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything,</v>

4863
03:13:19.671 --> 03:13:21.230
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with a,</v>

4864
03:13:21.231 --> 03:13:21.951
<v Speaker 2>with a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4865
03:13:21.951 --> 03:13:22.350
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4866
03:13:22.350 --> 03:13:26.170
<v Speaker 2>the dogs would go sit in kinds of very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very primitive methods of communication.</v>

4867
03:13:26.171 --> 03:13:27.860
<v Speaker 2>But like a dog whimpers you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in pain,</v>

4868
03:13:27.880 --> 03:13:29.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it.</v>

4869
03:13:29.900 --> 03:13:32.690
<v Speaker 2>And so I have to have a concept of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

4870
03:13:32.691 --> 03:13:33.524
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in pain to understand the dog's </v>

4871
03:13:34.671 --> 03:13:36.980
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that that means the dog hurt.</v>

4872
03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I must understand that the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurts.</v>

4873
03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if the aliens,</v>

4874
03:13:41.030 --> 03:13:41.863
<v Speaker 2>if they can end standing diced and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>must understand the concept of what </v>

4875
03:13:43.791 --> 03:13:46.760
<v Speaker 2>president is or they must have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must have some sort of,</v>

4876
03:13:46.940 --> 03:13:49.520
<v Speaker 2>they must have a clean way of analyzing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4877
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:50.383
<v Speaker 2>Surely they for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can take taking all [inaudible] </v>

4878
03:13:52.800 --> 03:13:53.930
<v Speaker 2>superior to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be saying,</v>

4879
03:13:54.350 --> 03:13:55.183
<v Speaker 2>well if not superior technologically far</v>
<v Speaker 2>more advanced in in that there've been </v>

4880
03:13:59.151 --> 03:14:02.270
<v Speaker 2>alive longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you consider the possibility of</v>

4881
03:14:02.271 --> 03:14:04.790
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of different weather </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>

4882
03:14:04.791 --> 03:14:08.180
<v Speaker 2>different life conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe different solar systems where they</v>

4883
03:14:08.181 --> 03:14:12.110
<v Speaker 2>have zero concern about being hit by an </v>
<v Speaker 2>asteroid is bipedal.</v>

4884
03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

4885
03:14:13.210 --> 03:14:14.043
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's because they're supposed to </v>

4886
03:14:15.651 --> 03:14:19.610
<v Speaker 2>represent us in the future cause easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

4887
03:14:19.760 --> 03:14:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Surely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we were called the funny too.</v>

4888
03:14:22.010 --> 03:14:23.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a relatable thing.</v>

4889
03:14:23.300 --> 03:14:24.133
<v Speaker 2>It'd be that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was my point is that I think </v>

4890
03:14:25.221 --> 03:14:30.221
<v Speaker 2>that aliens could potentially be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>alien that they can't even relate to the</v>

4891
03:14:30.831 --> 03:14:33.920
<v Speaker 2>concept of our ability to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with noises.</v>

4892
03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Like they might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emily,</v>

4893
03:14:35.221 --> 03:14:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Katie Fair with smells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4894
03:14:36.681 --> 03:14:37.514
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4895
03:14:37.610 --> 03:14:40.910
<v Speaker 2>They might be using some telekinesis or </v>
<v Speaker 2>some shit.</v>

4896
03:14:42.350 --> 03:14:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Psychics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4897
03:14:43.490 --> 03:14:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

4898
03:14:45.100 --> 03:14:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's,</v>

4899
03:14:46.140 --> 03:14:50.990
<v Speaker 2>do you think if you had a bet all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your youtube money very much.</v>

4900
03:14:50.991 --> 03:14:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I have aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have aliens been here or no?</v>

4901
03:14:56.090 --> 03:14:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I probably been no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4902
03:14:59.490 --> 03:15:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but skeptic,</v>

4903
03:15:01.860 --> 03:15:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of the ancient alien stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's total horse shit.</v>

4904
03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Total Horse Shit.</v>

4905
03:15:07.940 --> 03:15:12.080
<v Speaker 2>That stuff is really fits more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Graham Hancock,</v>

4906
03:15:12.081 --> 03:15:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Randall Carlson mode of there being an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient,</v>

4907
03:15:15.051 --> 03:15:18.110
<v Speaker 2>very advanced civilization that probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>was wiped out.</v>

4908
03:15:18.290 --> 03:15:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Just like we know there have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations that were wiped out.</v>

4909
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:25.310
<v Speaker 2>It's much more likely that someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>say in Machu Picchu,</v>

4910
03:15:25.400 --> 03:15:28.910
<v Speaker 2>someone was able to construct things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4911
03:15:28.911 --> 03:15:32.150
<v Speaker 2>that were like really confusing cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

4912
03:15:32.310 --> 03:15:33.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't come from the new world.</v>

4913
03:15:33.860 --> 03:15:34.693
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting because as soon </v>

4914
03:15:36.711 --> 03:15:38.090
<v Speaker 2>as you start going down this line you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

4915
03:15:38.091 --> 03:15:38.924
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well do you need to have high </v>

4916
03:15:39.501 --> 03:15:40.334
<v Speaker 2>civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need sudden series of things and </v>

4917
03:15:42.171 --> 03:15:43.310
<v Speaker 2>there are a bunch of books you can it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

4918
03:15:44.180 --> 03:15:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Abundance of food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture.</v>

4919
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:48.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like you need a little more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as well.</v>

4920
03:15:48.351 --> 03:15:49.710
<v Speaker 2>But like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

4921
03:15:49.711 --> 03:15:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you can</v>

4922
03:15:49.980 --> 03:15:51.330
<v Speaker 3>read a ton of solar things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth,</v>

4923
03:15:51.331 --> 03:15:53.760
<v Speaker 3>power or poverty in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with the title is,</v>

4924
03:15:54.020 --> 03:15:55.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

4925
03:15:55.111 --> 03:15:57.810
<v Speaker 3>why nations fail and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4926
03:15:57.840 --> 03:16:02.290
<v Speaker 3>what's the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>germs and steel red and we these books.</v>

4927
03:16:02.291 --> 03:16:03.124
<v Speaker 3>And then suddenly you understand what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what populations need three quarters of </v>

4928
03:16:05.821 --> 03:16:06.451
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should be honest,</v>

4929
03:16:06.451 --> 03:16:07.830
<v Speaker 3>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bailed on it,</v>

4930
03:16:08.700 --> 03:16:09.780
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4931
03:16:09.820 --> 03:16:10.653
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole slew of things you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a civilization for humans to develop </v>

4932
03:16:14.341 --> 03:16:15.174
<v Speaker 3>to high sort of standards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>population density and all this sort of </v>

4933
03:16:18.691 --> 03:16:19.770
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

4934
03:16:19.900 --> 03:16:21.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just population densities,</v>

4935
03:16:21.630 --> 03:16:24.900
<v Speaker 3>lots of other places that have high </v>
<v Speaker 3>population densities.</v>

4936
03:16:25.140 --> 03:16:28.920
<v Speaker 3>So in Africa for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got very few areas that have high</v>

4937
03:16:28.921 --> 03:16:29.754
<v Speaker 3>population density.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you don't have great </v>

4938
03:16:32.311 --> 03:16:35.820
<v Speaker 3>civilizations like in sort of sub </v>
<v Speaker 3>Saharan Africa because there just aren't</v>

4939
03:16:36.150 --> 03:16:38.370
<v Speaker 3>great cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dense cities to trade with.</v>

4940
03:16:38.610 --> 03:16:39.480
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you go,</v>

4941
03:16:39.481 --> 03:16:40.410
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what they had,</v>

4942
03:16:40.411 --> 03:16:41.244
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult tree cause in Africa and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something that Thomas soul goes </v>

4943
03:16:42.961 --> 03:16:46.500
<v Speaker 3>into is a look the rivers a Humphrey </v>
<v Speaker 3>navigable,</v>

4944
03:16:47.010 --> 03:16:47.843
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got lots of rapids and some </v>

4945
03:16:48.471 --> 03:16:49.380
<v Speaker 3>rocks and not very deep.</v>

4946
03:16:49.620 --> 03:16:52.000
<v Speaker 3>You can't carry huge barges done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like,</v>

4947
03:16:52.170 --> 03:16:55.230
<v Speaker 3>they're not like the Danube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know this thing goes for,</v>

4948
03:16:55.231 --> 03:16:56.064
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of miles and his deep and you </v>

4949
03:16:57.481 --> 03:16:59.730
<v Speaker 3>can get barges all up and down it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like this.</v>

4950
03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:01.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and traveling,</v>

4951
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:04.650
<v Speaker 3>traveling goods by water is so much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>fashion,</v>

4952
03:17:04.860 --> 03:17:06.960
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 20 times more efficient than trying</v>

4953
03:17:06.961 --> 03:17:09.960
<v Speaker 3>to take them over the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you don't have,</v>

4954
03:17:10.110 --> 03:17:10.943
<v Speaker 3>especially in three large machines and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you'd need that innovation or to </v>

4955
03:17:13.711 --> 03:17:15.290
<v Speaker 3>create the large machines in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

4956
03:17:15.420 --> 03:17:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4957
03:17:16.340 --> 03:17:18.990
<v Speaker 3>and you need somewhere to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not trading with anyone.</v>

4958
03:17:18.991 --> 03:17:19.824
<v Speaker 3>If there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're the one like Atlantean </v>

4959
03:17:20.941 --> 03:17:23.660
<v Speaker 3>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one else is buying your gifts.</v>

4960
03:17:24.270 --> 03:17:25.530
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4961
03:17:25.531 --> 03:17:26.364
<v Speaker 3>it's all horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just couldn't happen based on what </v>

4962
03:17:29.641 --> 03:17:32.080
<v Speaker 3>you need for this thing to actually end </v>
<v Speaker 3>up exist.</v>

4963
03:17:32.260 --> 03:17:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order for an Atlanta is to exist,</v>

4964
03:17:34.130 --> 03:17:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you really have to have a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta lenses.</v>

4965
03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:37.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is more likely that there were </v>

4966
03:17:39.741 --> 03:17:43.070
<v Speaker 1>some sophisticated civilizations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were hit by asteroids.</v>

4967
03:17:44.360 --> 03:17:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have evidence for that.</v>

4968
03:17:45.730 --> 03:17:47.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of iridium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4969
03:17:47.061 --> 03:17:48.680
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of actual physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

4970
03:17:48.681 --> 03:17:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also the stuff,</v>

4971
03:17:49.880 --> 03:17:50.713
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of clear glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's the best evidence cause </v>

4972
03:17:52.731 --> 03:17:55.360
<v Speaker 1>iridium comes from space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iridium radium,</v>

4973
03:17:55.370 --> 03:17:58.550
<v Speaker 1>when you find it in large quantities </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates and asteroid impact.</v>

4974
03:17:58.920 --> 03:17:59.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iridium is very common in space and </v>

4975
03:18:01.191 --> 03:18:02.024
<v Speaker 1>extremely rare on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when there's a whole sediment layer </v>

4976
03:18:04.131 --> 03:18:07.700
<v Speaker 1>of iridium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost entirely provable.</v>

4977
03:18:08.270 --> 03:18:09.103
<v Speaker 1>That's when it was hit by something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be some sort of ruins </v>

4978
03:18:11.181 --> 03:18:13.490
<v Speaker 1>underneath thisone yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're found a lot of ruins.</v>

4979
03:18:13.540 --> 03:18:14.373
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about how old go Beckley </v>

4980
03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:18.950
<v Speaker 1>tapis 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus years old.</v>

4981
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that didn't get,</v>

4982
03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:22.040
<v Speaker 1>that didn't die because it was hit by an</v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid.</v>

4983
03:18:22.130 --> 03:18:22.963
<v Speaker 1>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what Graham Hancock and Randall </v>

4984
03:18:24.171 --> 03:18:25.450
<v Speaker 1>commensalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's speculating.</v>

4985
03:18:25.490 --> 03:18:26.750
<v Speaker 1>That was really primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4986
03:18:26.751 --> 03:18:29.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we go into a massive,</v>

4987
03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:31.820
<v Speaker 1>huge stone columns that are 92 feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>tall,</v>

4988
03:18:31.821 --> 03:18:35.060
<v Speaker 1>they're carved out of stone by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are hunters and gatherers.</v>

4989
03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:38.510
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point being you're hero Tiramisu</v>

4990
03:18:38.511 --> 03:18:39.330
<v Speaker 1>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4991
03:18:39.330 --> 03:18:40.163
<v Speaker 1>for the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like a technological </v>

4992
03:18:41.450 --> 03:18:42.530
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4993
03:18:42.560 --> 03:18:44.660
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a PR impressive?</v>

4994
03:18:44.720 --> 03:18:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Machu Picchu?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impressive.</v>

4995
03:18:45.861 --> 03:18:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4996
03:18:46.791 --> 03:18:48.190
<v Speaker 1>That's not ulta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4997
03:18:48.191 --> 03:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>it's thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple thousand years old.</v>

4998
03:18:49.921 --> 03:18:52.200
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 1400 something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4999
03:18:52.210 --> 03:18:53.043
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think they know that for a </v>

5000
03:18:54.731 --> 03:18:56.890
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the speculations that</v>

5001
03:18:56.891 --> 03:18:57.724
<v Speaker 1>Graham Hancock and Randall Cros that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have presented is that the evidence of </v>

5002
03:19:00.521 --> 03:19:04.870
<v Speaker 1>this nuclear glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which only exists on impact sites before</v>

5003
03:19:04.871 --> 03:19:05.704
<v Speaker 1>you go to your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to maybe so you can understand </v>

5004
03:19:06.731 --> 03:19:08.830
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact sites,</v>

5005
03:19:09.190 --> 03:19:10.023
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where meteors hit or where they've done </v>

5006
03:19:12.731 --> 03:19:13.564
<v Speaker 1>nuclear tests.</v>

5007
03:19:13.600 --> 03:19:16.060
<v Speaker 1>So they found this stuff and micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>diamonds,</v>

5008
03:19:16.061 --> 03:19:19.030
<v Speaker 1>evidence of massive impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they do core samples,</v>

5009
03:19:19.031 --> 03:19:20.980
<v Speaker 1>they founded at 10 and 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

5010
03:19:21.220 --> 03:19:22.053
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>period as the end of the ice age did a </v>

5011
03:19:25.121 --> 03:19:28.390
<v Speaker 1>huge podcast on it with geologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know though.</v>

5012
03:19:28.391 --> 03:19:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to an expert,</v>

5013
03:19:30.130 --> 03:19:30.963
<v Speaker 1>this is pure speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no carbon dated evidence that </v>

5014
03:19:34.031 --> 03:19:37.060
<v Speaker 1>points to that age where as there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Sphinx.</v>

5015
03:19:37.090 --> 03:19:39.790
<v Speaker 1>So with the Sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or excuse me with the Great Pyramids,</v>

5016
03:19:40.040 --> 03:19:40.873
<v Speaker 1>the Great Pyramid of Giza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done some tests on some of the </v>

5017
03:19:43.391 --> 03:19:44.224
<v Speaker 1>sediment and some of the stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the stones and they brought it </v>

5018
03:19:46.601 --> 03:19:48.490
<v Speaker 1>to about 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

5019
03:19:48.900 --> 03:19:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Crazy specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5020
03:19:50.261 --> 03:19:53.130
<v Speaker 1>They found a bunch of stuff that shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

5021
03:19:53.140 --> 03:19:55.170
<v Speaker 1>with a very high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5022
03:19:55.570 --> 03:19:59.650
<v Speaker 1>high degree of possibility or </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that it's around 2,500</v>

5023
03:19:59.651 --> 03:20:00.590
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5024
03:20:00.670 --> 03:20:04.660
<v Speaker 1>What they've done with this [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>name of the massive impacts.</v>

5025
03:20:05.010 --> 03:20:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

5026
03:20:05.410 --> 03:20:06.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With Geezer,</v>

5027
03:20:06.431 --> 03:20:07.264
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5028
03:20:07.630 --> 03:20:08.351
<v Speaker 1>But there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

5029
03:20:08.351 --> 03:20:08.961
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

5030
03:20:08.961 --> 03:20:09.794
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great pyramid,</v>

5031
03:20:10.150 --> 03:20:10.983
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of evidence that there </v>

5032
03:20:13.271 --> 03:20:17.740
<v Speaker 1>was some sort of a massive event around </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

5033
03:20:17.741 --> 03:20:19.060
<v Speaker 1>and 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

5034
03:20:19.210 --> 03:20:20.043
<v Speaker 1>And what their belief is that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where all the stories of Atlanta has </v>

5035
03:20:22.181 --> 03:20:24.280
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where all these stories of these</v>

5036
03:20:24.281 --> 03:20:25.114
<v Speaker 1>great civilizations that were wiped out </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from is that most likely we </v>

5037
03:20:28.601 --> 03:20:29.434
<v Speaker 1>experienced a big die off and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were affected by these disasters </v>

5038
03:20:33.521 --> 03:20:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and catastrophes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That coincided with asteroidal impacts.</v>

5039
03:20:38.170 --> 03:20:39.003
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean we know where the stories of </v>

5040
03:20:40.390 --> 03:20:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Atlantis come from Plato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5041
03:20:43.420 --> 03:20:45.380
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had gone to Egypt and,</v>

5042
03:20:45.820 --> 03:20:47.090
<v Speaker 1>and been told us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all,</v>

5043
03:20:47.260 --> 03:20:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not looking real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

5044
03:20:48.970 --> 03:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said yeah 9,000</v>

5045
03:20:50.921 --> 03:20:53.350
<v Speaker 1>years before the present and that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>built the thing then he was,</v>

5046
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:56.100
<v Speaker 1>that's what's crazy is that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex.</v>

5047
03:20:56.100 --> 03:20:59.200
<v Speaker 1>But it does coincide with the time of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact.</v>

5048
03:20:59.410 --> 03:21:00.310
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>9,000</v>

5049
03:21:00.311 --> 03:21:02.340
<v Speaker 1>years ago there wasn't an Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5050
03:21:02.440 --> 03:21:03.460
<v Speaker 1>from Plato Plato's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5051
03:21:03.461 --> 03:21:06.970
<v Speaker 1>from like 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

5052
03:21:06.971 --> 03:21:08.470
<v Speaker 1>from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 500 BC,</v>

5053
03:21:08.830 --> 03:21:10.750
<v Speaker 1>like 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years pulled out that will's new Egypt.</v>

5054
03:21:10.900 --> 03:21:12.820
<v Speaker 1>There was no efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet the story involves,</v>

5055
03:21:12.940 --> 03:21:13.773
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily true either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Schoch cause the geologists that </v>

5056
03:21:16.841 --> 03:21:19.650
<v Speaker 1>have a Boston University has done a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>

5057
03:21:20.050 --> 03:21:22.380
<v Speaker 1>investigation on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5058
03:21:22.690 --> 03:21:24.820
<v Speaker 1>the temple that the Sphinx was carved </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of,</v>

5059
03:21:24.821 --> 03:21:25.654
<v Speaker 1>like where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sphinx is the walls of the temple </v>

5060
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:30.580
<v Speaker 1>and he believes it's from water erosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

5061
03:21:30.581 --> 03:21:32.740
<v Speaker 1>these fissures and he's deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5062
03:21:32.830 --> 03:21:33.663
<v Speaker 1>erosion marks that they believe indicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the temple of Sphinx or the area </v>

5063
03:21:38.291 --> 03:21:41.950
<v Speaker 1>that's carved out of is far older than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

5064
03:21:42.010 --> 03:21:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Like they know that the Great Pyramid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giza is two,</v>

5065
03:21:45.380 --> 03:21:46.213
<v Speaker 1>500 BC,</v>

5066
03:21:46.340 --> 03:21:48.410
<v Speaker 2>but they fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always attribute the Sphinx of being the</v>

5067
03:21:48.411 --> 03:21:51.320
<v Speaker 2>same timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Robert Schoch from Boston University,</v>

5068
03:21:51.321 --> 03:21:52.850
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case.</v>

5069
03:21:52.851 --> 03:21:53.684
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're looking at is thousands of </v>

5070
03:21:55.130 --> 03:21:55.963
<v Speaker 2>years of rainfall and they have hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of geologists that have signed off on </v>

5071
03:21:58.221 --> 03:21:59.300
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not like,</v>

5072
03:21:59.580 --> 03:22:00.413
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes over the physical evidence of </v>

5073
03:22:02.721 --> 03:22:05.360
<v Speaker 2>these fissures and how they're made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

5074
03:22:05.361 --> 03:22:06.650
<v Speaker 2>as a geologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you,</v>

5075
03:22:06.651 --> 03:22:08.840
<v Speaker 2>you are looking at thousands of years a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rainfall.</v>

5076
03:22:09.050 --> 03:22:13.310
<v Speaker 2>The last time there was series rainfall </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Nile Valley was about 7,000</v>

5077
03:22:13.311 --> 03:22:14.144
<v Speaker 2>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what he's saying is it's entirely </v>

5078
03:22:16.281 --> 03:22:17.114
<v Speaker 2>possible that there have been many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different civilizations that lived in </v>

5079
03:22:20.061 --> 03:22:20.894
<v Speaker 2>this area and that Egypt is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization that might have gone back </v>

5080
03:22:24.350 --> 03:22:27.650
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many thousands of years longer than just</v>

5081
03:22:27.651 --> 03:22:29.390
<v Speaker 2>the construction of the Great Pyramid of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giza.</v>

5082
03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't talking about the Great Pyramid</v>

5083
03:22:31.610 --> 03:22:32.443
<v Speaker 2>of Giza really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's Egypt will live us just a </v>

5084
03:22:34.100 --> 03:22:35.240
<v Speaker 2>monument in Egypt.</v>

5085
03:22:35.290 --> 03:22:36.123
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Egypt is a place that did exist </v>

5086
03:22:38.720 --> 03:22:39.860
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

5087
03:22:39.861 --> 03:22:40.880
<v Speaker 2>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

5088
03:22:40.970 --> 03:22:41.751
<v Speaker 2>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

5089
03:22:41.751 --> 03:22:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Because I like cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't say it.</v>

5090
03:22:43.281 --> 03:22:45.360
<v Speaker 2>No it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you don't really know well,</v>

5091
03:22:46.100 --> 03:22:47.690
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying no it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

5092
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:48.583
<v Speaker 2>are you in Egyptologist do you you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>boots on the ground and talk to the </v>

5093
03:22:51.411 --> 03:22:52.910
<v Speaker 2>people over there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't really know.</v>

5094
03:22:52.911 --> 03:22:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he doesn't know what I'm about say,</v>

5095
03:22:55.310 --> 03:22:57.060
<v Speaker 2>but you said no it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

5096
03:22:57.061 --> 03:22:58.460
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state of Egypt.</v>

5097
03:22:58.570 --> 03:22:59.403
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5098
03:22:59.410 --> 03:23:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Like as I'm not saying they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>people living in the area.</v>

5099
03:23:02.110 --> 03:23:03.590
<v Speaker 2>There aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daddy would've been people living in the</v>

5100
03:23:03.591 --> 03:23:04.424
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5101
03:23:04.430 --> 03:23:06.410
<v Speaker 2>But calling it Egypt are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5102
03:23:06.411 --> 03:23:08.540
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't know co when did they </v>
<v Speaker 2>start calling it Egypt.</v>

5103
03:23:08.600 --> 03:23:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to look that up.</v>

5104
03:23:09.651 --> 03:23:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Put it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

5105
03:23:11.390 --> 03:23:15.320
<v Speaker 2>the like we can tell I'll kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just can tell like,</v>

5106
03:23:15.860 --> 03:23:17.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when the,</v>

5107
03:23:17.591 --> 03:23:18.424
<v Speaker 2>when of grains with first domesticated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and things like this and you're never </v>

5108
03:23:20.841 --> 03:23:23.220
<v Speaker 2>going to have a state without farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to happen.</v>

5109
03:23:23.420 --> 03:23:25.590
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to have like a hunter </v>
<v Speaker 2>gatherer,</v>

5110
03:23:25.610 --> 03:23:29.720
<v Speaker 2>a state where they have a government and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a surplus of food to be able to</v>

5111
03:23:29.721 --> 03:23:31.000
<v Speaker 2>support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5112
03:23:31.100 --> 03:23:32.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre uh,</v>

5113
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:34.460
<v Speaker 2>preached the cloths in the US a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucratic class.</v>

5114
03:23:34.520 --> 03:23:35.353
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5115
03:23:35.390 --> 03:23:38.900
<v Speaker 2>And to get something built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need these things.</v>

5116
03:23:38.930 --> 03:23:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I mean,</v>

5117
03:23:40.761 --> 03:23:43.670
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily calling off stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're going to build a pyramid,</v>

5118
03:23:43.671 --> 03:23:44.504
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need these things.</v>

5119
03:23:44.750 --> 03:23:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Maybe calling us thinks that's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribesmen could do.</v>

5120
03:23:47.760 --> 03:23:50.620
<v Speaker 2>It ain't even cold cocked bell tappy out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it's pronounced go back clean.</v>

5121
03:23:50.660 --> 03:23:51.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correctly.</v>

5122
03:23:51.550 --> 03:23:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

5123
03:23:51.960 --> 03:23:53.470
<v Speaker 2>that can easily believe that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5124
03:23:53.480 --> 03:23:55.900
<v Speaker 2>nomadic a hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could,</v>

5125
03:23:55.940 --> 03:23:57.060
<v Speaker 2>they could have crossed the that cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

5126
03:23:57.120 --> 03:23:58.910
<v Speaker 2>just basically sanding and chipping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>

5127
03:23:59.300 --> 03:24:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've moved them to it.</v>

5128
03:24:00.960 --> 03:24:01.793
<v Speaker 2>These are huge chunks of stone that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>done back when they didn't have a </v>

5129
03:24:04.731 --> 03:24:06.110
<v Speaker 2>surplus of resources.</v>

5130
03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:09.290
<v Speaker 2>The hunters and gatherers and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done it wrong.</v>

5131
03:24:09.291 --> 03:24:10.124
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it wasn't like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monumental achievement for the time and </v>

5132
03:24:12.681 --> 03:24:13.514
<v Speaker 2>the resources obviously was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know that they weren't farming </v>

5133
03:24:16.610 --> 03:24:19.700
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be right about that,</v>

5134
03:24:19.730 --> 03:24:20.563
<v Speaker 2>but we might not be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about an incredibly long </v>

5135
03:24:22.821 --> 03:24:24.050
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,000</v>

5136
03:24:24.051 --> 03:24:24.884
<v Speaker 2>years ago is a long time and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence would be left is really </v>

5137
03:24:28.461 --> 03:24:30.120
<v Speaker 2>probably been absorbed by the earth by </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

5138
03:24:30.210 --> 03:24:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

5139
03:24:31.971 --> 03:24:32.804
<v Speaker 2>But I mean we can't sit here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>speculate about something that might've </v>

5140
03:24:35.480 --> 03:24:38.000
<v Speaker 2>happened if we've gotten a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's exactly what we're doing.</v>

5141
03:24:38.001 --> 03:24:40.640
<v Speaker 2>If we're saying that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely hunter and gatherers,</v>

5142
03:24:40.641 --> 03:24:41.474
<v Speaker 2>we don't know assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do know is they were capable of </v>

5143
03:24:44.401 --> 03:24:49.080
<v Speaker 2>making these incredibly massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated structures 12,000</v>

5144
03:24:49.081 --> 03:24:51.100
<v Speaker 2>years ago for sure is the Sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And infant.</v>

5145
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:52.380
<v Speaker 2>We mess up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're now talking about that.</v>

5146
03:24:52.380 --> 03:24:54.120
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about gold Beckley tappy </v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

5147
03:24:54.121 --> 03:24:54.954
<v Speaker 2>they had the space isn't big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking huge and for you to say </v>

5148
03:24:57.631 --> 03:24:58.464
<v Speaker 2>that it's very disturbing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've only uncovered 5% of it or 10% </v>

5149
03:25:01.860 --> 03:25:03.600
<v Speaker 2>it's massive for further than </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparable.</v>

5150
03:25:03.700 --> 03:25:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Not Quite big studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is the problem.</v>

5151
03:25:06.631 --> 03:25:10.160
<v Speaker 2>You don't know a lot about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're automatically jumping to this</v>

5152
03:25:10.161 --> 03:25:13.980
<v Speaker 2>skeptical but you haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't think it was big.</v>

5153
03:25:15.320 --> 03:25:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I just can't remember off the top of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>head exact the problem.</v>

5154
03:25:17.611 --> 03:25:19.590
<v Speaker 2>But you're so convinced in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

5155
03:25:19.591 --> 03:25:20.424
<v Speaker 2>but you're not really ever really spent </v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole lot of time thinking about a </v>

5156
03:25:23.081 --> 03:25:25.020
<v Speaker 2>carving stone man that's not very </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced.</v>

5157
03:25:25.021 --> 03:25:25.854
<v Speaker 2>Just carving stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're carving stern with three </v>

5158
03:25:27.541 --> 03:25:28.374
<v Speaker 2>dimensional objects in the stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning like lizards that are on the </v>

5159
03:25:30.451 --> 03:25:32.400
<v Speaker 2>outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 foot hauls,</v>

5160
03:25:32.730 --> 03:25:35.550
<v Speaker 2>tall stone columns and concentric </v>
<v Speaker 2>circles.</v>

5161
03:25:35.780 --> 03:25:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a huge structure,</v>

5162
03:25:37.730 --> 03:25:38.563
<v Speaker 2>look at the hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any particular the technology today it </v>

5163
03:25:40.921 --> 03:25:42.210
<v Speaker 2>does to move those things?</v>

5164
03:25:42.340 --> 03:25:43.173
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll look at the image on the far </v>

5165
03:25:43.951 --> 03:25:44.784
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they have figured out so </v>

5166
03:25:46.141 --> 03:25:48.030
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By using radar underground,</v>

5167
03:25:48.031 --> 03:25:51.030
<v Speaker 2>we look at the size of this room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is huge.</v>

5168
03:25:51.060 --> 03:25:53.580
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking shiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>primitive.</v>

5169
03:25:54.120 --> 03:25:54.953
<v Speaker 2>It's just stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that primitive for someone to </v>

5170
03:25:57.691 --> 03:26:00.840
<v Speaker 2>make something out of stone that Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really impressive.</v>

5171
03:26:00.841 --> 03:26:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must've been primitive and turn,</v>

5172
03:26:02.270 --> 03:26:04.290
<v Speaker 2>but like they don't have a TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you mean?</v>

5173
03:26:04.291 --> 03:26:06.690
<v Speaker 2>It isn't like the like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if they,</v>

5174
03:26:07.230 --> 03:26:08.063
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if they went and did some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like super high resolution scans on </v>

5175
03:26:11.971 --> 03:26:13.110
<v Speaker 2>it or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>

5176
03:26:13.111 --> 03:26:13.361
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5177
03:26:13.361 --> 03:26:14.940
<v Speaker 2>This has been coughed with other stone </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools.</v>

5178
03:26:14.941 --> 03:26:15.774
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can tell these be called Capa </v>

5179
03:26:16.440 --> 03:26:17.273
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

5180
03:26:17.460 --> 03:26:20.350
<v Speaker 2>This wouldn't have been carved by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of tools.</v>

5181
03:26:20.351 --> 03:26:21.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows.</v>

5182
03:26:21.031 --> 03:26:23.160
<v Speaker 2>He don't even know that when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great pyramid.</v>

5183
03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:24.750
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that speculate,</v>

5184
03:26:24.751 --> 03:26:25.584
<v Speaker 2>they figured out a way to make some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a diamond tipped late drill in order </v>

5185
03:26:29.491 --> 03:26:30.301
<v Speaker 2>to make the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5186
03:26:30.301 --> 03:26:31.134
<v Speaker 2>the king's chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the sarcophagus is if they </v>

5187
03:26:32.701 --> 03:26:33.534
<v Speaker 2>look at us not fringe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really know how they carved </v>

5188
03:26:35.281 --> 03:26:37.290
<v Speaker 2>out some of the stone in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

5189
03:26:37.291 --> 03:26:38.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a simple thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two pages.</v>

5190
03:26:38.890 --> 03:26:39.723
<v Speaker 2>There's a simple vase in Egypt they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand because it's carved </v>

5191
03:26:42.901 --> 03:26:43.734
<v Speaker 2>completely at a one piece of stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so intricate and so hard that </v>

5192
03:26:47.521 --> 03:26:48.354
<v Speaker 2>they've made this incredibly thin lip on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this vase and they've gone deep inside </v>

5193
03:26:51.751 --> 03:26:53.550
<v Speaker 2>of it and the whole thing is entirely </v>
<v Speaker 2>smooth.</v>

5194
03:26:53.700 --> 03:26:55.140
<v Speaker 2>They really don't know how the fuck they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>

5195
03:26:55.290 --> 03:26:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Probably some paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm rubbing it patients,</v>

5196
03:26:57.420 --> 03:26:59.340
<v Speaker 2>they can't get your fingers inside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing.</v>

5197
03:26:59.341 --> 03:27:01.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about an actual vas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5198
03:27:01.050 --> 03:27:04.230
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very confusing to modern archeologists.</v>

5199
03:27:04.231 --> 03:27:06.140
<v Speaker 2>This is not a got engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

5200
03:27:06.300 --> 03:27:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about what I'm saying.</v>

5201
03:27:09.210 --> 03:27:12.060
<v Speaker 2>What is an ancient advanced civilization</v>
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>

5202
03:27:12.061 --> 03:27:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Don't you agree that the Parthenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Acropolis,</v>

5203
03:27:14.400 --> 03:27:15.233
<v Speaker 2>that's an advanced civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not particularly for the time for what </v>

5204
03:27:17.521 --> 03:27:20.160
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what they accomplished is amazing.</v>

5205
03:27:20.390 --> 03:27:23.550
<v Speaker 2>They said none of great massive stones </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are cut in place.</v>

5206
03:27:23.551 --> 03:27:26.330
<v Speaker 2>The beautiful columns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifth century.</v>

5207
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:27.463
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then what pays in advance </v>

5208
03:27:28.831 --> 03:27:31.530
<v Speaker 2>civilization if that's not advance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the point,</v>

5209
03:27:31.531 --> 03:27:32.364
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you talk calling your vans pathogen </v>

5210
03:27:34.890 --> 03:27:35.723
<v Speaker 2>to as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the glorification of athletes over its </v>

5211
03:27:37.021 --> 03:27:37.910
<v Speaker 2>empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5212
03:27:38.120 --> 03:27:38.953
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not that these things didn't </v>

5213
03:27:39.931 --> 03:27:40.764
<v Speaker 2>already exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's he wanted to make Athens look </v>

5214
03:27:42.641 --> 03:27:44.290
<v Speaker 2>special in the eyes of the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

5215
03:27:44.810 --> 03:27:45.643
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what year did this happen and when </v>

5216
03:27:48.521 --> 03:27:52.210
<v Speaker 2>do you consider people to be fans of out</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the full 60 be seals?</v>

5217
03:27:53.300 --> 03:27:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I should know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Advanced civilization.</v>

5218
03:27:56.020 --> 03:27:57.280
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

5219
03:27:57.281 --> 03:27:58.114
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that didn't exist anywhere and then </v>

5220
03:28:00.071 --> 03:28:02.550
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden may send 1000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>

5221
03:28:02.560 --> 03:28:04.090
<v Speaker 2>but if 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

5222
03:28:04.210 --> 03:28:07.240
<v Speaker 2>something like something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5223
03:28:07.300 --> 03:28:11.260
<v Speaker 2>the Parthenon and the Acropolis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could prove that 10,000</v>

5224
03:28:11.261 --> 03:28:14.170
<v Speaker 2>years before anybody had done anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else that that existed,</v>

5225
03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:15.730
<v Speaker 2>you'd be blown away by that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5226
03:28:15.760 --> 03:28:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shocking.</v>

5227
03:28:16.810 --> 03:28:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5228
03:28:17.190 --> 03:28:19.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] may be 10,000</v>

5229
03:28:19.631 --> 03:28:20.920
<v Speaker 2>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be incredible.</v>

5230
03:28:21.010 --> 03:28:21.521
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5231
03:28:21.521 --> 03:28:22.354
<v Speaker 2>It would be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a bunch of upright stones that have </v>

5232
03:28:23.651 --> 03:28:27.950
<v Speaker 2>been nicely carved to have animals on </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and stuff like that,</v>

5233
03:28:27.951 --> 03:28:28.784
<v Speaker 2>that just that massive stones in 19 feet</v>
<v Speaker 2>tall and concentric circles all in this </v>

5234
03:28:33.430 --> 03:28:34.263
<v Speaker 2>huge structure hens in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know how they made it and we know </v>

5235
03:28:36.651 --> 03:28:37.640
<v Speaker 2>where the students came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5236
03:28:37.641 --> 03:28:39.580
<v Speaker 2>having gotten the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're one of those dudes,</v>

5237
03:28:39.880 --> 03:28:41.600
<v Speaker 2>well you're one of those dudes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>history that,</v>

5238
03:28:41.650 --> 03:28:42.483
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just read history cause you don't </v>

5239
03:28:43.391 --> 03:28:44.460
<v Speaker 2>know anything about go back.</v>

5240
03:28:44.460 --> 03:28:47.580
<v Speaker 2>They tempe and yet you're so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you just your throat to me.</v>

5241
03:28:47.590 --> 03:28:49.840
<v Speaker 2>But I'm trying to tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh I interrupt you.</v>

5242
03:28:49.841 --> 03:28:53.770
<v Speaker 2>You're adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep going with these things.</v>

5243
03:28:53.860 --> 03:28:54.693
<v Speaker 2>You really don't even know anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this area and yet your money by </v>

5244
03:28:58.271 --> 03:29:00.940
<v Speaker 2>hunters and gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of argument one way or the</v>

5245
03:29:00.941 --> 03:29:01.774
<v Speaker 2>other about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that they had </v>

5246
03:29:05.260 --> 03:29:06.520
<v Speaker 2>discovered farming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

5247
03:29:06.521 --> 03:29:07.354
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the area that farming was a </v>

5248
03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:10.240
<v Speaker 2>originally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>originally as part of the problem,</v>

5249
03:29:10.241 --> 03:29:11.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get to 12,000</v>

5250
03:29:11.681 --> 03:29:14.230
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what the fuck isn't it?</v>

5251
03:29:14.380 --> 03:29:17.710
<v Speaker 2>And we think they knew things and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we find out that they knew more.</v>

5252
03:29:17.730 --> 03:29:18.563
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is mostly covered in ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could you get an advanced </v>

5253
03:29:23.141 --> 03:29:24.460
<v Speaker 2>civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heart of the earth?</v>

5254
03:29:24.490 --> 03:29:24.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5255
03:29:24.911 --> 03:29:25.744
<v Speaker 2>Mostly covered in Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you're dealing with North </v>

5256
03:29:27.281 --> 03:29:28.240
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5257
03:29:28.300 --> 03:29:30.160
<v Speaker 2>North America 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours ago.</v>

5258
03:29:30.730 --> 03:29:31.563
<v Speaker 2>Big parts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the south to felt like a band in </v>

5259
03:29:34.481 --> 03:29:35.314
<v Speaker 2>the middle of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5260
03:29:35.480 --> 03:29:36.313
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're was posted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they think Turkey was like back </v>

5261
03:29:39.341 --> 03:29:40.550
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is where it go.</v>

5262
03:29:40.551 --> 03:29:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Beckley cafes in Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they think Turkey was like 12,000</v>

5263
03:29:43.751 --> 03:29:45.490
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is if that,</v>

5264
03:29:45.760 --> 03:29:48.220
<v Speaker 2>if they can carbon date it absolutely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,000</v>

5265
03:29:48.221 --> 03:29:49.840
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know it was covered up.</v>

5266
03:29:49.841 --> 03:29:52.390
<v Speaker 2>It was intentionally covered 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

5267
03:29:52.391 --> 03:29:53.960
<v Speaker 2>This is the story of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to Cathy.</v>

5268
03:29:54.840 --> 03:29:55.673
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when was it constructed that they don't </v>

5269
03:29:57.191 --> 03:29:59.320
<v Speaker 2>know because stone you can't carbon </v>
<v Speaker 2>date,</v>

5270
03:29:59.350 --> 03:30:01.030
<v Speaker 2>like the way they did it with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian pyramids,</v>

5271
03:30:01.031 --> 03:30:03.160
<v Speaker 2>they got the material in between each </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone.</v>

5272
03:30:03.690 --> 03:30:05.720
<v Speaker 2>So I can kind of think they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5273
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:07.870
<v Speaker 2>like say 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

5274
03:30:07.871 --> 03:30:08.704
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

5275
03:30:08.980 --> 03:30:10.630
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could believe in a certain area of the</v>

5276
03:30:10.631 --> 03:30:11.441
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5277
03:30:11.441 --> 03:30:14.800
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of tribesmen who hunter </v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering maybe,</v>

5278
03:30:14.980 --> 03:30:17.500
<v Speaker 2>maybe seasonally nomadic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5279
03:30:18.190 --> 03:30:19.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a hundred years,</v>

5280
03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:20.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was a,</v>

5281
03:30:20.711 --> 03:30:22.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a religious duty.</v>

5282
03:30:22.031 --> 03:30:23.470
<v Speaker 2>They considered it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5283
03:30:23.490 --> 03:30:24.323
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stonehenge was built over a period of </v>

5284
03:30:25.960 --> 03:30:27.370
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look thousand years.</v>

5285
03:30:27.371 --> 03:30:28.204
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took a long time to just put these </v>

5286
03:30:29.471 --> 03:30:30.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking stones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5287
03:30:31.050 --> 03:30:31.883
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how long this would have </v>

5288
03:30:33.371 --> 03:30:35.530
<v Speaker 2>taken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to have a bunch of carved stones up,</v>

5289
03:30:35.531 --> 03:30:36.730
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if they're big,</v>

5290
03:30:37.090 --> 03:30:40.040
<v Speaker 2>they'll just requires more people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not great technological</v>

5291
03:30:40.040 --> 03:30:41.360
<v Speaker 3>feat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

5292
03:30:41.361 --> 03:30:43.430
<v Speaker 3>It's not a blood is a technological </v>
<v Speaker 3>feat.</v>

5293
03:30:43.440 --> 03:30:45.230
<v Speaker 3>If Marlene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Acropolis,</v>

5294
03:30:45.610 --> 03:30:48.380
<v Speaker 3>there's not a technological feat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a technological feat,</v>

5295
03:30:48.381 --> 03:30:51.230
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't particularly unique to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world at the time.</v>

5296
03:30:51.231 --> 03:30:52.064
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Persians in the Babylonians and </v>

5297
03:30:52.731 --> 03:30:53.564
<v Speaker 3>Syrians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been done of thousands years </v>

5298
03:30:54.590 --> 03:30:56.840
<v Speaker 3>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Greeks were catching up when the,</v>

5299
03:30:56.980 --> 03:30:57.813
<v Speaker 3>doesn't that then support the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>go Beckley Tapi is even more unique </v>

5300
03:31:01.581 --> 03:31:04.890
<v Speaker 3>because it was incredible as a name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5301
03:31:04.990 --> 03:31:05.511
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all right.</v>

5302
03:31:05.511 --> 03:31:07.460
<v Speaker 3>It's that is an advanced civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

5303
03:31:07.530 --> 03:31:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5304
03:31:07.860 --> 03:31:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5305
03:31:08.420 --> 03:31:10.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's advanced for the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

5306
03:31:10.610 --> 03:31:12.830
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty advanced for today.</v>

5307
03:31:12.831 --> 03:31:16.340
<v Speaker 3>If we wanted to build something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that today would take massive resources.</v>

5308
03:31:16.580 --> 03:31:17.413
<v Speaker 3>It would take huge machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would take a gigantic group of </v>

5309
03:31:19.731 --> 03:31:21.810
<v Speaker 3>engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how convenient project.</v>

5310
03:31:22.100 --> 03:31:24.560
<v Speaker 3>That's out of convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean out of convenience?</v>

5311
03:31:24.560 --> 03:31:25.393
<v Speaker 3>Why that's missing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How was it out of convenience when you </v>

5312
03:31:27.321 --> 03:31:28.154
<v Speaker 3>get 19 foot tall stones that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't really get loads in </v>

5313
03:31:31.781 --> 03:31:33.320
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pulls him in a circle.</v>

5314
03:31:33.380 --> 03:31:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of work.</v>

5315
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:35.571
<v Speaker 3>Of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5316
03:31:35.571 --> 03:31:37.880
<v Speaker 3>That's why would you use machines?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it'd just be a lot of work.</v>

5317
03:31:38.210 --> 03:31:40.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not as simple as you just use </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines,</v>

5318
03:31:40.971 --> 03:31:41.804
<v Speaker 3>like you'd have to get very specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive machines that are incredibly </v>

5319
03:31:44.781 --> 03:31:45.614
<v Speaker 3>difficult to engineerings and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people did that without any of that </v>

5320
03:31:47.571 --> 03:31:47.860
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5321
03:31:47.860 --> 03:31:49.970
<v Speaker 3>they did the ropes and pretty easily </v>
<v Speaker 3>logs,</v>

5322
03:31:50.510 --> 03:31:53.060
<v Speaker 3>prob probably prominent police actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ropes in logs,</v>

5323
03:31:53.090 --> 03:31:55.660
<v Speaker 3>who knows how the fuck they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what we're supposed to be.</v>

5324
03:31:55.690 --> 03:31:58.070
<v Speaker 3>There was no wheel back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll probably wasn't,</v>

5325
03:31:59.290 --> 03:32:01.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's pretty spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5326
03:32:01.761 --> 03:32:02.211
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5327
03:32:02.211 --> 03:32:03.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>

5328
03:32:03.201 --> 03:32:03.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5329
03:32:03.591 --> 03:32:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5330
03:32:03.740 --> 03:32:04.573
<v Speaker 3>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not trying to take away the </v>

5331
03:32:06.921 --> 03:32:07.754
<v Speaker 3>amount of effort involved in building </v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing and the willpower to do it </v>

5332
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:12.463
<v Speaker 3>and the manpower to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you trying to say and not </v>

5333
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:17.930
<v Speaker 3>indicative of an advanced civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

5334
03:32:17.931 --> 03:32:20.060
<v Speaker 3>when I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a definition of advanced.</v>

5335
03:32:20.061 --> 03:32:20.894
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I would consider an advanced </v>

5336
03:32:22.460 --> 03:32:23.293
<v Speaker 3>civilization have writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would consider them to have </v>

5337
03:32:24.891 --> 03:32:26.180
<v Speaker 3>metallurgy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would consider,</v>

5338
03:32:26.750 --> 03:32:28.370
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even call this advanced this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is,</v>

5339
03:32:28.371 --> 03:32:29.480
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this puts them,</v>

5340
03:32:29.900 --> 03:32:33.200
<v Speaker 3>this puts them where we were 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

5341
03:32:33.310 --> 03:32:34.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a species.</v>

5342
03:32:34.341 --> 03:32:36.290
<v Speaker 3>So advanced is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5343
03:32:36.690 --> 03:32:38.240
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all well,</v>

5344
03:32:38.241 --> 03:32:38.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5345
03:32:38.610 --> 03:32:39.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's all relative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

5346
03:32:39.711 --> 03:32:42.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what I mean,</v>

5347
03:32:42.381 --> 03:32:43.180
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if,</v>

5348
03:32:43.180 --> 03:32:43.730
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

5349
03:32:43.730 --> 03:32:45.920
<v Speaker 3>if you want to speculate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might have been a civilization like</v>

5350
03:32:45.921 --> 03:32:50.921
<v Speaker 3>pre ice age or during the ice age that </v>
<v Speaker 3>had writing and metallurgy and you know,</v>

5351
03:32:52.940 --> 03:32:53.773
<v Speaker 3>great cities and international trade </v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture also all this sort of stuff </v>

5352
03:32:57.081 --> 03:32:58.850
<v Speaker 3>that we would look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the Roman Empire,</v>

5353
03:32:58.970 --> 03:33:02.150
<v Speaker 3>we see if we take them as the model of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an advanced civilization.</v>

5354
03:33:02.210 --> 03:33:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I say advanced,</v>

5355
03:33:04.070 --> 03:33:07.740
<v Speaker 3>we mean not as advanced as we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] right.</v>

5356
03:33:08.030 --> 03:33:09.950
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what everyone speculates </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

5357
03:33:09.951 --> 03:33:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Atlanta says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no one ever thinks that Atlanta was</v>

5358
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:14.640
<v Speaker 3>like today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think some crazy things.</v>

5359
03:33:14.641 --> 03:33:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Some people really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>

5360
03:33:16.491 --> 03:33:17.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5361
03:33:17.810 --> 03:33:19.100
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5362
03:33:19.540 --> 03:33:21.080
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should should've been more specific.</v>

5363
03:33:21.440 --> 03:33:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

5364
03:33:22.371 --> 03:33:22.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

5365
03:33:22.750 --> 03:33:24.860
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that for the time,</v>

5366
03:33:25.100 --> 03:33:25.933
<v Speaker 3>like when a run around and tribe came </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the hill and they saw go back to </v>

5367
03:33:28.431 --> 03:33:30.100
<v Speaker 3>the teepee and it was incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

5368
03:33:30.140 --> 03:33:32.000
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gods have built this,</v>

5369
03:33:32.001 --> 03:33:33.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they would have thought.</v>

5370
03:33:33.171 --> 03:33:34.004
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them it would have relatively been </v>

5371
03:33:36.050 --> 03:33:37.040
<v Speaker 3>incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5372
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.920
<v Speaker 3>am I'm doing wrong?</v>

5373
03:33:38.090 --> 03:33:38.923
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't want to take away the </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement for the people who made it </v>

5374
03:33:40.371 --> 03:33:43.100
<v Speaker 1>cause it's unbelievably good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

5375
03:33:43.230 --> 03:33:45.030
<v Speaker 1>especially for the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like if,</v>

5376
03:33:45.040 --> 03:33:46.950
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't have white mel tools then</v>
<v Speaker 1>have writing,</v>

5377
03:33:46.951 --> 03:33:49.470
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call that advance.</v>

5378
03:33:49.471 --> 03:33:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd just call that a loss of work for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise of civilization.</v>

5379
03:33:51.931 --> 03:33:52.764
<v Speaker 1>And the same with this stone henge would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been the real problem is we don't </v>

5380
03:33:55.291 --> 03:33:59.370
<v Speaker 1>really know what they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until more evidence gets uncovered,</v>

5381
03:33:59.371 --> 03:34:00.600
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just guessing.</v>

5382
03:34:00.660 --> 03:34:03.630
<v Speaker 1>They have some carbon dating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that the stones exist.</v>

5383
03:34:03.780 --> 03:34:04.613
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they didn't even know about this </v>

5384
03:34:06.391 --> 03:34:07.224
<v Speaker 1>until 1990 something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they found it in the 90s but me </v>

5385
03:34:10.040 --> 03:34:11.880
<v Speaker 1>know all of northern Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5386
03:34:11.940 --> 03:34:12.773
<v Speaker 1>stone circles hinges me or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they find more of those now than </v>

5387
03:34:16.321 --> 03:34:17.460
<v Speaker 1>ever before with satellites.</v>

5388
03:34:17.460 --> 03:34:18.293
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5389
03:34:18.340 --> 03:34:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Seen the ones that they're finding now </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Amazon and they're like,</v>

5390
03:34:21.241 --> 03:34:23.580
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're finding all these structures,</v>

5391
03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:25.380
<v Speaker 1>the channels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you send me the link to that because</v>

5392
03:34:25.381 --> 03:34:28.200
<v Speaker 1>that sounds interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the lost city of z.</v>

5393
03:34:28.201 --> 03:34:32.030
<v Speaker 1>You know about that right now there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy who went looking,</v>

5394
03:34:32.050 --> 03:34:34.410
<v Speaker 1>he was an explorer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went looking for the loss series,</v>

5395
03:34:34.440 --> 03:34:35.273
<v Speaker 1>city of z in the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a mythical lost city and he </v>

5396
03:34:38.981 --> 03:34:39.814
<v Speaker 1>got eaten by cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's some movie that's </v>

5397
03:34:41.731 --> 03:34:44.190
<v Speaker 1>coming out about him right now that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>

5398
03:34:44.640 --> 03:34:46.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were white counts.</v>

5399
03:34:46.850 --> 03:34:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5400
03:34:48.250 --> 03:34:49.680
<v Speaker 1>but I'll post privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

5401
03:34:49.681 --> 03:34:50.514
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5402
03:34:50.850 --> 03:34:51.683
<v Speaker 1>it was speculated that before the Ama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the other thing that came </v>

5403
03:34:54.301 --> 03:34:55.134
<v Speaker 1>out recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Amazon was covered in the ocean </v>

5404
03:34:56.880 --> 03:34:58.820
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around 10 million years ago or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

5405
03:34:59.460 --> 03:35:03.060
<v Speaker 1>But they think that these people had </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of,</v>

5406
03:35:03.061 --> 03:35:04.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the time again,</v>

5407
03:35:04.530 --> 03:35:06.250
<v Speaker 1>what is an advanced civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5408
03:35:06.251 --> 03:35:07.520
<v Speaker 1>It probably needs to be defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5409
03:35:07.580 --> 03:35:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's the first step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

5410
03:35:09.121 --> 03:35:09.954
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's interesting to say love </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the path for them to invest </v>

5411
03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:12.181
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5412
03:35:12.181 --> 03:35:13.330
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5413
03:35:13.350 --> 03:35:14.490
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a beautiful thing.</v>

5414
03:35:14.520 --> 03:35:15.353
<v Speaker 1>It a great construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it costs the Athenians a lot of </v>

5415
03:35:16.741 --> 03:35:20.170
<v Speaker 1>money and they did it to beautify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city and make it the jewel of Greece.</v>

5416
03:35:20.450 --> 03:35:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't like,</v>

5417
03:35:22.560 --> 03:35:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's more impressive is it's more that</v>

5418
03:35:25.861 --> 03:35:29.380
<v Speaker 1>they did for political reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Parthenon is built on the crop.</v>

5419
03:35:29.760 --> 03:35:32.310
<v Speaker 1>They did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Acropolis is what's a really a trip.</v>

5420
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:35.850
<v Speaker 1>What it was cause this giant fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks of stone.</v>

5421
03:35:35.851 --> 03:35:40.530
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea how big they are open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're huge and they're like,</v>

5422
03:35:40.531 --> 03:35:40.770
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

5423
03:35:40.770 --> 03:35:41.603
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know why they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't even built at the same </v>

5424
03:35:43.681 --> 03:35:44.514
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Acropolis is just a natural stone </v>

5425
03:35:45.901 --> 03:35:46.734
<v Speaker 1>formation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily there's stones under </v>

5426
03:35:49.051 --> 03:35:50.440
<v Speaker 1>that natural stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

5427
03:35:50.810 --> 03:35:51.643
<v Speaker 1>the actual platform that the parthenon </v>
<v Speaker 1>was built on existed before the </v>

5428
03:35:54.781 --> 03:35:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Parthenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5429
03:35:56.940 --> 03:35:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I follow what you're saying</v>

5430
03:35:58.831 --> 03:36:00.210
<v Speaker 1>that because as far as I'm aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Acropolis,</v>

5431
03:36:00.211 --> 03:36:01.860
<v Speaker 1>the Acropolis just lost the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

5432
03:36:01.861 --> 03:36:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they must have leveled it off as</v>

5433
03:36:03.601 --> 03:36:06.750
<v Speaker 1>something something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's actual physical stones,</v>

5434
03:36:06.751 --> 03:36:07.584
<v Speaker 1>actual monstrous physical stones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are involved in construction molter and </v>

5435
03:36:11.131 --> 03:36:13.830
<v Speaker 1>see the same sort of pull up photos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find that.</v>

5436
03:36:13.890 --> 03:36:14.680
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5437
03:36:14.680 --> 03:36:17.250
<v Speaker 1>The old ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the thing in Multa where they</v>

5438
03:36:17.251 --> 03:36:19.080
<v Speaker 1>thought there was like bill by side </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses or something?</v>

5439
03:36:19.081 --> 03:36:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant size,</v>

5440
03:36:20.041 --> 03:36:22.710
<v Speaker 1>like 3000 years BC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that ball back now?</v>

5441
03:36:22.711 --> 03:36:23.810
<v Speaker 1>That's in Lebanon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5442
03:36:23.811 --> 03:36:25.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ball back in Lebanon,</v>

5443
03:36:25.381 --> 03:36:28.500
<v Speaker 1>they found these enormous stone carved </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

5444
03:36:28.830 --> 03:36:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See those stones?</v>

5445
03:36:30.480 --> 03:36:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Which ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>

5446
03:36:32.281 --> 03:36:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5447
03:36:32.940 --> 03:36:33.990
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some stuff.</v>

5448
03:36:34.050 --> 03:36:35.980
<v Speaker 1>See if you could find some images of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5449
03:36:36.130 --> 03:36:36.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it does.</v>

5450
03:36:36.971 --> 03:36:37.900
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From that side.</v>

5451
03:36:38.230 --> 03:36:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that just a natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone out.</v>

5452
03:36:39.730 --> 03:36:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

5453
03:36:40.781 --> 03:36:42.550
<v Speaker 2>this sort of like fortifications around </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

5454
03:36:42.580 --> 03:36:43.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can probably just google that and </v>

5455
03:36:43.961 --> 03:36:46.450
<v Speaker 2>find out when we put up it probably like</v>
<v Speaker 2>16th century or something,</v>

5456
03:36:46.960 --> 03:36:47.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing mystical about the path </v>

5457
03:36:49.411 --> 03:36:50.244
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a really useful defensive </v>

5458
03:36:51.050 --> 03:36:54.130
<v Speaker 2>fortification or not missed a call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying ancient.</v>

5459
03:36:54.730 --> 03:36:55.451
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5460
03:36:55.451 --> 03:36:57.310
<v Speaker 2>the speculation was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5461
03:36:57.311 --> 03:36:59.230
<v Speaker 2>the Acropolis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one's the Acropolis?</v>

5462
03:36:59.270 --> 03:37:01.480
<v Speaker 2>That's bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Parthenon is the top.</v>

5463
03:37:01.660 --> 03:37:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Now the powerful though is on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Acropolis.</v>

5464
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:06.640
<v Speaker 2>The Parthenon is on the top and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Acropolis is on the bottom.</v>

5465
03:37:06.641 --> 03:37:08.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they,</v>

5466
03:37:08.151 --> 03:37:10.660
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that they think is the ancient</v>

5467
03:37:10.690 --> 03:37:12.190
<v Speaker 2>stones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5468
03:37:12.330 --> 03:37:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5469
03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:15.400
<v Speaker 2>And the Parthenon is just the building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5470
03:37:15.490 --> 03:37:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5471
03:37:16.090 --> 03:37:18.640
<v Speaker 2>The papillon was a temple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you say the Acropolis,</v>

5472
03:37:18.641 --> 03:37:22.000
<v Speaker 2>the Parthenon is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most cities have necropolis,</v>

5473
03:37:22.001 --> 03:37:25.470
<v Speaker 2>which is just a raised rocky bit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd build defensive right then.</v>

5474
03:37:25.480 --> 03:37:26.313
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd put the temple's on and stuff </v>

5475
03:37:27.461 --> 03:37:28.151
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so find out what,</v>

5476
03:37:28.151 --> 03:37:29.320
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I read that,</v>

5477
03:37:29.350 --> 03:37:33.550
<v Speaker 2>see if you could google a man made </v>
<v Speaker 2>stones in the Acropolis.</v>

5478
03:37:34.570 --> 03:37:35.403
<v Speaker 2>There was some sort of weird speculation</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Acropolis was a part of some </v>

5479
03:37:38.231 --> 03:37:40.750
<v Speaker 2>structure that was far older than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Parthenon.</v>

5480
03:37:42.810 --> 03:37:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5481
03:37:44.090 --> 03:37:45.780
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not persuaded by all of that sort of,</v>

5482
03:37:45.790 --> 03:37:48.440
<v Speaker 2>that was a bit fringe stuff for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not in the friendship.</v>

5483
03:37:49.100 --> 03:37:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Not when it comes to history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to know accurate stuff,</v>

5484
03:37:52.871 --> 03:37:53.740
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5485
03:37:53.770 --> 03:37:54.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>

5486
03:37:54.970 --> 03:37:57.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just fringe is always more </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractive though.</v>

5487
03:37:57.250 --> 03:37:58.150
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

5488
03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Because you never know and there's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5489
03:38:00.041 --> 03:38:00.874
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to find out for </v>

5490
03:38:01.571 --> 03:38:02.404
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like undeniably it has </v>

5491
03:38:04.241 --> 03:38:05.320
<v Speaker 2>gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5492
03:38:05.350 --> 03:38:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Towards me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least I am.</v>

5493
03:38:06.701 --> 03:38:08.380
<v Speaker 2>I love the old stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

5494
03:38:08.381 --> 03:38:08.621
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5495
03:38:08.621 --> 03:38:09.790
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what they found out,</v>

5496
03:38:09.791 --> 03:38:10.700
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were werewolves.</v>

5497
03:38:10.780 --> 03:38:11.613
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always like something that you </v>

5498
03:38:12.221 --> 03:38:13.054
<v Speaker 2>find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5499
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I went through all of this and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties I went through literally all of</v>

5500
03:38:16.541 --> 03:38:17.680
<v Speaker 2>these fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a late bloomer.</v>

5501
03:38:17.980 --> 03:38:18.813
<v Speaker 2>They really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

5502
03:38:19.470 --> 03:38:20.830
<v Speaker 2>You'll end up eventually where I am.</v>

5503
03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:21.873
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely want wake end up where you </v>

5504
03:38:22.481 --> 03:38:23.250
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will,</v>

5505
03:38:23.250 --> 03:38:24.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5506
03:38:24.560 --> 03:38:26.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a good place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

5507
03:38:26.470 --> 03:38:30.850
<v Speaker 2>you go through all of these ferries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll immediately dismiss things.</v>

5508
03:38:30.910 --> 03:38:32.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't immediately dismiss things.</v>

5509
03:38:32.321 --> 03:38:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to start reading about why</v>
<v Speaker 2>things happened.</v>

5510
03:38:34.960 --> 03:38:36.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to start reading the,</v>

5511
03:38:36.831 --> 03:38:39.060
<v Speaker 2>the source material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I know who built the bill,</v>

5512
03:38:39.070 --> 03:38:39.903
<v Speaker 2>the Parthenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5513
03:38:40.060 --> 03:38:40.893
<v Speaker 2>But that's also why you just just </v>
<v Speaker 2>flippantly decided that [inaudible] was </v>

5514
03:38:44.441 --> 03:38:45.160
<v Speaker 2>small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5515
03:38:45.160 --> 03:38:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5516
03:38:45.470 --> 03:38:46.660
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that the size of,</v>

5517
03:38:46.661 --> 03:38:47.494
<v Speaker 2>it's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the sort of technological </v>

5518
03:38:48.731 --> 03:38:49.600
<v Speaker 2>advancement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5519
03:38:49.601 --> 03:38:51.700
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take much to Co coff stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to,</v>

5520
03:38:51.701 --> 03:38:52.534
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let you know they just other stone to </v>

5521
03:38:53.771 --> 03:38:55.900
<v Speaker 2>break against it and then it's smooth at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands of sand.</v>

5522
03:38:55.901 --> 03:38:56.734
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just took a lot of work for a long </v>

5523
03:38:57.971 --> 03:39:00.680
<v Speaker 2>time and I mean wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must've been fucking with,</v>

5524
03:39:00.710 --> 03:39:02.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a hide the leather put sand in it.</v>

5525
03:39:02.760 --> 03:39:05.410
<v Speaker 2>He spent ages smoothing up stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it yourself if you'd like.</v>

5526
03:39:05.411 --> 03:39:06.880
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking boring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5527
03:39:06.881 --> 03:39:07.714
<v Speaker 2>But I guess if you've got nothing else </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do all day because you're just right </v>

5528
03:39:09.821 --> 03:39:10.280
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

5529
03:39:10.280 --> 03:39:11.740
<v Speaker 2>but that's not carved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

5530
03:39:11.741 --> 03:39:16.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is bass relief I believe is it says</v>

5531
03:39:16.030 --> 03:39:16.863
<v Speaker 2>what most of the art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll go back with tippy was it was </v>

5532
03:39:18.911 --> 03:39:19.480
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

5533
03:39:19.480 --> 03:39:20.313
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a three d and moved away and not </v>

5534
03:39:21.791 --> 03:39:23.350
<v Speaker 2>carved into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5535
03:39:23.351 --> 03:39:25.570
<v Speaker 2>that's what was interesting about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more difficult.</v>

5536
03:39:25.780 --> 03:39:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really,</v>

5537
03:39:26.560 --> 03:39:27.393
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take anything away from </v>

5538
03:39:27.941 --> 03:39:30.070
<v Speaker 2>the artist because that must've been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of work.</v>

5539
03:39:30.310 --> 03:39:33.160
<v Speaker 2>What was the a man made stones and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Acropolis to finding</v>

5540
03:39:34.040 --> 03:39:38.300
<v Speaker 1>there was evidence of these enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks of rock that were moved.</v>

5541
03:39:38.780 --> 03:39:39.613
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I might be conflating chunks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock a ball back in Lebanon with the </v>

5542
03:39:44.001 --> 03:39:44.834
<v Speaker 1>Acropolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fascinating to me because we </v>

5543
03:39:47.391 --> 03:39:48.224
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't know what these people </v>

5544
03:39:49.551 --> 03:39:50.384
<v Speaker 1>were up to and we see what they left </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind and we pieced it together and </v>

5545
03:39:53.151 --> 03:39:55.760
<v Speaker 1>people have studied it for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and it's just,</v>

5546
03:39:55.761 --> 03:39:57.200
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

5547
03:39:57.230 --> 03:39:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've been to Rome,</v>

5548
03:39:59.150 --> 03:40:00.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't,</v>

5549
03:40:00.740 --> 03:40:02.450
<v Speaker 1>it's on my list to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5550
03:40:02.910 --> 03:40:04.910
<v Speaker 1>The coliseums fairly recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5551
03:40:06.140 --> 03:40:08.990
<v Speaker 1>One of the century ideal something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5552
03:40:09.050 --> 03:40:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean in terms of like ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

5553
03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:13.300
<v Speaker 1>the very recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

5554
03:40:13.330 --> 03:40:15.800
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy when they show you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of it.</v>

5555
03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:19.940
<v Speaker 1>How they used to that whole thing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Nero's backyard.</v>

5556
03:40:20.810 --> 03:40:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they decided to,</v>

5557
03:40:23.751 --> 03:40:24.920
<v Speaker 1>once they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad,</v>

5558
03:40:24.980 --> 03:40:27.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then then decided to build this,</v>

5559
03:40:27.261 --> 03:40:31.130
<v Speaker 1>this thing to sort of entertain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masses.</v>

5560
03:40:31.400 --> 03:40:34.010
<v Speaker 1>And this thing has gone through all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different,</v>

5561
03:40:34.011 --> 03:40:36.350
<v Speaker 1>various stages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they show you all the different</v>

5562
03:40:36.351 --> 03:40:37.610
<v Speaker 1>things they used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

5563
03:40:37.790 --> 03:40:38.623
<v Speaker 1>have these boat fights where they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>fill it up with water and they would </v>

5564
03:40:41.691 --> 03:40:42.524
<v Speaker 1>raise these lions and all these animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the bottom of the cage and they </v>

5565
03:40:44.601 --> 03:40:46.640
<v Speaker 1>would fight against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're fucking crazy.</v>

5566
03:40:46.641 --> 03:40:47.630
<v Speaker 1>And not that long ago.</v>

5567
03:40:49.700 --> 03:40:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

5568
03:40:51.270 --> 03:40:53.150
<v Speaker 1>people used to be brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's think people forget.</v>

5569
03:40:53.151 --> 03:40:53.811
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5570
03:40:53.811 --> 03:40:55.370
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still are.</v>

5571
03:40:55.430 --> 03:40:56.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they,</v>

5572
03:40:56.151 --> 03:40:57.080

<v Speaker 1>unit to most people,</v>

5574
03:41:00.711 --> 03:41:01.640
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5575
03:41:01.641 --> 03:41:03.080
<v Speaker 1>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 15th century,</v>

5576
03:41:03.081 --> 03:41:05.330
<v Speaker 1>16th century kids used to do coke </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

5577
03:41:05.331 --> 03:41:06.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no something,</v>

5583
03:41:18.731 --> 03:41:20.360
<v Speaker 1>no compassion for anything that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

5584
03:41:20.361 --> 03:41:21.051
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

5585
03:41:21.051 --> 03:41:22.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely not for chickens.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's super common in many parts of the </v>

5594
03:41:40.551 --> 03:41:41.271
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

5595

<v Speaker 1>it's really common in the south of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the same way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Should I do all the amazing,</v>

5605
03:42:05.060 --> 03:42:05.893
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty controversial these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just lost another matador a couple </v>

5606
03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:09.541
<v Speaker 1>of days ago.</v>

5607
03:42:09.541 --> 03:42:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Doug.</v>

5610
03:42:14.391 --> 03:42:16.340

<v Speaker 1>No sympathy whatsoever.</v>

5611
03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:17.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5612
03:42:17.781 --> 03:42:21.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a foolish way to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wanted it to die and risk your life.</v>

5613
03:42:22.130 --> 03:42:27.130
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is crazy ex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Spain is an advanced civilization.</v>

5614
03:42:28.060 --> 03:42:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known too many Spaniards.</v>

5615
03:42:31.980 --> 03:42:33.240
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how dare you.</v>

5616
03:42:34.250 --> 03:42:35.083
<v Speaker 3>But didn't anything that I think in </v>
<v Speaker 3>general there are modern Western </v>

5617
03:42:37.321 --> 03:42:39.160
<v Speaker 3>civilization and they have bull </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>

5618
03:42:39.780 --> 03:42:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what's really funny about </v>
<v Speaker 3>spine?</v>

5619
03:42:40.930 --> 03:42:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I mean like a,</v>

5620
03:42:42.271 --> 03:42:44.310
<v Speaker 3>in America you've got a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

5621
03:42:44.460 --> 03:42:45.293
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a terrible history of being </v>

5622
03:42:46.741 --> 03:42:47.940
<v Speaker 3>terrible is what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5623
03:42:48.210 --> 03:42:49.043
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5624
03:42:49.230 --> 03:42:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Spanish,</v>

5625
03:42:50.850 --> 03:42:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spanish history is,</v>

5626
03:42:52.141 --> 03:42:56.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm highly Islamophobic obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went out and spent a few years ago</v>

5627
03:42:57.090 --> 03:42:59.640
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything everywhere.</v>

5628
03:42:59.820 --> 03:43:02.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a white guy killing him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim on every poultry,</v>

5629
03:43:02.970 --> 03:43:04.860
<v Speaker 3>on every undergo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5630
03:43:05.270 --> 03:43:08.730
<v Speaker 3>Cause they spent 800 years kicking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslims out of Spain because the Muslims</v>

5631
03:43:08.731 --> 03:43:09.564
<v Speaker 3>came along and conquered Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so everything is Towsley </v>

5632
03:43:13.440 --> 03:43:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobic because that is their </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

5633
03:43:14.611 --> 03:43:15.444
<v Speaker 3>They can't get away from it that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be a Spain because the malls </v>

5634
03:43:17.611 --> 03:43:18.960
<v Speaker 3>came over and conquered it and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5635
03:43:18.961 --> 03:43:19.794
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's a Muslim now or you're going </v>

5636
03:43:20.341 --> 03:43:21.260
<v Speaker 3>to have to pay the Gza.</v>

5637
03:43:21.470 --> 03:43:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be a DHIMMI.</v>

5638
03:43:23.460 --> 03:43:24.560
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5639
03:43:24.561 --> 03:43:26.340
<v Speaker 3>And they spent emgs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his letter,</v>

5640
03:43:27.060 --> 03:43:27.631
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loss,</v>

5641
03:43:27.631 --> 03:43:29.700
<v Speaker 3>resistance or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the Spanish.</v>

5642
03:43:29.701 --> 03:43:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Before it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5643
03:43:30.931 --> 03:43:34.620
<v Speaker 3>just the reconquista and it took several</v>
<v Speaker 3>crusades.</v>

5644
03:43:34.621 --> 03:43:37.500
<v Speaker 3>It took hundreds of years and gallons of</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood.</v>

5645
03:43:37.800 --> 03:43:39.830
<v Speaker 3>But eventually Spain became Christine </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and the,</v>

5646
03:43:39.870 --> 03:43:42.420
<v Speaker 3>and the Muslims and they're like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Islam of files.</v>

5647
03:43:42.421 --> 03:43:44.430
<v Speaker 3>He'll sit there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well you know,</v>

5648
03:43:44.460 --> 03:43:47.580
<v Speaker 3>I'll under loose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah it was stolen from someone else and</v>

5649
03:43:47.581 --> 03:43:48.414
<v Speaker 3>these people took it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got no fucking sympathy for these </v>

5650
03:43:50.701 --> 03:43:51.630
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got kicked out.</v>

5651
03:43:51.780 --> 03:43:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Who came in originally?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't even supposed to be there.</v>

5652
03:43:54.100 --> 03:43:54.933
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Muslims are fucking lucky that </v>

5653
03:43:56.401 --> 03:43:57.234
<v Speaker 3>Columbus discovered the new world </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Spanish were basically </v>

5654
03:43:58.331 --> 03:44:00.970
<v Speaker 3>functional roll up all of North Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was gonna.</v>

5655
03:44:00.990 --> 03:44:04.530
<v Speaker 3>They were piling to take it all fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>back cause this was all Christian.</v>

5656
03:44:05.010 --> 03:44:06.550
<v Speaker 3>It really annoys me that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

5657
03:44:06.551 --> 03:44:08.130
<v Speaker 3>oh no that's Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No it wasn't.</v>

5658
03:44:08.490 --> 03:44:11.790
<v Speaker 3>And it's because they took it and so if </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Spanish is going to take it back,</v>

5659
03:44:12.120 --> 03:44:12.953
<v Speaker 3>that's just as valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have an argument against them </v>

5660
03:44:14.611 --> 03:44:17.100
<v Speaker 3>doing it and it's something that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>established though.</v>

5661
03:44:17.101 --> 03:44:19.150
<v Speaker 3>We don't want you to take it back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

5662
03:44:20.080 --> 03:44:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just saying it now.</v>

5663
03:44:21.120 --> 03:44:24.120
<v Speaker 3>I'll be suggesting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still,</v>

5664
03:44:24.190 --> 03:44:25.380
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

5665
03:44:25.381 --> 03:44:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I put like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when we're,</v>

5666
03:44:26.551 --> 03:44:27.384
<v Speaker 3>when we're looking back at history </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the lens of having a moral </v>

5667
03:44:29.221 --> 03:44:31.150
<v Speaker 3>judgment about it and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the Spanish kicked the Muslims.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he can't really have moral judgments </v>

5671
03:44:40.171 --> 03:44:41.760
<v Speaker 3>about history when people do this full </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

03:45:56.250 --> 03:45:59.500
<v Speaker 3>Why people should apologize for all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the horrible things that we've done.</v>

5707
03:45:59.740 --> 03:46:02.080
<v Speaker 3>What about to native Americans?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we apologize to them?</v>

5708
03:46:02.230 --> 03:46:03.063
<v Speaker 3>I think that if they're prepared to </v>
<v Speaker 3>apologize to the people they genocide </v>

5709
03:46:05.271 --> 03:46:06.850
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

5710
03:46:06.860 --> 03:46:07.900
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going a little too far.</v>

5711
03:46:07.901 --> 03:46:09.010
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5712
03:46:09.100 --> 03:46:10.840
<v Speaker 3>you go too far back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

5713
03:46:10.970 --> 03:46:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who decided once we have done that,</v>

5714
03:46:14.261 --> 03:46:15.460
<v Speaker 3>we've trespassed on their land.</v>

5715
03:46:15.460 --> 03:46:20.460
<v Speaker 3>You don't bring up them doing it cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hour that would be native American.</v>

5716
03:46:20.561 --> 03:46:22.300
<v Speaker 3>A phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not our place.</v>

5717
03:46:23.010 --> 03:46:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Our place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5718
03:46:23.710 --> 03:46:25.100
<v Speaker 3>See this the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all bollocks.</v>

5719
03:46:25.110 --> 03:46:28.090
<v Speaker 3>And this whole relativism is pissing me </v>
<v Speaker 3>off and he read it really actually makes</v>

5720
03:46:28.091 --> 03:46:28.924
<v Speaker 3>me angry and none of them will ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to the like the counter </v>

5721
03:46:31.131 --> 03:46:32.260
<v Speaker 3>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really annoying.</v>

5722
03:46:32.820 --> 03:46:33.560
<v Speaker 3>And so it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5723
03:46:33.560 --> 03:46:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5724
03:46:34.270 --> 03:46:35.103
<v Speaker 3>nobody's got any respect for you when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you turn around and say portable </v>

5725
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:37.680
<v Speaker 3>crusades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

5726
03:46:38.050 --> 03:46:38.883
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a boundary is the dumbest damn </v>

5727
03:46:39.731 --> 03:46:41.250
<v Speaker 3>thing anyway because you never </v>
<v Speaker 3>addressing the point.</v>

5728
03:46:41.251 --> 03:46:41.571
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5729
03:46:41.571 --> 03:46:46.571
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't even give a context about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam basically.</v>

5730
03:46:48.060 --> 03:46:49.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

5731
03:46:49.150 --> 03:46:49.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5732
03:46:49.750 --> 03:46:50.583
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they for some reason to think that </v>

5733
03:46:50.951 --> 03:46:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Christianity is as bad as Islam as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nurse,</v>

5734
03:46:52.660 --> 03:46:55.270
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like the Crusades were distinctly</v>

5735
03:46:55.300 --> 03:46:57.190
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I spoke to his story and Tom Holland</v>

5736
03:46:57.191 --> 03:46:59.080
<v Speaker 3>about this and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

5737
03:46:59.380 --> 03:47:02.620
<v Speaker 3>how did they come to the conclusion that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't have a crusade?</v>

5738
03:47:03.010 --> 03:47:03.843
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they didn't get it from </v>

5739
03:47:04.361 --> 03:47:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Christianity and the Orthodox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5740
03:47:07.420 --> 03:47:08.253
<v Speaker 3>the Orthodox patriarch in Constantinople</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just completely against the idea </v>

5741
03:47:11.381 --> 03:47:14.470
<v Speaker 3>because there's nothing in the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 3>that justifies it in the new testament.</v>

5742
03:47:14.730 --> 03:47:15.563
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jason,</v>

5743
03:47:15.680 --> 03:47:17.500
<v Speaker 3>man of peace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he turns her on the cheek,</v>

5744
03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:20.770
<v Speaker 3>he lets his enemies strike him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't pick up a sword and say I'm</v>

5745
03:47:20.771 --> 03:47:21.604
<v Speaker 3>going to kill someone for Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense when people have </v>

5746
03:47:25.241 --> 03:47:26.690
<v Speaker 3>massive amounts of power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

5747
03:47:26.740 --> 03:47:27.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it went,</v>

5748
03:47:27.350 --> 03:47:29.980
<v Speaker 3>it's weird with the Aztecs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes weird with everybody.</v>

5749
03:47:30.310 --> 03:47:31.930
<v Speaker 3>It was entirely Tempura.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was about like,</v>

5750
03:47:31.931 --> 03:47:32.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>concrete and Middle East.</v>

5751
03:47:33.130 --> 03:47:33.963
<v Speaker 3>But it was also about like making sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they could get to Jerusalem is </v>

5752
03:47:35.720 --> 03:47:37.060
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an ideological thing.</v>

5753
03:47:37.061 --> 03:47:37.894
<v Speaker 3>Cause the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Turks were basically preventing </v>

5754
03:47:38.830 --> 03:47:39.663
<v Speaker 3>pilgrims from getting to Jerusalem </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Muslims don't Jerusalem's for </v>

5755
03:47:41.791 --> 03:47:42.624
<v Speaker 3>like 400 years and everything was okay </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the pilgrims could travel along </v>

5756
03:47:46.181 --> 03:47:48.490
<v Speaker 3>a pill and trail and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people make money doing this,</v>

5757
03:47:48.491 --> 03:47:49.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd sell things.</v>

5758
03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:51.160
<v Speaker 3>And then the text came in and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

5759
03:47:51.161 --> 03:47:54.550
<v Speaker 3>we're Muslims and fuck everyone cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the Turks and that was it.</v>

5760
03:47:54.580 --> 03:47:57.100
<v Speaker 3>The pilgrims couldn't go to Jerusalem </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'd put the pope,</v>

5761
03:47:57.101 --> 03:47:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an innocent,</v>

5762
03:47:58.001 --> 03:47:58.900
<v Speaker 3>the second urban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second,</v>

5763
03:47:58.901 --> 03:47:59.734
<v Speaker 3>I can never remember which one it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of the pope was he tell him I </v>

5764
03:48:02.051 --> 03:48:02.884
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

5765
03:48:03.400 --> 03:48:05.830
<v Speaker 3>I could create a spiritual kingdom or </v>
<v Speaker 3>empire,</v>

5766
03:48:06.310 --> 03:48:09.850
<v Speaker 3>an empire of faith on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

5767
03:48:09.851 --> 03:48:12.160
<v Speaker 3>why don't you all rather than fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other in Europe,</v>

5768
03:48:12.220 --> 03:48:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean Europeans were not very advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were very,</v>

5769
03:48:16.121 --> 03:48:19.780
<v Speaker 3>very warlike and wanting to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Middle East.</v>

5770
03:48:19.810 --> 03:48:22.000
<v Speaker 3>And they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the crusade was actually,</v>

5771
03:48:22.390 --> 03:48:24.370
<v Speaker 3>it means a real thrilling thing to read </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

5772
03:48:24.371 --> 03:48:25.001
<v Speaker 3>Now what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5773
03:48:25.001 --> 03:48:27.980
<v Speaker 3>you see like historical films like all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

5774
03:48:27.981 --> 03:48:31.790
<v Speaker 3>it's always the Roman empire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which one?</v>

5775
03:48:32.060 --> 03:48:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Just every historical fucking right.</v>

5776
03:48:34.060 --> 03:48:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just someone needs to do a film</v>

5777
03:48:36.621 --> 03:48:37.454
<v Speaker 3>by the first crusade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause the first crusade is one of the </v>

5778
03:48:38.361 --> 03:48:40.400
<v Speaker 3>most thrilling things you can ever read </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

5779
03:48:40.700 --> 03:48:43.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane what these men did,</v>

5780
03:48:43.730 --> 03:48:44.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marching.</v>

5781
03:48:44.391 --> 03:48:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean they must like a thousand miles </v>
<v Speaker 3>from northern Europe and just the master</v>

5782
03:48:47.931 --> 03:48:50.270
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so much stuff.</v>

5783
03:48:50.660 --> 03:48:51.493
<v Speaker 3>Like the pope first calls a crusade and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes kind of wrong for him cause </v>

5784
03:48:54.891 --> 03:48:58.940
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like the page or the emperor </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Constantinople,</v>

5785
03:48:58.941 --> 03:49:01.130
<v Speaker 3>the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says the,</v>

5786
03:49:01.131 --> 03:49:01.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pope,</v>

5787
03:49:01.790 --> 03:49:03.050
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do me a favor.</v>

5788
03:49:03.051 --> 03:49:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting thrashed by the Turks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need about 4,000</v>

5789
03:49:05.571 --> 03:49:09.620
<v Speaker 3>nights professional soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good fighters so I can beat them back.</v>

5790
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:10.641
<v Speaker 3>And the posts like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

5791
03:49:10.641 --> 03:49:11.474
<v Speaker 3>great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we all go over there and beat </v>

5792
03:49:12.981 --> 03:49:17.280
<v Speaker 3>up the Tux for Christianity and loads of</v>
<v Speaker 3>patents when I call.</v>

5793
03:49:17.281 --> 03:49:18.114
<v Speaker 3>And that's a good idea.</v>

5794
03:49:18.380 --> 03:49:21.320
<v Speaker 3>And so like 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>peasants led by Peter,</v>

5795
03:49:21.321 --> 03:49:23.690
<v Speaker 3>the hermit turn up on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the emperor is dose and he's like,</v>

5796
03:49:23.691 --> 03:49:25.610
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5797
03:49:25.611 --> 03:49:28.820
<v Speaker 3>why have you sent me the scum of Europe </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come and fight the Turks?</v>

5798
03:49:28.970 --> 03:49:29.803
<v Speaker 3>So he just gets them across into </v>
<v Speaker 3>Anatolia and they go on and they just </v>

5799
03:49:31.281 --> 03:49:33.830
<v Speaker 3>get massacred by the text.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely butchered.</v>

5800
03:49:34.430 --> 03:49:38.010
<v Speaker 3>And then the crusading armies actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrive a piece.</v>

5801
03:49:38.020 --> 03:49:40.490
<v Speaker 3>The home actually manages to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the Crusades,</v>

5802
03:49:40.491 --> 03:49:43.070
<v Speaker 3>the army's arrive and the Turks think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this would be fine.</v>

5803
03:49:43.071 --> 03:49:44.450
<v Speaker 3>And the emperor is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

5804
03:49:44.451 --> 03:49:45.284
<v Speaker 3>look at all these really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these guys were totally </v>

5805
03:49:46.641 --> 03:49:47.474
<v Speaker 3>disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets them across and they ended up </v>

5806
03:49:49.881 --> 03:49:50.714
<v Speaker 3>smashing the texts and the Turks were </v>
<v Speaker 3>just expecting another bunch of passes </v>

5807
03:49:52.430 --> 03:49:54.320
<v Speaker 3>and they're not expecting what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the men of iron,</v>

5808
03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:58.160
<v Speaker 3>which couldn't be broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why they both fight in Paris,</v>

5809
03:49:58.660 --> 03:50:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we fucked out.</v>

5810
03:50:00.500 --> 03:50:01.041
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5811
03:50:01.041 --> 03:50:01.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

5812
03:50:01.581 --> 03:50:03.920
<v Speaker 3>this is a really interesting thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>no one ever talks about it,</v>

5813
03:50:04.310 --> 03:50:05.143
<v Speaker 3>but it's the history of human beings as </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast as we have learned and how long </v>

5814
03:50:09.231 --> 03:50:11.730
<v Speaker 3>it's taken us to get to this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The regressive left,</v>

5815
03:50:11.731 --> 03:50:13.970
<v Speaker 3>they'll always talk to you like this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a one sided.</v>

5816
03:50:14.030 --> 03:50:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Kristine's side.</v>

5817
03:50:15.190 --> 03:50:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Just bullying them out of the blue one </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

5818
03:50:16.831 --> 03:50:17.241
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5819
