12
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.450

13
00:00:57.451 --> 00:01:01.590
the only John Half Ron has joined us.
Thank you very much.

14
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.610
You know I'm always conscious about how I sit here cause after I'll do your
show,

15
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:07.800
I'll get tweets that say,
I don't know,

16
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.980
he kind of looks like a tool just by how we sit.
So now I'm here.

17
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.990
I don't know who I sit with,

18
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.770
my posture and puffy chesty and some romance lighting up in this motherfucker.

19
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.540
Or,
or,
or,
or do you sit like this?
You,
I see.
I don't even think of how you'd sit.

20
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:24.930
It's only if you have like the word industry on your shirt or something.

21
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.800
That's what you need to have that.
That's the key.
Why did I do,

22
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:32.600
I do have industry.
I have a,
do you think that John Heffron and August

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.620
spooky.
Now it's kind of cool on my face.

24
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.920
Yeah,
but yours?
Yeah.
Headphones too dark.

25
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.100
Can't see us winning smile and his palmated hair.
What do you use department?

26
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.590
I used to use whatever.
Yeah,
palm aid,
but now that company's discontinued to him.

27
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:57.120
I just have to shave it off.
Chris.
I can't find switch the crew.
I'm like,

28
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.420
we need like red lights in here.
This is a place it should be more chilled.

29
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.190
You know what I'm saying?
To more of a stoner hut.

30
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.730
Like right now it's like we're sitting in an office with some lights on.

31
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.090
It would be bad ass if it just had a couple of black lights and so everyone's

32
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.170
fat and life Collo some fucking velvet paintings and shit.
No,
I just,

33
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:17.460
I feel like it's,
it's just two s two normal.
You know,
this is so normal.

34
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:19.110
This room is as normal as you can get.

35
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.770
There's nothing crazy in here and knows a Johnny Cash picture of doing poster.

36
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.710
There's nothing going on in here.
This room has nothing.
Maybe.

37
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.490
Is it good to have nothing because then you bring your own something to it and

38
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:30.720
you know you,
you know you don't,

39
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:33.360
you're not influenced by your environment where you're not distracted,

40
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.600
you're not distracted.
Right.
So John,
half,

41
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:39.030
would you make it visually like blow it out with some reds and some Greens and

42
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.330
make it visually awesome?
How have,

43
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.330
how much are you really worried about these people who don't like the way?
Shit,

44
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.210
let's get to that.
You know what?
Yeah,
right.

45
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:52.500
I don't know why I'm confident enough in myself not to let it put for some

46
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:55.350
reason.
When you are,
anytime you're upset about something,

47
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:59.350
it's because anytime you get mad it's because there's fear.
So I think when I,

48
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.220
when I read those,

49
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.070
<v 2>I go,
well yeah,
you know what?
I do kind of slouch and then,</v>

50
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.790
and then I get all up in my head so I slept terrible.
I'm short as it is,

51
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:11.130
but I slumped and slumped down.
It's horrible.
Yeah.
It's bad for your back too,

52
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.470
you know,
it seems like a,

53
00:03:12.471 --> 00:03:15.110
it's easier to do somehow and it just like to slouch but as I could,

54
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.600
it's really Nazi you up and shit started to go when I'm on planes.
Right.

55
00:03:18.601 --> 00:03:22.450
I try to sit like the whole flight a little bit more cause I slouch crazy on a

56
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:26.410
plane because you sleep like,
like that or you can stand straight.

57
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.060
The more you can control your posture.

58
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:31.510
Definitely the best Atar you get like funky back thing.

59
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.970
<v 3>I don't like it cause it feels like I'm like,
hey look at my titties.</v>

60
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.210
<v 2>Yeah,
it does kind of look a little douchey.</v>

61
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.450
And he'd go on a little handyman at the beach.

62
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.860
I remember once years and years ago they had some type of Bra thing that guys

63
00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:46.200
can wear that throws your shoulders back.

64
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.120
It is some type of yeah it so you put it on and it,
and I almost bought it.

65
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.120
Really?
Just kidding.
She was sexy as fuck.
You should've got that.

66
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.660
And then say she's hooked up with the girl and see if she could undo it with

67
00:03:57.661 --> 00:03:59.940
like one hand.
Oh,

68
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:03.510
you've done this before you dirty little fat Bra sloughed.

69
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.800
Yeah.
What's up with those crazy outfits where they just tightened women up?

70
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.150
You know they have a weird outfits that you buy that like sucking your ass,

71
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.490
suck in your legs and there's like compression shorts.

72
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.130
You know I watched a whole commercial on at once when I was on mushrooms and the

73
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.220
<v 3>funny thing is it's like they had this woman,</v>

74
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.340
it was a for a thing like that word squeezed your body and make it look like you

75
00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:27.230
were skinnier and had bigger boobs.

76
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.250
But they showed like the before and it was like frumpy boobs and I was just

77
00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:32.780
thinking,
imagine the audition,

78
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.070
I'm looking for a frumpy boob person and imagine not getting that audition

79
00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:40.880
because you were too frumpy.
Not frumpy,
not frumpy in frumpy.

80
00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:42.980
One was like they had sun damage,

81
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.700
there was a boob hanging out out of like one part of the Bra and it was like a

82
00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:47.690
mole on the other side.

83
00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:51.710
Damage when even my son like you know where it has been that crazy freckled

84
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.470
wrinkle a look,
you know what I'm talking about.

85
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.830
But then they should like the after and it was just like she had her shirt on

86
00:04:57.831 --> 00:04:59.870
but her boobs were really perfect.
I was like,
wait a second.

87
00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:02.720
What about the mole it?
What about the sun damage?
You're just tricking me.

88
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.230
<v 2>That's got to be discouraged.</v>

89
00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:08.690
You're going in any audition where you're going in as the before?
Yeah.
Yeah.

90
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.830
We're looking at with the for 25 35 our buddy Tony does infomercials.

91
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.250
Tony from Columbus,

92
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.480
he does infomercials and he let me in on how they do those fitness ones.

93
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.440
They get in shape motherfuckers and they pay him to get fat.
Oh really?

94
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.180
Never thought about that's what the verse,

95
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.960
they get these guys who are bad ass in shape dudes,
you know they're,

96
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.200
they're shredded and ripped and they reverse the process and then make the guy

97
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:35.290
just not work out for a while and get fat and they stand there and look all

98
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.170
slumpy and shit and they get paid and then they get back in shape again.

99
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.490
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

100
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.640
I know somebody that did the one that's at cvs right now where it's like a thing

101
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:44.700
you put in your water and it makes you lose weight.

102
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.090
You know what I'm talking about?
It's like what it does is that makes you,

103
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.140
it makes you not want to eat.
Like it kills your Alpha hydroxy cut or something.

104
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:52.831
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.

105
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:56.130
But he was paid to do this commercial because the commercials before and after,

106
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
right.
He's like,
I didn't that shit once.
All

107
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.940
<v 2>I did was I got the money and just worked out like a motherfucker and starved</v>

108
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:05.290
myself and that stuff so bad.
It's such a,

109
00:06:05.291 --> 00:06:09.740
a weakness that people pray on and the government kind of lets them do it

110
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.560
because it's real hard to figure out what's causing you to lose weight.

111
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.070
Because I'm gonna have to do is say,
must be,
uh,
you know,

112
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:20.120
you must do it with a proper exercise and diet as well as taking this pill.

113
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.720
And that's all you have to say.
And no one's going to exercise,
you know,

114
00:06:22.721 --> 00:06:25.100
half the people that are taking these fucking things for lazy as Shit.

115
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.820
We're not going to exercise.
Right.
You know,

116
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.960
I know a woman that was barely overweight,
man.
I mean,

117
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:33.500
she was like fucking shit.
Five pounds overweight,

118
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:37.430
maybe like a little two last cans of Coca Cola.

119
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.610
She didn't even say five.
Okay.
I mean,
yeah,

120
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.530
she was probably 10 pounds over the,
the perfect,
you know,
but she was good.

121
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.910
She wasn't fat and she got light bulb and I'm like,
you lazy bitch,

122
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.950
you're just going to go and get that stuff sucked out of you.

123
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:56.360
This is like a serious easy solution.
Just fucking eat less,
work out more.

124
00:06:56.361 --> 00:07:00.740
It's that simple.
You know,
get up an hour earlier,
you know,
just fucking do,

125
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.530
do some crazy DVD,
you know,

126
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.920
30% faster than you normally walk to a gym.

127
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.100
You know how many fucking DVDs there are out there.

128
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.570
All you have to do is follow the DVD.

129
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:15.620
You need to hand weights and you follow along with this crazy fitness freak.

130
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.070
And next thing you know you're in shape.
You know,
it's God damn,
you know,

131
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.870
didn't I'll fucking hole stuffed under your skin and suck sucking fat out of

132
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:28.280
your body.
Whoa man,
that's,
that's some deep shit man.

133
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.350
And then you have to wear compression shorts.

134
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.710
You have to wear these heavy heavy shorts because if you don't that a lot of

135
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:35.180
times it doesn't smooth out good.

136
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:38.270
A lot of times what happens when you get the light pole is it leaves behind
like,

137
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.250
like Funky,
like meteor crater type shit.
You know,
it doesn't,

138
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:47.390
it's not all smooth like your leg,
you know?
So yeah,
it's a little thinner,

139
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:50.150
but it's all fucking weird when you touch it,
you know,

140
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.770
you could feel scar tissue under there,
man.
They're chewing out your body.

141
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.690
You Lazy cunt.
Get the fuck Jim.

142
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.820
Do not have any friends that have your back.
You know,

143
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.290
your friends should grab you and go,
Hey,
no,
no,
don't do that.

144
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.230
Right that you,
you're fucking 10 pounds overweight.
You crazy bitch.

145
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.430
Don't get a hose stuffed under your ass and you can't do anything for three

146
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:17.240
weeks.
Can't even sit right cause your ass has been vacuumed.

147
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.950
You crazy hooker.

148
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.000
Just go to a body rock TV and do that chick's workouts.
What does that,

149
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.100
oh man,
it's literally the greatest website and they get paid here.

150
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:31.760
Is this page plug a plug for?
No,

151
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.660
I said a friend of your wives.
No,
I have no idea who she is.

152
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.220
She just rushing chick.

153
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.570
Who's a fitness chick whose husband kill you and take your liver?
Who'd,

154
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.310
who shoots the workout videos as if their porn.

155
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:45.650
But they're actually really tough workout.
Okay.

156
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:48.680
I just said something there about the Russian checks gonna kill you and take

157
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:50.540
your liver.
Now if you're a Russian woman,
you'd probably say,

158
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:53.270
well that's pretty racist shit you just said yes.
But let's be honest,

159
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.680
there's a lot of Russian women who will kill you and take your liver.

160
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.260
And the reason why total.
Yeah.

161
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.530
And the reason why I'm bringing that up is because the last couple of podcasts

162
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:03.750
we've been talking about this Jeremy Clarkson situation.

163
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.710
And at first I was criticizing this comedian from making fun of Jeremy Or for

164
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.380
picking a Jeremy Clarkson,
cause I love that fucking show.

165
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.620
You get paid by top gear and then,
no,
it's one of my favorite fucking shows,
man.

166
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:16.170
I love that show.
It's,
it's fun.
I,
you know,

167
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.960
we talked about it yesterday with Adam Carolla,
but,
um,

168
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.080
so there was a dude who messaged me yesterday and he said that he was from

169
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:29.880
Mexico and he said that I had it wrong.
His name is Al Dose,Z ,

170
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.160
e f and a,
you know,
the way the message you sent me wasn't Douchey in any way.

171
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:37.050
He just,
he said,
I got the story wrong.

172
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:40.980
Here's The v he said to me that I personally,
me,
I got the story wrong.

173
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.690
Here's the video.
And uh,
um,
Saludos from Monterey,
Mexico.

174
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:49.440
So he sends me his thing.
He's from Mexico.
So I said,
all right,
well let me say,

175
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.970
because the thing I read before was that what he had said is there's no Mexicans

176
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:56.010
don't do well in the Olympics because anyone who can run,

177
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:59.910
swim or jump Missouri jump has already gotten across the border,
you know?

178
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:03.000
So I was like,
that's not even that bad.
Like,
what's,
what's so bad about that?

179
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:05.850
That's nothing like if you're really shitting on this guy for making that joke,

180
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:09.780
the,
you're the asshole.
It's like,
come on man.
You know there should be you,

181
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:12.810
if you're Italian guest,
what?
Shithead you're going to hear some mob jokes.

182
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.570
All right.
If you could give her Irish,
you're going to hear some drunk jokes.

183
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:18.450
It's not,
it's not bad.
Come on,
you can't take a joke.

184
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.950
That's what I thought until he sent me this and listen to this because this is

185
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:25.290
all about a Mexican sports car that they're reviewing.

186
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.880
<v 4>Anyway,
that's,
we got a bit off topic,
but there you are.
A new Ford Focus.</v>

187
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.810
Only do if you just want some car chaps.
Listen,

188
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.840
have you ever wanted a Mexican sports car?
Yes,
I have.

189
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.220
Good news because there is one and here it is and it's called the Tortilla

190
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.100
is not called the tall team.
Why is it useful?
I don't remember.

191
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:53.910
It's something a bit.
So you just made up the name.
I've forgotten.

192
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.540
Would you want a Mexican car?
Because cars reflect national characteristics.

193
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:03.030
So German cars are sort of halal build hand Italian cars,

194
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:07.920
a bit flamboyant in quick Mexican cars.
Just going to be a lazy factless flat

195
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.400
leaning against the fence asleep.

196
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.680
Looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on is a coat

197
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.730
is interesting because they can't do food the next cause it's kind of like,

198
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.950
cause it's all like sick with cheese on it.

199
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.650
How much is this Mexican sports car?

200
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.710
The refrig Mexican sports car is 33,000 pounds.

201
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.530
That isn't enough.
And I know there was,

202
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.690
there isn't enough because that's been somebody paid for that to be developed

203
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:42.740
and it's got to be shipped over.
It's I say tell him to quit to the Carl.

204
00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:45.210
Does he say that though?
But they do say and they're blurred.

205
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:49.260
He's got rack and pinion steering.
Wow.
It's got steering.

206
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.520
I'm sorry,
but just imagine waking up and your Mexican,

207
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.340
you can just go straight back to sleep again.
Oh,

208
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.470
I'm going to do all day.
That's what I'd be looking at again.

209
00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:05.620
He could play him about this cause the Mexican embassy,

210
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.150
the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote and so at this

211
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.420
they won't complain.
It's fine.
Oh,
now and tell you what,

212
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:14.980
there's a radio station in Germany.
Okay.

213
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:18.520
Offered a 20,000 quids worth of mini Cooper as a prize.

214
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.180
So any listener who would do the zaniest craziest thing.
Okay.

215
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.460
And the chipper one is when it's,

216
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:29.461
because he had the word mini tattooed on his face.

217
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.340
US.
That's it.
That's it.
I think

218
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.120
<v 0>that's all the shit they said about Mexicans,
but that's a big difference.</v>

219
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.440
That's not just kind of joking,
throwing out a,
yeah,
we get it where this way,

220
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:47.580
you know.
Yeah,
this is an interesting subject now because uh,

221
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.120
this is where the line is and that first of all to say,

222
00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:55.510
imagine waking up and remembering your Mexican,

223
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.120
the fact that they'd let that clumsy,

224
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.500
poorly written line just get in so they could have a wake up joke and you'd go

225
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:03.334
back to sleep.

226
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.920
That's what they did with that is is a writer issue that's a hate and hate.

227
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.070
Well,
yes.
What they're saying was hate,
but the reason why they're saying is is a,

228
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.150
is a very poorly written line that someone wrote for them.
It's very obvious.

229
00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:20.860
That's like a shitty comic set up because he sets it up in this artificial way.

230
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.030
Imagine remembering waking up and remembering your Mexican,
wait,

231
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.270
why am I waking up?
I was asleep remembering a Mexican,
like,
wait,

232
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:30.880
what is this weird fake premise you're setting up?
Well,

233
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:35.800
it's only so that he tell this Mexican go back to sleep joke.
So what he hasn't,

234
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.920
he has sacrificed the feelings of an entire nation just to get to one shitty,

235
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.620
like wake up and go to sleep.
Joke.
That joke was terrible.

236
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:46.870
And then the other one shitting on Mexican food.

237
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.020
Mexican food is fucking awesome.

238
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.960
And you will tell me that Mexican food is nothing but sick on it.

239
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:55.990
They can't do food,
can they?
It's just sick with cheese on it.

240
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:59.080
Hall English guys are saying that.
That's funny.

241
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:05.020
That's rude shit.
And it's okay if it's funny,
but it's not funny.
You know,

242
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.860
it's like,
come on man,
I can't go with you.
Yeah,
it's,
it's not,
it's not enough.

243
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.170
You know,
there's not enough there to justify doing it.

244
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.110
So what you have is to offensive jokes.
One of them about food,

245
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:15.790
not that big a deal,
but the other one about,

246
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:18.730
or imagine waking up and remembering your Mexican,

247
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:23.020
like that's just straight Polack jokes.
Like that's racist.
That's,
that's,

248
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.350
that's spic jokes.
That's the,
you know,
anything,
anything you want that's,

249
00:14:27.351 --> 00:14:30.200
that's a nigger joke.
That's like,
I mean it really is.
I mean that's,

250
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.850
they're doing it to Mexicans.
That's like bugs bunny Yammer from 1960 that was,

251
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:34.571
that was bad.

252
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:38.830
And then the other thing is that the taking on the characteristics of the

253
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:43.360
nation,
like the whole nation,
Rick,
really like,
first of all,

254
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.990
you motherfuckers have never seen Mexican gardeners.
Okay.

255
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.680
If you want to talk about lazy Mexican gardeners aren't lazy at all.

256
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.190
Their chopping

257
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.870
<v 2>down brushes and stacking them on the top of a pickup truck with giant big</v>

258
00:14:56.871 --> 00:15:01.160
fucking doors on each side of the pickup truck to keep this overflow of
branches.

259
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:04.580
And they're polling it and tying it down.
There's a fucking hard day's work,
dude.

260
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:07.460
They're doing it every day and they're there at seven o'clock in the morning

261
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.380
like where they got this lazy reputation and to say a whole nation.

262
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.470
Yet the nation.
Here's the problem.
It's got no government.
Okay.

263
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:19.610
The government is completely missing.
It's completely,
totally corrupt.

264
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.780
The fucking,
the entire country is co-opted by gigantic,

265
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.010
militaristic gangs.
The drug lords,
I mean it's,

266
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:32.360
they literally own like giant sections of the country that they cannot reclaim.

267
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.480
They have massive corruption throughout the police force,

268
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.290
massive corruption throughout their government.
They have all sorts of problems,

269
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.970
but there no fucking different than you,
man.
They're just in a shitty situation.

270
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.430
Mexicans are the least latency as person.
I did not lazy at all,
man.

271
00:15:47.431 --> 00:15:50.420
They're human beings and they're in a fucked up environment.
It's just,

272
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.200
it's a scientific experiment.
What happens when the environment offers no hope?

273
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.320
Well,
yeah.
People get to feel sad and they're fucked up and they like to drink.

274
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.460
That's normal,
dude.
That's normal.
That's what you would do that to you.
Fuck,

275
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.470
you're just lucky you're over here.
It's,
it's,

276
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:07.630
it's total racism and it's not funny.
It's like what they're doing is that,

277
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.360
unfortunately,
it's not funny.
I see what they're trying to do,

278
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.270
but what they did was ham handed.
If I was working on that show,

279
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:17.090
I would have said,
we're not doing this man.
I would have stopped him.

280
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:19.310
I would've or I would've tried.
I would've said it.
I mean,

281
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.890
if I was one of those guys,
that was the joke that I was supposed to deliver,

282
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:23.660
I would say no way.
I go,

283
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:26.540
you need to stop and think about what you're doing to get out a few Mexican

284
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:29.440
jokes here.
You know,
that's all you're trying to do and you,
you,

285
00:16:29.441 --> 00:16:31.580
you know what you're saying is not funny.

286
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.260
Like saying that every good Mexican has swam,
ran or jumped over the board.

287
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.040
That's a joke.

288
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.130
Cause there's a border and we all know they want to get across the border.

289
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.140
And that's why Mexico doesn't do well in the Olympics.

290
00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:43.010
That's how it's kind of fun.

291
00:16:43.011 --> 00:16:47.150
And every Mexican comic jokes about that kind of plays into that.

292
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.920
That's kind of funny.
But when did you start going,

293
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:53.840
imagine waking up and remembering your Mexican?
What the fuck man?

294
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.820
And that's a very unfortunate to me because like I said,
I love that show.
I mean,

295
00:16:58.821 --> 00:17:03.530
and he says a lot of offensive shit,
but it's always very tongue and cheek very,

296
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.580
he's coming from this snooty British way of looking at things and yeah,

297
00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:08.660
that way I enjoy it.

298
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.890
I enjoy his son joined a snootiness cause I even know don't like that Richard

299
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.740
Hammond guy right there.
That was bad.
And I usually like him a lot.

300
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.050
You see it as great on the show.

301
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.800
You see his demeanor when he was saying that joke teller,

302
00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:20.270
he was like looking at his glass like Ah,

303
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.580
these are gonna have to wake up to the Mexican.
Like it was just like,

304
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:26.360
I just wanted to slap him with.
Unfortunately it was a performance,

305
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:29.270
and this is what I'm Anna Crowe was talking about to us yesterday.

306
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.020
The difference between how Adam handles it and how they handle it as Jeremy

307
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.130
Clarkson,
they write everything out.

308
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.580
Everything they say is scripted and they write it out and rehearse it and do it

309
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:41.540
out.
So that was like him trying to get out this joke.

310
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.430
Instead of him talking from the heart,

311
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.140
which is what Corolla does when he does his rants,
you know,

312
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.440
he comes from the heart,
just he's not,
you know,

313
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:50.610
I mean he might repeat the same thing over and over again,

314
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:53.790
but that's just because that's what he means and that's what is in his head.

315
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.710
And he's just going to say it again.
You know what I'm saying?

316
00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:57.510
It's not like some calculated nonsense.

317
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.720
And what these guys are doing is trying to get out some calculated nonsense and

318
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:03.780
he's trying to get it out with the most impact possible.

319
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.260
That's also because they're doing it in front of a live audience and a live

320
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:11.280
audience of people standing up,
which has got to be annoying as fuck a plus.

321
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:13.890
If you're reading a script,
they're just delivering your line.

322
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:18.460
It is at face value.
You're making up stuff from,
or use an Improv heart.

323
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.050
You have a filter system,
right.
You know,
even when you're B,
you know,

324
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.200
you run it through a filter going,
yeah,
how does this sound?

325
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.350
I can make this funny.
Yeah.
But that one,

326
00:18:27.351 --> 00:18:30.700
I mean if you like say if you were on a show or you're a accomplished standup

327
00:18:30.701 --> 00:18:30.941
comedy,

328
00:18:30.941 --> 00:18:34.260
did you win season one of last comic standing or season to season to season two

329
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:38.310
motherfucker,
he's legacy last comic standing champion,

330
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.220
all those bow before him.
So you've got,
you know,

331
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:45.600
I mean you've got a reputation to uphold if you are on that show and all of a

332
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:47.580
sudden they wanted you to deliver a line like that,

333
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:50.880
what would you know you put your foot down,
right?
Yes.
I had to do that.

334
00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:55.740
I was on um,
uh,
Tony Rock project.
Do you know Chris's brother?

335
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.710
Yeah,
he had a,
he had a show.
Very funny.
Super Nice Guy.

336
00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:03.390
And I was at your show and I was,
I was the,
the white cohost on the show.

337
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:07.100
So it was Tony Rock and me.
You are the wacky white guys.
Yeah,

338
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.200
he would give me a lot of lines like,
you know,

339
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:13.870
like a rap battle that I'm a guy who doesn't know what a rap battle lists and

340
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.250
and I would contact go and I grew up with like Ronnie,

341
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.580
I know what a rap battle lists.

342
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.260
I was a kid from the 80s I know more about kind of wrapped then a lot of young

343
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:25.930
guys do,
cause I was old school,
we could go UTFO and

344
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.290
we do a lot of that.
Like I'm the dumb white guy stuff.

345
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.790
I didn't get upset and I would say,

346
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.720
can we say it a little bit smarter so I don't come across as,

347
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.180
but you're doing a character when don't come across as a retarder if it's

348
00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:43.280
funnier.
Wow.
The guy didn't run.
No,
it wasn't like I was me,
but it's what I mean.

349
00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:46.500
Is it John Heffron?
I think I was,
yeah.
Yo Dude,

350
00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:49.380
you got to come off as a real retarded.
You can't catch it.
No,

351
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:53.180
I want to go over with you.
Fuck yeah.
News radio.
It was a total retard.
Nope,

352
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.231
no I wasn't.

353
00:19:55.231 --> 00:19:59.550
I was host show Garelli my whole character on news radio was the guy who was an

354
00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:02.240
idiot savant.
I was half retarded,
you know.

355
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.500
But I knew stuff about like how to my fucking fix elevators and shit and rig

356
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:10.610
computers and make stun guns out of garage door openers and stuff.

357
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.530
Conspiracy theory.
But this one,
I wasn't playing a character.

358
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:18.180
I was just John had for introducing the,
the skits.
So I understand.

359
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.830
So you were playing your me.
Hey Tony Rock.
Hey I'm John Hubbard.

360
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.610
You know John,
we went on the streets of that still really streets.

361
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:30.840
Did you guys make cakes?
I mean,
you know,
like that type of,
I'm a white guy,

362
00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.460
you know,
I'm like Carlton Fresh Prince,
right?
Cause that's,

363
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:38.940
and that's a different story because even though you should go with the joke,

364
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:40.980
what's going on,
the funny thing is gonna make you,
you know,

365
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.600
whatever makes you the most retarded.
But that's you really playing yourself.

366
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.160
Like what if they're just calling you an idiot?
You know?
And it's Kinda like,

367
00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:51.430
you know,
it's like what a black guy gets on stage and goes,
hey,
why I'm out here.

368
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:55.710
All my friends are out stealing hubcaps and I always go,
rarely,

369
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.500
rarely.
You're going to laugh at that.
Really we're going to how the war,

370
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.760
the worst is when,
yeah,
I ain't seen this many white folks since my trial.
Yeah.

371
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.460
We don't have any guys who he's heard do that joke.
We were doing that.

372
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.740
I was talking to a comic can.

373
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:13.741
We were doing automatic applause breaks cause this one guy had like everyone you

374
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:16.780
could possibly have in his act.
Like you know what?

375
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:21.340
Single moms that really have a tough job.
Clap,
clap,
clap,
clap.
You know what?

376
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:23.980
Our troops are over there.
Clap,
clap,
clap.
Whoa.

377
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.270
That's a specific type of Greg set up that black guys do.

378
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.420
Black guys when they're in trouble we'll go give it up for the ladies.

379
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.680
Y'all get up to the ladies.
Ladies,
ladies,
ladies got it hard out there y'all.

380
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.130
A lot of single mothers.
A lot of single mother,
but much love.

381
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.480
My mom raised me single.
Yeah,
no.
So anyway,
what's up?
So am I drinking?

382
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.240
What am I drinkers?
They drink.
He bonds with us.

383
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:47.830
We drink.
Yeah.

384
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:50.680
There's a little of that going on and unless you're really setting something

385
00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:55.000
really strong up,
it's not really,
they can off state.
Yeah.
It hits with the one,

386
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:58.270
two,
three.
You know,
it's a trick.
I mean a lot of guys have tricks in their act,

387
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.400
you know,
and some tricks are good though.
So I'm trying to,

388
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.980
so some are like impressions,
impressions are tricks,

389
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.590
but I like impressions if someone is good,
you know,

390
00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:09.260
I like hearing like Jame or do like Christopher Walken,
Casey Kasem.

391
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.380
If I listened to it,
I could do Casey case.
You know,

392
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.850
if I really listened to him like,
like I could do Joe Diaz,

393
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.910
this voices that I can do and there's horses I can't do.
I'm not like,

394
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.990
like what's his name?
Frank.
Kellyanne.
Dalia Endo.
That guy can do,

395
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.320
he can he nails motherfuckers.
He's a,

396
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.260
he's got a a but Freddy Lockhart man.
He's a bad motherfucker to that.

397
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.670
Morgan Freeman and the ice tea.
Those are,
those are,
yeah.
He was on your show.

398
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.200
A couple pie.
He was good.
I could use to be on Caliendo show toe.
Alright.

399
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.000
I can do bad impressions of people doing impressions.

400
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.770
Like I need one person removed.

401
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:46.960
Like I kept checking we're doing Tracy Morgan but I can't do Tracy Morgan.

402
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.430
How bad is Vegas?
Kelly Endo was making fucking ridiculous money there.

403
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:53.980
And he said,
no,
I don't want to do it.
Yeah.
Done.

404
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:58.630
I can only live right next to Satan's balls for so long before the smell and the

405
00:22:58.631 --> 00:23:02.350
funk and the fucking you're living in Satan's ball sweat,
fog.

406
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.770
I don't know if you guys talk about that kind of stay stay on point.

407
00:23:05.771 --> 00:23:10.340
Did you see that a Canadian comic?
We haven't talked about that.
That got fine.

408
00:23:10.341 --> 00:23:12.820
That got sued.
Yeah.
What did he get sued for?
How much?

409
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.910
What the $22,000 Antia perform.

410
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.180
Can't perform in Canada.
How long what happened?

411
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.740
He was on stage and make camp before my candidate got like banned.
He likes,
yeah.

412
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:28.210
Yeah,
sure.
I think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He got some,
what happened?

413
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:33.160
He was on stage and he was being heckled and uh,
two ladies through wine.

414
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:37.030
Adam like,
you know,
like tossed it,
right and then you start,
you're saying,

415
00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:39.790
you know,
shut up you lesbians.
And he started,
I don't know what his exact,

416
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:42.670
but he was like,
you two lesbians,
are you going to go home later?

417
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.380
And then they lot harder than that.
He called them dykes and cons.

418
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:51.080
They shoot him for 22,000,
500 bucks.

419
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:54.920
Was that the total they sued them,
sued them for feelings.

420
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:59.880
Hurt for slander,
for,
for him calling them names from the state.

421
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.240
What they won.
She won one for her feelings awarded the mode.

422
00:24:05.241 --> 00:24:09.050
That feeling,
that opens up a whole.
So now as a comic,

423
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:12.050
what you have to do is you literally have to read a disclaimer,

424
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:16.960
but by you shouting at me,
you are saying that I have to like,
you know,

425
00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.900
you're going to have to have some card carry read before you make fun of the
guy.

426
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.960
That's scary as fuck.
Yeah,
that's completely ridiculous.

427
00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.580
<v 3>Just like an opening comic like you,
you,
you,
you,
it was hope for Joe.</v>

428
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.570
And he has like,
you know,

429
00:24:28.571 --> 00:24:31.720
you're just like living on the couch at somebody's house and you,
you know,

430
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.740
you say something crazy,

431
00:24:32.741 --> 00:24:36.060
you get sued and then now you owe $22,000 and you're not allowed back here.

432
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.060
But think about it.
Hecklers can shoot hecklers if you hurt their feelings.

433
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.950
Like there's,
I don't know that,
that can't be legal competent.

434
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.450
How many clubs need to have releases?
See,
bullshit shit

435
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.360
<v 2>is what it is.
It is a bunch of fucking babies that are in charge of side it.</v>

436
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.830
This gets paid what and who wins?
What?
Here's the deal,
man.

437
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:59.540
It's real fucking simple.
Come to a comedy show.
If you do not enjoy it,
leave.

438
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.990
If you want to talk about how you don't enjoy it online,
feel free to do so.

439
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:05.660
That's what the Internet is all about,
man.
You know,
email your friends,

440
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:08.150
put it up on Twitter or John,
John,
John Heffrons socks,

441
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:11.720
Joe Rogan fucking ate it and whatever.
Do whatever you want to do,
man.

442
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:14.540
That's all well and good.
But when you interrupt the show,

443
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.540
you are not just interrupting the show for the performer.

444
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.350
You are interrupting this show for every other fucking person in the room and

445
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:24.230
you haven't made a poll.
You haven't walked around and said,
hey,

446
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:27.770
how many of you guys would like me to yell out?
Right?
Right now,
you know,

447
00:25:27.771 --> 00:25:30.080
and you know,
even then they wouldn't be honest with you because he like,

448
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:32.930
who is this crazy person asking me?
Yay,
I do what you want to do man.
And it's,

449
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.030
it's amazing how one,
hold on a second.

450
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.230
My point is that there's fucking 300 other people in that room and any person

451
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.750
that thinks they're more important than a show,
they're,

452
00:25:41.751 --> 00:25:45.320
they're more important than the 300 of the people that person's account and they

453
00:25:45.321 --> 00:25:46.580
shouldn't get shit.

454
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.630
And the fact that this weak ass court systems set this up and let this go

455
00:25:50.631 --> 00:25:55.610
through.
That's fucking pathetic,
man.
That's fucking pathetic.
You know?

456
00:25:55.611 --> 00:25:59.090
I mean that's a,
that's some kangaroo court shit right there.
That's what that is.

457
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.230
That's nonsense.

458
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.910
You can't call someone a fucking dyke when someone stops a show in hackles.

459
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:08.220
And it fells whine at you by that.
By the way,
if she a dike,
yes,

460
00:26:08.221 --> 00:26:12.700
she was there with her girlfriend.
Yeah.
Okay.
Look,
you're a dyke.
That's wrong.

461
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.480
I have to take a quick fuck and I'm prove that you're not a lesbian dice called

462
00:26:16.481 --> 00:26:20.960
themselves dykes.
Is that,
is that a bad thing?
Is that,
is that,

463
00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.840
is that fuck I could bury though,
Joe.
It's terrifying.

464
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.960
It's terrifying in how fucking dumb people are.

465
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.250
This is a person who committed a crime.
You violated the show.

466
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.630
You should be kicked out.

467
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:36.560
They should fucking take you and take a picture of you and never let you back in

468
00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:37.370
the club again.

469
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.180
There should be a big fucking built bulletin board filled with pictures of

470
00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:44.010
Douche bags who get drunk and yell stupid shit out and

471
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.790
<v 0>interrupt the show for hundreds of other people and make that perform or</v>

472
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:51.090
recognize that you're there and interact with you against his will.

473
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.120
Unless the guy comes up to you and starts talking to you and asking you

474
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:57.690
questions,
laugh or don't laugh.
Those are your two options.
You know,

475
00:26:57.691 --> 00:27:01.200
when you want to interject your own shit and they were a preplanned routine and

476
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:04.920
material,
you're just being a cunt.
It's that simple.
And the fact that this,

477
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.840
this court system is paint conc like Whoa,
that's,
that's pathetic.

478
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.080
I think these comedy clubs need to take responsibility and make them sign

479
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:16.250
releases.
Then two,
before they showed work,
you know,
we're not,

480
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.850
we don't need more paperwork.

481
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:21.750
We need gut judges at fucking get it til that happens.
Dealt with,

482
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:24.450
do you want to be sued next week if you can in a heckler fight.

483
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.260
I don't think you can do it.
Actually have,

484
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.850
I actually have insurance errors and omissions insurance.
Oh cool.

485
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.090
Private insurance too.
But yeah,
I should get stuff like that.
But that's cool.

486
00:27:34.091 --> 00:27:38.310
I didn't know that exact as I gender norm got sued and he sent me hip to it.

487
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.390
He got sued.
But Jim,

488
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.450
Jimmy went after some guy on the radio and belittled him and crushed him.

489
00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:44.430
And the guy was a lawyer and the guy,
um,

490
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.490
and him had gotten into a lawsuit and you know,
even though,

491
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.260
you know Jimmy didn't lose the lawsuit,

492
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:51.930
just paying for the legal fees and everything is a huge pain in the ass.

493
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.430
And he said,
you know,
so he,
he sent me hip to errors and omissions stuff,

494
00:27:56.431 --> 00:27:58.860
but like,
it's just ridiculous that you have to do with man,

495
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:01.920
there's only one reason I'm talking to you at a comedy club is one reason.

496
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.630
And that's because you yelled out something stupid.

497
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.940
If you're a nice person and I talked to you,
if you're a nice person,

498
00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:08.180
I'm going to be nice to you.
You know,
if there's something going on,

499
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.430
like you're just like a peacock and I have to address it,
you know,
the,
the,

500
00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:14.450
you know that it's going to be fun.
I'm not going to be a mean person.
I'm not,

501
00:28:14.451 --> 00:28:16.650
it's,
I want you to have a good time.
That's what we're all here for.

502
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.850
When someone's yelling something out,
you're interrupting the show.
You fuck.

503
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:25.590
You know,
and people think like,
Oh man,
or help do hope to hope show bro.

504
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.230
And there's always two ways you can do.
They can either ignore the guy and go,

505
00:28:29.231 --> 00:28:32.790
okay,
if he responds or shouts something twice and I don't say anything,

506
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.280
maybe that thing will click on in his head going,
okay,

507
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:38.970
he's not going to talk to me.
But what happens is,
is you have two people,

508
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.670
let's say,
or one guy being a Douche.
It'll,

509
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:46.110
it'll affect 60 70 80 people around them because they keep staring at that

510
00:28:46.111 --> 00:28:49.980
person because the guy,
I'll keep talking and interrupts the cancer.

511
00:28:49.981 --> 00:28:54.240
You have to,
yeah,
you have to address it.
If you don't address it,
it ruins shows.

512
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.650
I've seen it happen many times.

513
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:59.010
There's girls and last time I was in Texas at Austin,
at the cap city,

514
00:28:59.011 --> 00:29:00.030
which I love,
great club.

515
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.330
So one of the rare times I had to kick a whole table full of girls out,

516
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.770
they just,
no offense ladies.

517
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:08.800
Statistically though it's girls in their twenties early twenties that are direct

518
00:29:08.801 --> 00:29:13.140
typically.
And you can look it up and you can take me to back to that.

519
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.030
It's always young girls.

520
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:18.120
Didn't you get video of her complaining outside saying that she was getting no,

521
00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:21.660
you didn't do it.
Horse did.
Dave did.
No,
I got some of it too.
Oh,

522
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:23.660
Dave got the girl saying she was gonna Sue.

523
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:28.110
Sue and I got this crazy bitch was saying she was going to say they wouldn't

524
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:32.670
stop or turn me whatever the fuck.

525
00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:35.410
It was always something was JC gain gain.

526
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.860
They kept fucking charming.
It was just a table full of man.

527
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.400
<v 2>It was terrible.
There was a a fresh road kill and they were all squawking.</v>

528
00:29:45.401 --> 00:29:47.970
Every time a car went by,
it was fucking terrible,
man.
It,

529
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.430
it wouldn't stop and I kept telling them,
guys,
you can't fucking just talk.

530
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.380
This isn't a nightclub.
This is the fucking,

531
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.990
there's a show going on like I got to concentrate.
I'm going to do this.

532
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.390
These people are here to see it.
They're not here to listen to you talk.
Okay,

533
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.630
we cool.
We cool.
All right.
That's it.
You got to go.
Yeah,

534
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.040
I kicked them all out.
Edward people think it is a comedy once.
Once you start,

535
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:06.821
are you telling the story?

536
00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:10.570
It's like interrupting a singer mid now your train of thought is stopped and

537
00:30:10.571 --> 00:30:11.890
you're like,
wait,
what was I?

538
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.220
And that's why some people tried to do it on purpose.
Like guys,

539
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.180
you see guys doing that on purpose all the time.
The week guys,
you know,
we'll,

540
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:23.120
we'll,
we'll heckle and then you go.
I'm sorry sir.
What are you saying?
What book?

541
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.450
Like they'll say something back to you like stupid.

542
00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:29.830
Like does compensation nonsense,
nonsense word.
Like not a real conversation.
Like,

543
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.820
Oh,
you're just being annoying.
That's a beauty I've done.
Stand up for what,

544
00:30:33.821 --> 00:30:35.840
23 years.
And when you're a young guy,
Yo,

545
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.380
you always have like a heckler line locked in your brain.

546
00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:41.380
And if somebody says something,
you slam them and you're like,
hi,

547
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.600
I totally slammed.

548
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.730
But then you reach a point of being comfortable where you're like,
you know what,

549
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.890
Heckler Guy,
you bore me.
You can leave here.
So you can just go,
I'm going to,

550
00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:52.900
I'm going to hang out with the adult chicken amount as the best every he has

551
00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:56.130
like his ass,
his paddle.
Yeah.

552
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.960
As much as people love those youtube clips that are up of hecklers getting

553
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:01.600
destroyed,
it's the way better just kick him out of the fucking show.

554
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.110
I want everybody to have fun,
man.
I want some one needy ass hole in.

555
00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:08.890
A lot of them are want to be,
a lot of them are wanting to be comedians.

556
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:11.950
A huge percentage of them,
they think they're good.
They think they can do it,

557
00:31:11.951 --> 00:31:12.460
you know,

558
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.040
and they just never had the balls go to an open mic night or something like
that.

559
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:18.320
But you know,
they see you and they were fucking drawn her 400 query.

560
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.490
I can do it too.
Or fucking queer.

561
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.690
I'm going to fucking ruin them on a ruined once we're headphone show night and

562
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.990
ruined them all the whole right there.
They're thinking,

563
00:31:25.991 --> 00:31:26.771
here's what I'm going to say.

564
00:31:26.771 --> 00:31:30.130
I'm probably just going to say like the last person that,
uh,
was um,

565
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.240
bragging about fucking up a Heckler was Dana Dear Armand,

566
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:39.190
bragging about just crushing Mike Young and she heckled Mike Young and jacked

567
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:43.150
him.
John was the one person that we know that,
uh,
stopped his show.

568
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:44.920
Mitch show to take a piss break.

569
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.390
Remember we talked about this a couple of weeks ago,
like Oh,
your comedy show.

570
00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:52.870
That's right.
Yeah.
I still has the most of the craziest thing I've ever heard.

571
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.910
You know,
you might have like a,
like a bladder problem,

572
00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:57.220
like my homie Mike Goldberg,
listen to this folks.

573
00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.290
Here's a little inside information.

574
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:02.740
If you ever listen to the UFC and you know how the fire walk ups are,

575
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.340
you know like a dude's will come out and the music will start playing and then

576
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:08.810
I'll go hailing out of Reno,
Rockport,
Illinois.
Right.

577
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.930
You know this guy's a Jujitsu fighter is a,
you know,

578
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:14.560
one of the best one available that if you only hear me talking,

579
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.990
it's cause my goal,
birds pain.
Cause Mike Goldberg,
no bullshit.
We'll p five,

580
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.010
six times during a show that has he got that shit checked out.
Oh Dude.

581
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:27.730
I don't know man.
I think his deck is just broken and all kinds of ways.

582
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.550
I don't know.
I tried to tell him about it.
I'm like Homie,
whatever.

583
00:32:30.551 --> 00:32:32.680
They got you on.
That shit ain't working.
And he's like,

584
00:32:32.681 --> 00:32:35.080
it's just drinking all these red bulls because he drinks a ton of red bulls.

585
00:32:35.081 --> 00:32:35.651
When we do a,

586
00:32:35.651 --> 00:32:40.250
I stopped trying to keep up with him because a nice tasty red bull.

587
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.250
I know a cold one.
They got him in there in a bucket filled with ice.

588
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.590
It seems like,
you know,
and the guy goes,
you want another red bull?

589
00:32:45.591 --> 00:32:48.500
I could just have a red bull whenever I want man,
when I'm at work,
you know,

590
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.810
sometimes like give me another one.
And then I realized,
Holy Shit,

591
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:54.470
I've drank three red bulls,
my hearts ready to break out of my fucking chest.

592
00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.220
I'm sitting there,
I'm gone.
And like people who've said,
you'd be like,
dude,

593
00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:01.580
you're a coke when you do the UFC.
No,
but yeah,

594
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:05.090
three red bull realizable man.
You might as well be on coke.

595
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.860
The energy you have to have because as,
as energetic as people are on TV,

596
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.140
that gets toned down by the time you see it.

597
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:17.290
So if you have to have crazy over the top energy for it to seem normal energy.

598
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:20.990
If I'm a guy on my couch,
man,
I guess I don't think about it like that.

599
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.320
I think I'm better off with one red bull then with three

600
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:27.650
excited for no reason,

601
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:30.680
but I only get excited and naturally I never tried to ramp it up and people

602
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:33.530
don't believe that.
They think that I like hype up fights.

603
00:33:33.531 --> 00:33:35.930
And if I don't think much about a fight,
man,

604
00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:38.690
it'd be pretty fucking flat about it.
I mean,
I have to do my job about it,

605
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.390
you know?
But it was some fight where I'm like,
mom,

606
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.830
this is not that exciting to me.
I,
I'm not,
I don't get hyped about it.

607
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.160
If you hear me hyped about something,
it's 100% legitimate.
You know,
I,

608
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.220
I don't like,
like tried to put out all this energy.

609
00:33:49.221 --> 00:33:50.750
That's just how I feel about shit.

610
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.690
The PN one had a point when I started in on this rant.
Uh,

611
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.310
we were talking about me being on stage.
No,
no,
no.
Mike Goldberg's broken.

612
00:33:58.670 --> 00:33:59.503
That's what it was.

613
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.740
So this is how you know if you're ever watching the fights and you only hear me

614
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:07.850
talking for a long period of time,
that's cause Goldberg's pin.
That's what it is.

615
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.660
Always.
You sure?
Yeah.
So when you hear that it's the new rules,

616
00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:15.260
you got to do a shot.
So when you hear just the new UFC drinking game,

617
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:19.940
when when when a fighter's walking up and Goldberg's not talking to a shot

618
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.300
and it counts for Facebook fights to,

619
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:25.340
cause all of them are going to be on Facebook.
Now.

620
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.050
This one that's in Canada this weekend,

621
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.860
paper view is an hour earlier and all the PR,
all the prelims,

622
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:34.760
100% of them are going to be on Facebook.
Wow.
We're going to air all the,

623
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.260
and then you're gonna see is Facebook and then spike TV and then the UFC pay per

624
00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:42.830
view.
Facebook.
It's going to be the shit.
All the unaired prelims.

625
00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:46.460
A lot of great fucking fights and it was prelims man.
You know,
that's what,

626
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:47.720
when you get to see these guys,

627
00:34:47.721 --> 00:34:50.810
like a lot of times when you see a guy and he's in the main card for the first

628
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:54.800
time RDC and homeboy fight like three or four times like I know what's up,

629
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:57.500
you know,
I know what he's,
you know,
this is like this,
this guy's awesome.
Wait,

630
00:34:57.501 --> 00:34:59.960
wait.
Do you see this guy?
You know and you get,

631
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.390
you get a really chance to see these upcoming dudes.

632
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.200
You know like some guys like in name you like a hunter s Thompson and a Nixon

633
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.870
had a conversation once in the back of a limo and this is how a hunter s

634
00:35:08.871 --> 00:35:10.970
Thompson knew that Nixon was a real football fan.

635
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:14.480
Cause he started talking about like second string quarterbacks from some obscure

636
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:17.810
college,
you know?
And he was like wow,
this guy is like legit.

637
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.590
Like he's a legit football fan.
You know,
if you're a UFC guy,

638
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:24.380
like UFC fans like to be like legit too.

639
00:35:24.381 --> 00:35:26.720
They like to know do to fall on the undercard.
And by the way,

640
00:35:26.721 --> 00:35:30.200
I made a mistake yesterday cause we've got two blasted and we were talking about

641
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:32.470
Greg Nelson,
uh,
the trainer at a Minnesota and I,

642
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:37.580
I just didn't think I was trying to like scramble and remember who fighter was.

643
00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.340
And I was thinking about Jacob Volkman is one of them.
And uh,

644
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.340
Jacob Volkmann's up fucking awesome grappler.
I love watching that guy fight.

645
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.730
And the other guys,
nick the Carny Lense who won his last fight,

646
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:50.640
not private citizen,
but he went by Guillotine.
He's another badass fighters.

647
00:35:50.641 --> 00:35:54.900
These guys are like some serious wrestlers that they're converting into MMA

648
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:57.750
fighters.
But that Greg Nelson Guy,
he does a bad ass job.

649
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.840
So I had made a mistake yesterday.
I wanted to correct that so that,

650
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:05.480
those two things,
I want to correct that Mexican top gear thing.
And the,
uh,

651
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.530
by the way,
I speak wrestling in high school.

652
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:10.040
They're getting rid of the figure four around the head.
Really?

653
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.850
He can't do that in high school.
I figure four around on random facts out.
Yeah.

654
00:36:13.851 --> 00:36:16.530
I remember you put a chicken wing in and then you'd run it and then you'd figure

655
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:19.950
for the guy's head.
That's a dark,
like a dark.
What with your legs?

656
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.140
All with your lecturer.
But that,
that moves.

657
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:25.170
Now we illegal and I only know because that was the worst wrestler in my high

658
00:36:25.171 --> 00:36:25.801
school history.

659
00:36:25.801 --> 00:36:29.700
And I got figured for probably more than anyone in history of high of Michigan

660
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:32.490
Wrestle.
Know why.
But dudes are probably turned it into triangles.

661
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.500
I bet there's kids that are Jujitsu guys that are on the bottom and locking guys

662
00:36:36.501 --> 00:36:38.670
up and triangles and pinning them cause they're unconscious.

663
00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.270
That's what Dave Schultz,
who's to do the Dave Schultz and I'm,

664
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.530
and I'm Mark Schultz.
The Shults brothers were these fucking bad ass wrestlers.

665
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:48.960
And uh,
one of the moves they did was the Shults headlock.

666
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.230
And it's the same thing that Matt Hughes to,
to Ricardo Alomeda.

667
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.580
He got him in his front headlock and choked him to sleep with it.
And the hue,

668
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.970
the Hughes Right.
Pulled it off.
Yeah.
It's,
it's a wrestling submission.
Yeah.

669
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.810
And Hughes did it to Alomeda and now made it,

670
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:03.390
didn't even know it was coming and he's a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu.

671
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.171
But these,
uh,

672
00:37:04.171 --> 00:37:07.410
the Schultz brothers used to do it and choke guys unconscious and then put them

673
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:09.570
on their back and they'd be pinned,
you know?
Yeah.

674
00:37:09.571 --> 00:37:11.520
You pen the fucking put you to sleep first.

675
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.790
It's a totally different sport you're playing.
You know,

676
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:16.980
he would break guys arms with rolling Camorra's.

677
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:21.300
He would grab Camorra's and rip guys arms apart when they would take him to the

678
00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:25.560
ground.
Full blast,
grab in a wrestling match.
There's like him in the Olympics.

679
00:37:25.561 --> 00:37:28.920
He got disqualified for ripping some guy's fucking arm apart.
I mean,

680
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:32.130
he's like the wrestling,
but he's not wrestling.
He's trying to break your shit,

681
00:37:32.131 --> 00:37:34.830
man.
Did you see that video of that kid is for your wrestling?

682
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.810
It's about nine years old as a Mohawk,

683
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.530
like chocolate l and he's eight or nine years old in the Vegas.

684
00:37:40.531 --> 00:37:44.220
Kids are twins Max.
No,
this is just the unknown wrestling kid.
Oh yeah,

685
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:45.760
I did see that.
And she goes out there.

686
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:49.500
He's got my mean his fucking face like the kid.
And it's funny the comments,

687
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.420
all these people go,
he's too nasty.

688
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:55.470
His parents should cause he knows Jujitsu and I think in judo,

689
00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:00.360
well his wrestling ridiculous talk is incredible.

690
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.530
He's amazing.
He's so good.
What's the youtube video then?

691
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.590
I would look up nine year old killer wrestlers that it has a Mohawk and you

692
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:09.270
could see as the kid walking out there,

693
00:38:09.271 --> 00:38:12.890
you see every little kid that he goes to Russell like look back at his parents

694
00:38:12.891 --> 00:38:16.980
going,
oh I want to go home.
I want to play soccer at one in the kitchen.

695
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.141
Not Fair.

696
00:38:19.141 --> 00:38:21.870
Because there's other kids who are just like just starting out and this kid has

697
00:38:21.871 --> 00:38:25.890
been doing it every day for years and he's got fucking some serious technique

698
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:26.640
man.
Yeah,

699
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.770
it's interesting you see the common future when you see the people going to,

700
00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.070
you know,
yelling at the parents and you're being a pussy,
you know,

701
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.280
combos.
Those parents,

702
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.400
<v 5>they've never been in a,
in a combat sport themselves.
It's that simple.</v>

703
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.710
You need to know that somebody like that out there.
Okay.

704
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.500
Do you want to be like that guy or do you want to let that guy dominate you like

705
00:38:45.501 --> 00:38:46.570
that?
Those are your two choices.

706
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.540
Do you want to like have fastest sport or do you want to be like that

707
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:52.060
motherfucker?
That's the top of the rainbow.
The see it.
That's what,

708
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.030
that's what it is.
There you go.
Now you know,
go wrestle him.
Find out what's up.

709
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:58.450
Boom.
Yeah,
you got fucked up,
right?
Okay.
How do we not get you fucked up?

710
00:38:58.451 --> 00:39:00.490
But you got to learn how to wrestle like that guy right now.

711
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:03.370
You know you have like something to aspire to the meanwhile they'll have,

712
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.690
they'd be happy shit if their kid was the one kicking ass parents,
man,

713
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.910
we gas bitches raising some soft motherfuckers besides following high school

714
00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:15.530
wrestling,
which is something I noticed these cargo

715
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.060
and can we get the bachelor?
Watch the guy with one leg,
I forgot his name.

716
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:23.770
He was pretty bad ass.
Giant national.

717
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.430
Did you know that John created this really cool plugin for,

718
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.350
for like your Internet browser.

719
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.770
So like if you're like talked about this on the way over here.
So tell it,

720
00:39:31.771 --> 00:39:33.970
tell us about the c suite.
You,
you,
what did you use?

721
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.750
You came up with the idea and he got a piece store you want to know.

722
00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.641
Do you want me to,

723
00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:42.310
I didn't know if you want me to tell that when I was in Columbus when I actually

724
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:46.840
had to go on stage
your browser,
I did a,

725
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:51.030
I was working on with this guy and he gave me some off the shelf,
uh,
like,

726
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.390
like energy type of weight loss type thing to work out with,

727
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:58.720
have something like that.
But I would speed mother fireworks show thirsty.

728
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.230
Like so in between shows I drank,
you know,
in the greenroom bottles,

729
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.230
maybe six bottles of water,
like just pounded them.

730
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.500
And then I even told the comic Cagle I've never been this thirsty in my entire

731
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:13.330
life.
I peed right before the show,
one of those long,
huge piece get on stage.

732
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.560
I'm on stage maybe six minutes and I start going,
I have to pee again.

733
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.380
Now we've all had that where I'm like,
Nah,
I'll be able to,
hey guys,
I'll,
I'll,

734
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.260
I'll say up here for about 45 minutes so I can,
and I have to pee now.

735
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.570
The only thought in my head is I have to pee.

736
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.880
So I look at the girl in the front row.
I'm like,
so what do you do for a living?

737
00:40:31.881 --> 00:40:35.130
You know,
I'm sweating now.
I'm trying to talk this.
Oh,
Brian was there,

738
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:38.320
was there while you were in the crowd,
right.
So I'm like,
what do you do?

739
00:40:38.321 --> 00:40:40.540
And she talked to me,
it's,
you gave me your answer.

740
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:43.780
And I couldn't read for $1,000.
I couldn't tell you what she said.

741
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.930
Sweats coming off and what you are.
I literally go,

742
00:40:46.931 --> 00:40:50.620
I've never had to do this in my life.
I have to go to the bathroom.

743
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.920
I can't even view are there.
How come he was in the crowd?
I was in the crowd,

744
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:54.754
he was just in the crowd,

745
00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:57.460
just happened to be in Columbus that we can get with in town called.

746
00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.490
And I'm like,
dude,
I'm gonna come see you.
Oh,
that's so fun.
And with crazy.

747
00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:03.280
He kept on asking the opening comics.

748
00:41:03.281 --> 00:41:07.090
They help who just bitter that that he's opening for me and I'm like,
I go,

749
00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:08.350
can I get the mic back up here?

750
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.650
I have to go to the bathroom and then I would do a bit and then a couple minutes

751
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:16.180
later I go,
seriously,
I need them see you to cup.
And then he slowly walks up.

752
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.080
So the Columbus Comic Club,
you have to run all the way in the back room.

753
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:23.170
It all the way to the Front to pee.
So I sprint off.

754
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.740
I think Brian has footage of me running past them as fast as I can.
Right.

755
00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.940
And maybe 20 guys got up to go to the bathroom when I go,

756
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:34.040
I'll be right back to them.
Yeah.
By time I get to the

757
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.320
<v 0>bathroom,
there's 20 guys deep in the urine.</v>

758
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.090
That's because a real comedy club has a fucking bathroom for the comment.
Then I,

759
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:43.670
comedy club has a bathroom in the green room and she just went out back in the

760
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:46.240
kitchen.
Can I take cuts in front of,

761
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.370
and this guy as he's painting with his Dick is Andrew's goes,
oh,
sorry bro.

762
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:52.370
We just thought that it would be a good time to go if you were going literally,

763
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:56.330
and he pulls away the part to see you can't land back on the Shitty way that

764
00:41:56.331 --> 00:41:59.780
club is designed.
That's stupid as fuck.
There's no green room.
They're either,

765
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:04.190
it's always so embarrassed.
Like I was so to this day,
now before I go on stage,

766
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.550
I think I go to bathroom 15 times.
Like in my head I'm like,

767
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.850
nobody goes more than Goldberg and couldn't believe it.
He goes and like,

768
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.250
it's a running joke with the all the aren't,
you know what?

769
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.180
I'm going to do this UFC.
Okay,
this one,
I'm gonna do this.
UFC,
I'm going to cold,

770
00:42:17.181 --> 00:42:21.290
have a video camera set up so that it'll be right there.

771
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:24.200
Might not like every time,
every time he gets up,
I'm going to,

772
00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:27.670
I'm going to videotape him going to the bathroom just so we can get a number or

773
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.850
you mean,
you mean sitting by you?
Okay.
I'm going say in the bathroom.
I came in,

774
00:42:31.851 --> 00:42:34.470
Andy Dick drinking red bull,
him in the bathroom and he,

775
00:42:34.471 --> 00:42:37.610
Dick went off the wagon again.
Remember how Andy Tech was telling us,
you know,

776
00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:39.110
he was talking about whether or not he yet,

777
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.670
I don't know if he wants this advertised,

778
00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:43.010
but Ari Shaffir already let it out to me,

779
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.530
so I'm sure he's told other people or it's got a big fucking mouth.

780
00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.670
Arguer could you see a code word like of Goldberg's bathroom and you go whoa,

781
00:42:49.671 --> 00:42:54.380
this next fighters like light on his toes.
Like light on it.
It's bananas,

782
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.190
bananas and beating Banana.
No,
no.

783
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:03.230
It would have to be something like try to program the UFC.
Yeah.
Oh,
sniff.

784
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:07.160
Go.
Okay.
No,
you know what I'm saying?
If you're playing,

785
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.080
if you're playing the UFC drinking game,
take one shot.
Yeah.

786
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.420
That's what everybody would be like.
What is he talking about?

787
00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:17.180
And then they'll glow.
I'll totally do that.
Yeah,
I will.

788
00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:19.100
If I remember another shot,

789
00:43:19.101 --> 00:43:21.400
I have to remember if you're playing the UFC drinking game,
this is,

790
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.490
this is one shot folks.
Yeah.
And that's another shot.
And then what?
Yeah.

791
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.460
And by the way,
folks,
if you're going to take some UFC drinking game shot,

792
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.750
make it Jack Daniels,

793
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.200
which is why you fucking around with some fruity tasted nonsense.

794
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:37.670
I am a big fan of the Jack Daniel shot because of Jack Daniel's shot.

795
00:43:37.671 --> 00:43:41.600
Lets you know exactly what the fuck you're getting into when you do a shot of

796
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:44.740
Jack Daniels and your whole body goes,
ah,
ah,

797
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:50.260
ah,
Jack Daniels makes your fucking toe straightened out.
Sheila too.

798
00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:53.630
Man.
Tequila can,
but it's gotta be cheap,
Shitty Tequila.

799
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.630
Jack Daniel's always gets me if I have a choice.

800
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:58.510
But there's something also about Jack Daniels.

801
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.800
It makes me think of like fucking Merle haggard and Johnny Cash and write down a

802
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:06.830
trail somewhere.
You know,
Dick,

803
00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.810
with all your clothes tied to the end,

804
00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:12.740
walking on the railroad tracks only about a shot of Jack.
You know,

805
00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:15.380
you're all doing this together.
You like to go and you,
where are you ready?

806
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:17.570
All right,
let's do this.
You're all doing it together.
Yeah,

807
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.720
it's going to feel great to get a little buzz on,
but it's also,

808
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:24.680
you're all just drinking his fucking vile poison.
You're saying?
Yeah,
I know.

809
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:26.540
I know.
I'm not going to live forever.
I know.
I know.

810
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:29.030
I'm taking care of myself as well,

811
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:32.910
but every now and then the train's got go off the track and then the woods.

812
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.210
Here we go,
bitches,
boom,
and then when you throw the bottle against a brick wall,

813
00:44:37.211 --> 00:44:41.910
it doesn't look the same as like a Zima.
I watched.
It reminds me of Mike Young.

814
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:46.410
What?
Mike Dung.
He's the one that always drink Jack Daniels,
remember?
Oh No.

815
00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:47.700
He had a joke about Jack Daniel's.

816
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:50.760
That's why he had a joke about Jack 10 just makes you want to fight your

817
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:53.980
relatives.
It was that like it was a good impression.

818
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.580
Mike Young talking to her and play,
hey mo,

819
00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:03.120
her mo zones with stone up calling her,
you know?

820
00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.020
Yeah,
I'm might and some new material,

821
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.280
mumble,
mumble,
mumble artists and mumble.
When he does his podcast,

822
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.760
when he does the podcast,
he's pretty pretty clear what's up with that.

823
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.090
Talk to that mother fucker on the phone.
Sometimes you want to spank him.

824
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.200
You want to go,
hey dummy,
how about you talking and some noise.

825
00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:26.820
That sounds like words you fuck.

826
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.910
I think I hearing them come out of your mouth is lazy cunt.
And he's like,

827
00:45:29.911 --> 00:45:32.640
well there's car Taco.

828
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.110
I think I agreed and more things that he says to me just because I don't know

829
00:45:37.111 --> 00:45:38.290
what he says and I'm just like,
yeah,

830
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.000
yeah I don't have a single friend who I have more frustrating conversations with

831
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.900
Ari.
I'll have conversations with him on the phone.
I'm like motherfucker,

832
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.050
I don't know what you're saying.

833
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.370
You speak English and I don't know what you're saying.
This is ridiculous.

834
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.920
It's not another person I talked to this like this.

835
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.730
I have people that I'm talking to all the time that don't speak English.

836
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.430
I know a Russian dude barely speaks English.

837
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.250
I can communicate with him better than I can with Ari.

838
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.290
Absolutely mirrors or mumble,
mumble,
mumble.

839
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.380
And the worst is when he's stoned because he has stone thoughts.

840
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.760
And then so you add that to mumbling.

841
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:12.870
So it's like we were my friend or my hands on far.
Jesus.
Yeah,
sometimes

842
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:19.200
I used to mumble a lot.
I used to mumble when I did a newsradio like am I acting,

843
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:24.380
cause I was consciously trying when I was doing news radio to be as non actory

844
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.840
as I could.
I want it to be as non sitcommy.

845
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.880
I just wanted to be this dude who's just like a little fucking dance and stupid.

846
00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:36.360
But every now and then comes up with some brilliant shit,
some fucking Weirdo.

847
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:40.380
Right.
So I would try to do it like real kind of relaxed and in doing so I would,

848
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:43.530
you know,
and trying not to be like big and fake,
I would,

849
00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.560
a lot of times it's like it'd be hard to understand what the fuck.
I would say.

850
00:46:46.561 --> 00:46:47.630
Like we'd have to do retakes.

851
00:46:47.631 --> 00:46:50.370
Sometimes producer Paul stems would come over and go,

852
00:46:50.371 --> 00:46:53.000
hey mumbles or to get this right.
And we're going,
oh yeah,
sorry.

853
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.370
So I know what it's like to get into the habit of mumbling.

854
00:46:56.460 --> 00:47:00.330
But with Ari it's almost like some sort of a psychological block that he's got

855
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:03.210
going on because we've talked to him about it a hundred times.

856
00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:06.180
I think I too lazy to move his mouth.
That's what I think it is a part of it.

857
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.910
Because when he's on stage I go,
Yo Dude,
listen to me right now.

858
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.740
People don't know what the fuck you're saying.

859
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:14.580
I go cause I know what you're talking about and I don't know the words you're

860
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:16.950
saying.
Right.
Okay.
And I know the premise,
I know the bit,

861
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.880
I've seen that bit 20 times.
I know the bit and I don't know what you're saying.

862
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:23.280
Like you got to clean up your fucking words,
man.

863
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:25.940
And remember what else he used to do.
I don't know if he does it as much anymore,

864
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.590
but the thing he,
from the comedy story,
when I first met him,

865
00:47:28.591 --> 00:47:29.830
what I always told him,
he was like,
dude,

866
00:47:29.831 --> 00:47:33.730
you breathe into the mic out of his nose.
Used to rapper the mic.
Yeah.

867
00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.590
I used to do it like a rapper.
He used to cover the topic like this.
And

868
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:43.810
people do a lot of shit in the early days of comedy to make themselves feel

869
00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:47.470
comfortable.
You know,
they're,
they're not really comfortable.
I just suck.

870
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.560
And it makes,
they make,
they have a,

871
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:53.810
an affectation,
you know,
they,
they,

872
00:47:53.811 --> 00:47:57.670
they add something to their natural way of behaving on purpose,

873
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:59.650
to try to be more comfortable on stage.

874
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.110
And it usually works the exact opposite way.
You know,

875
00:48:02.111 --> 00:48:05.050
we've seen a lot of comics have pro try to pretend in their coolest fuck none.

876
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.610
I'm going to fuck.
But they do give a fuck.

877
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:11.080
It's the worst thing you could say when you give a fuck is I don't give a fuck.

878
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.070
Because then I'm like,

879
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.280
oh well I can't trust anything you say because all my instincts tell me you

880
00:48:15.281 --> 00:48:16.980
clearly give a fuck right now and you're nervous.

881
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.660
You can't just be honest about your nervousness.
You fucking Weirdo.

882
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.360
You're not even asking for compassion.
You're so bad ass.
You don't need it.

883
00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:25.940
You don't give a fuck.
Right.
You know,
it's,
it's a tricky thing,
man.
The,

884
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:29.170
the relationship that you have with the audience,
you know,
do you ever,

885
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:30.160
you mean you've,

886
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.450
I've been in this situation before and I assume you probably have to where you

887
00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.510
are in the middle of a job,

888
00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:37.480
but you're not really feeling this joke and not really thinking this junk and

889
00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:41.080
even though you're saying it right,
it is not working at all.
Yeah.

890
00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:42.370
There's a weird disconnect.

891
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:44.950
I do that with crowds sometimes it's to make you have 500 people.

892
00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:48.230
You're telling a story.
Then as you're talking,
you're like,
I don't fit.
I don't,

893
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.200
I just don't,
I don't feel like talking about that.

894
00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:53.490
And then so then your energy level goes from here to,
and then I went,

895
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:56.830
walked into the bar.
You know,
you just,
you just see yourself.

896
00:48:56.831 --> 00:49:01.090
He can feel that I do tricks now when I'm on stage to keep me at that level or

897
00:49:01.091 --> 00:49:05.830
when I start to imagine my brain going someplace else to stay present.

898
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:09.370
You know what?
It only works.
The only reason why that ever happens with me,

899
00:49:09.371 --> 00:49:11.680
if I lose a commitment to something,

900
00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:13.750
it's because what I'm talking about is really not that good.

901
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.350
It's really that simple with me.
It's not ready yet.
I haven't,

902
00:49:17.351 --> 00:49:21.190
I haven't toned it up enough.
I'm not excited about doing every bit that I,

903
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:25.960
that I do that I love.
Like I've never gotten to certain bits and been like,

904
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:30.070
like when I get to,
you know,
any,

905
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:34.960
any my gay marriage bit that bit when I get to that bit,
I never go,

906
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.440
God I gotta do this cause I know this bit's gonna crush.

907
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.370
I know it's going to be fun.

908
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.040
But when I get to a bit that's like Kinda like not really there,
you know,

909
00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:45.680
I'm still fucking with it.
I'm still working on it and I'm like,
ah,

910
00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:48.550
I don't even want to do this right now cause this is a,
this doesn't feel ready.

911
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.950
But you know,
you're,
you're committed to talking about it.

912
00:49:50.951 --> 00:49:52.600
It's very difficult to change gears.

913
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.160
I've seen you like feel uncomfortable with debt because of some situation.

914
00:49:57.161 --> 00:50:01.420
I can't remember if it was like you've sensed the audience didn't like the gay

915
00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:05.720
humor or the,
uh,
I forget which were what club we were at.

916
00:50:05.721 --> 00:50:07.990
But I remember like you even brought it up like halfway through it and you're

917
00:50:07.991 --> 00:50:11.220
like,
oh,
you know,
I have a lot of Dick Jokes.
Or he said something like that.

918
00:50:11.221 --> 00:50:14.290
Or I have a lot of gay jokes or I can't remember what it was like maybe six

919
00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:16.640
months ago you did it.
Maybe it was a damn.

920
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.680
When you bring these things up right now are so unspecific.
All those kids,

921
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:23.590
I don't remember any audience getting upset at gay jokes.

922
00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.320
They were getting upset.
You just kind of sensed it.
Like how,
you know,

923
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:29.390
I'd say that sometimes cause I sense it because I know I talked to Jim Norton

924
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:30.290
about this.
I go,
dude,

925
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.370
I thought that I had a problem because they had so many Dick Jokes in my act

926
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.570
until I went to see Norton and laugh my ass off as dude has like fucking,

927
00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:43.280
it's one long Dick joke,
but it's hilarious.
I mean,
I loved it.
I said,

928
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:45.050
now I don't feel bad cause all I never think about that.

929
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:47.240
I never worry about that cause he's crazy.
Right,
right,
right.

930
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:49.920
But I thought about that.
I'm like,
you know,
I've said it on stage before.

931
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:53.940
I have like a jokes of dude's sucking dude's Dicks,

932
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:58.220
don't want to and it's all different premises and all different shit.

933
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:00.470
And every now and then I'll like bring it up on stage.
Like man,

934
00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:02.660
I've got a lot of jokes about dudes getting their dick sucked.

935
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:05.120
But it wasn't because I felt something in the audience.

936
00:51:05.121 --> 00:51:08.310
It was because of me being aware.
Right.
Just trying to like,

937
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:12.350
especially now like trying to put together like the,
the material for a special,

938
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.900
uh,
by the way,
we still don't know where they're going,

939
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.470
what the fuck we're going to do in Vancouver.

940
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.490
But more than half the tickets are sold out.
So the vogue theater,

941
00:51:19.491 --> 00:51:22.880
which is a beautiful theater isn't,
yeah.
Did you do it?
I've done it.

942
00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.520
What's it like?
Super Nice.

943
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.050
One of those old school theaters that have been around,

944
00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.380
you know like back in the day of Alice and Columbus,
Ohio or yeah,

945
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:34.470
just really cool.
Yeah.
Some of those stages are amazing though.

946
00:51:34.471 --> 00:51:37.010
Staters you do around the country,
you just walk,
you know what does,

947
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.690
what does this plug,
going back to this what?
What?

948
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:41.980
What does this plug in that you made cause explain that because I think it's a

949
00:51:41.981 --> 00:51:44.480
too,
man.
You can't change gears like that.
Do I know what the fuck?

950
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.840
Oh the plugin for the website.

951
00:51:47.841 --> 00:51:51.290
Just talking about the vogue theaters then you can't just change gears like
that.

952
00:51:51.291 --> 00:51:55.850
I'm looking at it up the,
the actual dates on the counter.
Brian.
Brian,

953
00:51:55.851 --> 00:51:57.980
Brian got to stay in the grooves on.

954
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:01.280
Don't be like talking about completely different.

955
00:52:01.281 --> 00:52:05.990
Talking about comedy and Y'all going back and forth.
When did you do the vote?
Um,

956
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:09.440
years ago when I could actually do theater.
Years ago when you could do it.

957
00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:12.200
You can do with heaters anymore.
Wait,
four years ago,
I think I did it.

958
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.400
You can't do theaters anymore.
I have a pen to by myself recently.
No.

959
00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:19.670
June 10th is when I'm at the vogue.
What happened?
What happened?
What changed?

960
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.790
Not being on television,
just as silly.

961
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:26.210
Just so the last comic standing and then there was like a,

962
00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.660
you rode the same level for a while.
For a long time.

963
00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:35.660
I think even still now I think out of the same level.
Well not theater's name.

964
00:52:35.661 --> 00:52:37.310
I still do really well clubs.

965
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:40.940
Was the theater's things you did with the last comic standing group or do we

966
00:52:40.941 --> 00:52:44.750
just me,
well we did it together.
We did theaters together when,
when I met John,

967
00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:49.780
John and I did the maxim comedy tour and we did shit did to me and you and

968
00:52:50.121 --> 00:52:54.480
Charlie Murphy?
Yeah.
Did,
uh,
what did the 22 dates?
Went to?
Gigs.

969
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:57.650
Got Whole.
It was a whole month of October or whenever it happened.

970
00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:01.760
All theaters and uh,
except a couple of comedy clubs,
a few comedy clubs too.

971
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:04.220
But that was fun as shit.
And with theaters when,

972
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.770
if you're a comic that are in theaters,
man,

973
00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:09.980
some of it now that I've learned really falls in the hands of the people

974
00:53:09.981 --> 00:53:11.400
promoting it more.

975
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.860
I mean you as your online presence and and I mean even now,

976
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.610
look how fast Internet was.
I have more of an online presence.
It's up.

977
00:53:19.611 --> 00:53:23.180
Then when we did that tour because Twitter wasn't really,
we weren't,

978
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:27.180
Twitter wasn't around and in,
in Twitter.
Yeah.

979
00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:31.560
Now it's getting easier.
But those promoters really dictate.
So then,

980
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.650
well we didn't have promoters at all.
Zero.
We had zero for that.

981
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:39.420
They decided this is what happened.
They sold a fucking thing to bud light.

982
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:43.320
It was the bud light maxim comedy toward these guys sold this tour.

983
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:44.970
They packaged it with me.

984
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:48.990
And the reason why Charlie was on was because me and Charlie have the same
agent.

985
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:52.170
My agent convinced me that Charlie was doing really well and clubs and you know,

986
00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.930
help because he was just coming off the,
you know,
the Chappelle show.

987
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:59.430
And so these guys basically sold it and then did nothing to promote the shows.

988
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.310
They were getting a guaranteed amount of income and they just did a crap job.

989
00:54:02.311 --> 00:54:06.650
We didn't do any radio.
We did not any and build up,
say there's two big liking,

990
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.870
not 1000 feet.
How many was the biggest one?

991
00:54:09.871 --> 00:54:14.640
We plan like a 10,000 are the ones that we did well and whereas once I always

992
00:54:14.641 --> 00:54:17.070
did well in like Houston who sold out Houston.

993
00:54:17.071 --> 00:54:19.860
But I always do well in Houston and we,
you know,
we did well in,
uh,

994
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.270
in Phoenix and I always do well,

995
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:24.720
and we would go into market to where you would sell out and I would sell out.

996
00:54:24.721 --> 00:54:26.640
I didn't,
I didn't know nothing about Charlie at the time,

997
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:31.050
so I don't know how he did.
And those theaters were so big.
You're like,

998
00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.560
I would pull more people if I was at the club.
You know what I mean?
Like I just,

999
00:54:34.561 --> 00:54:38.220
that just showed you how nobody knew that you weren't,
you know what I mean?

1000
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:43.110
That that tour was in Tom.
Well,
the fact that,
you know,
now we have the podcast,

1001
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.840
there's that completely changes.
Any kind of promotion.

1002
00:54:45.841 --> 00:54:50.040
I've never been able to move tickets as easily and sell tickets to sell radios

1003
00:54:50.041 --> 00:54:53.550
dead in every city.
You Go.
Cheddar's no,
he's not dead.
It's dying.

1004
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:57.330
You know what I mean?
It's like,
and you know,
they're all fucking scared.
These,

1005
00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:01.050
these,
these morning Djs,
you know,
there's only a few of them that have balls in,

1006
00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.720
a lot of them are fucking terrified cause they know they're during the chopping

1007
00:55:03.721 --> 00:55:07.410
block.
You know,
for every Bob and Tom that can just relax.
You know,

1008
00:55:07.411 --> 00:55:08.430
this guy's had been around forever.

1009
00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:10.320
They're not going anywhere and they do whatever they want.
You know,

1010
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.350
for every one of them there's some poor guy who is trying to survive and fucking

1011
00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:17.790
Cleveland and doesn't have their stations going to turn into all iPod channel or

1012
00:55:17.791 --> 00:55:19.650
stuff like that.
Oh yeah man.
I mean,

1013
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:23.500
I mean how many people were I look at even Tom like is,
is fucked.
He's,

1014
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.110
he's out in the cold.
All of those guys,

1015
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:29.050
like even guys who did really well on radio or fucked,
it's like they,

1016
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:32.280
you bought all this pain.
No place for a homing.
Yeah.
Listen to this.

1017
00:55:32.281 --> 00:55:35.520
When they work out,
when he,
well we want to get you doing one of these,
man.

1018
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:36.120
I think you would,

1019
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.030
you would be awesome doing a podcast and you're always looking for shit to do

1020
00:55:39.031 --> 00:55:42.920
after your shows.
I think the neat,
my vending machine food.
Yeah.

1021
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.771
When you're talking about,

1022
00:55:43.771 --> 00:55:46.140
you're on some crazy diet right now because you eat too much.

1023
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:48.760
A hotel vending machine.

1024
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:52.260
It's like I'm a 500 pound buried alive type eater.

1025
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:56.760
I consume that much junk food.
After a show railing,
I go to the bank machine.

1026
00:55:56.761 --> 00:56:00.080
I'll get three or four rows,
donuts,
maybe some cheese.

1027
00:56:00.081 --> 00:56:02.370
It's if they have the bacon,
a chip things,

1028
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:06.270
and then I'll get some tea and I'll set it right next to my computer and then I

1029
00:56:06.271 --> 00:56:10.200
start just seeing where my youtube brain takes me.
Just eating,

1030
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:13.380
bouncing youtube,
watching stuff,
and we'll go on youtube,

1031
00:56:13.381 --> 00:56:18.150
let's make you productive milk,
right?
Let's have a John Heffron podcast.

1032
00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.030
You could do it with opening acts.
Do you have opening acts or cool.

1033
00:56:21.031 --> 00:56:24.070
Or when you were signing them,
you were saying there was the one guy when you

1034
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.060
<v 2>had to pee on stage.
That was douchey.
Yeah,
I mean I think you know,</v>

1035
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.970
every weekend some guys are cool,
some guys are,
you know,

1036
00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:33.080
you don't bring guys with you.
You must do the low.
I don't,
yeah.

1037
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:36.310
Everyone who I used to bring with me ended up getting a special and then they

1038
00:56:36.311 --> 00:56:38.740
don't want to you know,
feature anymore.
They kind of get that.

1039
00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.740
Well that's good but there's,
there's other young guys coming up,
man,

1040
00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:45.760
it's really funny Guy Damien and then ones that are that are really bad that

1041
00:56:45.761 --> 00:56:48.480
don't want to take any advice and then you reach that stage.
We go,

1042
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:51.690
do I want to be a guy who gives advice or I want to be just sit there like what

1043
00:56:51.691 --> 00:56:53.290
was my place to advice?

1044
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:57.790
You give advice but you also tell them like how to do it when they open for you.

1045
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:02.260
You tell them like what good don't do that bit and the one thing that bothers

1046
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:04.090
you don't tell them what you told us.
You told them not to,

1047
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:08.110
what not to do certain bits.
The bits that that I will say is the,

1048
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:10.300
let me ask a question before have you joke guy?

1049
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:12.920
That's really the only time I open my mouth now.

1050
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.990
But you'd tell them they can't do that.
Well what?
Well you give me.

1051
00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:19.980
Give us an example for the non comedy oriented folks.
All right,

1052
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:23.490
so how many people here at Facebook?
So I was on Facebook,
Greece,

1053
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:28.150
and they tell him to stop doing.
How many,
how many people have cats?
Well,

1054
00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:30.400
my cat recently and then I always go,
listen,

1055
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:32.890
if you're going to do the same exact joke,

1056
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.660
we guard lists of what the what your pole than stone has the question.

1057
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:41.530
Just go Facebook.
Why do you care?
What if that's their style?

1058
00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:45.960
Some people like to set things up like that,
you know?
Well then I get on stage.

1059
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.860
I'm like,
so I was in my,
you know,
I had a big wheel as a kid.
Yeah,
I know,
I know.

1060
00:57:50.861 --> 00:57:51.650
You've heard a big wheels.

1061
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:56.020
I'm not asking you because you're asking permission to do the joke when you ask

1062
00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:58.720
questions.
So what you're saying is that this guy is fucked up,

1063
00:57:58.721 --> 00:58:02.620
this audience for you?
Yes.
That's ridiculous.
I know.
It's silly.

1064
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:04.330
You might have retards for audience members.

1065
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:06.260
You got to develop your own podcast son.

1066
00:58:06.261 --> 00:58:09.160
So you have your fans that come to see you and then you'd have to worry about

1067
00:58:09.161 --> 00:58:12.220
shaping your audience.
You worried that this guy is poorly trained,

1068
00:58:12.221 --> 00:58:15.230
your audience like a dog that pisses all over the carpet and when you get off

1069
00:58:15.231 --> 00:58:17.590
stage the dog doesn't listen,
like stop pissing all over the place.

1070
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.770
That's what the,
I guess if you put it that way it feels like,
you know,

1071
00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:23.770
well Daddy,
can I stay the night at someone's house?
I don't know.

1072
00:58:23.771 --> 00:58:25.630
What kind of food do they have cable?

1073
00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:29.950
I guess I'm being a little too protective of [inaudible] everything.

1074
00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.360
Yes,
I'm being honest with you.
That's absolutely ridiculous and I love you,

1075
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.010
but you've got to stop doing that.

1076
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:38.490
This is the only thing you should ever tell comics not to do it.

1077
00:58:38.491 --> 00:58:42.190
Don't steal material and don't step on my premises because some dudes will step

1078
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:44.530
on premises that on purpose to try to fuck you up.

1079
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:49.060
Like how you might do some crazy bid about getting stranded,
you know,

1080
00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:51.730
in the tiger cage at the circus and,

1081
00:58:51.731 --> 00:58:54.250
and all of a sudden this mother fucker will have some crazy circus story.

1082
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.910
Anybody here like tigers?
Dude,
I would ever marry.

1083
00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:00.430
How many times have you worked with guys and you do Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,

1084
00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:04.240
and you do a set with them Thursday and then Friday they'll open for you and do

1085
00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:07.030
the same fucking subjects that you do on purpose.

1086
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.630
You can tell that they're not even formed bits.
Yeah,

1087
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:14.700
they're just trying to snip on your premise is so common amongst young haters,

1088
00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.150
you know,
and it's usually guys that are creative in the first place.

1089
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.770
This is why they're trying to fuck you up.
I've done that with like,

1090
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.240
I do some material out just getting a little bit older,

1091
00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:27.650
but I'm also in my forties where you see the young guy 22 so I'm getting older.

1092
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:31.730
What Dude?
You're 22 rarely three.
You're going to complain about getting older?

1093
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.390
Yeah.
All right,
I'm going to stop.
So every comic,

1094
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:37.820
I've worked with them now I won't,
I won't let him steal.

1095
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:41.210
Don't let him step on your shit.
You know you don't want guys who suck if you,

1096
00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:44.840
you know it was sucks.
Don't use them again but let him do his own thing,
man.

1097
00:59:44.841 --> 00:59:47.090
Shit,
what do you worry about in the stupid questions?

1098
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:51.720
All you need a Goddamn podcast.
John Heffron can I can,
I should.

1099
00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:54.830
I could have these guys on and maybe give them advice on the podcast and la so

1100
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:57.650
they would be like you,
you're different intel,
their them.

1101
00:59:57.651 --> 00:59:59.690
Maybe their best jokes will come out of,
hey,

1102
00:59:59.691 --> 01:00:04.691
who's got an Xbox Xbox and makes you suck your mother's pussy.

1103
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:11.780
Maybe that's going to be as big closer is quite would be hilarious style.

1104
01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:15.620
Maybe that's his style.
It's just asking stupid fucking questions and getting up.

1105
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:20.280
But it a clap like ironically
I got alive.

1106
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:24.110
Did good.
I got a lot of prospects.
You were asking questions.
Is that okay?

1107
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.630
Oh you you so they will say to you,
you gotta love that.
Got a lot of applause.

1108
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:28.783
That's like,

1109
01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.930
well you have like keg stations like that where you guys are defending their Aco

1110
01:00:32.931 --> 01:00:35.150
and I got a lot of flaws breaks I've had.
Yeah.

1111
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.730
So you've criticized them and then they'd come back with,

1112
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.070
I got a lot of applause because the crop,
any charts or pie graphs,

1113
01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.340
you could show the guy how good

1114
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.320
you're telling them that what they did was not good and they're saying,

1115
01:00:48.321 --> 01:00:52.400
well people clapped.
Yeah,
that's accepted and said that I just,
yeah,

1116
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.753
I'm not a fan.

1117
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:58.610
So it's because you're just apparently am violence to mad at buyer the most I've

1118
01:00:58.611 --> 01:01:02.690
stood up the whole time.
Yeah.
Just don't ask questions.
But here's what I think.

1119
01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.600
You are obviously a perfectionist when it comes to your act.

1120
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.220
Your act is very tight and very home and everything and I think you see sloppy

1121
01:01:10.221 --> 01:01:13.760
shit and people's act and it hurts you.
Like you're seeing it in yourself,

1122
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:17.180
you know,
and that your audience has to be subjected to it.
Is that what it is?

1123
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:19.010
Yeah.
Well I was watching this and that's what they say,
right?

1124
01:01:19.011 --> 01:01:22.550
When you're insecure.
W when you,
when you criticize someone,
you shit on someone,

1125
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.790
well you're really are afraid of that and yourself,
right?
Yeah.

1126
01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.920
But on the question once,
cause I don't ask,

1127
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.370
I don't know why it bugs me can be honest because that's why bugs,

1128
01:01:31.371 --> 01:01:32.540
that's why thieves bug me.

1129
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:35.420
The reason why thieves always bugged me is cause I was always terrified of being

1130
01:01:35.421 --> 01:01:38.570
completely on original.
Like the idea of like what if I just repeat it all.

1131
01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:41.510
Only things and other people said and tried to claim them as my own like sounds

1132
01:01:41.511 --> 01:01:43.250
so gross.
Anything like,
you know,

1133
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.910
I would watch like people get arrested on like cop shows and Shit like that and

1134
01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:49.100
uh,
you know,
like any,
any,
any sort of show where,
you know,

1135
01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:53.000
they recreate this guy went on a rampage right now.
Fuck.
What if I do that?

1136
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:54.750
I would always think that like,
I don't wanna,

1137
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:57.500
I don't want to be a guy who wants a ride.
Robin banks.
Why?

1138
01:01:57.501 --> 01:01:59.560
Because I have friends who've robbed banks.
You know,

1139
01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:03.800
I know a couple of dudes who rob banks who robbed a bank and wanting to thought

1140
01:02:03.801 --> 01:02:07.310
about robbing a bank.
You know,
I mean,
shit happens.
So I,
I'm,
I,

1141
01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.160
when I see like laziness or fucked up shit and other people,

1142
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.570
that's what it makes me mad.

1143
01:02:11.571 --> 01:02:13.790
And what makes me mad is that I'm afraid of seeing in myself.

1144
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:16.720
So are you afraid of seeing him and yourself?

1145
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:20.190
Is that why you're telling all these guys to stop?
I honestly from for,
from

1146
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:25.190
<v 0>a place of where I think I can give them a little bit of a help to make it</v>

1147
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.630
almost like a golf swing.
This is a bad exam or like throwing a punch.
I,

1148
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.640
every week I go someplace,
I'll find a,

1149
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.490
like a boxing coach or whatever and I work,

1150
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:37.960
every guy wants to show me how to throw a punch different.
Right?

1151
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:41.190
But here's the difference.
You Ready?
You're seeking help.
Okay.

1152
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:44.820
You're going to someone and you're saying,
I want to improve this.

1153
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.650
Will you help me what they're doing?

1154
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.820
It's just living their life and doing their act and in performing their art,

1155
01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:54.690
the way they see fit and what you're doing is offering unsolicited advice.

1156
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:57.030
So if they came up to you,
that would be a different thing.

1157
01:02:57.031 --> 01:02:59.280
If they came up to you and go,
look,
John,
you're an awesome comedian.

1158
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:01.440
If you could give me some advice or anything you can do,

1159
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.570
which I've done for friends,
you know,
and I've,

1160
01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:06.600
I've done some unsolicited shit for friends to where I pulled them aside and go,

1161
01:03:06.601 --> 01:03:09.850
dude,
you got to stop doing that.
But like,
this bit's fucked up.
Like to,

1162
01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:14.190
I'm 100% over,
over controlling and stuff like that.

1163
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:19.440
Like I'll even say now,
okay,
I guess I'm a tool a way,
like an MCO.

1164
01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:24.360
Get on stage and and go,
hey,
are you guys in a good mood tonight?
Clap,

1165
01:03:24.361 --> 01:03:28.050
clap,
clap.
Come on.
And you can do better than that.
I don't like that,
man.

1166
01:03:28.051 --> 01:03:31.470
That makes me more where I always go,
listen,
don't give an option.

1167
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:34.050
Just tell them how they're doing.
Get onstage and say,

1168
01:03:34.051 --> 01:03:38.490
you guys look like you're in a great mood.
Why?
Ask them why.
Ask them like,

1169
01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:41.430
I don't know why.
So I will say,
but you're right though.

1170
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:44.400
I was at the gym recently and I was doing a kettle bell swing and one of the

1171
01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:47.640
trainers at the gym came over and said,
you're doing it wrong.

1172
01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:50.370
Here's how to do it.
And I was so offended.
I'm like,
no,
I'm not.

1173
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.560
I have friends that do kettlebells.
This is exactly how you're supposed to,

1174
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.830
and I felt this probably the same way that,
well,

1175
01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:58.770
that sounds like he was incorrect though,
was you are you are,

1176
01:03:58.771 --> 01:04:03.660
you're pretty much of a spot.
I didn't ask,
I didn't ask for his help.
Right.
So I,

1177
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.200
regardless if he was like,
I probably what he said was,

1178
01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.050
could have helped me and I didn't like when people give me advice when they're

1179
01:04:10.051 --> 01:04:13.770
not right.
I didn't know this guy was.
Yeah,
I thought they were completely wrong.

1180
01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.350
I,
you know,
that's a,
a martial arts thing.

1181
01:04:16.351 --> 01:04:18.660
Two guys will come over and give you advice all the time,

1182
01:04:18.661 --> 01:04:21.360
like [inaudible] aren't even as good at you will like give you advice.

1183
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:24.690
And they're just,
it's like some weird fucking Alpha control thing,

1184
01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:27.540
like telling you how to do it.
I'm like,
that's not right.
I'm saying I'm,

1185
01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.880
I'm all down for advice.
If you know what the fuck you're doing.

1186
01:04:29.881 --> 01:04:33.570
But it's hard for people to take advice from a people they don't like,

1187
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.390
that's tough.
Or you know,
if your,
they're jealous of you,

1188
01:04:36.391 --> 01:04:38.340
they got some weird thing with you.
Like you're the headliner,

1189
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.830
you're John Half Ron's last comic standing and they're,
you know,

1190
01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.060
Bobby and mcfuck stick from Columbus,
Ohio,
you know?
Yeah.
And you know that guy.

1191
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:48.840
It's weird.
Even though the punch thing,
how often every week,

1192
01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:53.640
how it's such a different,
every guy says I punch wrong and it's in,

1193
01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.630
well,
everybody's got their own style and then,
you know,

1194
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.340
but it's all that Joe Frazier,
you said throw a leftist.

1195
01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:03.810
Even Mike Tyson did you know Joe Frazier and Mike Tyson through two totally

1196
01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:07.620
different left talks.
Joel Fraser's too,
that,
that palm down left hook.

1197
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.470
And Mike Tyson would throw the,

1198
01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:14.300
the palm facing him left hook and both are awesome.
You know,
there's a bus route,

1199
01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.190
another bang.
We had a,

1200
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:20.800
<v 2>yeah,
we had a boss on the podcast.
It was awesome.
I love it.</v>

1201
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:22.810
One of the greatest guys ever.
And uh,
you know,

1202
01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.470
I mean no one can tell you what to do if you're doing it effectively in pool.

1203
01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:29.350
The game of pool does a legendary player named Keith McCready.

1204
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.570
He was in the color of money.
Remember that movie?

1205
01:05:31.571 --> 01:05:34.150
The color of money with Tom Cruise.
You play the Pool Hustler and play that guy.

1206
01:05:34.151 --> 01:05:39.010
That one is that um,
pool hall when I lived in Chicago.
Oh really?
Yeah,
he played,

1207
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:40.530
he played this guy,
uh,

1208
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:45.070
Keith McCready play this Guy Grady Stephens and Keith McCready was known as like

1209
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:50.250
one of the greatest gambler a pool players in the history of California and

1210
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:53.920
nationwide.
He used to walk around with a TV show with a tee shirt,

1211
01:05:53.921 --> 01:05:57.130
rather walk around to professional tournaments with a tee shirt on.
That said,

1212
01:05:57.131 --> 01:06:01.210
the world gets the eight.
And what that means is he will spot the world,

1213
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:01.781
the eight ball,

1214
01:06:01.781 --> 01:06:05.020
they're playing nine ball and he will give them an extra money ball.
The whole,

1215
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:08.100
like he would gamble with anybody but he,
you know,
be cranked out.

1216
01:06:08.101 --> 01:06:12.070
It was fucking mind on who knows why he couldn't miss.
And he had a terrible,

1217
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:15.070
like his,
his fundamentals were completely wrong.

1218
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:18.790
He would put his arm out completely sideways because he learned how to play as a

1219
01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:21.510
little kid when he was so small,
he couldn't even reach the table.

1220
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:25.180
So you'd have this side arm strokes.
He would do it totally,
completely wrong,

1221
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:29.650
but he would rob everybody.
Right,
right.
Like who's to tell him that he's wrong?

1222
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:34.000
You know what I'm saying?
Like,
yeah,
going on stage and asking,

1223
01:06:34.001 --> 01:06:37.100
so who's here having a good time?
You guys,
uh,
you guys look like you have,

1224
01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.790
are you having a good time tonight?
You know?
Yeah,
you would get upset,

1225
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:43.420
but what if he came back with the greatest line ever right after that?

1226
01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.770
You know what I'm saying?
I mean it's just,
yeah,
I mean it's just a style man.

1227
01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:51.360
It's a style.
I D I will just dive of new leaves that go,

1228
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:56.010
which I will sit in the back,
eat my chicken tenders and just walk out to it.

1229
01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:00.630
My only pet peeves I have ever when guys are opening up his guys that um,
the,

1230
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.730
it could be guys that use the word fuck too much.
Like they're,

1231
01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:04.570
they use it so much.

1232
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:06.700
It's uncomfortable to use it after them cause they'll be like,

1233
01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:08.740
some guys look good,
they'll get nervous.
No,
I fucking,

1234
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:11.600
this fucking guy was fucking told you to fucking this fucking just fucking you

1235
01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:15.990
man.
And then fucking becomes,
ah,
you know,
it becomes,

1236
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.600
yeah,
it comes this guy,
uh,

1237
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:24.490
that sounds stupid,
but fucking,
you know,
when you,
there's,
there's,

1238
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:29.170
you utilize the war.
If you utilize the word properly,
it's a great word.
You know,

1239
01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.530
this fucking guy thinks that he can do it.
You know?
That's funny.

1240
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:35.920
They know what I'm saying.
It's like relays fucking has,

1241
01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:39.160
it brings more meaning to more volume to the sentence.

1242
01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.540
But when you use it all the time,
it does nothing hilarious.
Hilarious.

1243
01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:46.540
It just Jackson and throws.
Especially if you just say hilarious.

1244
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:47.180
Tell everybody why you say

1245
01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.080
<v 3>Maddie cursors.</v>

1246
01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:51.470
We have a friend named Matt Kirsh who I used to open up for Joe [inaudible]

1247
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:54.650
going to date.
Oh,
he was hilarious back in the day.
I haven't seen him recently,

1248
01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:55.790
but uh,
he uh,

1249
01:07:56.060 --> 01:08:00.500
he somehow out of nowhere it started saying the word hilarious and like every

1250
01:08:00.501 --> 01:08:04.670
sentence.
So He'd be like,
oh,
hilarious.
I went out to get Starbucks today.

1251
01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:08.580
How did it areas,
it was the most delicious Starbucks ever headed areas.

1252
01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.600
It was like

1253
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:16.190
he had a hilarious stroke and it won't go Larry A and now I hung

1254
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:16.761
<v 0>out with him the other day,</v>

1255
01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:19.010
how I am on a couple of podcasts and I don't remember it now,

1256
01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:22.130
so I don't know if maybe hilarious it up.
I think he said Hilarious,

1257
01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:24.770
but I don't think it was as much.
There's no way he keeps that up.

1258
01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.810
You set up a furious pace then the no way weird.

1259
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:30.980
Just face like I remember when I was in high school after everything we said

1260
01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:34.850
we'd go brown like for no reason.
So like,
and I couldn't,

1261
01:08:34.851 --> 01:08:38.270
my dad literally was going to kill me one day,
you know,
like he's like,
Hey,

1262
01:08:38.271 --> 01:08:42.110
do you mow a lawn?
I'm going to do it after I,
you watched the new thriller video.

1263
01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:47.370
He's like,
you do that one more in our group in our group.

1264
01:08:47.371 --> 01:08:49.520
But it's the word powerful,
powerful,
powerful.

1265
01:08:49.521 --> 01:08:54.290
In our group we say and it all comes from my crazy friend Larry who's nodding in

1266
01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:56.390
the group anymore.
We kicked him out of the band.

1267
01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:00.830
It's one in a different direction.
Much love Larry,
wherever you are.

1268
01:09:00.831 --> 01:09:02.600
But he also came up with the head slap.

1269
01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:05.300
If you see like sometimes me and Goldberg when we're doing the UFC,

1270
01:09:05.301 --> 01:09:08.630
if we get excited we go,
oh my goodness,
I'll slap him on the forehead too.

1271
01:09:08.631 --> 01:09:12.140
That I pray for.
My friend Larry and the,
the word powerful came from Larry.

1272
01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.720
You know what?
I'm glad it's over.
We did for like,

1273
01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:18.440
it was like I got so sick of it every time.
It's like very nice.

1274
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:24.860
Well,
you know what,
not much respect for the greatest movie of all time.

1275
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:28.660
I have to say one great,
great comedy movie Barat Wins.

1276
01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:32.870
If I one one great comedy movie,
man,
it's tough to fuck with that movie.

1277
01:09:32.871 --> 01:09:36.380
When those guys were both naked wrestling in the hotel room,
I'm sorry,

1278
01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:38.470
that's one of the funniest scenes in the history of the world.
You know,

1279
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.313
they always said that.

1280
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:43.370
That's a way you could tell if your partners is cheating on your hanging out

1281
01:09:43.371 --> 01:09:46.010
with a different group of people as they start doing a weird,

1282
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:49.130
so if you're with a girl or something,
then I'll for no reason,

1283
01:09:49.131 --> 01:09:51.930
she just goes powerful.
You're like,
wait a minute,
that's new.

1284
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:56.240
That's not in our group.
Never Thought Eddie Bravo,
you turn to pitch.

1285
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.280
People are going to start doing that.
But what powerful is is you know,

1286
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:09.690
the way we say powerful.
So just to explain looks,
I want to go uh,
what time,

1287
01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.840
what time you got this?
You want to get some food?

1288
01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.030
How about five o'clock all right,
powerful.
Let's do it

1289
01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.050
more powerful cause nobody ever sampled tickets.

1290
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:21.840
Then you say like you'll say powerful things to powerful new laptop.
Ooh,

1291
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.350
you know,
powerful new sneakers,
but it's some people want to be,

1292
01:10:24.351 --> 01:10:27.240
so when you say that,
he'd go,
hey,
where do you want eat?
Arby's.
Powerful.
You.

1293
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.760
Powerful.
Powerful.
Okay,
well my parents said,
you're ridiculous.
You got issues.

1294
01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:35.540
It all comes back to you.
Yeah,
he's got a goddamn theme he needs.

1295
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.570
He needs a friend and you knew that honey pot.
I'm telling you,

1296
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:40.940
you are fucking up your brain going on the road by yourself.

1297
01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:43.760
You're doing this too much.
You're overthinking too much to ever.

1298
01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:44.990
You're spending too much time alone.

1299
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:47.450
That's why you're eating donuts and all depressed.
When we go on the road,

1300
01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:51.440
we go on the road with a group of us is Joey and Brian and Ari and we go,

1301
01:10:51.441 --> 01:10:54.650
it's a rolling party.
So it's not that what I miss,

1302
01:10:55.790 --> 01:11:00.620
I miss my kids,
I miss my wife,
I miss my house,
I miss my bed,
I miss my car,

1303
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:03.590
I miss all that stuff.
But when I'm on the road,
but I'm not lonely.

1304
01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:06.290
I have my buddies,
we have great times.

1305
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:09.720
When you're doing is you're doing a show so you have fun during the show and

1306
01:11:09.721 --> 01:11:11.720
then the rest of your day sucks a bag of dicks.

1307
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:14.010
And why does it suck about your decks?
Cause you're too cheap to

1308
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.310
<v 5>pay an opening it,
right.
That's what it is.
You're fucking,</v>

1309
01:11:16.311 --> 01:11:18.360
you're sitting in your hotel room watching entourage.

1310
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.770
You should be going to the moon will,
no,
no,

1311
01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.970
I'm what sitting hotel watching what you guys are doing,
right?

1312
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.190
You guys were in Portland,
right?
This is,
you guys were important in,

1313
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:32.220
in prime was doing a thing from the Portland Club.
You had your iPad,

1314
01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:34.320
you are streaming a Diaz was Zara.

1315
01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:37.530
And then he wanted to decide to smoke and whatever.
And I,
and I fall asleep.

1316
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.920
I was eating donuts.
Watch that,
fell asleep,
woke up the next day.
And I was like,

1317
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:44.130
oh that was crazy.
When a Diaz was outspoken and then I later went,

1318
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.870
that didn't fucking happen.
I wasn't with that.

1319
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:50.610
That was those guys in Portland,

1320
01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:54.690
like what my life site and then you just see carnage,
caramel corn,

1321
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:59.490
me sleep.
And I'm like,
I gotta go do something.
Oh,
that's ridiculous.

1322
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:00.990
You're in a sugar coma.
Yeah.

1323
01:12:00.991 --> 01:12:04.950
Just thinking that you guys are so silly to just know when you guys do your

1324
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:07.860
stuff and you're tweeting,
it's,
you should be doing the same thing,
man,

1325
01:12:07.861 --> 01:12:10.500
when like we did when we did the Maxim tour,
when did the maximum cor,

1326
01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:14.310
you and me and Tate and we had a great,
we had a great fucking time and Charlie,

1327
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.700
Charlie's a cool motherfucker.
I've got to get him on the podcast too.
You know,

1328
01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:18.181
we should do,

1329
01:12:18.181 --> 01:12:21.810
we should do a God damn reunion with the three of us and get rid rich Charlie's

1330
01:12:21.811 --> 01:12:24.960
cousin that was with them or what's the guy's name?
Rich.
Super Nice Guy.

1331
01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:26.970
When I ran into them on Maui,

1332
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:32.550
I went to the four seasons in Maui on vacation with the Rogan clan and just out

1333
01:12:32.551 --> 01:12:35.130
of nowhere I see rich at the,
at the,
uh,

1334
01:12:35.131 --> 01:12:38.010
at the clerk desk or whatever the fuck would you check in?
I go,
what's up dude?

1335
01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:40.890
And he goes,
oh,
should we do,
I go,
we're on vacation was oh shit.

1336
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.360
Trolleys here with Eddie.
I got to hang out with any Murphy.
Really Dude,

1337
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:48.060
Eddie Murphy,
I cannot to Eddie Murphy goes,
man,
you're a funny motherfucker.

1338
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.500
I don't want it.
How would you not send that?
Even it didn't even seem real.

1339
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:53.730
I'm like,
this is not happening.

1340
01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:56.820
There's no way I'm meeting Eddie Murphy and he's telling me that I'm a funny

1341
01:12:56.821 --> 01:12:59.760
motherfucker.
I was like,
wow,
I go,
thank you very much man,

1342
01:12:59.761 --> 01:13:01.500
that that means the world coming from you.

1343
01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:04.110
And then Charlie gives me a hug and then I'm hanging out with,
you know,

1344
01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:06.150
his mom's there and his family's there and shit like that.

1345
01:13:06.151 --> 01:13:08.430
And he's got eight kids and they all look like Eddie but fat.

1346
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:09.810
A lot of them looked like Eddie dude.

1347
01:13:09.811 --> 01:13:13.230
Like in a weird way like Eddie Different Eddie,
but weird.
No,

1348
01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:17.570
it wasn't like the movies.
Eddie Murphy's cool as fuck man.
You know,

1349
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.400
I thought it would be weird because he's such a huge movie star,

1350
01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:22.970
but he's just sitting there eating.
He's like,

1351
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:27.300
this is like a outdoor lunch spot and he's just sitting down eating,
eating.

1352
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:31.200
That would be so great to have lunch with Eddie Murphy was so weird to have

1353
01:13:31.201 --> 01:13:33.480
Charlie and here the thing that press me about Charlie,

1354
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:38.050
Charlie Murphy used to get these air,
not air force one,
just the all white,
um,

1355
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.460
Nike's and he'd get a little bit of blue on the top of your shoe.

1356
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:43.100
Laces would go from your genes,
right?

1357
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:46.020
And it would leave them in the green room and I would go,
hey,

1358
01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:48.960
you left your shoes here.
Oh No,
they get that blue stuff on them.
Yeah,

1359
01:13:48.961 --> 01:13:49.860
but you're not going to,
no,

1360
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:54.980
I already got a new Bucer are white and you don't understand the black community

1361
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:57.990
and how,
how important it is to be flossing.

1362
01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.140
That's not nearly as ridiculous as that chains it.

1363
01:14:01.141 --> 01:14:05.340
He would wear rich come out and went right to hold out your hands and he's just

1364
01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:10.170
taking his rings off his finger,
putting on Rich's fingers.
And he took,

1365
01:14:10.171 --> 01:14:14.920
he took neck,
he had these big crazy medallions.
They're covered in diamonds.

1366
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.943
Okay.
I mean there,

1367
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:18.520
there are those rapper things that you see like job rule wearing,

1368
01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:21.780
Joe Rose even alive anymore.
One of those guys,
little Wayne,
you know,

1369
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:23.560
he's got all these crazy diamonds and,

1370
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:27.430
and Charlie would would go to rich and he would leave one on just to keep it

1371
01:14:27.431 --> 01:14:32.080
classy,
keep it classy Charlie.
But he would take most of his heavy shit off.

1372
01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.970
I was hoping I'd run into Charlie.
I got the guy from skin industries owl.

1373
01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:41.020
He sent me a watch for some work I did with him and he sent me,

1374
01:14:41.021 --> 01:14:45.040
I always wanted a Cardiay roadster.
So he sent me his Cardiay roadster,

1375
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.300
not one piece on it,
didn't have diamonds on,

1376
01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:52.780
he's 30 so just imagine,
watch completely blinged out.
Right.
And he goes,

1377
01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:56.110
you did some work,
but the budget's gimme a couple of bucks for it,
you know,

1378
01:14:57.070 --> 01:15:01.360
stupid washers on you.
So I had it on this diamond thing.

1379
01:15:01.361 --> 01:15:05.660
It was so blinged out that you couldn't,
as a white guy,
he couldn't wear know.

1380
01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:07.990
I'm thinking about getting me one of them right now.
Just listening to you.

1381
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:12.190
You couldn't wear it.
Hey could you just got to have some personality,
man,
not me.

1382
01:15:12.191 --> 01:15:16.000
So I took it,
the foam pawnshops aunt acardiac and the cardiac guy goes,

1383
01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.830
if we did those diamonds,

1384
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:21.040
it'd be worth about 250,000 we don't know where those diamonds came from,

1385
01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:25.720
so you know,
and it's stolen.
Nobody believed.
I had all the paperwork and stuff.

1386
01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:26.680
So then I was like,

1387
01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:30.880
how do I run into Charlie Murphy Cause I'm going to have it and then they run

1388
01:15:30.881 --> 01:15:33.610
into him and then I bet you I could sell.

1389
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:36.760
So Cardiay we told you that it was stolen.
No,

1390
01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:40.810
they're just am aftermarket diamonds.
The diamonds definitely were aftermarket.

1391
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.900
Yeah.
But it was Al and Al gave me the richness of cognitive.

1392
01:15:43.901 --> 01:15:47.670
Definitely didn't do the diamonds did not.
Okay.
Definitely.
Definitely does.

1393
01:15:47.671 --> 01:15:50.740
So how much is it worth by?
Give it back to him.
It was,

1394
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:54.220
he said give it back to them.
Yeah,
that was a whole thing.
I couldn't,

1395
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:56.880
I didn't know what to do with the walks,
the whole thing.

1396
01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:02.110
I was the whole thing when I read great way of leg saying,
oh you know,

1397
01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:06.150
so don't,
one time I worked when I hosted the don't even have to explore.
Sure.

1398
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.760
The MMA awards.
When I was in a toward it,
I was like,
I'm gonna wear it.

1399
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:13.240
I'm wearing a Tuxedo.
And then I went to blame me.
I can't pull it off,

1400
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:17.290
took it off,
and then I sent it back to it because I'm like,

1401
01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:19.540
I don't know what I can do with this thing.
I've had nothing.

1402
01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:22.630
I don't know if he wears crazy shit like that,
but he's,
yeah,

1403
01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.630
and you know he also tries Ferraris.
I know he's a porn star.

1404
01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.910
He was a porn starting at a porn company and then he got into skin industry

1405
01:16:28.911 --> 01:16:30.760
isn't meant.
Yeah.
So I gave it back to them.

1406
01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.490
I found out my watch just yesterday was on,

1407
01:16:33.491 --> 01:16:35.080
I think it was TMZ or something like that.

1408
01:16:35.081 --> 01:16:40.081
I found out my watch is what the government looks for because of terrorism.

1409
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.440
If you will wear this watch,
you're automatically automatically get flagged.

1410
01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:47.770
What like the fuck are you talking about?
It's a certain brand of Casio.

1411
01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:51.430
Watch that square.
Yeah.
It's the old school Casio Watch.

1412
01:16:51.431 --> 01:16:54.550
Very Romano has one that's the only watch you ever wear.
Same here.
I love,

1413
01:16:54.551 --> 01:16:57.300
that's my watch.
I've had since I was a kid,
so I always buy it now.

1414
01:16:57.301 --> 01:16:58.330
I'll buy it in different colors.

1415
01:16:58.331 --> 01:17:01.870
Where are you hearing the government's flagging people for tall while fine.

1416
01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:03.970
I'll find the dumbest shit I've ever heard.
No,

1417
01:17:03.971 --> 01:17:08.380
because what it has is training camps,
terrorist training camps,

1418
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.070
they all this certain kind

1419
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.530
<v 3>of watch did it too for for whatever reason.</v>

1420
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:16.970
Cause they could program it to like set off bombs and stuff like that.
Yeah.

1421
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:21.971
So it ended the exact wow Gus you wearing this Casio watch might be terrorist.

1422
01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:26.850
That is ridiculous.
F 91 w yeah.

1423
01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:32.210
It's don't watch.
This is so fucking stupid.

1424
01:17:32.211 --> 01:17:34.190
I swore,
I thought you were trolling.
No,

1425
01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:37.880
I wasn't showing this was going to be a joke and you're going to have a joke at

1426
01:17:37.881 --> 01:17:41.370
the end and you're going to no,
no,
no.
I can't believe that's true.

1427
01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:44.630
I guess the reason I got it,
cause Kmart has it for $12.

1428
01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:46.220
So every time I lose it or scratch it,

1429
01:17:46.221 --> 01:17:49.190
I was going to Kmart and buy a new one for 12 bucks and now they started making

1430
01:17:49.191 --> 01:17:50.480
them in different colors.
Like they,

1431
01:17:50.481 --> 01:17:53.870
they made them in different colors back in the day too.
But this one is like the,

1432
01:17:53.871 --> 01:17:57.260
it's like now I'm flagged if you go to the airport wearing this watch,

1433
01:17:57.390 --> 01:18:01.360
there are trained to look for this watch.
So stupid.
And you know,

1434
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.860
that's the one ray Romano has that watch

1435
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:06.310
<v 0>get a new one.
I know.
Yeah.</v>

1436
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:12.380
Little bit of a terrorist yourself.
A bit of a mark says.

1437
01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:19.780
Anyway,
guys,
he's an awesome guy.

1438
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:21.600
You know,
he said something really funny.
We did that.

1439
01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:26.140
A taping back to back of that.
Paul prevents a show,
the green room.
And uh,

1440
01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:30.580
when he was up there he was talking about how,
you know,
he goes to Vegas,
he does,

1441
01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:31.660
he shows they're doing it.

1442
01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:35.300
Like I think he doesn't meant the wind might be the Mirage.
I Dunno.

1443
01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.110
But he does it some big ass giant place.
Right.
And he said,

1444
01:18:38.111 --> 01:18:40.630
then right before I go out there,
I feel like a fraud.

1445
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:44.710
It's like they're all cheering because I don't even feel like that's really me.

1446
01:18:44.711 --> 01:18:45.610
Like I've tricked them.

1447
01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.470
It goes out there and kills for an hour and then just feels like shit and
leaves.

1448
01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.150
It's weird.
It's like the really nice guys,
like for whatever reason,

1449
01:18:55.151 --> 01:18:58.390
like those nice guys,
like Ray Romano was super,
Super Nice Guy,

1450
01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:02.200
but those really nice guys.
It's like they never get to enjoy their success.

1451
01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.830
You know,
Kevin James is the same way.
Well he enjoys it a little.

1452
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.420
She watched a lot of,
uh,

1453
01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.460
that's my biggest la stories as I've watched a lot of UFC fights at his house.

1454
01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:13.323
It's cool,

1455
01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:18.280
although he's got a rule like where I don't talk like during the fight,
you know,

1456
01:19:18.281 --> 01:19:22.390
cause I know when that rule,
but I don't,
I don't know him well enough that,

1457
01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:25.150
you know,
some people are like quiet.
Like I,
when I watched UFC,

1458
01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:28.310
I run it and I don't have anybody over and I sit there pay,

1459
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:29.270
it's always about me and beat.

1460
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:31.280
<v 3>I say,
give me a town Saturday.
If we're doing a</v>

1461
01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.240
<v 0>hold on a second.
Wait,
would it seem what you're saying?</v>

1462
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:35.550
So I'm afraid to like talk,
you know what I mean?

1463
01:19:35.551 --> 01:19:37.800
Cause you're at his house and it's just,
we're kind of respect.

1464
01:19:37.801 --> 01:19:41.490
I don't want to stock Babin and he'd be the guy who's like,
can you not talk?

1465
01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.270
I like to listen to row.
So it's not a rule that he has is just,

1466
01:19:45.271 --> 01:19:49.110
you don't feel comfortable at his house.
But yes,

1467
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:54.250
overthinking thing you over-thought that's the point where you made it a rule at

1468
01:19:54.841 --> 01:19:55.231
his house.

1469
01:19:55.231 --> 01:19:59.970
I say you introduced it like Kevin's this fucking speak before me.

1470
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:05.630
You know he's got a fucking Turkey leg in a fucking full of meat with the mouth,

1471
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.500
but he gone,
he me

1472
01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:12.510
<v 2>bring another and made it a rule in your head before you introduced it.</v>

1473
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:16.590
No,
I guess,
I don't know.

1474
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.310
It's so crazy and maybe that's why it happened to him at all,
but he's like,

1475
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:21.860
I might have for,
and he just sits there like a log.
He doesn't say anything.

1476
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:25.090
He's fucking funny.
Everyone else's cracking jokes.
You want me to talk?

1477
01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.100
Does it even say anything?

1478
01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:30.180
Watching fights with your friends is actually at home on a TV.

1479
01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:33.700
Might be a little better than watching it live if you have all your backups.

1480
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:36.660
Well,
you know what?
Here's the thing.

1481
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:40.200
My opinion is shit because I'm,

1482
01:20:40.201 --> 01:20:42.930
they're not even watching it live with my friends.

1483
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:47.820
I'm watching it live and working.
So even though I enjoy the fight very much,

1484
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.630
it's not the same experience as watching it live when you don't have to talk.

1485
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.240
Cause when you don't have to talk,
you can shoot the shift with your friends.

1486
01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:58.200
You guys were doing acid
brown.
He's a shit.

1487
01:20:58.201 --> 01:21:00.960
Everybody's drunk as fuck.
It's a totally different experience.

1488
01:21:00.961 --> 01:21:03.660
It's a party watching the fights and when you're watching the fight,

1489
01:21:03.661 --> 01:21:05.400
the lie with your friends,
like I used to love going with Eddie.

1490
01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:10.320
We used to go and watch the WEC ones at the hard rock and the evening and we

1491
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:13.350
used to go fucking,
it was awesome,
man.
We got,
I didn't have to work.

1492
01:21:13.351 --> 01:21:15.090
We sit in there drinking and having a good time,

1493
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.970
but there's something about watching him on TV.
Man,

1494
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:20.610
we don't have to deal with all those shit heads.
You know,

1495
01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:25.320
like this weekend is going to be 55,000 fucking people in Toronto.

1496
01:21:25.321 --> 01:21:26.160
Oh my God.

1497
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:30.180
And it's probably actually going to be way better than 55,000 people in America

1498
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:34.660
because the number of Douche bags per capita is way smaller in Canada.

1499
01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.680
It just is.
It's just,
you know,
people certainly fuck you over there.

1500
01:21:37.681 --> 01:21:42.300
So fucking move their queer.
I'm just telling you,
you might not be a Douche bag,

1501
01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:43.580
but you can't deny that.

1502
01:21:43.581 --> 01:21:46.980
But the huge numbers of Douche bags we have in this country,

1503
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.770
it's not saying America is an awesome,
it's not saying that I don't love living,

1504
01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.491
but individually,

1505
01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:54.240
but you click too many people together to become one big douchebag Auto Bot,

1506
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:56.130
you know,
or yeah,
yeah.

1507
01:21:56.131 --> 01:21:59.550
Wherever it just clicks in and then suddenly you hit that common dinner.

1508
01:21:59.551 --> 01:22:02.100
You ever think about living somewhere else other than la?
All the time.

1509
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:06.780
My parents just bought a in in Detroit where I'm from,
30 acres pine tree,

1510
01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:11.720
50 Bucks,
110,000 it denied 90 stall.

1511
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:14.220
Indoor riding likes almost like a hockey arena.

1512
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:17.880
Indoor heated that you can ride your horses 90 stalls.

1513
01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:21.000
Nice house pine trees for like $110,000.

1514
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:25.770
My storage unit that I pay for in Los Angeles costs more.
Yeah.

1515
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:30.660
You know,
when you start thinking that I have been,
that's got like a,
the more,

1516
01:22:30.661 --> 01:22:32.370
cause my dad has a shooting range out there.

1517
01:22:32.371 --> 01:22:36.300
He put in like sh I love guns and we go out there and dogs run around and you

1518
01:22:36.301 --> 01:22:38.670
shoot stuff.
And what I'm thinking is just,
you don't,

1519
01:22:38.671 --> 01:22:39.840
you're never even home anyway.

1520
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:43.680
I've been on the road since November every and nobody I know hustles more than

1521
01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:47.940
half Ron.
That's what I came up with.
A,
you know,
you're out there every day.
Yeah.

1522
01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:49.600
Yeah.
So now your web browser,

1523
01:22:49.601 --> 01:22:53.760
it just stinks cause you've been overthinking your browser history.
And I offer,

1524
01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.950
so I've had a joke in my act for ever and it just kind of out of context when I

1525
01:22:58.951 --> 01:23:03.600
say w,
uh,
when your wife sees that you have zero Internet history,

1526
01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:06.280
she knows something's up.
Well that's your wife checking

1527
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.460
<v 5>your phone.
No,
it's not.
It's not a,
it's a fake bit.
It's not a legitimate,</v>

1528
01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.420
you know,
tell that Bitch,
oh,
I've done that before.
We go.
And then I go,

1529
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:17.620
they should have a,
a browser that has fake sites.
So because sometimes in the,

1530
01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:21.400
in the,
due to the Joel Gray,
it's Bluetooth or you go and save the world.

1531
01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:23.260
Dot Org automatically pops up,
right?

1532
01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:26.230
So I was sitting in a hotel room by myself once,

1533
01:23:26.231 --> 01:23:27.790
eating donuts and stuff and went,

1534
01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:32.360
there's gotta be a way to actually make this as a browser.
And A,

1535
01:23:32.361 --> 01:23:33.340
and by the way,

1536
01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:36.070
I was talking to somebody about it and they were saying some Chi was at a

1537
01:23:36.071 --> 01:23:36.880
convention.

1538
01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:41.170
He know when he's got his computer hooked up to where 600 people could see.

1539
01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:46.120
And he starts typing like whatever the his program is,
you know,
to show people.

1540
01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:46.900
And uh,

1541
01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:51.900
all the history of like uga.com let me know all popped up for all these people

1542
01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:53.230
to see.
So anyway,

1543
01:23:53.231 --> 01:23:58.231
so I created this web browser called history rewrite where you can be on any

1544
01:23:58.331 --> 01:24:03.331
website and you all Wyatt and one of our preloaded sites automatically pops up.

1545
01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:07.360
So I created this a browse,
a friend of mine,
like a guy who does it.

1546
01:24:07.361 --> 01:24:10.720
So you have the idea.
So you went to history rewrite.com you'll see it.
Yeah.

1547
01:24:10.721 --> 01:24:14.230
So I went to him and I go,
is this hard to do?
Is this?
He goes,
oh,

1548
01:24:14.231 --> 01:24:17.500
that should know that's a a white list.
And he started explaining,
he goes,

1549
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.660
I think I can do this.
So we did it.

1550
01:24:19.661 --> 01:24:24.661
So and then so what it does is it blows out your history and the throws 20 sites

1551
01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:27.580
in there.
Right.
So it's never completely empty.

1552
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:29.040
<v 3>Right.
And did you choose the site?</v>

1553
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:31.420
<v 5>Yeah,
yeah.
We picked the sites just to see if it worked.</v>

1554
01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:34.850
But now like we can change them up and stop forgetting to make them funny.

1555
01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:38.000
<v 0>He never put this funny thing happened to me in it.
No,</v>

1556
01:24:38.001 --> 01:24:40.980
you don't put that down with your porn stars and shit.

1557
01:24:40.981 --> 01:24:44.370
Your selfish ass defeating the whole purpose.
It's not bad.

1558
01:24:44.490 --> 01:24:46.770
You know he said to me once during,
shut down my account,

1559
01:24:46.771 --> 01:24:49.040
mount assholes and I was like,
why does shut down your account?

1560
01:24:49.041 --> 01:24:51.180
There's nothing or you need to do anything.
Just some,

1561
01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:54.510
some girl pulled her pants down like that's it.
Yeah,
you can even see her.

1562
01:24:54.511 --> 01:24:55.680
But he didn't tell me that.

1563
01:24:55.681 --> 01:24:59.160
Some guy had his face up this chick's ass while this was going.

1564
01:24:59.161 --> 01:25:01.860
She pulled her pants down,
he stuffed his face in her ass.
I'm like,
oh,

1565
01:25:01.861 --> 01:25:05.590
he ate her ass on camera.
Oh,
wonder why he wouldn't,
you know,

1566
01:25:05.610 --> 01:25:09.000
wonder why they wouldn't want to have that displayed throughout offices with the

1567
01:25:09.001 --> 01:25:12.930
big Ustream labeled the bottom of it.
She had a thong on and he was just kissing.

1568
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:16.620
Dude,
it doesn't matter.
You can't be eating someone's ass in an office.

1569
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:19.500
You walk in,
if you're walking and you know,

1570
01:25:19.501 --> 01:25:22.290
we're watching this podcast and you know you're working and you're supposed to

1571
01:25:22.291 --> 01:25:25.290
be doing something.
You've got this in a small window in the corner.

1572
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.801
You know what I mean?

1573
01:25:25.801 --> 01:25:28.350
But you're doing all your paperwork and everything and I just listen.
He's guys,

1574
01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:30.780
no big deal.
That's fine.
Until you walk in,

1575
01:25:30.781 --> 01:25:34.200
you see some girl's ass and some guys get his face burden.

1576
01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:37.120
<v 3>Yeah.
And then you watch Andy Dick and he has his dick hanging out,</v>

1577
01:25:37.121 --> 01:25:39.550
slapping some guy in the face with it and you're like,
okay,

1578
01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:43.120
how is he like listed as top hit on Ustream?

1579
01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:45.220
<v 5>What are you talking about?</v>

1580
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.110
<v 3>Have you seen any of Andy Dixie stream videos?</v>

1581
01:25:47.111 --> 01:25:50.050
Pulls his dick out and the couple I saw he was,

1582
01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:54.420
it was a slapping some dude in the face with his dick.
No.
Did she have no,
no.

1583
01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:56.350
Swear to God.
I saw with my own eyes.

1584
01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:04.070
<v 0>But let's say you're at Twitter.
Twitter,
please,
please verify.
I did not</v>

1585
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.730
<v 5>have time to Google this.
Certain things I just,</v>

1586
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:10.310
I don't have too much dignity to Google.

1587
01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:14.170
So we came up with that with the browser.
The guy did it.
We,

1588
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:18.740
we throw it out there just to see and tested it and stuff and we had like a lot

1589
01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:20.150
of people download it and the first I don't,

1590
01:26:20.151 --> 01:26:23.190
I don't promote it looks pretty cool.
Yeah,
it's like a cool idea.

1591
01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:28.100
It only does two things.
Like I've had some people go,

1592
01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.010
you should have it two more.
No,
it's only there for,

1593
01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:35.080
we make it as simple as possible.
We have,
you know,

1594
01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:38.720
we're upgrading it where you can put insights you want to be able to get,

1595
01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.520
but that,
you know,

1596
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:43.180
they just took a little bit of a learning charge on this thing about free.

1597
01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:44.420
If look at you,

1598
01:26:44.421 --> 01:26:47.510
you're just trying to help manage this and it gives me something to talk about

1599
01:26:47.511 --> 01:26:50.630
when I'm on radio.
But it also,
yeah,
that's a good idea.

1600
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:55.730
It serves a purpose and it's a thing and you helping push you with men.

1601
01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:59.760
They post it up on people.
I always get people go,
well,
no,
because let's say,

1602
01:26:59.761 --> 01:27:03.920
but let's say you're going to the hooker.
No,
let's see.

1603
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:06.010
Ah,
you know,

1604
01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:09.970
surprise party for my wife and your wife was a come home and see you.

1605
01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:14.630
You're looking them.
I tried to mask it and my wife comes home and she sees it,

1606
01:27:14.631 --> 01:27:17.490
goes through my browser and says,
I can't believe you were trying to,

1607
01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.210
trying to make a surprise party for him.
I'd be like,
Bitch,

1608
01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:23.630
why you looking at my fucking computer?
But now she'll go,
oh,

1609
01:27:23.631 --> 01:27:26.960
I saw you bought John Hough.
You went to John Hepburn website.
Does he like,
yeah,

1610
01:27:26.961 --> 01:27:30.770
so which,
which I was gonna put you guys in there.
I don't think I did this one.

1611
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:31.623
Yeah.

1612
01:27:32.710 --> 01:27:35.110
Do you ever come home and your wife is looking through your fucking computer?

1613
01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:37.940
I got my own computer.
Does she ever look through your computer?

1614
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:41.240
I would have never sees his wife.
Yeah,
I would.
I would imagine she she,

1615
01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:46.160
she probably,
you know thing.
It's on the old dude's so fucking confident.

1616
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:50.140
How do I know Brian is Brian?
Set up cameras at your have bags.

1617
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:53.350
I'll show you the tapes.
Cameras.
It's just an easy install.

1618
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.300
You can wait to say why of my wife's by going hilarious.

1619
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:02.780
Today's been bananas.

1620
01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:11.280
So dog,
particularly

1621
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:19.490
funny
ever.
You've never caught your wife fucking around with your computer.

1622
01:28:20.710 --> 01:28:23.450
It's not like the number one way people get caught is or on Facebook.

1623
01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.480
You can't have a relationship.
I know a guy who got his,

1624
01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:31.340
his girl looked at his status and his profile and saw he was looking at an ex

1625
01:28:31.341 --> 01:28:34.190
girlfriend something and cheating.
She can't him.

1626
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:36.490
If he would have had my history right to look at it,

1627
01:28:36.491 --> 01:28:39.320
that wouldn't have been a problem because he was looking at his ex girlfriends

1628
01:28:39.321 --> 01:28:42.050
history.
Why wait till you just like,
wow,
this is a crazy bitch.
Got Fat.

1629
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.870
How can we can look at that?
That's what it is for kids,
man.

1630
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:48.630
How come we can't do that?
That's ridiculous.
What would it mean?

1631
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:51.170
I don't get that cause I think once in a while you should be allowed to just

1632
01:28:51.171 --> 01:28:53.870
check your ex girlfriend.
That makes sir.
Hey,
see what's going on man.

1633
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:56.600
It's no big deal,
dude.
Let,
unless you check your ex girlfriend,

1634
01:28:56.601 --> 01:28:59.030
then you get mad at your wife.
Look the fuck you know.

1635
01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:01.950
You don't even fucking appreciate me guys

1636
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.130
<v 0>start saying shit like that.
John had fun.</v>

1637
01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:07.830
I think we cleared up a lot of things about you today.
Yeah,
for you.

1638
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:10.440
Here's what I'm doing.
I'm not.
I'm going to make you feel good about all this.

1639
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:13.770
I feel good.
I'm going to let it go.
I'm at Saint Louis this week.

1640
01:29:13.771 --> 01:29:17.230
Whatever the guidance is in St Louis,
I'm going to bite my lip and not yet where?

1641
01:29:17.231 --> 01:29:21.900
Yeah,
it's a funny bone.
The funny bone and Saint Louis.
And what days?

1642
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:27.120
I'm there tomorrow,
which tomorrow?
Thursday the 20th through Sunday.
Oh Shit.

1643
01:29:27.121 --> 01:29:30.090
You do the full week?
Huh?
Sunday three shows Saturday,

1644
01:29:30.091 --> 01:29:32.130
but I'm moved three shows on Saturday.
No,

1645
01:29:32.131 --> 01:29:36.000
I moved the third show Saturday to Sunday.
Double Tion Double Sunday,

1646
01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:38.160
so I wouldn't have to,
but then now I'm like,
Oh,

1647
01:29:38.161 --> 01:29:41.850
I could've been home Sunday Monday to Friday.
Oh,
I see.

1648
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:44.160
So instead of double Sunday,
you just have one on Sunday.

1649
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:46.640
I pushed through because then,
yeah,
but you don't want to do,

1650
01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:49.350
you're better off doing that because it ain't bad to have that extra day.

1651
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:53.370
And I'll tell you what,
that third show,
his death,
that third Saturday show.

1652
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:57.210
That's too much.
Yeah.
And it's nice.
Not my crowd.
It's okay to go,
you know,

1653
01:29:57.211 --> 01:30:01.170
buddies crowd,
maybe Stan hope it's the his crowd for 20 minutes.

1654
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:05.820
When you do what?
You do three shows on Saturday.
It's nobody's crowd after the,

1655
01:30:05.821 --> 01:30:07.650
by the time the headliner gets onstage,

1656
01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.250
it's nobody's crowd that that show is dead.
People are tired manner,

1657
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:14.670
especially on Saturday night,
man,
you've been drinking.
You got the day off.

1658
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:16.950
By the time Saturday night,
if you have a midnight show,

1659
01:30:16.951 --> 01:30:20.160
you're not going to show up at midnight.
Man,
you're going to go to a bar first.

1660
01:30:20.161 --> 01:30:21.600
You're going to go meet your friends at a bar.

1661
01:30:21.601 --> 01:30:23.930
Let's have a couple of beers are you want to get in line?
All right,

1662
01:30:23.931 --> 01:30:26.460
let's get in line.
You sit down,
you started ordering more beers.

1663
01:30:26.461 --> 01:30:28.500
By the time the show runs around your fucking tired.

1664
01:30:29.010 --> 01:30:32.670
I don't think I've ever seen a fight not go down at a midnight show and

1665
01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.690
especially there.
And that was the last plug that you could smoke St Louis.
Yeah,

1666
01:30:36.691 --> 01:30:38.160
it was the last club you can smoke in.

1667
01:30:38.161 --> 01:30:41.880
So even up until last year you would show up and it'd be Alaska in the country.

1668
01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:46.770
I was still smoking Dallas,
one of the ones I buy.

1669
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:50.430
Right?
That's right.
The last time we were there,
I was making fun of them.

1670
01:30:50.431 --> 01:30:53.880
Like how ridiculous that works.
Doesn't it seem like 1970 she's archaic,

1671
01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:57.440
especially Dallas Tech.
What I like about Texas is that the,

1672
01:30:57.441 --> 01:30:59.810
the whole attitude of Texas,
like get the fuck out.

1673
01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:03.630
It's about going to do whatever we want.
It said,
Texas is the shit.
I love Texas.

1674
01:31:03.631 --> 01:31:05.280
I was just,
I was like,
if I lived there,

1675
01:31:05.281 --> 01:31:07.520
I'd be halfway to every place I got to go.
Yeah.

1676
01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:11.860
But the problem is they got some archaic,
we'd laws the we'd love to think about.

1677
01:31:11.861 --> 01:31:15.120
So what do you always say that Willie Nelson got arrested?
Okay,

1678
01:31:15.121 --> 01:31:18.930
Austin's fucking taking ounces on the road while traveling in a van still

1679
01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:23.160
ridiculous.
They pull you over and go looking for it.
Man.
You hear what he got?

1680
01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.680
His payback was what the court did.
Right.

1681
01:31:25.681 --> 01:31:28.110
But that's also because they've got a ton of negative publicity.

1682
01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.120
There's a ton of people were like the fuck man,
you're,

1683
01:31:30.121 --> 01:31:32.250
you're arresting Willie Nelson.
And so the guy said,
look,

1684
01:31:32.251 --> 01:31:34.750
his punishment and he has to sing a song.
I'm a huge Willie Nelson Fan,

1685
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:37.650
so that's kind of funny.
That's so,
that's not crazy.

1686
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:40.560
Stils got to go to this guy's fucking courthouse and sing a song.

1687
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.730
How about you leave me alone.

1688
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:45.090
How about he doesn't have to sing a song for you for free gangster,
you know,

1689
01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:48.610
you fucking asshole.
Some old man wants to feel happy by,
you know,

1690
01:31:48.630 --> 01:31:52.920
enjoying a plant that grows naturally.
You [inaudible] you know,
I don't,

1691
01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:56.500
I'm not down with those stupid laws.
There's great parts of Texas.

1692
01:31:56.501 --> 01:32:00.640
There's like Dallas is bad ass.
I love Houston.
I Love Austin.
Austin.

1693
01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:02.140
It would be my number one place to live.

1694
01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.930
But the problem is those surrounding areas,
man,

1695
01:32:04.931 --> 01:32:09.160
they take white trash to a new level,
man.
They got that.

1696
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:13.900
Those black people dragging behind trucks.
White people,
right?

1697
01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:16.500
Remember that?
Remember that when that shit happen and those a,

1698
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:21.050
that was some weird fucking little suburb.
There was some weird,
you know,
outline.

1699
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:25.750
I forget what part of Texas that happened.
And do you remember?
No.
But either way,

1700
01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:28.750
you know,
there's,
there's a bunch of weird spots,

1701
01:32:28.751 --> 01:32:33.250
Waco and all that shit with the branch Davidians went down.
Texas is strange.

1702
01:32:33.251 --> 01:32:37.390
And I thought about Nashville cause you're,
you're 30 and literally to every,

1703
01:32:37.391 --> 01:32:40.970
and then I'm like,
man,
wait till I ever moved back to Michigan and just,
you know,

1704
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:45.760
get a fucking cold dude.
Yeah.
The winner,
I couldn't get used to.
So it crazy.

1705
01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:49.980
Austin,
Texas is the shit the other to me,
yes.

1706
01:32:50.050 --> 01:32:53.390
San Diego possible all throughout California and Northern California.

1707
01:32:53.391 --> 01:32:56.680
They sent you live a little different area than me and we don't live that far

1708
01:32:56.681 --> 01:32:59.950
apart.
Yeah.
I live further out than you.
Yeah,
just by a few miles.

1709
01:32:59.951 --> 01:33:03.160
But it's amazing.
It's quiet and it's peaceful.
It is out here to me.

1710
01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:06.100
There's too many God damn people.
I feel like I'm in the middle of a beehive.

1711
01:33:06.101 --> 01:33:10.210
I'm just as,
especially as I've gotten older and I've smoked more weed,

1712
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:12.340
I become more sensitive to energy.

1713
01:33:12.341 --> 01:33:15.790
I've become more sensitive to like what input we can deal with my neighbors.

1714
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:19.130
Your dogs are barking,
really.
I'm not,
you know,
and all that shit.
Yeah.

1715
01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:20.710
You're got to deal with a lot of shit,
man.

1716
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:22.500
You have to deal with a lot of shit that's just part of,

1717
01:33:22.501 --> 01:33:26.760
of living near a bunch of people and you something about downtime and you and

1718
01:33:26.761 --> 01:33:28.690
you're on the road,
you're doing shows,

1719
01:33:28.691 --> 01:33:32.410
it's airplanes filled with people and it's airports filled with people and it's

1720
01:33:32.411 --> 01:33:35.350
hotels filled with people and it shows filled with people.

1721
01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.450
And then the downtime when you get home,
it's not necessarily downtime.

1722
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:43.600
And when you have that,
it's like you're,
you're always running at like high rpms.

1723
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:46.300
Like the reason why I moved to the woods and Colorado,

1724
01:33:46.301 --> 01:33:50.230
like I had to try to explain this to my wife,
like why I wanted to live there,

1725
01:33:50.231 --> 01:33:52.480
why it was great for me.
What I enjoyed about it,
you know,

1726
01:33:52.481 --> 01:33:56.380
it's not like I'm crazy.
I'm not ready to go fucking,
you know.

1727
01:33:57.570 --> 01:34:00.550
Yeah.
I'm not,
I'm not ready to go a Unabomber.

1728
01:34:00.610 --> 01:34:04.060
I'm just saying I liked a little nature in my world.

1729
01:34:04.061 --> 01:34:06.610
I need to balance things out.
I like some peace and quiet,

1730
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.410
but to her it was like living in that is the whole reality.
You know?

1731
01:34:11.411 --> 01:34:13.930
She's not doing shows.
She's not doing the UFC.
You know what I mean?

1732
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:16.090
She's a normal human.
She doesn't,
you know,

1733
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:21.270
so to her it's like maybe this is a little too much isolated and then you deal

1734
01:34:21.731 --> 01:34:23.760
with some of those Weirdos and that fucking town.
You know,

1735
01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:27.430
if you're going to live with,
you know,
a couple of hundred people in a mountain,

1736
01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:32.200
guess what?
Those,
those people are going to be strange as fuck.
You know,

1737
01:34:32.201 --> 01:34:34.210
there's some probably some interesting writers.

1738
01:34:34.211 --> 01:34:35.770
I lived down the street from an Osh Rom.

1739
01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:39.130
There was a real ashram where people would just fuck it meditating all day.

1740
01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:42.200
I wasn't,
I was looking into though,
shit you were looking into though.

1741
01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:45.500
What are you going to do?
I found out it's a three day,
um,

1742
01:34:46.410 --> 01:34:50.980
dongle with magazine.
It's like a three day silence thing where all you do,

1743
01:34:51.130 --> 01:34:54.400
it's probably the,
it was in Colorado.
It's probably read days of silence.

1744
01:34:54.401 --> 01:34:57.010
You've got to rock three days and no talking about it's impossible for you.

1745
01:34:57.170 --> 01:35:00.230
You also have a 10 day one and then,
but it's that you meditate.

1746
01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:02.900
I don't know if you're allowed to talk to people at the thing or if it's

1747
01:35:02.901 --> 01:35:04.790
completely silent,
silent.
Well,
you know,

1748
01:35:04.791 --> 01:35:08.630
I have sleep apnea and I was thinking about getting an operation.

1749
01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:10.250
You cannot wear a mouthpiece.
When I go to sleep,

1750
01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:14.810
I put a blog up about it on my website and I went to a sleep study.

1751
01:35:14.811 --> 01:35:17.120
I have a big tongue,
I have a really fat tongue,

1752
01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.660
and I have my tonsils and adenoids are still in.
And when I lie back,

1753
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:25.240
my tongue closes over the roof of my mouth with some people that they have,
uh,

1754
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:26.600
issues with.
Um,

1755
01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.080
some people have issues with sleep apnea because they're fat because you get all

1756
01:35:30.081 --> 01:35:33.580
this fat tissue.
And other athletes a lot of times get it because they,

1757
01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:37.260
their neck is thick.
And for me,
it's that,
that my neck is thick.
You know,

1758
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:40.790
I lift a lot and then,
you know,
I'm kettlebells and shit,
but also the tongue,

1759
01:35:40.791 --> 01:35:41.630
my tongue is like fat.

1760
01:35:41.631 --> 01:35:45.050
So what they do is they cut out like some of your mouth tissue and it cut out

1761
01:35:45.051 --> 01:35:49.520
your tonsils and your adenoids.
I know this dude.
Um,
uh,
uh,

1762
01:35:49.570 --> 01:35:52.340
what the fuck's his name?
Mr Gannon gladiator.

1763
01:35:52.341 --> 01:35:56.420
Gannett kind of dam and I can't remember his name.
Um,
he,
he had it done and uh,

1764
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:59.060
he,
uh,
he said it helped him a lot,
but if I do it,

1765
01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:04.280
the point is I can't talk for 10 days,
like for 10 whole fucking days.

1766
01:36:04.810 --> 01:36:07.520
I don't know if that'd be weird.
He'd go crazy if you had a camp though,

1767
01:36:07.521 --> 01:36:10.160
for three days where you're just not allowed to that.
Excuse me.

1768
01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:14.330
What's that sound?
The background,
ladies and gentlemen.
That sounds enlightenment.

1769
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.420
That's what that is.
That's the vaporizers.
Air Conditioning.
Networking.

1770
01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:22.090
Is that what it is?
It's hot in here.
What I have to tell you about,
are you?

1771
01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.400
Hi Jonathan.
Sweating.
But I don't know if it's because a,

1772
01:36:24.401 --> 01:36:29.060
I'm having a heart attack or something,
but it's hot in here.
Well,

1773
01:36:29.061 --> 01:36:32.960
it also could be the fact that you were drinking coffee,
man.
You know,

1774
01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:38.330
it's so hot that water drops going down in the crack of your back and they

1775
01:36:38.331 --> 01:36:42.150
actually feels refreshing.
Here we go.
Great.
Yeah,
those feel good.
Correct water.

1776
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:47.240
My chrome browser is taking a shit on me.
You need to get John's blog.
Yeah,

1777
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:49.460
I think I do history rewrite.

1778
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:54.410
I'm just happy they actually had an idea and it through with it and got it done.

1779
01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:55.130
Uh,
you know,

1780
01:36:55.130 --> 01:36:58.910
I've had 8 billion cure for cancer ideas that I've never really done.

1781
01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.460
This is the start of a new John Heffron

1782
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.410
startup as far as wide internet suffer actually as far as getting shit done.

1783
01:37:08.411 --> 01:37:09.001
But again,
shift.

1784
01:37:09.001 --> 01:37:12.650
Donna got a script done and I've been really kind of visualizing doing some

1785
01:37:12.651 --> 01:37:15.260
stuff to,
you know,
script for a movie.
Yeah.
It's just uh,

1786
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:18.050
it's always something I've always been a free make people read it and please say

1787
01:37:18.051 --> 01:37:22.190
no.
Um,
no,
but it was interesting.
I didn't ask any of my friends to do it,

1788
01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:25.670
but it's interesting the friends of mine that I've read 8 billion or their

1789
01:37:25.671 --> 01:37:30.050
script cost suddenly,
so it's kind of like a test or to see,
okay,

1790
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:33.800
I'm weeding out some of the people in my life that,
that was a good thing.

1791
01:37:33.801 --> 01:37:37.910
I haven't asked anybody to read anything of mine really.
For the most part.

1792
01:37:37.911 --> 01:37:41.060
That's annoying as fuck,
but I haven't done,
you know what I mean?

1793
01:37:41.061 --> 01:37:44.300
I would never go to,
hey,
can you sign it or cause,
but I will.

1794
01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.030
I mean there's companies that like after we did it that I,
I paid just in,

1795
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:52.520
they give you like script that I don't feel bad about because you paid them to

1796
01:37:52.521 --> 01:37:55.040
review it more than my friends.
That's,

1797
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.880
<v 5>yeah,
a lot of that,
you know,
it's like,
it's if boys,
we added,</v>

1798
01:37:59.890 --> 01:38:01.860
some guy asked me to read a script once and I'm like,
dude,

1799
01:38:01.861 --> 01:38:04.680
you're asking me for an hour and a half of my time.
I don't even know you.

1800
01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.960
That's a lot of God damn time.
I don't have that much time in a day.
You know?

1801
01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.200
If you want me to really read it and pay attention to it,

1802
01:38:10.201 --> 01:38:12.080
it's an hour and a half.
That's isn't it?

1803
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.130
That's a ridiculous question to ask someone.

1804
01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:16.780
But how else do you get someone to read your script?
You know,

1805
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:21.240
you've got to get either fuck,
but what do they do a good job?

1806
01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:24.330
Like what does it look?
Do you get it back and,
and go fucking look at you.

1807
01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:28.400
You want to be great.
You know,
like my stuff,
they review it.
Yeah.

1808
01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:31.380
You almost get like a grade and like this part didn't make no sense in you go,

1809
01:38:31.410 --> 01:38:34.230
okay.
You know what I mean?
I'll take those notes and blah blah blah.

1810
01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:37.670
So I'm getting that done.
Working on a book with the,
uh,

1811
01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:42.090
a doctor friend of mine out of Chicago,
a doctor's a shrink.

1812
01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:45.390
He's written a lot of books on psychology and comic.
You're,

1813
01:38:45.391 --> 01:38:47.970
you're working on a psychology book.
Yeah.

1814
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:51.090
It's like Christie Allie working on a weight loss book,
right?
Yes,
yes.

1815
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:56.140
Um,
but it's uh,
just kind of you,

1816
01:38:56.141 --> 01:38:58.500
you have a degree in psychology and have a thing.
Yeah.

1817
01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:02.430
Bachelors bs degree when I was going to college,
so I'm doing stuff.

1818
01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.500
And so what does this book about?
Um,

1819
01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:07.540
he's written a lot of books on like Farley and blue and wide comics,

1820
01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:09.680
self destruct,
you'd think,
you know what I mean?
And,

1821
01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:15.140
and so he also does a lot of cognitive therapy stuff and comics are really good

1822
01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:18.360
at reframing shitty situations in their life.

1823
01:39:18.361 --> 01:39:22.200
And blowing them so far out of proportion where a lot of people have that

1824
01:39:22.201 --> 01:39:24.660
trouble as so when comics are like,
so I just broke up with my girl,

1825
01:39:24.661 --> 01:39:27.660
just lost my job.
Some people take stuff so seriously,

1826
01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:31.860
they can't see this crazy kind of blown up thing that comics do.

1827
01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:36.270
So there's a therapy and psychology that shows people how to do that.

1828
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.410
So we've taken parts of my act and you and I talk about how I write and how

1829
01:39:40.411 --> 01:39:42.660
everything comes from something shit in my life and how you,

1830
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.920
how you kind of get that perspective on.
She's so hot.
Who,
oh,

1831
01:39:46.921 --> 01:39:50.400
this is a different one.
This is different than then that doctor,

1832
01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:53.400
how are you hanging out with all these doctors?
It was hot doctors.
You know what?

1833
01:39:53.401 --> 01:39:56.260
Psychology stuff,
Dr v that

1834
01:39:57.890 --> 01:40:01.240
is gorgeous.
You're living a porno film on the tongue.

1835
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:05.550
Dr Tinger got something wrong.
My Dick,
they see,
oh shit.

1836
01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:09.360
That's,
so you've got to go out of good shit going on.

1837
01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:10.651
People want to get ahold of you.

1838
01:40:10.651 --> 01:40:14.940
They go to John heffron.com go John hepburn.com all this stuff.
Two F's,
two F's,

1839
01:40:14.941 --> 01:40:19.490
half wrong.com,
and then it has links to everything else.

1840
01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:22.070
If you want,
you know,
Lee's book,
Twitter.

1841
01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.880
Um,
I think I'm on to,

1842
01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:30.000
I enjoy Twitter probably more than you know,

1843
01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:34.020
and I enjoy Twitter.
I,
my my,
you know,
I'm not,
I don't plug a lot of stuff.

1844
01:40:34.021 --> 01:40:38.940
I'd probably 90% reach waiting trying to say some funny and the now in

1845
01:40:38.941 --> 01:40:43.240
occasional,
you know,
occasional plugs.
So you respect people's attention span.

1846
01:40:43.241 --> 01:40:46.040
So you say funny shit on Twitter all the time.
Yeah.
And um,
you know,
I know,

1847
01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:49.380
but I liked that.
I sit there with my tweet deck and I'll click on,

1848
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:53.160
you'll see like I clicked on something you did like about the,
there's no time

1849
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.490
<v 0>for like some of the stuff that you,
yeah,
I retweet a lot of fascinating stuff.</v>

1850
01:40:57.570 --> 01:40:59.890
A lot of tightening was fucking amazing.

1851
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:04.150
There's a video of a dude getting hit by lightning twice and then I constantly

1852
01:41:04.151 --> 01:41:07.210
clicking.
I don't know what's real.
Brian's cat on his office chair.

1853
01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.840
I've probably seen,
okay,
this guy just said totally fake.
That's what,
you know,

1854
01:41:10.841 --> 01:41:13.570
a lot of people say that,
but I don't know pretty real to me.

1855
01:41:13.571 --> 01:41:16.660
But who knows you I totally fake all the,
there's,

1856
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:19.880
there's enough shit that's real.
I mean,
I,

1857
01:41:19.890 --> 01:41:22.950
I believe that they would fake enlightening thing.
Yeah,
for sure.
But well,

1858
01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:26.200
it's easy to film that.
That's,
that's it.
That was an easy edit.

1859
01:41:26.230 --> 01:41:28.520
If like I could reenact that one simple,
right.

1860
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:32.410
Just make the guy fall down and then just make a burn mark cut easy.

1861
01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:37.540
It looked good though.
It was just enough.
It's always granny security film,
like,

1862
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:41.920
you know,
stuff like that.
That's true.
You follow Alyssa Milano on Twitter?
Nope.

1863
01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.020
I don't think so.
I made a B.
I used to,
I weeded out a lot of my Twitter people.

1864
01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:50.800
I just get tired of listening to nonsense and that's probably a lot of people.

1865
01:41:51.090 --> 01:41:54.790
That'll be,
we'll probably weeded out me too.
But uh,
I uh,
some people will like,

1866
01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:56.620
let you know I'm unfollowing Oh,

1867
01:41:56.621 --> 01:41:58.750
I got a bunch of people unfollowed me the other day.

1868
01:41:58.810 --> 01:42:02.320
This is what I wanted to talk about.
A bunch of people got mad at me,
man,

1869
01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.210
because I said something about Easter.
This is no bullshit.

1870
01:42:07.211 --> 01:42:11.950
I'm going to read this just because it's so fucking silly.
Like this is okay.

1871
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:16.420
I gotta I gotta go back and find it because I couldn't believe that people were

1872
01:42:16.421 --> 01:42:19.300
actually getting upset by this.
Um,

1873
01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:24.430
but the big thing that people kept saying is that I wasn't being classy because

1874
01:42:24.431 --> 01:42:28.510
it was Easter.
You know that it was also gay sex day where you have gay sex.

1875
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:33.250
Can I interject one thing?
Here's one.
Here's one guy says,
okay,
hold on,

1876
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.113
let me get the A.

1877
01:42:35.190 --> 01:42:35.810
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1878
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:40.810
<v 0>See the original tweet.
Okay,</v>

1879
01:42:40.811 --> 01:42:43.210
I can't find the original tweet.
Oh,
here it is.
Dear time,

1880
01:42:43.211 --> 01:42:46.270
traveling historians in the future trying to make sense of Easter,

1881
01:42:46.271 --> 01:42:49.960
let it go and have some chocolate and no one understands it.
That's all I said.

1882
01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:54.940
That's all I said.
Let it go and have some chocolate to time traveling and story.

1883
01:42:54.970 --> 01:42:57.550
Nothing.
Right?
And so I hear not cool man,

1884
01:42:57.670 --> 01:43:01.900
making fun of Cra Christ and Christians on the holiest of days.
Can't you leave?

1885
01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:06.170
You can't leave it alone.
Can you,
and I'm a fan of yours.
Wow.
Like,

1886
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:09.220
like whoa.
So I quote,

1887
01:43:09.221 --> 01:43:12.850
so I tweet all you silly fucks that are actually upset at someone is making fun

1888
01:43:12.851 --> 01:43:16.780
of zombies and giant rabbits.
You need mushrooms in your life.
So,

1889
01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:22.240
and then I get just attack after attack.
People attacking me for retweeting him.

1890
01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.840
Yeah.
Leave him out there so your fans and quotes can attack.

1891
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:27.790
You know this other fan and I was like,

1892
01:43:27.791 --> 01:43:31.180
I didn't tell people what to say about this.
I didn't tell you.
I just want to,

1893
01:43:31.181 --> 01:43:35.950
I just want you to see the kind of craziness that I get when I say dear time

1894
01:43:35.951 --> 01:43:39.820
traveling historians don't try to figure out east or just have some chocolate

1895
01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:44.020
like that offends you.
And a bunch of people like a,

1896
01:43:44.021 --> 01:43:47.140
doesn't use the word classy.
Like yeah,

1897
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:52.130
we'll see classy making fun of Christ on Easter.
Like,
well I'm not making

1898
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:56.870
<v 5>fun.
I'm going to
see the most shit in the world.
Well,</v>

1899
01:43:56.871 --> 01:44:00.410
the gimme names are so focused on all the negative and they're supposed to be

1900
01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:04.100
religious with the people that were doing this all had this one hashtag in their

1901
01:44:04.101 --> 01:44:08.600
sentence.
He is risen in quotes.
He is risen like,
like a bone or what?

1902
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:11.260
No,
no.
Like a boner.
But that would be fun to take it.

1903
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:15.790
The reason for the gay sexiest day ever.
Yeah,

1904
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:18.080
I'm into my cave.
Yeah.

1905
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.880
Let me move this rock for risen.
Can I just randomly,
I just got a tweet.

1906
01:44:25.881 --> 01:44:30.110
Somebody,
you know,
we were talking about my thing in some kid goes,
uh,

1907
01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:35.090
says,
okay,
this song's tool.
But what about private browsing?

1908
01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:38.750
Every browser has it.
Sorry.
Dumb idea.
Can I say some?
Yeah.

1909
01:44:38.751 --> 01:44:40.760
Every browser has private browsing.

1910
01:44:40.761 --> 01:44:44.330
But the deal is when you hit that you have zero in your Internet history.
No,
no,

1911
01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:44.691
no,
no.

1912
01:44:44.691 --> 01:44:48.950
What private browsing it also does is it also just stops anything you're doing,

1913
01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:53.560
but you have to constantly mind been there.
Turn it on,
turn off an alibi.
Right.

1914
01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:55.490
So if you're on the Internet for two hours,

1915
01:44:55.491 --> 01:44:57.360
you're not going to have zero Internet.
Right.

1916
01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.570
And it's going to say use young kids and want married.

1917
01:44:59.571 --> 01:45:03.860
I have no idea what kind of level.
Sorry,

1918
01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:08.450
I do that.
That is a really ridiculous thing to have to worry about,
isn't it?

1919
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:13.460
You're not allowed to look at things.
I don't trust you yet.
What are you crazy?

1920
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:15.980
What are you out there looking at what you're interested in?

1921
01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:20.570
I want you to keep your mind in line with my feelings.
That's why I like

1922
01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.250
the sweatshirt.
You like girls that look at worship than,
yeah,

1923
01:45:25.251 --> 01:45:26.900
that girls that like their browser.

1924
01:45:26.901 --> 01:45:29.770
Internet history is way more shocking than mine.

1925
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:33.830
He came home and you'd girl was masturbating to gay porn.

1926
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:37.620
She does all the time.
No,
God,
God,

1927
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.080
gay gay porn is not girls going at it,
going at it.
It's just porn.

1928
01:45:42.081 --> 01:45:45.560
It's his girl on girl porn and gay porn.

1929
01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:47.990
What would you do if you came home to one dude?

1930
01:45:47.991 --> 01:45:51.320
It's just fucking some guy and she's fingering herself.
She thinks it's hot.

1931
01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.960
I would just start struck and my shaft and you're so close.

1932
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:59.090
You're so gross.
There's something.

1933
01:45:59.091 --> 01:46:03.860
Would you be looking at [inaudible] my shaft of my,
please don't.

1934
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.530
It'd be classy.
Classy,
classy.

1935
01:46:09.670 --> 01:46:13.610
So some people can say things and they say it a certain way or in the same
words,

1936
01:46:13.770 --> 01:46:18.750
right?
You lose a lot in texts,
you know,
until you really do,
you know,
I mean,

1937
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:22.370
if you're reading a script for a porno and the guy was trying to fuck his wife

1938
01:46:22.371 --> 01:46:26.480
on the ass and is,
and it says,
you want to put in my ass,

1939
01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:30.830
oh my God,
we can't know there's,
that's,

1940
01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:33.320
that's just unscript you know,
just written.

1941
01:46:33.650 --> 01:46:36.290
But you could have it two different ways.
Like I'm going to put it my ass.

1942
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:41.110
Oh my God.
No.
Like that girl wants a dick in her ass.
All right.

1943
01:46:41.111 --> 01:46:46.040
That's all the tone.
The tone or it can be,
you want to put it in my ass.
Watch.
No,

1944
01:46:46.041 --> 01:46:49.230
we can't.
No,
that's an angry girl.
She's angry

1945
01:46:50.230 --> 01:46:53.400
<v 0>by the way.
Nothing fucks up dudes more for the rest of their life then.</v>

1946
01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:57.090
Then porn or they have anal sex because it always goes well.

1947
01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:00.600
And there's never fucking complaints.
No one's ever angry,
you know?

1948
01:47:00.601 --> 01:47:01.830
But when you bought fuck someone,

1949
01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:05.230
nine times out of 10 you go say sorry afterwards.
You know,
like,

1950
01:47:05.250 --> 01:47:09.750
I didn't know what you should've told me.
Your ass is not meant to be fucked.

1951
01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.400
You know what I learned is a few,

1952
01:47:11.401 --> 01:47:15.540
I have a finger in the girl's ass and then don't put it like take it out and put

1953
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:18.450
it in her vagina.
You didn't know that he'd dummy.
Didn't ever think about,

1954
01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:23.070
oh my God.
Did you give her a crazy funky and no,
she's making little shit babies.

1955
01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:26.610
I don't finger a lot of girls in the ass,
so I've only done a couple of times.

1956
01:47:26.611 --> 01:47:30.750
I've never really thought like,
oh yeah,
it's not a good idea.
Yay.
Yeah,
yeah.

1957
01:47:30.751 --> 01:47:32.940
A lot of people right now shutting off their fucking iPod.

1958
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:38.630
We were good for about two hours and then finally to show all this Easter toast,

1959
01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:39.840
fucking morons.

1960
01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:43.260
Bob was headlining and I was in the back right now by the sound guy.
I'm like,

1961
01:47:43.261 --> 01:47:47.160
can we like him?
Can we please?
What's he doing?
He's trained in my crowd.

1962
01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:51.930
He's making my crowd dumb.
I love,
by the way,

1963
01:47:51.931 --> 01:47:56.730
all the comments that I have a um,
some kind of social disorder.
You do.

1964
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:58.950
You really think I do.
You know me well,

1965
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.370
you know how like how you know how I act on this show?
It's completely,

1966
01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:07.260
Brian is a unusual dude.
Okay.
Nobody,
everybody's different.

1967
01:48:07.290 --> 01:48:11.090
You don't have to be around peg or a square hole,
right?
We're all different.
He's,

1968
01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:12.240
he's,
he's unusual.

1969
01:48:16.610 --> 01:48:20.250
It's kind of bad.
Pimp skills.
Give him some knuckles.
Oh,

1970
01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:25.620
does the best with the stories that make me get these girls here.
He's like,

1971
01:48:25.630 --> 01:48:27.750
I'm a retard and people feel bad for retards.

1972
01:48:27.751 --> 01:48:31.020
So they start like slowly like combing my hair and then they find out what it
is.

1973
01:48:31.230 --> 01:48:35.220
Do you feel a little retarded though?
I'll be honest.
I overdo retard on this.

1974
01:48:35.970 --> 01:48:39.090
Definitely.
It's almost like you're half playing a character.

1975
01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:43.260
I am half plank care.
I'm red band man.
I'm not.
Brian was Shelly.
Oh by the way,

1976
01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:45.000
he talked about yourself in the third person.
Well,

1977
01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:48.030
we talking to girls on the phone.
Well,
red band does.
Red Wants to do,

1978
01:48:49.190 --> 01:48:52.720
I did as a joke.
Definitely.
You don't do it.
I never see her last sanction.

1979
01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.320
Sometimes when I see you on Facebook and I'll see your full name,

1980
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:59.040
my brain doesn't connect.
Right?
So I will click on your thing.

1981
01:48:59.190 --> 01:49:03.480
Your profile will come up.
I'll see the picture of you.
Then I'll go yo,
like I,

1982
01:49:03.481 --> 01:49:06.180
that's my process.
Yeah.
There's nothing Brian,

1983
01:49:06.181 --> 01:49:08.330
your your name and I can never even know.
You know,

1984
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:10.470
there's some people that you just think of their like,

1985
01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:15.050
like one of the dudes from,
uh,
from the tap out crew.
His name's Tim,
right?

1986
01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.400
But I call him scrape cause he's always scrape.

1987
01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:21.270
So if I see Tim written somewhere on the fucking him like,
oh yeah,

1988
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:24.420
was kind of name.
It's not just scrape.
You know,

1989
01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.450
I gotta stop doing that Facebook chat and let people talk.

1990
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:31.170
It's just a waste of my time.
This is what we need to do.
No,

1991
01:49:31.171 --> 01:49:34.560
we need to get you both podcast.
Fill it with,
do a podcast.

1992
01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:36.220
It'll be the greatest thing for,
look,

1993
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:40.440
your whole thing is you don't have to be by yourself.
You look best squad,

1994
01:49:41.230 --> 01:49:44.400
extra hundred bucks every week and take some fucking kid was you on the road?

1995
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:47.770
Come to do podcasts with him.
He's coming to death squad once a week.
Come on.

1996
01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:48.160
How many,

1997
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.400
<v 5>how many funny young comics are there at the Improv that would love to go and</v>

1998
01:49:51.401 --> 01:49:52.091
open for you.

1999
01:49:52.091 --> 01:49:55.230
Pay Him a hundred bucks or sad or 150 bucks a set or whatever the fuck you want

2000
01:49:55.231 --> 01:49:56.770
to pay him.
You know,
and and,

2001
01:49:56.771 --> 01:49:59.290
and you know it's going to cost you a little bit more money but you're going to

2002
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:03.130
have a much better experience and you could put together a podcast and do

2003
01:50:03.131 --> 01:50:06.010
whatever.
Yeah,
to it after the shows easily man,

2004
01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.080
you can interview all kinds of people.
You can.

2005
01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:11.050
There's always interesting like how many times you talked to club owners and

2006
01:50:11.051 --> 01:50:14.240
they have some crazy ass fucking comedy stories of the onetime,

2007
01:50:14.290 --> 01:50:18.470
Tracy Morgan came through town and I hear stories about some of these guys be

2008
01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:22.740
total dicks to the club owners.
Go,
really?
You're allowed to say that stuff here.

2009
01:50:22.741 --> 01:50:25.330
I,
you know what I mean?
I'm,
I'm sitting in the corner guard.
Do you guys mind?

2010
01:50:25.331 --> 01:50:26.320
Can I get some water?

2011
01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.900
And then you hear the next story of somebody who was in there going,
yeah,

2012
01:50:28.901 --> 01:50:30.580
he got two waitresses pregnant,

2013
01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:33.040
but we don't care cause he sold out the place you do to be great.

2014
01:50:33.041 --> 01:50:36.370
A podcast where you're talking to the opening comic but you're telling them what

2015
01:50:36.371 --> 01:50:37.510
you're doing wrong for an hour

2016
01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:44.200
and you sit down,
let's go,
let's move your real job.

2017
01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:47.140
How's everybody doing tonight?
Do you really want to ask that question?

2018
01:50:47.170 --> 01:50:49.730
How's everybody doing tonight?
This is what you want to Sheldon,

2019
01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:51.700
you want to tell these people how they're doing?

2020
01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:55.480
We're at the fucking John Hamm Fun show.
Awesome.

2021
01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:57.850
That would be a great podcast.

2022
01:50:57.851 --> 01:51:02.320
Then quit selling cds with the sharp re and no sticker on your cds.

2023
01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:06.190
No sticker on the CDS.
That'd be over emotional podcast for real though.

2024
01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:09.760
Like you do it seriously like you're playing a character almost.

2025
01:51:09.761 --> 01:51:12.040
What did you just say about sharpies?
Explain yourself.
You just,

2026
01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:15.790
what did the first guys that sell stuff that are like MCS that'll grab like a

2027
01:51:15.791 --> 01:51:20.380
blank CD and they get with the Sharpie,
write their name on it and then the cell,

2028
01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:25.660
their act after a show but not even produce cds.
I'm confused.

2029
01:51:25.661 --> 01:51:29.080
They sell blank CD?
No,
they'll like put their computer,
the burn,

2030
01:51:29.081 --> 01:51:32.380
the burn to see your act and then with the sharpie write their name and then

2031
01:51:32.381 --> 01:51:34.360
that's what they sell to.
People have to have show.

2032
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:37.120
Do you mind if I sell something?
I would buy that if I was a fan.
Oh,
hold on.

2033
01:51:37.130 --> 01:51:41.650
Sorry.
Yeah.
What do you think about that?
I let them,
I 100% let them,
but I also,

2034
01:51:41.651 --> 01:51:43.210
but then I metal,
I go,

2035
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:48.390
this is the last image you want for for 80 cents you can make a prepackage cool

2036
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:52.840
thing to give them.
So you look professional and they're like,

2037
01:51:52.841 --> 01:51:56.740
well that costs money.
Is this a recording of the show?
They just did.
No,

2038
01:51:56.741 --> 01:52:01.140
this is like they had already made
one.
They made it.

2039
01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:06.040
But I think it's a good idea is after you get off there to show you sell a a

2040
01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:09.940
pass that in the next week you're going to go to a website and you can download

2041
01:52:09.941 --> 01:52:13.870
the seat that tonight's show.
You can download the whole thing immediately.

2042
01:52:14.110 --> 01:52:16.450
There's a guy that I made with that I asked him,
I go,

2043
01:52:16.451 --> 01:52:18.730
can you shoot this one little clip of my act?

2044
01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:20.710
I wanna I wanna use it for something in a camera.

2045
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:24.820
And then he shot it and put it up on Youtube.
How pissed would you be?

2046
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:28.960
Pretty pissed if I said,
can I use your camera for a second?
Brian can,

2047
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:31.390
can you just shoot my set?
And he goes,
yeah.
And then that,

2048
01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:34.840
that night without you saying anything,
he puts it on Youtube.
Yeah.
Wow.

2049
01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:38.650
Someone did that to you?
Yeah.
Wow.
Did you get youtube to take it down?

2050
01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:40.210
No cause I ended up thing,

2051
01:52:40.211 --> 01:52:43.150
but I think he did it from a place of I'm going to help him out cause he said he

2052
01:52:43.151 --> 01:52:45.590
wanted it for the Internet.
So I didn't

2053
01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:50.510
<v 0>he,
I think it was unaware he was going to film it for the Internet.
No,</v>

2054
01:52:50.511 --> 01:52:53.000
I said it's for my history rear rewrite.
I go,

2055
01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:56.290
I'm going to talk about this browser on stage.
I just want to get this thing,

2056
01:52:57.250 --> 01:52:59.690
then I'm going to use it.
Right.
So then he shoots,

2057
01:52:59.691 --> 01:53:03.500
he shoots it and then it puts the whole set online and then he put the thing on

2058
01:53:03.501 --> 01:53:08.120
youtube.
So I'll set,
um,
a lot of it,
not the,
but,

2059
01:53:08.121 --> 01:53:09.350
but I wanted the,

2060
01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:13.790
the hard drive and then I was gonna put it on my computer and whatever,

2061
01:53:13.791 --> 01:53:17.750
but he put it on youtube and I was like,
hmm.
And you didn't,

2062
01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:20.660
what did you say to him?
I go,
Hey,
I appreciate you did this,

2063
01:53:20.661 --> 01:53:23.410
but I didn't want to get this internet.
What?

2064
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:27.910
Because he came from a place of being helpful.
I'm not confrontational,

2065
01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.400
but I'm like,
maybe she got,
now I'm second guessing.
I'm like,

2066
01:53:31.401 --> 01:53:32.380
am I being a Dick for being?

2067
01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:38.210
He should have had that to me is the most private of of things.

2068
01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:41.180
That's not cool.
There's a reason why every club says don't use cameras.

2069
01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:43.040
You know it's supposed to film and it's because you,

2070
01:53:43.041 --> 01:53:46.430
if you get a guys act as if it already gets out there on the Internet,

2071
01:53:46.431 --> 01:53:49.380
maybe you don't want to go see him then you know maybe always got the same.
He,

2072
01:53:49.381 --> 01:53:52.550
this was last week,
I already saw his jokes,
I saw him on Youtube.
People do that.

2073
01:53:52.551 --> 01:53:56.300
People Watch everything of yours now before they come and see you.
And look,

2074
01:53:56.301 --> 01:53:58.490
that's a valid reason for not going to a show.
I'll tell you,

2075
01:53:58.491 --> 01:54:01.400
if you go to see someone,
I mean look if,
if,

2076
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:05.960
if I was a kid and I only had a certain amount of money and I liked the comment

2077
01:54:05.961 --> 01:54:08.840
cause I watched this clip on youtube and it was his whole act and was broken

2078
01:54:08.841 --> 01:54:11.780
down into six clips and I watched all of them and then he's going to be in my

2079
01:54:11.781 --> 01:54:13.880
town.
Well that's the way a week ago.
What are the odds?

2080
01:54:13.881 --> 01:54:17.830
He's got new material and he's awesome,
but I'm not going to go.
Yeah,
it'll,
it'll,

2081
01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:21.350
you know,
people less people will see you,
the show,
you know,
like you,

2082
01:54:21.351 --> 01:54:24.530
Stan hope gets really mad.
He's even got a big,
uh,
a bit about it,

2083
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:28.640
a bit about telling people to stop doing stop filming shows while it's going on.

2084
01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.580
But it's also a part of the,
it's part of the Internet.

2085
01:54:31.581 --> 01:54:33.830
I mean people are going to get clips off your phone,
you know,

2086
01:54:33.831 --> 01:54:36.530
off their phones and shit like that.
But there's a big difference between that,

2087
01:54:36.531 --> 01:54:40.130
like some sneaky audience members just trying to have some fun and some asshole

2088
01:54:40.131 --> 01:54:44.750
that films you and then doesn't tell you and then puts it online.
It puts it,

2089
01:54:44.751 --> 01:54:48.660
he's just trying to get hits on is a huge showing another comic that seems like

2090
01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.940
he's another comic.

2091
01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:54.940
He was the MC Tom breaking like every kind of guy code or comic code that you

2092
01:54:56.451 --> 01:55:00.620
could add.
Slap a bitch and he just think you weren't going to know.

2093
01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:03.630
Did he bring it up or did you find uh,

2094
01:55:03.710 --> 01:55:07.880
I went into the green room and the clip was on youtube on his channel and I'm

2095
01:55:07.881 --> 01:55:12.650
like,
is that me on his,
and then the other comment goes,
yeah man,

2096
01:55:12.651 --> 01:55:17.060
he put that up there.
I was like,
how many minutes did he put up?
It was just,

2097
01:55:17.061 --> 01:55:20.900
it was really short.
It was only like three f three,
because I wanted it for,

2098
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:23.930
to promote the browser.
So it wasn't my whole act.

2099
01:55:23.931 --> 01:55:26.230
But the fact that your whole act,

2100
01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:29.220
was it the clip to promote the browser that he put on Lauren?

2101
01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:31.580
What did you put 'em on the clip to promote the book.

2102
01:55:31.610 --> 01:55:36.200
But I didn't tell him what clip I won and I kind of said to me that's kind of

2103
01:55:36.201 --> 01:55:40.460
pointless.
It's regardless.
So through the,
I'm so confused.

2104
01:55:40.461 --> 01:55:43.980
I thought he puts your whole act online so he only put like

2105
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.030
<v 2>a couple of minutes.
You put a couple of minutes and it gets,</v>

2106
01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.300
you shouldn't have put anything online.

2107
01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:50.820
And it was the clip that I said I want it to use on that.

2108
01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:55.080
Not nearly as offensive.
It's putting,
I thought,
I thought,
wow,

2109
01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:57.450
I'm so stoned.
Cause that's what I was thinking too.

2110
01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:02.430
And this whole time I'm down just like you social disorder.
Yeah.
This is,

2111
01:56:02.431 --> 01:56:07.170
this whole podcast is a fucking intervention.
Um,

2112
01:56:07.230 --> 01:56:10.290
so John had fun.
When are you going to start doing a desk squad podcast.

2113
01:56:10.770 --> 01:56:13.720
Why don't you get,
get on the fucking program?
I'm gone this week.

2114
01:56:13.721 --> 01:56:15.690
I'm home all next.
[inaudible] start it next week.

2115
01:56:15.691 --> 01:56:18.850
This is what would you have this much equipment underneath my desk in shoe boxes

2116
01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:22.320
is what we'll do it together.
Rag Tag or just go to Brian's house.
We'll uh,

2117
01:56:22.321 --> 01:56:26.610
we'll make sure that we mention it on the podcast so that people could download

2118
01:56:26.611 --> 01:56:28.980
it when you actually do want of doing it and we'll put it on Twitter.

2119
01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:30.990
But I think it's the perfect solution for you.
I mean,

2120
01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:33.810
nobody's more miserable than you when you go on the road.

2121
01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:36.690
You know what I'm saying?
We,
whenever we talk,
you always talking about,

2122
01:56:36.691 --> 01:56:40.310
I've been on the road for 18 months.
I'm miserable.
I ever,
you know what I mean?

2123
01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:43.590
Just have one other thing to do and that other thing people would love.

2124
01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:47.370
It's like another,
it's an opportunity to do another show.
You know what to do.

2125
01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.830
Do a little radio show a little John half run on the road,

2126
01:56:50.010 --> 01:56:52.410
do it from hotel rooms.
That's your hook.

2127
01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:55.620
You're doing it on the road from hotel rooms and maybe you know if you're in

2128
01:56:55.621 --> 01:56:57.210
Cleveland and there's two clubs in Cleveland,

2129
01:56:57.211 --> 01:56:59.430
maybe you can call the guy was at the other club and he can meet you after a

2130
01:56:59.431 --> 01:57:01.210
Friday night show and that's what you guys can do.

2131
01:57:01.211 --> 01:57:04.440
And you smoke a joint and fucking do the only thing come on site and I can

2132
01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:05.274
travel with us.

2133
01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.880
<v 7>Bitches do.
It was thinking in advance,</v>

2134
01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:13.500
setting up John have fun and free entertainment from my people.
Now I need a name

2135
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:18.080
<v 2>now stuff cobb's in San Francisco is the next club we're doing.</v>

2136
01:57:18.230 --> 01:57:23.000
And that is Thursday,
Friday and Saturday the 12th,
13th,

2137
01:57:23.001 --> 01:57:27.470
and 14th.
And as I said,
the last podcast,
well as of a couple of days ago,

2138
01:57:27.471 --> 01:57:31.010
half the tickets were already sold out and I just started talking about it and

2139
01:57:31.011 --> 01:57:34.870
the vogue theater,
which is,
um,
June,
um,

2140
01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:37.670
June 10th,
uh,

2141
01:57:37.671 --> 01:57:41.030
and that's in Vancouver and that the tickets just went on sale and half of those

2142
01:57:41.031 --> 01:57:41.900
tickets are sold out too.

2143
01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:46.170
So I don't want any you bitches getting left out in the cold.
Um,
in,
uh,

2144
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:51.080
Toronto Friday night it's going to be Sam Tripoli and me.
So,

2145
01:57:51.081 --> 01:57:54.590
uh,
that should be fun as fuck.
I can't wait.
It's at Massey Hall.

2146
01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:56.570
Most of the tickets are sold out.

2147
01:57:56.571 --> 01:57:58.490
The only thing that's left is like single tickets.

2148
01:57:58.790 --> 01:58:01.260
So I think there's like a hundred single tickets left and then the halls.

2149
01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:04.850
Great too.
You did it.
Have you done it yet?
Last summer?
What'd you do it with?

2150
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:09.290
Just for laughs mean brewer.
Oh,
nice.
Yeah.
Is it,
is it beautiful?
Yeah.

2151
01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:12.290
Nice.
I love Toronto.
I can't fucking wait.

2152
01:58:12.291 --> 01:58:16.850
UFC fucking 55,000 people going to be this weekend.
That's going to be nuts.

2153
01:58:16.851 --> 01:58:19.280
Biggest in North American history that Saturday night.

2154
01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:22.870
George Saint Pierre Versus Jake.
She owns good.

2155
01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:27.250
<v 3>I want to apologize the lady bug seven from my Twitter remarks.
Remarks today.</v>

2156
01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:28.180
Yeah.
Explain what you did.

2157
01:58:28.181 --> 01:58:32.590
You fucked up how she wrote a really weird sentence that said something like,
uh,

2158
01:58:32.591 --> 01:58:36.550
you know,
please retweet if he don't think red ban is a Douche.

2159
01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:40.460
And I thought it said,
please retweet if you think red bands.
And Dude,

2160
01:58:40.461 --> 01:58:42.010
she was like one of iPhone.
Like you're

2161
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.110
<v 0>looking in the car while you're driving down the highway.</v>

2162
01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:48.730
And so I retreated back.
Something rude and I apologize.

2163
01:58:49.450 --> 01:58:53.780
Okay.
You tweeted back some roots.
I personally attacked her.
You personally,

2164
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:55.740
it's something I'd never do on Twitter.
I was just like,
oh,

2165
01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:57.130
I got a funny joke that I'm a PR.

2166
01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:59.500
It was like more of a joke that I was just like,
oh,

2167
01:58:59.501 --> 01:59:02.590
I could do this joke that I wrote,
but it was mean.
It would mean,
and it was,

2168
01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:06.920
you fucked up.
I fucked up and I feel bad.
So look at that.
You guys give her,

2169
01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:08.350
you're making amends.

2170
01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:13.000
What's her Twitter name or a Twitter names lady bug seven lady bugs seven.

2171
01:59:13.210 --> 01:59:15.550
Now what's going to your enemies will now coopt her term.

2172
01:59:15.551 --> 01:59:18.750
What they'll do is they'll be nice to lady bugs Chava and they're gonna do,

2173
01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:23.110
we're going to slowly but surely gain her confidence.
Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah.

2174
01:59:23.111 --> 01:59:25.360
I'll read her tweets and lol them.

2175
01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:28.780
You know our t with an lol just to let them know like,
wow,
this girl's really,

2176
01:59:28.930 --> 01:59:32.000
she's really happy.
She's saying some smart shit.
Then then one day,

2177
01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:36.430
I just think what that red band guy did to you was really fucked up.

2178
01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:40.360
You went to the olive garden with me.

2179
01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:43.660
Then let's get back now let's get back at that.
Fuck

2180
01:59:45.290 --> 01:59:48.340
all you Easter bitches.
Let it go.
Okay.
And UFC,

2181
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:51.100
we're going to be doing the drinking game with you,
Joe.

2182
01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:54.910
So try to remember to do that.
And if I'm not,
if I,
I might go fish.

2183
01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:57.490
If I see drinking games,
this is one shot.

2184
01:59:57.491 --> 01:59:59.290
And if I say that when a fighter is walking out,

2185
01:59:59.450 --> 02:00:02.230
that means Kohlberg's Ping and we're going to do UFC drunk cast,

2186
02:00:02.231 --> 02:00:05.830
I believe with Dheas and they'll post.
It was next to me.
Remember,
remind me that,

2187
02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:08.920
remind me that.
Oh,
there was one other thing that I forgot to talk about.

2188
02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:10.480
They shut down Seti.

2189
02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:14.770
They shut down the search for extraterrestrial intelligence budget cuts.

2190
02:00:14.771 --> 02:00:17.470
They shut that thing down.
Those,
uh,
from contact.

2191
02:00:17.471 --> 02:00:19.140
Remember the movie contact with Jodie Foster?

2192
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:21.130
I just saw that like a couple of weeks ago.

2193
02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:25.120
Fucking great movie man still holds up bad ass movie.

2194
02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:28.960
And that was about them receiving signals from another galaxy.

2195
02:00:28.961 --> 02:00:33.290
And the signals were directions on how to build some wormhole machine and you

2196
02:00:33.291 --> 02:00:33.391
know,

2197
02:00:33.391 --> 02:00:38.391
you jump through it and fly through this wormhole and communicate with alien

2198
02:00:38.471 --> 02:00:42.970
life and on the ship.
Interesting fucking movie.
One of my favorites.
But uh,
they,

2199
02:00:42.971 --> 02:00:45.700
uh,
they shut down the program and the reason why they shut it down,

2200
02:00:45.701 --> 02:00:49.840
it's because they've had no success.
You know,
if all this listening,

2201
02:00:49.930 --> 02:00:53.920
all this listening,
all this listening now,
who the fuck would have thought,

2202
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:58.590
why would you think to do it's still be using radio.
Yeah.
Right.

2203
02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:01.930
If they're smart enough to be,
you know,
they can,

2204
02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:05.290
they can travel from here to from other galaxies to here.

2205
02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:06.610
Why the fuck would they still be using,

2206
02:01:06.611 --> 02:01:09.040
raise it that they're going to be some new cool shit.

2207
02:01:09.130 --> 02:01:12.830
Is it that they're doing radio or that it would be changes in signal?
Well,

2208
02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:16.540
it's in,
it's any kind of a broadcast and he signaled,
that comes from,
you know,

2209
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:18.860
they're looking at a bunch of different bandwidths.

2210
02:01:18.861 --> 02:01:21.350
They're looking at any kind of signal.
I mean,
that's why they get,
they get,
um,

2211
02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:23.910
like,
uh,
planets give off signals.

2212
02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:27.700
So novas hyper Novas they give off signals and all sorts of different things

2213
02:01:27.701 --> 02:01:28.534
give off signals.

2214
02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:31.630
They're just trying to look for a pattern and trying to look for something

2215
02:01:31.631 --> 02:01:35.110
that's,
that seems to be some sort of a message.
But it's really,

2216
02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:36.400
it's kind of a flawed idea.

2217
02:01:36.401 --> 02:01:39.500
I think it's been around forever and they've really never had any progress.

2218
02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:40.581
You mean there's,
I mean,

2219
02:01:40.581 --> 02:01:43.940
they just waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting

2220
02:01:43.941 --> 02:01:47.270
and hoping that if there,
if they can contact us,

2221
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:49.400
they're going to fucking contact us.
You know?

2222
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:54.550
I think it's going to happen where I think if there was alien life,

2223
02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:59.930
I think they would easily be able to get to us before we would ever be able to

2224
02:01:59.931 --> 02:02:03.470
detect them.
They would want to check us out.
You know,
if you,

2225
02:02:03.471 --> 02:02:08.471
if you live near some planet and you had these halfway evolved monkeys with

2226
02:02:08.541 --> 02:02:12.510
nuclear weapons,
you wouldn't want to keep an eye on those crazy motherfuckers.

2227
02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:14.600
What do you think that they're smarter than us and you're going to give it like

2228
02:02:14.601 --> 02:02:15.391
what if the human race,

2229
02:02:15.391 --> 02:02:18.320
it's amazing and they're all just let rolling around in circles like peeing on

2230
02:02:18.321 --> 02:02:21.290
themselves.
Well,
that's true,
but if that's true,
they're not coming here anyway,

2231
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:22.910
then you don't have to worry about signals.

2232
02:02:22.911 --> 02:02:24.080
You don't have to worry about anything.
I mean,

2233
02:02:24.081 --> 02:02:28.040
it could very well be that we are the apex of intelligent life in the universe.

2234
02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:31.220
It's very possible.
It could be that that human life,
you know,

2235
02:02:31.221 --> 02:02:34.010
or life intelligent life,
any kind of light,
it's really,
really,

2236
02:02:34.011 --> 02:02:35.330
really hard to develop it.
I mean,

2237
02:02:35.331 --> 02:02:38.930
it takes the absolute perfect conditions and this weird planet just happens to

2238
02:02:38.931 --> 02:02:40.960
be a certain distance from the soil.
The start of it,

2239
02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:45.260
one day we'll get smart enough to go do have land and we have a large moons or

2240
02:02:45.261 --> 02:02:47.330
orbit is stable.
You know,
that's the other thing we don't,

2241
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:49.670
it doesn't vary much between summer and winter.

2242
02:02:49.710 --> 02:02:53.240
There they're pretty small degrees of variations compared to some planets.

2243
02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:55.600
So like we're in the,
the ideal conditions.

2244
02:02:55.610 --> 02:02:57.800
It very well could be that this is as good as it gets.

2245
02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:00.680
But it's also possible that the universe is,
you know,

2246
02:03:00.730 --> 02:03:05.360
at least 14 billion years old and this planet is only like 4.6 billion or

2247
02:03:05.361 --> 02:03:06.140
something like that.

2248
02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:11.140
So that leaves out somewhere between nine and 10 billion fucking years for one

2249
02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:13.970
planet to evolve past the point that we have.

2250
02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:16.790
And if that is possible for something,
I mean who knows,
because if it is,

2251
02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:18.800
it comes into question like how long the stars last?

2252
02:03:18.801 --> 02:03:21.890
What of the star Burns out while the civilizations evolving?
Is it a big race?

2253
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:26.540
Cause it's our,
our son is eventually going to burn out.
So on one hand,
the,

2254
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:28.130
if the human race is going to survive,

2255
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:31.670
it has to figure out a way to colonize space.
It's the only way to do it.
I mean,

2256
02:03:31.671 --> 02:03:33.140
if we're going to stay around and to,

2257
02:03:33.141 --> 02:03:35.840
any life is going to stay around in a few billion years.

2258
02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:39.140
I mean [inaudible] I mean now I don't know how many billion it takes,

2259
02:03:39.141 --> 02:03:42.260
but let's just assume that if wife has been around for 4 billion years,

2260
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:45.030
whatever the fuck it's been,
however long the life has been around it,

2261
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:47.410
which assume a billion years from now,
it's probably still going to be life.

2262
02:03:47.411 --> 02:03:49.820
Right?
Would,
if that's when the stunts starts going bad,

2263
02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:52.430
if it's 2 billion or three,
but whatever the fuck it is,
eventually,

2264
02:03:52.431 --> 02:03:55.760
if life keeps going,
we're going to have to get off this fucking thing.
Oh,

2265
02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:58.430
there will be no more life.
You know,
it's really that simple.

2266
02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.540
So if there is some sort of a life,
a of some sort of a civilization,

2267
02:04:02.541 --> 02:04:07.040
some sort of an intelligent civilization that is a billion years older than us,

2268
02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:11.990
they know about us,
you know,
I don't know if they do.
I,
I'm not convinced.

2269
02:04:11.991 --> 02:04:14.630
I watch all those Ufo footages,
man,
and I just,

2270
02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:18.430
I just feel like I'm being fucked with,
you know,
I watched that.
The mode,

2271
02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:21.560
the recent one from Jerusalem,
a million people twittered me that thing.

2272
02:04:21.561 --> 02:04:26.540
It looks fake as fuck you.
You seen that the one in Israel Ufo over Israel?

2273
02:04:26.770 --> 02:04:29.420
No,
I don't want the one that just shoots straight up.
Yeah,
we,
yeah.

2274
02:04:29.421 --> 02:04:31.880
We talked about from a couple of weeks that we talked about it isn't that you

2275
02:04:31.881 --> 02:04:34.790
said it's an effect that's an effect,
an after effects.
It's,
yeah.

2276
02:04:34.791 --> 02:04:38.280
That was already proven to be fake.
Yeah.
I mean,
come on man.
Haven't seen one.

2277
02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:43.020
<v 2>I haven't seen one where I'm like,
wow,
what the fuck is that?
I haven't seen one.</v>

2278
02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:45.780
You know,
everybody's got a goddamn camera on their cell phone.

2279
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:49.800
There's pictures of the guy from Seinfeld yelling nigger on stage.

2280
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:50.880
There's video of that.

2281
02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:54.540
What are the odds you're there with when that happens and you have a camera,

2282
02:04:54.570 --> 02:04:57.000
right?
You know there's that.
How often does that happen?

2283
02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:59.790
That might have never happened ever again.
And the whole universe,
right?

2284
02:04:59.910 --> 02:05:03.330
Kramer from Seinfeld yelling nigger on stage at the laugh factory and someone

2285
02:05:03.331 --> 02:05:04.170
got a video at,
right?

2286
02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:07.440
You're telling me they don't have one video of one fucking alien,

2287
02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:11.850
one video of one little gray man and your room.
That's realistic to me.

2288
02:05:12.090 --> 02:05:13.890
One video,
a full hunters.

2289
02:05:13.891 --> 02:05:17.400
What we picked up again next season that I sit in the hotels,

2290
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:20.610
go shows to go shows are my favorite.
Who were in the basement.

2291
02:05:20.611 --> 02:05:23.580
What does that noise cut to?
Commercial.
You know,
nothing ever happens.

2292
02:05:23.610 --> 02:05:28.140
Nothing happens on those go shows.
Those are the most unsatisfying shows ever,

2293
02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:30.630
but they're huge.
Those things do real well.

2294
02:05:30.631 --> 02:05:33.810
There's like 80 ghost hunter shows and they dress up like,
yeah,

2295
02:05:33.811 --> 02:05:37.530
they dress up with like fucking military garb and shit with powerful fucking

2296
02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:41.400
flashlights and shit and looking for ghosts in a basement of a building.

2297
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.880
Get out of their stupid.
That's my message.

2298
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:47.770
Get out of their stupid really

2299
02:05:47.770 --> 02:05:50.600
<v 0>cool show on history channel that just started.</v>

2300
02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:54.370
I haven't heard anything about the,
the history,
the,
the 80s technology,

2301
02:05:54.371 --> 02:05:58.060
the history of the 80s technology and I guess it's really cool like one episode

2302
02:05:58.300 --> 02:06:01.840
they dissected like you arcade games back in the early eighties and like the

2303
02:06:01.841 --> 02:06:04.730
technology and then they started moving onto all that's bad at yeah,

2304
02:06:04.731 --> 02:06:06.610
it's like a tare and yeah.
Yeah.

2305
02:06:06.670 --> 02:06:10.390
Like so then I started last night and one of those where you're just on the

2306
02:06:10.391 --> 02:06:12.520
internet in a daze,
like a Zombie going through everything,

2307
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:17.230
looking at old arcade games for sale on a like a craigslist and shit.

2308
02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:20.050
If you ever thought about just making an arcade room,

2309
02:06:20.051 --> 02:06:22.720
like an old school arcade room around the pool table.

2310
02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:27.340
I liked pool better than any games.
The more I played pool,
the more I like it.

2311
02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:30.280
A pool is to me way more fun than Arcade Games.

2312
02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:33.310
If I had a pool table next to an arcade,
I don't want to play stupid video.

2313
02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:36.760
Hadn't tron reach somebody to spit and read cool on paper,

2314
02:06:36.761 --> 02:06:38.920
but it's like driving an old car.
Adam Carolla.

2315
02:06:38.921 --> 02:06:41.410
What we were talking about old cars yesterday.
Like you have an old hot rod,

2316
02:06:41.411 --> 02:06:42.910
they're really like a conversation piece.

2317
02:06:42.911 --> 02:06:45.750
You sit around and you'll look at it because driving is kind of stupid.
Right.

2318
02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:48.270
You know,
and that's kind of how those games are kind of cool.
Oh,

2319
02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:50.080
that's the old tron.
Well,
yeah.

2320
02:06:50.081 --> 02:06:53.440
Why would you play that when you can play gears of war.
True.
By the way,

2321
02:06:53.441 --> 02:06:55.810

2326
02:07:07.390 --> 02:07:10.480

2327
02:07:10.481 --> 02:07:13.660
