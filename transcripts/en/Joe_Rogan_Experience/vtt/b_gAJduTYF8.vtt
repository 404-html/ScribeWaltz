00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.180
<v Speaker 2>There was a video that MTV put out.</v>

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 2>it was a new year's resolutions for white guys.</v>

5
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the worst fucking,</v>

6
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 2>most racist sexist videos of Erythrocyte tweet that it was so ridiculous.</v>

7
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I imagine if anybody had ever made a video like that about any like</v>

8
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 2>generalization,</v>

9
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 2>about a hundred million people and that's what it is.</v>

10
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a general,</v>

11
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.963
<v Speaker 2>like if you say,</v>

12
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 2>how many white guys are in America?</v>

13
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.271
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

14
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:32.300
<v Speaker 2>let's just guess how many white males or an American,</v>

15
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:33.134
<v Speaker 2>not enough</v>

16
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 2>princess layers.</v>

17
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

18
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Had a heart attack right now though.</v>

19
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.841
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.674
<v Speaker 2>How many?</v>

21
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.670
<v Speaker 2>62% of the population is white.</v>

22
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 2>62% of the US.</v>

23
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 2>What percentage of white males?</v>

24
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.053
<v Speaker 2>White males.</v>

25
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.731
<v Speaker 2>The majority,</v>

26
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 2>which is about 77%.</v>

27
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 2>How many white males?</v>

28
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.891
<v Speaker 2>Males.</v>

29
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 2>The white men are 31% of the population there.</v>

30
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

31
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.940
<v Speaker 2>so we're 31% of the population is 350 million people.</v>

32
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere around a hundred million people,</v>

33
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

34
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 2>It's in that neighborhood between 80 and a hundred million.</v>

35
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:08.774
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

36
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what a crazy thing to generalize.</v>

37
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.411
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

38
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 2>just to make a video about white men.</v>

39
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.431
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

40
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:17.630
<v Speaker 2>hey white guys,</v>

41
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 2>how about you get your shit together?</v>

42
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Like just white guys.</v>

43
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Just white guys.</v>

44
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

45
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

46
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to do this about black guys too?</v>

47
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you see what happens when you do it about black guys?</v>

48
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 2>How about you do it about black women?</v>

49
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 2>See how quick somebody beats the fuck out of you.</v>

50
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.220
<v Speaker 2>How come you can do that about white guys like this?</v>

51
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:39.221
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that white men are the privileged and that white men have this</v>

52
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:39.651
<v Speaker 2>advantage.</v>

53
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 2>So you should attack that advantage by being racist towards them.</v>

54
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I the best way to stop racism is to be racist towards people who you think are</v>

55
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:47.084
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

56
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

57
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 2>It's so stupid.</v>

58
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.040
<v Speaker 2>It's so unbelievable that MTV news stuff,</v>

59
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>they should do a video like that.</v>

60
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>What's really bad?</v>

61
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Mtvs the worse.</v>

62
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

63
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>have you watched it on TV recently?</v>

64
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.721
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry?</v>

65
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

66
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>do you like MTV?</v>

67
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.543
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

68
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 1>I try,</v>

69
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I to watch TV anymore.</v>

70
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't have cable anymore,</v>

71
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>so I have,</v>

72
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>a ps view or whatever.</v>

74
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.013
<v Speaker 1>It's sling.</v>

75
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.571
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

76
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>so I have certain channels I normally,</v>

78
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>but not as many as I used to have.</v>

79
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:16.490
<v Speaker 1>So like I'll watch MTV more just because I have it.</v>

80
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>It's one of 30 channels,</v>

81
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>but MTV is just garbage channel now.</v>

82
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing that we're too old for it.</v>

83
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>That's like you have to be 18 to 22 to have any fun to have that show.</v>

84
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>

85
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Dickless is that on MTV?</v>

86
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

87
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 2>that shows just saw a bunch of videos for people getting jacked on the Internet.</v>

88
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.093
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

89
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.701
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

90
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

91
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 2>everything else is,</v>

92
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 2>they don't have videos anymore,</v>

93
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.323
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

94
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 2>No videos on youtube.</v>

95
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Every videos I'm sending you to one.</v>

96
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 2>What a weird time.</v>

97
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:44.591
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

99
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>it was cool when they had videos as you learned about new bands because you saw</v>

100
00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>their video.</v>

101
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

102
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to watch those anymore.</v>

103
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

104
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 2>If they,</v>

105
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

106
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 2>they played videos versus people falling on their head.</v>

107
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 2>People go to falling on their head every day.</v>

108
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.470
<v Speaker 2>So they just went where the money is.</v>

109
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 2>So this is the idea is that they're just trying to appeal to social justice</v>

110
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 2>warriors by making this video.</v>

111
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 2>There's one girl in the video,</v>

112
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>she goes find out what mansplaining is and then don't do it.</v>

113
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.003
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

114
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.121
<v Speaker 2>like find out what?</v>

115
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:15.121
<v Speaker 2>Like what a ridiculous idea that you can be condescending about someone being</v>

116
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 2>condescending and it that somehow or another is going to work like that.</v>

117
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 2>All the thought behind making a video like that,</v>

118
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly how Trump got elected.</v>

119
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 2>When you tell people what to do,</v>

120
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 2>they automatically want to do the other thing.</v>

121
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Even if they wouldn't want to do the other thing if you hadn't said Shit,</v>

122
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.630
<v Speaker 2>but when you push people and you tell people just if you,</v>

123
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>you make up ridiculous standards for the way people are supposed to behave</v>

124
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>because you think they should behave like that and that you are allowed to make</v>

125
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:46.951
<v Speaker 2>gigantic gross generalizations about an entire group of 100 million people just</v>

126
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 2>because you think it's open season on white guys like that is how people like</v>

127
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Trump get elected because people push back against your ridiculous political</v>

128
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 2>correctness and go towards what's the enemy of that?</v>

129
00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 2>What's the enemy of political correctness?</v>

130
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 2>That pussy grabbing guy,</v>

131
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 2>let's fuck a vote modem in and that's what happens.</v>

132
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what happens.</v>

133
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 2>These people are,</v>

134
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 2>the people that are so mad that Trump is in office are directly responsible for</v>

135
00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

136
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Hoards of people voting for Trump because they are sick of where the the PC</v>

137
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:17.510
<v Speaker 2>generation is pointing fee.</v>

138
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 2>It's an irrational point of view.</v>

139
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not objective.</v>

140
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

141
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 2>if anything has to do with gender or homosexuality,</v>

142
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 2>whoever has to do with any of those things is no longer considered as an</v>

143
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

144
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Then you're considered as a part of an untouchable group that is almost always</v>

145
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 2>exonerated of anything that they've done wrong.</v>

146
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.511
<v Speaker 2>It cheats.</v>

147
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 2>You get to this weird fake world where people aren't people anymore.</v>

148
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 2>They're figureheads for ideologies and that's the problem with political</v>

149
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:43.001
<v Speaker 2>correctness.</v>

150
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 2>As much as it's a problem with people that are super right wing or people that</v>

151
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 2>are born again Christians or</v>

152
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking up comedy like so many comedians have been talking about lately,</v>

153
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>how like they've had to stop themselves on stage,</v>

154
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>and not go down a route.</v>

156
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>They normally would always go down because of the recent,</v>

157
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.370

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 1>in the last even six months.</v>

161
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Well there's definitely more pushback,</v>

162
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>but there's always been pushback.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you noticed a change?</v>

164
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:10.091
<v Speaker 1>Have you,</v>

165
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 1>have you noticed like certain things you won't say now or do now or,</v>

166
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.651
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

167
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:15.750
<v Speaker 2>it makes you just back up what you want to say better.</v>

168
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.060
<v Speaker 2>It makes you reinforce your arguments better.</v>

169

<v Speaker 2>It makes you,</v>

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a real point and you have to be able to back up what you're</v>

174
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:27.630
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

175
