<v Speaker 1>I left.</v>

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because after going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through all the old podcast,</v>

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>every beginning of every single podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you know that Tony into art bell,</v>

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 2>please turn off your radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

11
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 2>And A to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was people always call up that </v>

12
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 2>feedback himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

13
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 2>they're listening to themselves and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're at.</v>

14
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a nonsense conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what they want to hear</v>

15
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 2>themselves on the radio,</v>

16
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>so like just being in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>record it with my cell phone,</v>

17
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>turn up that radio.</v>

18
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately this is very different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

19
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I guess we want to hear ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast.</v>

20
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 2>So we got to show this weekend at the </v>

<v Speaker 2>It took me a second dead stroke.</v>

27
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 2>That's a hangar pool terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys keep doing this to each </v>

28
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 2>other now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just started by itself under the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a new computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it on both things.</v>

31
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:43.521
<v Speaker 2>I got it on this ustream window too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Brian is redoing my website and in </v>

<v Speaker 2>the ustream actually on Joe Rogan.net.</v>

34
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 2>So if you'd go to the webpage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

35
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a little corner link that says </v>
<v Speaker 2>live Webcam,</v>

36
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 2>so you can see it right from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna get better.</v>

37
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's on itunes now too.</v>

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Joe Rogan podcast on </v>
<v Speaker 1>itunes.</v>

41
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>So you can get that shit or if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>zoom,</v>

42
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 1>you could go to your website and </v>
<v Speaker 1>download the MP three.</v>

43
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're one of those soon dudes who </v>

44
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 2>just hates apple so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to get one of the goofiest </v>

45
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 2>fucking devices ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless it does anything better.</v>

46
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.450
<v Speaker 2>There's no need for another one soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Microsoft version of the ipod and </v>

47
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:31.461
<v Speaker 2>the people that are that prefer it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's how they're like super windows </v>

48
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 2>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that just love it</v>

49
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.810
<v Speaker 1>because no denial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specialty old zoom.</v>

50
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:39.811
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember ever using that where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fake spin wheels that get </v>

51
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:41.740
<v Speaker 1>pushed it down and it clicked up and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was retarded.</v>

52
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>So new one's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they probably couldn't use the </v>

53
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

54
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.491
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you say that apple is assuming </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people for the technology that in </v>

55
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.630
<v Speaker 1>their iphone or android devices and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sprint devices,</v>

56
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:57.631
<v Speaker 1>they're all fucked right now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they own or apple owns like 20 of the </v>

57
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>patents that all these new cell phones </v>
<v Speaker 1>are using.</v>

58
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Why you have a phone like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the android or the droid.</v>

59
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has pinch to zoom,</v>

60
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>just like the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all,</v>

62
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>apple owns all these patents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So android might be hurting a android,</v>

63
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.360
<v Speaker 1>even palm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be hurting because their new </v>

64
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>phones are all really just pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing of apples a shit.</v>

65
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be nuts.</v>

66
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.000
<v Speaker 1>The only one that's not in trouble right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

67
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's the new windows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven phones.</v>

68
00:03:21.921 --> 00:03:25.110
<v Speaker 1>So they don't use the pendants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't,</v>

69
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.580
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

70
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.190
<v Speaker 1>they were really smart not to use any </v>
<v Speaker 1>patents.</v>

71
00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>They have their own shitload of patents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is pinch to zoom.</v>

72
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.320
<v Speaker 1>There's no better way to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There really isn't.</v>

73
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has.</v>

74
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there could be like a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make like circled as Uhm,</v>

75
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's squared.</v>

76
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 1>It came circled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>C'Mon man.</v>

77
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.400
<v Speaker 1>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be able to pinch it.</v>

78
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if you wanted to zoom on in </v>

79
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just put a circle around</v>

80
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.980
<v Speaker 3>zoom now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

81
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.700
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

82
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:51.420
<v Speaker 3>I want to do this.</v>

83
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I took five years ago,</v>

84
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

85
00:03:53.871 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>you can go like this.</v>

86
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I know that I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you have water in your </v>

87
00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 3>ear and the water gets out of here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

88
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I can hear like you accepted the way</v>

89
00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:03.720
<v Speaker 3>your ear was bursting when the water was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>

90
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.890
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay with it.</v>

91
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I can deal with those people that still </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't on the Internet.</v>

92
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.870
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll just pick two males pie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking awesome documentary on</v>

93
00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:15.120
<v Speaker 3>PBS TV about this dude who lives in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arctic,</v>

94
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.030
<v Speaker 3>one of the last people that it's allowed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to live in the Arctic,</v>

95
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 3>and he lives like way the fuck up in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>northeast part of Alaska.</v>

96
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no one within like hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 3>of miles.</v>

97
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have a car.</v>

98
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.360
<v Speaker 3>He gets electricity from a generator and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fucking shoots all his own meat,</v>

99
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.540
<v Speaker 3>kills all his own rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kills on Caribou,</v>

100
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 3>has to protect his cabin.</v>

101
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Little tiny ass cabinet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the size of a bedroom has to </v>

102
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.570
<v Speaker 3>protect his cabin from wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's fun going from a bear's rather</v>

103
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.630
<v Speaker 3>bears come to the cabin because he hangs</v>
<v Speaker 3>his meat outside because it's never </v>

104
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.630
<v Speaker 3>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a refrigerator,</v>

105
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.180
<v Speaker 3>they don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he hangs his fucking meet outside and</v>

106
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.490
<v Speaker 3>bears occasionally will come into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus smelling.</v>

107
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.570
<v Speaker 3>So he's got this dog that he leaves out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's supposed to protect and bark.</v>

108
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.600
<v Speaker 3>So then he comes out as to chase the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear down on the fucking shotgun and </v>

109
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.081
<v Speaker 3>he's doing this in the nighttime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's night and he can't see and he's </v>

110
00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:09.750
<v Speaker 3>chasing down this fucking bear and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting at it.</v>

111
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.580
<v Speaker 3>It is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy is living in the extreme.</v>

112
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean as as close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's sort of civilized </v>

113
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.320
<v Speaker 3>civilization I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.980
<v Speaker 3>He's got a television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a generator.</v>

115
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.980
<v Speaker 3>He can get electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watches dvds that he gets shipped to </v>

116
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.430
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still has not seen a even an image of</v>

117

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

178

179
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.690
<v Speaker 2>but then once that for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird when a memory gets awakened </v>

180
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 2>when you didn't think the memory was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head at all and then someone brings</v>

181
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 2>it up and also the rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the balloons comes back to life.</v>

182
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Like someone talks about some shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

183
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Like when you were a kid and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

184
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck,</v>

185
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the sudden boom.</v>

186
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:41.321
<v Speaker 2>It was clear when that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That opens up a lot of these little </v>

187
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:44.471
<v Speaker 2>memories that just because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>remembered that one thing being will </v>

188
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:44.471
<v Speaker 2>start remembering like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

189
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 2>and really used to listen to that guy at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grocery store.</v>

190
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Bishop Desmond Tutu gets the gas face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much research was good </v>

191
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that guy's flow,</v>

192
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 3>but it seemed like people would pick on </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was white.</v>

193
00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 3>It was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he became like a producer </v>

194
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 3>instead of a wrapper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think was a huge mistake because</v>

195
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I think as a rapper he was really bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>

196
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to love his stuff,</v>

197
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 3>but I felt like he was almost sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like doing it but sort of apologizing at</v>

198
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a junior and he stopped doing it,</v>

199
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 3>but the cashier will never stopped </v>
<v Speaker 3>rapping and that guy was fucking good.</v>

200
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 3>The idea that he went on to produce some</v>
<v Speaker 3>records.</v>

201
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he produced some good to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>liking it.</v>

202
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Perform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can appreciate that.</v>

203
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 3>But I think with him that guy was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking good.</v>

204
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:34.761
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really used to enjoy as shit illegally </v>

235
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.780
<v Speaker 3>but on the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tick it off.</v>

236
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're Nazis in the bag.</v>

237
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 3>You can't totally get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can kind of play dumb.</v>

238
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.680
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

239
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 3>Take it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

240
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:04.720
<v Speaker 3>I never don't take it off when they rate</v>
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>

241
00:11:04.721 --> 00:11:09.721
<v Speaker 3>I take it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to tell me I'm not going to </v>

242
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:09.721
<v Speaker 3>take it off on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The break and if you're sleeping they'll</v>

243
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 3>never wake you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will fake sleep.</v>

244
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.160
<v Speaker 3>I'll make sure that my seat is up for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

245
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.350
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this shit right here and</v>

246
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.690
<v Speaker 3>it should just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please.</v>

247
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no one's going to crash because my </v>

248
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.750
<v Speaker 3>fucking head turn it off because radio </v>
<v Speaker 3>waves.</v>

249
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a real wave.</v>

250
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.000
<v Speaker 3>It's electric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want you to turn off everything.</v>

251
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:34.550
<v Speaker 3>They want you to turn off game boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

252
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's like it's on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nonsense.</v>

253
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:43.551
<v Speaker 3>It's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is some sort of electrical </v>

254
00:11:43.551 --> 00:11:46.310
<v Speaker 3>interference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think really the good idea too is </v>

255
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.891
<v Speaker 3>that it forces people to comply and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the same thing with putting the </v>

256
00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:52.881
<v Speaker 3>seat up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you never really thinks it's </v>

257
00:11:52.881 --> 00:11:52.881
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I used to think it was ridiculous to</v>

258
00:11:52.881 --> 00:11:56.481
<v Speaker 3>force people to put their seat up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now I think it's important because </v>

259
00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 3>you've got to get them to fucking listen</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

260
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Well important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they do get into a tough,</v>

261
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.390
<v Speaker 3>they don't want you to look lean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you know,</v>

262
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.020
<v Speaker 3>if you can get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get hurt.</v>

263
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that's going to hurt you.</v>

264
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna hurt you any less because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like this.</v>

265
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Then you are like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

266
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

267
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

268
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't see how even in the most furious</v>

269
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 3>turbulence it would make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're fucked either way.</v>

270
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 3>If you're fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

271
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 3>You're on a goddamn metal tube flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the air.</v>

272
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.080
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the good thing about it is that </v>

273
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.080
<v Speaker 3>they get you to comply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

274
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anybody to tell me what to </v>

275
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:32.640
<v Speaker 3>do and you don't want anybody to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you what to do,</v>

276
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.690
<v Speaker 3>but let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to do anything fucking </v>

277
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:36.690
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

278
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.750
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people out there that </v>

279
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.200
<v Speaker 3>need to be told what to do during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>landing.</v>

280
00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:45.201
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just go to the bathroom on the </v>

281
00:12:45.201 --> 00:12:45.201
<v Speaker 3>fucking fly all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

282
00:12:45.201 --> 00:12:45.690
<v Speaker 3>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

283
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.640
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain amount of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

284
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.190
<v Speaker 3>there's just too many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need very clearly established rules.</v>

285
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Even if they're ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's just like,</v>

286
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.290
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

287
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.730
<v Speaker 3>you're conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just an expert retards,</v>

288
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know there's just so many fucking</v>

289
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:05.941
<v Speaker 3>dummies out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very important to have a certain </v>

290
00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:05.941
<v Speaker 3>amount of order to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

291
00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 3>because even though you don't want that </v>
<v Speaker 3>order,</v>

292
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 3>you've worked really hard to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself into a position where you don't</v>

293
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 3>have to have that order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

294

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

297
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 3>like regular normal person's life to </v>
<v Speaker 3>being this crazy fucking comedian where </v>

298
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making your living talking shit </v>

299
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.860
<v Speaker 3>on stage and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sleep till noon and it means that,</v>

300
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:30.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

301
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 3>That right there is most people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>never be able to figure out a way that's</v>

302
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 3>just too tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too fucked up.</v>

303
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most dumb people would never be </v>

304
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.400
<v Speaker 3>able to figure out a way to slip through</v>
<v Speaker 3>some weird path to make a career doing,</v>

305
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 3>watching your work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now we're not talking about,</v>

306
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

307
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:56.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody really wants to work unless you </v>

308
00:13:56.161 --> 00:13:56.161
<v Speaker 3>love what you're doing and then it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>working anymore.</v>

309
00:13:56.161 --> 00:13:58.570
<v Speaker 3>And that's really the secret to life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then everybody loves something else,</v>

310
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:03.571
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a reason why there's </v>

311
00:14:03.571 --> 00:14:03.571
<v Speaker 3>lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why.</v>

312
00:14:03.571 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of dudes who love being </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking dentist now.</v>

313
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of dudes and loved being </v>
<v Speaker 3>carpenters and everybody's got their own</v>

314
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.380
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>

315
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.620
<v Speaker 3>If you want me to find it then it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>really work.</v>

316
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:12.490
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

317
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.550
<v Speaker 3>And until then it's going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still get surprised sometimes on the </v>

318
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.680
<v Speaker 3>road and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

319
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

320
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.790
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because we do it so often for free,</v>

321
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in La,</v>

<v Speaker 3>free?</v>

323
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I start.</v>

324
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:27.850
<v Speaker 3>Whenever people ask me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

325
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:29.920
<v Speaker 3>do you want like a future for the third </v>
<v Speaker 3>show or something or whatever.</v>

326
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

327
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.760
<v Speaker 3>I've said no before and then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

328
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.540
<v Speaker 3>I do a guest spot now once I get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

329
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.950
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you hear the laughter,</v>

330
00:14:38.951 --> 00:14:40.840
<v Speaker 3>you just want to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

331
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.090
<v Speaker 3>it was we were in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

332
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flight fucks you up man,</v>

333
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 3>because it's like a 16 hour time zone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like 19 ahead.</v>

334
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:53.810
<v Speaker 3>So it's like literally you're the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

335
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 3>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

336
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 3>well really delusional.</v>

337
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know,</v>

338
00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:02.260
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as I got to the club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the people who have interest </v>

339
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 3>sparks it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

340
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:04.010
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Bam,</v>

341
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do a fucking trouble and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have some fun.</v>

342
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you just fire up,</v>

343
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just get one people,</v>

344
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.310
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish people in their regular jobs </v>

345
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.310
<v Speaker 3>could feel what we feel when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing,</v>

346
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally sleep for a couple hours </v>

347
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.211
<v Speaker 3>afterwards to go on wired afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you got a new bit,</v>

348
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.400
<v Speaker 3>if you have a new button,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that new bid is killing that.</v>

349
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 3>It just takes everything up to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

350
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.440
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

351
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Comedy is so much fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's seen alice in wonderland yet.</v>

352
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard very mixed reviews.</v>

353
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am going to watch it.</v>

354
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 1>A universal city walk on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we got back from Tibet,</v>

355
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in three D imax.</v>

356
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Disregarding the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you not had a bad trip before?</v>

357
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.740
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's going to be your bad </v>

358
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.500
<v Speaker 1>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I thinking</v>

359
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 3>about bad trips and I think for sure you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could definitely take too much of </v>

360
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.790
<v Speaker 3>anything and have a bad trip no matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>what state of mind is.</v>

361
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had that trips on pot.</v>

362
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.380
<v Speaker 3>I've never had bad trips and anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else about pot,</v>

363
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.240
<v Speaker 3>but I've had bad trips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eating Pot.</v>

364
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.270
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's how you approach it.</v>

365
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it's where you're at when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>take it,</v>

366
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.270
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a good place.</v>

367
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Last time I did shrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start shooting and having diarrhea and</v>

368
00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:22.520
<v Speaker 1>know that changes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think you're dying,</v>

369
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.310
<v Speaker 1>that's causing mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody get into an accident across the</v>

370
00:16:27.311 --> 00:16:29.950
<v Speaker 1>street from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all going back.</v>

371
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing that second dealer show </v>
<v Speaker 1>next time?</v>

372
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I can.</v>

373

<v Speaker 3>Fear is doing.</v>

375
00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:43.231
<v Speaker 3>If you live in la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing this psychedelic show and he </v>

<v Speaker 1>Look are going to make them better.</v>

378
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Well this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the idea of the show is most </v>

379
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.460
<v Speaker 3>comedians that we know at least most </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny ones because had a few psychedelic</v>

380
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:03.461
<v Speaker 3>experiences and a lot of them have </v>
<v Speaker 3>really funny stories to go with them and</v>

381
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:05.690
<v Speaker 3>so they're all talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of a crowd.</v>

383
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 3>It should be kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just fun stories.</v>

384
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Anything interesting I've ever learned?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already told 100 fucking times.</v>

385
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always get it.</v>

386
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Drug experience for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

387
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.500
<v Speaker 1>In Tempe this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the place to do it,</v>

388
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God spirits in us and said,</v>

389
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 1>you have some Guy Dylan Birdie told the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

390
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.440
<v Speaker 3>You're always supposed to be incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>synthetic spirit self.</v>

391
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.660
<v Speaker 3>My friend Matt was in New York and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>took it and he said he could hear people</v>

392
00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 3>talking in a building like straight way </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>

393
00:17:41.541 --> 00:17:43.780
<v Speaker 3>I said a glass window,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>

394
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I can hear them talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

395
00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:47.640
<v Speaker 3>it's probably just like a cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>going off.</v>

396
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

397
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.000
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

398
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 3>there's ways we can perceive things </v>
<v Speaker 3>other than the standard way.</v>

399
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could hear things further away,</v>

400
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:03.111
<v Speaker 3>but like a center,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at a bar weapon normally hear </v>

401
00:18:03.111 --> 00:18:03.111
<v Speaker 3>nothing I can set on one person talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

402
00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.680
<v Speaker 3>but people around me then I just see </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and I hear what they're saying.</v>

403
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 3>That your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your liver,</v>

404
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.380
<v Speaker 3>your liver does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows when your liver is what makes </v>

405
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 3>a week so fucked up when you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when it produces that shit.</v>

406
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 3>It's called 11 hydroxy metabolite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's,</v>

407
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

408
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.470
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's present and smoking it.</v>

409
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.640
<v Speaker 3>When you smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's present.</v>

410
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 3>But it's not like a psychoactive levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you eat it,</v>

411
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
<v Speaker 3>it's processed by your body and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>produces this fucking insane chemical </v>

412
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.230
<v Speaker 3>that's like four times more psychoactive</v>
<v Speaker 3>than thc.</v>

413
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.790
<v Speaker 3>That's why when you eat pot sewing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

414
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.560
<v Speaker 3>Those brownies or cookies gave us and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicago Shit.</v>

415
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Even fucking Joey Diaz freaked out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

416
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Joey DSSD had a mild heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the first time.</v>

417
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.970
<v Speaker 3>We're all still high the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you wake up,</v>

418
00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:01.770
<v Speaker 3>you're just kind of like shuffling your </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>

419
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Feel sort of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're still tired until it hits </v>

420
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:06.800
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not.</v>

421
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 3>You're too high to think it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're like,</v>

422
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so hot.</v>

423
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I reevaluated my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really did.</v>

424
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 3>I made some life changing decisions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

425
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.090
<v Speaker 3>I was so fucking gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally,</v>

426
00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was very,</v>

427
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:22.230
<v Speaker 3>very similar to taking mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar,</v>

428
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 3>just just as intense and just go into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different place.</v>

429
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:26.220
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

430
00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:27.360
<v Speaker 3>this is strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

431
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 3>how I knew it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

432
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:31.410
<v Speaker 3>really strong is my laid in the bed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I close my eyes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And the hallucinations were insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all.</v>

<v Speaker 3>becoming different things and fucking </v>

436
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.820
<v Speaker 3>each other and becoming different things</v>
<v Speaker 3>if fucking each other and becoming </v>

437
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:48.820
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was insane and they were like,</v>

438
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.540
<v Speaker 3>the cartoon characters were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a glowing,</v>

439
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:55.020
<v Speaker 3>almost like a neon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The handling big glowing neon quality to</v>

440
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:56.940
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they look like someone drew them,</v>

441

<v Speaker 3>like a half an hour.</v>

443
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.760
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 1>getting sick and stuff.</v>

446
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Then I resorted to bed and it was weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I went into like stages of like </v>

<v Speaker 1>I was going inside out or something.</v>

449
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like seven things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was in a cycle,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like it kept on doing it.</v>

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way to really do it right is to not </v>

<v Speaker 3>smoke pot for a long time and then below</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

519
00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:34.100
<v Speaker 1>She's just a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How bad was Ohio's?</v>

520
00:23:34.101 --> 00:23:35.370
<v Speaker 1>We'd compared to California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

521
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.480
<v Speaker 1>it was Mexican brick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>

522

<v Speaker 1>Is that where it's compressed where at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least you like this.</v>

523
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't have much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd left,</v>

524
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.920
<v Speaker 1>but that one break you're just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling out long time ago,</v>

525
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's gotten better and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind</v>

526
00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 3>of in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's used again,</v>

527
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.590
<v Speaker 3>address broker back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was probably always existed.</v>

528
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.160
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

529
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:54.340
<v Speaker 3>the people that get arrested for drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it,</v>

530
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:59.350
<v Speaker 3>are we speeding?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a life sentence in your car </v>

531
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.910
<v Speaker 3>while you're doing something stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like throw,</v>

532
00:24:00.911 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 3>always talking on the phone without </v>
<v Speaker 3>using a headset or.</v>

533
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:08.201
<v Speaker 3>And they get pulled over for that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also in the cops like why do I smell </v>

534
00:24:08.201 --> 00:24:08.201
<v Speaker 3>weed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

535
00:24:08.201 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 3>And then he popped the trunk and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a fucking giant brick of weed in the</v>

536
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:16.301
<v Speaker 3>back or you're parked on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road with your door open and a girl </v>

537
00:24:16.301 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 3>sitting on your lap and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

538
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:18.500
<v Speaker 3>why do you have a gun in the backseat of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your car?</v>

539
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Why you so nervous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sweating?</v>

540
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.860
<v Speaker 3>What is it about these fucking trucks to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get busted?</v>

541
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.400
<v Speaker 3>And they have like 100 million dollars </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the weed,</v>

542
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.240
<v Speaker 3>like giant fucking semis.</v>

543
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Like how crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a big gamble.</v>

544
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Let's take a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>US get through,</v>

545
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I've been a lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They must get through.</v>

546
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.560
<v Speaker 3>I bet 90 percent of them get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They busted one of them in Arizona </v>

547
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 3>because the guy had a ups drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was ups trucks stolen.</v>

548
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't real.</v>

549
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.110
<v Speaker 3>It was a forge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fake ups truck.</v>

550
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:53.170
<v Speaker 3>They made a ups truck with fake numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just took the numbers from one of the </v>

551
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:53.170
<v Speaker 3>other ups trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wrote it down.</v>

552
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.370
<v Speaker 3>They recreated a fucking nice truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

553
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.510
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why are they going to do it?</v>

554
00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:59.020
<v Speaker 3>But because the cops ran the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>number that was on it,</v>

555
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:04.030
<v Speaker 3>they were speeding or doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cops ran the number that was on it </v>

556
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.840
<v Speaker 3>and it turns out it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the wrong truck.</v>

557
00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.530
<v Speaker 3>It was so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

558
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:07.560
<v Speaker 3>we're in Michigan match.</v>

559
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.810
<v Speaker 3>It didn't match for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they decided to pull them up.</v>

560
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.780
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull this guy over.</v>

561
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:14.360
<v Speaker 3>He's got a giant fucking truckload a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

562
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean they just decided to pretend that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're delivering for ups.</v>

563
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would check it.</v>

564
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.450
<v Speaker 3>They probably got away with it a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>load of times,</v>

565
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.890
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one guy just got a little care </v>

566
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:28.890
<v Speaker 3>list and started driving fast and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>got Boston.</v>

567
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:29.620
<v Speaker 3>They always get complacent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get away with it,</v>

568
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:35.410
<v Speaker 3>totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you feel like I'm not going to get </v>

569
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:35.410
<v Speaker 3>caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

570
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:40.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that becomes part of the thrill of </v>

571
00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:40.090
<v Speaker 3>it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for people.</v>

572
00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.261
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted to crime and they think that </v>

573
00:25:44.261 --> 00:25:44.670
<v Speaker 3>crime like selling weed or do anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal where you,</v>

574
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really even pay taxes on it.</v>

575
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.060
<v Speaker 3>Think there's a fucking a wild outlawed </v>
<v Speaker 3>real to that shit.</v>

576
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people love living like that.</v>

577
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.470
<v Speaker 3>But those mother fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be around them.</v>

578
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:57.550
<v Speaker 3>They're going to blow up like that shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not going to last like you're,</v>

579
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:02.580
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these guys would destroy with like </v>

696
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.230
<v Speaker 3>really dumb hack shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Mitch Hedberg regard whether </v>

697
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:23.200
<v Speaker 3>it's really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unique act,</v>

698
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that like on paper isn't even funny,</v>

699
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:25.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

700
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 3>it's got some great stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an interesting way of delivering,</v>

701
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:35.460
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very much you have to set it up </v>

702
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:35.460
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>

703
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.370
<v Speaker 3>You can't have some guy going up singing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dancing and having a full audience </v>

704
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.810
<v Speaker 3>clap along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Hedberg who just basically </v>

705
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.300
<v Speaker 3>stands there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doubletree hotel,</v>

706
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:50.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's got like all these weird jokes </v>

707
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:50.491
<v Speaker 3>that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just so,</v>

708
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:50.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so uniquely him.</v>

709
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:51.730
<v Speaker 3>But you got to set it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

710
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

711
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.690
<v Speaker 3>that's part of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let people go there.</v>

712
00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:56.590
<v Speaker 3>God can follow that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that,</v>

713
00:31:56.591 --> 00:32:01.591
<v Speaker 3>that guy's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means that they're actually aren't </v>

714
00:32:01.591 --> 00:32:02.560
<v Speaker 3>compatible if people don't have a harder</v>
<v Speaker 3>time following the other people.</v>

715
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.830
<v Speaker 3>But those people would have a harder </v>
<v Speaker 3>time following people that I don't know.</v>

716
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes titles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guys like really super </v>

717
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.710
<v Speaker 3>cerebral and really wordy and doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>swear and Israeli,</v>

718
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:19.920
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you go up and you want to talk </v>

719
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:19.920
<v Speaker 3>about get your Dick sucked.</v>

720
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:19.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>

721
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck earns for some reason and we're </v>

722
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 3>killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would always do well when other people</v>

723
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.210
<v Speaker 3>are killing that I have trouble and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't.</v>

724
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just styles.</v>

725
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey used to have his,</v>

726
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.990
<v Speaker 3>his jenks used to be a Jamal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember?</v>

727
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was amazing.</v>

728
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Incredible timing agents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most such a proud man.</v>

729
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.140
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his timing was just so perfect.</v>

730
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:48.160
<v Speaker 3>You hear the same jokes 10 times in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>row and he's still would laugh and for </v>

731
00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.641
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason I think that just got </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside Joey's head because Joey wasn't </v>

732
00:32:51.641 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 3>that kind of a guy who wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 3>technician,</v>

733
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.890
<v Speaker 3>like a j.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamal just had that perfect timing.</v>

734
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.770
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he would do it,</v>

735
00:32:57.771 --> 00:33:01.250
<v Speaker 3>like you would just be recovered from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last job and then the next one would</v>

736
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:01.760
<v Speaker 3>hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we,</v>

737
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:02.900
<v Speaker 3>he do the right time.</v>

738
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:08.110
<v Speaker 3>Like why we're still appreciating that </v>
<v Speaker 3>show and then other one hits you and he </v>

739
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.490
<v Speaker 3>would hit you with these waves and jelly</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just a,</v>

740
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like stream of consciousness guy</v>

741
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:17.830
<v Speaker 3>which just go up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a couple ideas of some jokes he </v>

742
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.830
<v Speaker 3>would talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he want to just fuck around.</v>

743
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find,</v>

744
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:23.110
<v Speaker 3>find the material onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it bothered him with this guy </v>

745
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.110
<v Speaker 3>was like so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

746
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.380
<v Speaker 3>so rigid and that used to bother me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot too.</v>

747
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.390
<v Speaker 3>And I had a really strong impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was really strong and well done.</v>

748
00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:33.140
<v Speaker 3>It would make me insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

749
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.650
<v Speaker 3>what is mine that good and I'm not doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's doing.</v>

750
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Have trouble falling asleep if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>does real real well with crowd work.</v>

751
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:42.810
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because then that's my</v>

752
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.290
<v Speaker 6>pull up move and gives some power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then it's like,</v>

753
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:47.520
<v Speaker 6>well he just did it already.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He did it better than you.</v>

754
00:33:47.521 --> 00:33:49.860
<v Speaker 6>It's not my one cheat move his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>taken away</v>

755
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.240
<v Speaker 3>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

756
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crowd was a good move.</v>

757
00:33:53.511 --> 00:33:56.280
<v Speaker 3>If you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've got a position to go to it.</v>

758
00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say the job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

759
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.940
<v Speaker 3>there's one that you do where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:34:00.941 --> 00:34:02.140
<v Speaker 3>you talked to a check in the audience </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

761
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

762
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.350
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wait for it.</v>

763
00:34:06.351 --> 00:34:11.351
<v Speaker 3>Like when you started talking about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I go here comes like if you're </v>

764
00:34:11.351 --> 00:34:11.960
<v Speaker 3>in a tricky situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he bust that one out.</v>

765
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 3>That's just a crack in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

766
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.320
<v Speaker 3>but those are nice to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really no different than any other </v>

767
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.590
<v Speaker 3>kind of job that you're gonna just mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're recreating the moment,</v>

768
00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

769
00:34:22.131 --> 00:34:24.830
<v Speaker 3>you're saying it all like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking it right there and then.</v>

770
00:34:24.831 --> 00:34:26.660
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of it is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said many,</v>

771
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:31.661
<v Speaker 3>many times before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just got to keep it as organic as </v>

772
00:34:31.661 --> 00:34:31.661
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The electrode,</v>

773
00:34:31.661 --> 00:34:35.000
<v Speaker 3>because it sets my mouth to be like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a real clock on.</v>

774
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.640
<v Speaker 3>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

775
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.340
<v Speaker 6>Why jokes on went to the store.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds gross.</v>

776
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:42.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

777
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:47.940
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When is it ever sound grosser than when </v>

778
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.520
<v Speaker 3>you're in a tiny little audience?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a audience,</v>

779
00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:53.590
<v Speaker 3>like three people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see all the problems with your </v>

780
00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:57.091
<v Speaker 3>material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tiny audiences are really good to </v>

781
00:34:57.091 --> 00:34:57.091
<v Speaker 3>do because when you perform in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like three people,</v>

782
00:34:57.091 --> 00:35:00.070
<v Speaker 3>it's so uncomfortable that you're making</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person talk to you.</v>

783
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.130
<v Speaker 3>The illusion of a crowd is just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

784
00:35:03.131 --> 00:35:05.520
<v Speaker 3>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prefer for two ones,</v>

785
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.660
<v Speaker 3>two people at danger fields in New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>City,</v>

786
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.690
<v Speaker 3>and it was one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the weirdest feeling.</v>

787
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.440
<v Speaker 3>It makes you snip out the fat and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes.</v>

788
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:19.650
<v Speaker 3>It makes you get to the point quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You respect their attention span more </v>

789
00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.070
<v Speaker 3>because it's more ridiculous for you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>require them to listen to you,</v>

790
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.230
<v Speaker 3>but you also can't pretend like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a pause.</v>

791
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:25.380
<v Speaker 3>That might be setting their theatrical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even a good word.</v>

792
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even do it now.</v>

793
00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.800
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just seems really fucking weird.</v>

794
00:35:29.801 --> 00:35:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Fucking fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find out what the fake shit is.</v>

795
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.470
<v Speaker 3>You can do a pause if you're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that way.</v>

796
00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.030
<v Speaker 3>You know if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

797
00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a moment you app.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

798
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

799
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 3>What is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

800
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:47.750
<v Speaker 3>There is a real moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a real opportunity for a moment </v>

801
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.750
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it has to be real.</v>

802
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.561
<v Speaker 3>I think very often we write stuff and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>write it and we say it in a way we just </v>

803
00:35:51.561 --> 00:35:55.551
<v Speaker 3>know it's going to kill you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not necessarily the way you'd </v>

804
00:35:55.551 --> 00:35:55.551
<v Speaker 3>say it in front of a small group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

805
00:35:55.551 --> 00:35:57.300
<v Speaker 3>It's good to clean your act up with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

806
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.360
<v Speaker 3>It's good to do shows where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't impressed too.</v>

807
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Like that's why it's good to do those </v>
<v Speaker 3>improv shows like those Wednesday night </v>

808
00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 3>shows because they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Ain't gonna be there.</v>

809

<v Speaker 3>I fucked your mom three times.</v>

927
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teams.</v>

928
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:34.490
<v Speaker 3>But for comics and for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fun exercise.</v>

929
00:40:34.491 --> 00:40:39.491
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when people know that you do </v>

930
00:40:39.491 --> 00:40:39.491
<v Speaker 3>like to get mad at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

931
00:40:39.491 --> 00:40:41.410
<v Speaker 3>who wouldn't asshole?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's calling this guy loser.</v>

932
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're a fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think you're fucking bad ass because</v>

933
00:40:44.121 --> 00:40:45.380
<v Speaker 3>you're on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

934
00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm just practicing dealing with Douche </v>
<v Speaker 3>bags.</v>

935
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're like online hecklers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the same thing as a heckler in</v>

936
00:40:50.911 --> 00:40:55.911
<v Speaker 3>an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really the same thing and just </v>

937
00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:55.911
<v Speaker 3>breaking them down for a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fun.</v>

938
00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I wish he would throw it </v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

939
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it online anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to.</v>

940
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.220
<v Speaker 3>It's just so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're,</v>

941
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:08.260
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're deciding to get upset and to </v>

942
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.290
<v Speaker 3>enter into this little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little competition with someone who</v>

943
00:41:09.291 --> 00:41:11.570
<v Speaker 3>you don't know who chooses to interact </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

944
00:41:11.571 --> 00:41:16.571
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way they choose to interact </v>

945
00:41:16.571 --> 00:41:18.371
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They choose to attack you and you're </v>

946
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:18.371
<v Speaker 3>just going to submit to that and start </v>
<v Speaker 3>going back and forth,</v>

947
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:20.510
<v Speaker 3>and that's ridiculous that they win </v>
<v Speaker 3>right away.</v>

948
00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:25.511
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just part of being in the public </v>

949
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:25.790
<v Speaker 3>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of being an entertainer.</v>

950
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.590
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate you.</v>

951
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.440
<v Speaker 3>That's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you get back involved,</v>

952
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.370
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll show them up.</v>

953
00:41:31.371 --> 00:41:33.380
<v Speaker 3>You won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter what energy,</v>

954
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a waste of energy.</v>

955
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Unless you can do it and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>having fun and it's good natured and you</v>

956
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:44.561
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you do it just for shits and </v>

957
00:41:44.561 --> 00:41:44.561
<v Speaker 3>giggles.</v>

958
00:41:44.561 --> 00:41:47.590
<v Speaker 3>As long as it's good nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're really getting upset and </v>

959
00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:47.590
<v Speaker 3>you're really trying to hurt their </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings,</v>

960
00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:52.191
<v Speaker 3>so my role is to is if you will just </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to show them the error of their </v>

961
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:52.191
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never will.</v>

962
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Speaker 3>They'll never see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Felt.</v>

963
00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Think that they showed you up some rare </v>
<v Speaker 3>for like a reflective moment,</v>

964
00:41:59.091 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 3>like you know what man you might be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to with with no aggression.</v>

965
00:42:03.081 --> 00:42:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Like you might be able to show someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like just,</v>

966
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very calm way.</v>

967
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:09.050
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard for them to accept it,</v>

968
00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:14.051
<v Speaker 3>but the occasional person will accept </v>
<v Speaker 3>the occasional person who's just </v>

969
00:42:14.051 --> 00:42:14.051
<v Speaker 3>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people mad.</v>

970
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:19.060
<v Speaker 3>The reason why they lash out is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>really they just want someone to love </v>

971
00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:19.060
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one loves them.</v>

972
00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:23.170
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is all a lot of fucking humans </v>

973
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:23.170
<v Speaker 3>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

974
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that they live </v>
<v Speaker 3>these terrible fucking lives.</v>

975
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who it was.</v>

976
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:30.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it was some fucking famous guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralph Emerson.</v>

977
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember who it was her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is this quote.</v>

978
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:40.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goddammit.</v>

979

<v Speaker 6>Got To A.</v>

<v Speaker 6>supermarket parking lot because we're </v>

981
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.030

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

982
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:50.570

<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

983
00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:51.500
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

984
00:42:51.501 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 6>I bet you got to an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone's going the right way.</v>

985
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.080
<v Speaker 6>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anything quote?</v>

986
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.210
<v Speaker 6>What was it was November.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember too much weed.</v>

987
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.330
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tempe,</v>

988
00:43:04.331 --> 00:43:05.220
<v Speaker 6>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This clicker.</v>

989
00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 6>And there's been a lot of good questions</v>
<v Speaker 6>or the questions.</v>

990
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.610
<v Speaker 6>Give us one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian sent it out loud.</v>

991
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.130
<v Speaker 6>Start talking about comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

992
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.900
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how,</v>

993
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.020
<v Speaker 6>what are the other questions in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>question for them?</v>

994
00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to watch it float if </v>

995
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.970
<v Speaker 6>you're not enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just fucking gone.</v>

996
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I give up on the Oscars when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

997
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.720
<v Speaker 1>in the bedroom last to that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible mine or whatever.</v>

998
00:43:39.721 --> 00:43:42.230
<v Speaker 1>The split personality going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

999
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than Avatar.</v>

1000
00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 1>And that just hurts my soul because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that you like the hurt locker,</v>

1001
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.310
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hurts me to why?</v>

1002
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Because especially when the boring ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking movie and I just can't </v>

1003
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:59.040
<v Speaker 1>understand why everyone thinks it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next awesome thing if the movie they</v>

1004
00:43:59.041 --> 00:44:01.470
<v Speaker 1>like or don't like when some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>award one.</v>

1005
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Because then there's a movie like Avatar</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just something brand new.</v>

1006
00:44:04.621 --> 00:44:09.621
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced anything like </v>

1007
00:44:09.621 --> 00:44:13.431
<v Speaker 1>this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get an appetite depression when </v>

1008
00:44:13.431 --> 00:44:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you found out it wasn't real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole thing with that.</v>

1009
00:44:15.031 --> 00:44:18.160
<v Speaker 1>People miss that because it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of depression,</v>

1010
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen it once,</v>

1011
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.020
<v Speaker 1>minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw it three times.</v>

1012
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:26.021
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just saying I thought together.</v>

1013
00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:30.460
<v Speaker 1>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1014
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.620
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun movie.</v>

1015
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.370
<v Speaker 3>It was like a God damn comic book or </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to the common man.</v>

1016
00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 3>It's just like the Pocahontas so shut </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1017
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

1018
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 3>I like stories that wrap up nice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>neat.</v>

1019
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say that shit shorty.</v>

1020
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Shorter Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1021
00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1022
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:50.121
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they pointed out that that was a </v>

1023
00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:50.121
<v Speaker 1>little out of a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

1024
00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:54.051
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No good reason I care is because it </v>

1025
00:44:54.051 --> 00:44:54.051
<v Speaker 1>seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1026
00:44:54.051 --> 00:44:54.120
<v Speaker 1>you saw the same movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw.</v>

1027
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:58.170
<v Speaker 1>You think that was enough to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That window.</v>

1028
00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm on a brave,</v>

1029
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.440
<v Speaker 1>like a wave length.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people's intelligence and how </v>

1030
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:06.440
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking and that just blows it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the water.</v>

1031
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a million movies</v>

1032
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.430
<v Speaker 3>better than hurt locker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I liked the hurt locker math.</v>

1033
00:45:10.431 --> 00:45:11.510
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be the year.</v>

1034
00:45:11.511 --> 00:45:13.160
<v Speaker 3>You know what I didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1035
00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.690
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a unique movie.</v>

1036
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.300
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1037
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:21.310
<v Speaker 3>I think probably because of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're in this middle is unpopular </v>

1038
00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:23.430
<v Speaker 3>war and it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was actually art at a point.</v>

1039
00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I think so pointless will warn you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1040
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a solution.</v>

1041
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.250
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra special treatment.</v>

1042
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if this was done and who knows,</v>

1043
00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:38.830
<v Speaker 3>it could be done during the year where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no water will reflect on how we </v>

1044
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:40.130
<v Speaker 3>don't have more movies all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it was pretty good.</v>

1045
00:45:40.131 --> 00:45:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really liked it.</v>

1046
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:46.390
<v Speaker 3>I've watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Granted while being held captive on a </v>

1047
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.390
<v Speaker 3>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1048
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.820
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't go anywhere else in my seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't go anywhere.</v>

1049
00:45:46.821 --> 00:45:51.821
<v Speaker 3>And so I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was actually looking forward to it </v>

1050
00:45:51.821 --> 00:45:51.821
<v Speaker 3>because I've heard a lot of people said </v>
<v Speaker 3>good things about it.</v>

1051
00:45:51.821 --> 00:45:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was interesting.</v>

1052
00:45:53.121 --> 00:45:54.560
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know too much about it,</v>

1053
00:45:54.561 --> 00:45:56.990
<v Speaker 3>so that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know any spoilers.</v>

1054
00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:00.830
<v Speaker 3>It captivated me the whole way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That movie took place four years ago.</v>

1055
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That scene of that movie.</v>

1056
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.880
<v Speaker 3>But here at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's playing xbox 30,</v>

1057
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.240
<v Speaker 3>60 fucking funny.</v>

1058
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.820

<v Speaker 3>Well that's interesting man.</v>

1061
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:26.300
<v Speaker 3>So did you read about this online or did</v>
<v Speaker 3>you figure it out yourself?</v>

1062

<v Speaker 3>Easter egg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1072
00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I just watched one really slow mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a little more crazy actually.</v>

1073
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I never knew what the fuck was </v>

1074
00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:56.940
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be exciting and you shot two</v>

1075
00:46:56.941 --> 00:47:01.941
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the first time you did not fucking </v>

1076
00:47:01.941 --> 00:47:01.941
<v Speaker 3>know that I was not going to blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1077
00:47:01.941 --> 00:47:02.850
<v Speaker 3>and it was very scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a part in the beginning of the</v>

1078
00:47:02.851 --> 00:47:05.640
<v Speaker 3>movie when that guy blows up spoiled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of shit that happened.</v>

1079
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never felt the tension.</v>

1080
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tension though.</v>

1081
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It was an excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting Jack what you're saying.</v>

1082
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.340
<v Speaker 1>There were a couple of times we'd feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic but.</v>

1083
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.410
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of it was slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was slow.</v>

1084
00:47:18.411 --> 00:47:23.411
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The attention perks I guess with dental </v>

1085
00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:23.411
<v Speaker 1>work and they failed.</v>

1086
00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't stones.</v>

1087
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.530
<v Speaker 3>They succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to be.</v>

1088
00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:27.890
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't.</v>

1089
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 3>I was totally sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1090
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.410
<v Speaker 1>was in bed going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was at the movie theater,</v>

1091
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.810
<v Speaker 1>a movie theater and I didn't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1092
00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1093
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.300
<v Speaker 1>You in the ship copy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was at Blue Ray pop.</v>

1094
00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Rick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was at the Imax theater and </v>

1095
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:51.140
<v Speaker 1>three days to fuck Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the Ria?</v>

1096
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Busted down your doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took you out of here.</v>

1097
00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:57.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't have anything illegal on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1098
00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:02.490
<v Speaker 1>just everything about that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we're getting really close </v>

1099
00:48:04.001 --> 00:48:09.001
<v Speaker 1>to the point where you can just download</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and put it directly on your TV and </v>

1100
00:48:09.001 --> 00:48:10.230
<v Speaker 1>super high quality in real time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were there,</v>

1101
00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:15.530
<v Speaker 1>but I mean like I heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do really easily with Mac Minis </v>

1102
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.160
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that and make money with </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

1103
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are still going to the movies,</v>

1104
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1105
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1106
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 1>it'd be nice if everyone else does </v>
<v Speaker 1>except me.</v>

1107
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.420
<v Speaker 1>People still down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1108
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Was there any copies of Avatar online </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere?</v>

1109
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people still went to see </v>

1110
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.491
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point is that you will </v>

1111
00:48:38.491 --> 00:48:38.491
<v Speaker 1>download like stupid comedies and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1112
00:48:38.491 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not paying to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking downloads with Sony.</v>

1113
00:48:40.481 --> 00:48:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Has a new TV coming out that's a three d</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV right out of a mall.</v>

1114
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.500
<v Speaker 1>It comes out this summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1115
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:49.240
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put goggles on.</v>

1116
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:54.241
<v Speaker 1>They have a battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you press a button and these guys are </v>

1117
00:48:54.241 --> 00:48:54.241
<v Speaker 1>playing soccer and the ball is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>flying.</v>

1118
00:48:54.241 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 1>It models the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV's wacky.</v>

1119
00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.290
<v Speaker 1>My other goggles on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at it like,</v>

1120
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:04.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you look at right now it's a capable </v>

1121
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.541
<v Speaker 1>of Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Hook up a computer to it and it </v>

1122
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:08.440
<v Speaker 1>renders anything in three d into three d</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like that.</v>

1123
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.830
<v Speaker 1>So when Avatar comes out on three d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that until it gets to.</v>

1124
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:17.070
<v Speaker 1>But so I'm not going to buy those </v>
<v Speaker 1>goggles and programming is like for us,</v>

1125
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.740
<v Speaker 1>the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that coming through?</v>

1126
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the crazy.</v>

1127
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the three d is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch on program,</v>

1128
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but how many people you might think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

1129
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:28.560
<v Speaker 1>but you know how many people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1130
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy a whole new tv just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have this three d.</v>

1131
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 1>especially after they've made us all </v>
<v Speaker 1>bond new ones.</v>

1132
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>HDTV took a long blue rays.</v>

1133
00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Barely still kept holding on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1134
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:43.080
<v Speaker 1>That's true because regular TV still </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks pretty fucking bad ass and people </v>

1135
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:43.080

<v Speaker 1>how much better is it?</v>

1136
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Really Bucks instead of 20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1137
00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:50.370
<v Speaker 1>in this economy you pay 20 bucks and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the right middle one could give a </v>

1138
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:53.401
<v Speaker 1>shit and honestly three d to me man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even when I go to the imax movie </v>

<v Speaker 1>theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still kinda like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1142
00:49:56.211 --> 00:50:01.211

<v Speaker 1>some caulk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go run.</v>

1144
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:07.070
<v Speaker 1>In San Francisco it's getting better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>better on to wherever the hardest cock </v>

1146
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:13.411
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still feel like they're looking </v>

1147
00:50:13.411 --> 00:50:13.510
<v Speaker 1>through something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it still hasn't gotten to the point</v>

1148
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:16.270
<v Speaker 1>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely disagree.</v>

1149
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I go to that movie theater and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't feel perfect,</v>

1150
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:24.270
<v Speaker 1>but I've put those glasses on and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched those dudes in Avatar floating </v>

1151
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.270
<v Speaker 1>inside that room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is awesome.</v>

1153
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 1>That movie is an event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just</v>

1154
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:33.040
<v Speaker 3>a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just you go and watch a bunch </v>

1155
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:33.040
<v Speaker 3>of shit happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that's great about Avatar,</v>

1156
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 3>it's like a Goddamn comic book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1157
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:37.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a super ride at universal city walk</v>

1158
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of the things I said about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1159
00:50:39.171 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 3>like the acting is Kinda clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1160
00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.780
<v Speaker 3>so going weaver sounds like she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nailing it in a bunch of times.</v>

1161
00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gave you the fuck up.</v>

1162
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on guys.</v>

1163
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Are we serious here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's my cigarette?</v>

1164
00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:51.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1165
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.980
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like the kind of acting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see in those rides at universal city</v>

1166
00:50:55.981 --> 00:50:57.650
<v Speaker 3>walk like right before you go on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ride.</v>

1167
00:50:57.651 --> 00:51:02.651
<v Speaker 3>They make you watch them back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future clip where they explained what </v>

1168
00:51:02.651 --> 00:51:02.960
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were in a bad situation guys.</v>

1169
00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.620
<v Speaker 2>We've got to get through the tone for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nuclear bomb.</v>

1170
00:51:05.621 --> 00:51:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Looks like just don't much time please </v>
<v Speaker 2>in an orderly fashion.</v>

1171
00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Hurry up and get into your chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My popcorn wasn't laying when,</v>

1172
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:19.500
<v Speaker 2>when they said when all the other armies</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out to fight them and was like,</v>

1173
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:24.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got all the other risk about like </v>

1174
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.510
<v Speaker 2>what we were there the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about them.</v>

1175
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:28.050
<v Speaker 2>They're right over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why don't you just get them earlier?</v>

1176
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you guys doing in order </v>

1177
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:34.050
<v Speaker 1>for it to really work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all,</v>

1178
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:38.231
<v Speaker 1>these places that bought their hd </v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras now have to buy three d cameras </v>

1179
00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:43.380
<v Speaker 1>and like all these shows have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmed a different way and that's going </v>

1180
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:43.380
<v Speaker 1>to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

1181
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:43.790
<v Speaker 1>because he used to have to do black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

1182
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:49.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did black and white with black </v>

1183
00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:49.090
<v Speaker 1>color who hasn't called hd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of go,</v>

1184
00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:50.570
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't ended up happened already?</v>

1185
00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Because the media has been huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next technology isn't that </v>

1186
00:51:59.050 --> 00:51:59.530
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1187
00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.310
<v Speaker 1>During the black and white early color </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of television,</v>

1188
00:52:02.311 --> 00:52:04.160
<v Speaker 1>when you first saw the red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would probably.</v>

1189
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.340
<v Speaker 2>This is a break year to someone who saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>jaws.</v>

1190
00:52:07.341 --> 00:52:12.341
<v Speaker 2>Three d theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shark comes at you like,</v>

1191
00:52:13.721 --> 00:52:13.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1192
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:20.190
<v Speaker 1>it's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then you also thought video games </v>

1193
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:22.370
<v Speaker 1>were like this that were like amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why things improve and technology</v>

1194
00:52:22.371 --> 00:52:24.440
<v Speaker 1>advances and that's why three days </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally come into its own.</v>

1195
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I just think that three d would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been popular.</v>

1196
00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:31.880
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you got greedy.</v>

1197
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the future for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movies away.</v>

1198
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Way more excited when they're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>greedy way.</v>

1199
00:52:36.641 --> 00:52:37.830
<v Speaker 2>More interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more layered.</v>

1200
00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard the video.</v>

1201
00:52:41.461 --> 00:52:41.550
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

1202
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:44.990
<v Speaker 1>visuals are incredibly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you read the article on in Gadget?</v>

1203
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:50.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy told me puts a detailed review </v>

1204
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:50.520
<v Speaker 1>of the white sox and red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes so much sense.</v>

1205
00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the director use layers in the </v>

1206
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.251
<v Speaker 1>movie in certain ways to give an effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of depth and then the three d comes in </v>

1207
00:52:58.251 --> 00:53:02.310
<v Speaker 1>there and changes what he was doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposedly just does not work.</v>

1208
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:06.360
<v Speaker 1>So it would be cool if you saw it today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

1209
00:53:06.361 --> 00:53:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1210
00:53:07.021 --> 00:53:12.021
<v Speaker 1>That's what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't filmed for three d and that's </v>

1211
00:53:12.021 --> 00:53:14.781
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these avatar was avatar was </v>

1212
00:53:14.781 --> 00:53:15.840
<v Speaker 1>burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does Not know his films being filmed for</v>

1213
00:53:15.841 --> 00:53:16.400
<v Speaker 1>three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1214
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:16.680
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1215
00:53:16.681 --> 00:53:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not film it for Three d movie.</v>

1216
00:53:19.171 --> 00:53:24.171
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm trying to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avatar was filmed in the regard that </v>

1217
00:53:24.171 --> 00:53:25.850
<v Speaker 1>they filmed it as a two d movie and made</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it for three.</v>

1218
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1219
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1220
00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to see it.</v>

1221
00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:34.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these shit would have to be filmed </v>

1222
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:34.980
<v Speaker 1>in three d and it's going to take a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people to go,</v>

1223
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.140
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to spend his whole movie being a</v>

1224
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:38.700
<v Speaker 1>three d movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like jaws,</v>

1225
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:40.890
<v Speaker 1>three d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to go back with your crazy,</v>

1226
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:45.920
<v Speaker 1>listen to me dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna do it for every single </v>

1227
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.051
<v Speaker 1>gigantic explosive and it wouldn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to make them much more so I </v>

1228
00:53:48.051 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't make sense for every monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie in Three d,</v>

1229
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:53.880
<v Speaker 1>so they will make way more than two days</v>
<v Speaker 1>and three days.</v>

1230
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Second sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1231
00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Because I do both doing a ton more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do both at the same time because</v>

1232
00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:03.770
<v Speaker 1>just theater just hypes up the sales of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two.</v>

1233
00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:08.790
<v Speaker 1>They had to rerelease jobs three and non</v>
<v Speaker 1>three d because it didn't do so fucking </v>

1234
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:13.700
<v Speaker 1>terrible fucking thing came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like there's only like one effect</v>

1235
00:54:14.371 --> 00:54:14.550
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1236
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so dumb.</v>

1237
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one effect the shark coming at you.</v>

1238
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 1>It was like such a stupid ass moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1239
00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Speaker 1>we're not in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got it stopped,</v>

1240
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's my bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're what?</v>

1241
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I think three days going to be fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think's going to skip </v>

1242
00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:30.920
<v Speaker 1>through them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's next?</v>

1243
00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Like more better than that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejection.</v>

1244
00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Hologram in your house type shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1245
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that's coming to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right,</v>

1246
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
<v Speaker 1>but I think until that does come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is pretty fucking so it's going to </v>

1247
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.760
<v Speaker 1>come more where a wall like paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>LCD technology where this whole wall is </v>

1248
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.190
<v Speaker 1>going to be like computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large size.</v>

1249
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:55.690
<v Speaker 1>This screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it'll ever get to a point </v>

1250
00:54:55.831 --> 00:55:00.831
<v Speaker 1>where everything is controlled by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice or you think that that's just </v>

1251
00:55:00.831 --> 00:55:03.930
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about if you don't want to </v>

1252
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:03.930
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if it's late at night?</v>

1253
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Because my password,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like on password xxx.</v>

1254
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:12.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet we'd have another interface or </v>

1255
00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:12.100
<v Speaker 3>keyboard or something.</v>

1256
00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1257
00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:16.510
<v Speaker 1>You just go up to the keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will keep be here or do you think </v>

1258
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:17.740
<v Speaker 1>divorce recognition will get so good </v>
<v Speaker 1>that be irrelevant?</v>

1259
00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I think eventually it will get so good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

1260
00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you use voice technology at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever use it?</v>

1261
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I used it briefly on my android and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was amazing.</v>

1262
00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:29.240
<v Speaker 1>It was way better than I've ever used </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1263
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:31.940
<v Speaker 1>It was personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep hearing about that because it's,</v>

1264
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:32.830
<v Speaker 1>it's okay</v>

1265
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:35.090
<v Speaker 3>with some things.</v>

1275
00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:01.290

<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

1276
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:05.280
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like a instead of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that when you do it in a car,</v>

1277
00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:07.590
<v Speaker 3>it's a speakerphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like talking to Chris.</v>

1278
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.230
<v Speaker 3>So what I always do is I would do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight from the phone.</v>

1279
00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.240
<v Speaker 3>So you're talking right into that little</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny Mc.</v>

1280
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty direct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems pretty accurate enough.</v>

1281
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:18.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it beats having to press buttons.</v>

1282
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to press buttons when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving.</v>

1283
00:56:20.011 --> 00:56:22.260
<v Speaker 3>It's all come through the Bluetooth so </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1284
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 3>Because that's one of the coolest ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that you could have a,</v>

1285
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:30.750
<v Speaker 3>you could drive in your car and talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>to people on the phone with both hands </v>

1286
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:30.750
<v Speaker 3>on the steering wheel nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about this company </v>
<v Speaker 1>overseas?</v>

<v Speaker 1>being made for that 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>each.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And you only go five feet off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Just keep fucking with whatever freaks </v>

1298
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:09.581
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to have some sort of a </v>

1299
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:09.581
<v Speaker 1>parachute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1300
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1301
00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.160
<v Speaker 1>extra weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine we dropped down so much fucking </v>

1302
00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:16.160
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1303
00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.800
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mother fucker planned out and just </v>

1304
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.270
<v Speaker 1>say how many toilets were recalled in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan last night in San Diego?</v>

1305
00:57:23.271 --> 00:57:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy couldn't stop and the police</v>

1306
00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:28.730
<v Speaker 1>got to the side of it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just gets peers,</v>

1307
00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:33.740
<v Speaker 1>like hit the power button up and the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was kept on hitting the power button </v>

1308
00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.060
<v Speaker 1>when working was standing on the break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said just like full blast.</v>

1309
00:57:35.061 --> 00:57:38.960
<v Speaker 1>She'd go in and do and then he put his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it,</v>

1310
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:42.200
<v Speaker 1>but I think it has something to do where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just won't let you do anything.</v>

1311
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the cop had to get in front of </v>

1312
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:47.340
<v Speaker 1>them and I guess in like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1313
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:47.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of break his car.</v>

1314
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing that's standard clutch,</v>

1315
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta put it in yourself,</v>

1316
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.380
<v Speaker 1>go down that way.</v>

1317
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:56.570
<v Speaker 1>We have a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a manual transmission,</v>

1318
00:57:56.571 --> 00:57:58.760
<v Speaker 1>you can always put it into zero and into</v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral.</v>

1319
00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.190
<v Speaker 1>But the emergency brake doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1320
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe the computer wouldn't let </v>

1321
00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:05.330
<v Speaker 1>the transmission to switch gears and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency brake,</v>

1322
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.410
<v Speaker 1>mercy break doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was on a broker,</v>

1323
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.960

<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1324
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:14.070

<v Speaker 1>And not to even try.</v>

1325
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:19.140
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1326
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:21.580
<v Speaker 1>George Lucas says that he's found things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are wrong with the Prius and he </v>

1327
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:24.821
<v Speaker 1>says it's a software issue that he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>duplicate George,</v>

1328
00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.730
<v Speaker 1>not George Lucas,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he has a Prius and he said that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>an issue with the accelerator and the </v>

1334
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Incan replicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could do like a specific number of </v>

1335

1339
00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:57.400
<v Speaker 3>shows them how to do it because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a software issue.</v>

1447
01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:10.410

1448
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:13.410
<v Speaker 3>Barry Seal's was a guy who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1449
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:18.560
<v Speaker 3>a drug runner who would fly drugs in </v>
<v Speaker 3>from South America to the United States </v>

1450
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.551
<v Speaker 3>and drop them off in Mena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas in a little plane and he would </v>

1451
01:04:22.551 --> 01:04:25.971
<v Speaker 3>drop a parachute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will these two kids saw the dropoff one </v>

1452
01:04:25.971 --> 01:04:28.911
<v Speaker 3>day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they caught the kids because they </v>

1453
01:04:28.911 --> 01:04:28.911
<v Speaker 3>didn't want the kids telling they killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1454
01:04:28.911 --> 01:04:33.020
<v Speaker 3>And their parents found out that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a murder because the cops had said that </v>

1455
01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.240
<v Speaker 3>they found these kids on the train </v>
<v Speaker 3>tracks apparently,</v>

1456
01:04:34.241 --> 01:04:36.930
<v Speaker 3>that they placed their bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but travels went over and they said,</v>

1457
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.270
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got stoned and they laid out on the</v>

1458
01:04:39.271 --> 01:04:44.271
<v Speaker 3>train tracks and the parents did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Autopsies hadn't had an autopsy found.</v>

1459
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.010
<v Speaker 3>They found knife wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kids had been stabbed.</v>

1460
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.380
<v Speaker 3>So they stabbed these kids and killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1461
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:54.680
<v Speaker 3>And then they laid him on the tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then it became this gigantic </v>

1462
01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:54.680
<v Speaker 3>investigation who was flying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1463

1464
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.300
<v Speaker 3>They get ahold of this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barry Seals and bearings.</v>

01:04:57.301 --> 01:05:00.450
<v Speaker 3>Seals is totally spills the beans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tells the whole story.</v>

1466
01:05:00.451 --> 01:05:02.390
<v Speaker 3>All the different shit that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's ready to testify,</v>

1467
01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 3>goes to court and they fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>assassinate him.</v>

1468
01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was waiting.</v>

1469
01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:08.460
<v Speaker 3>So this dude's eyes weighted court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got George Bush,</v>

1470
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:14.090
<v Speaker 3>George Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his phone number in his pocket at the </v>

1471
01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:14.490
<v Speaker 3>time and he gets murdered in his car on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to talk about it.</v>

1472
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.890
<v Speaker 3>And this was the guy that was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>employee of the CIA.</v>

1473
01:05:16.891 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not just those,</v>

1474
01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:21.700
<v Speaker 3>because a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Rupert is a guy who wrote a book</v>

1475
01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:26.701
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an lapd detective and something </v>

1476
01:05:26.701 --> 01:05:26.701
<v Speaker 3>in Lapd.</v>

1477
01:05:26.701 --> 01:05:26.701
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he was,</v>

1478
01:05:26.701 --> 01:05:30.490
<v Speaker 3>but he busted the CIA selling drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1479
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.310
<v Speaker 3>and he was told to the back off the case</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

1480
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:36.100
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's written books about it.</v>

1481
01:05:36.101 --> 01:05:38.460
<v Speaker 3>He's got this website from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wilderness.com,</v>

1482
01:05:38.461 --> 01:05:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I believe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1483
01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.050
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all detailing,</v>

1484
01:05:41.051 --> 01:05:46.051
<v Speaker 3>all the different corruption that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're doing it right in front </v>

1485
01:05:46.051 --> 01:05:46.051
<v Speaker 3>everybody's fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the crazy thing.</v>

1486
01:05:46.051 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about how much God damn cocaine is</v>

1487
01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:53.251
<v Speaker 3>in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not all coming in because of </v>

1488
01:05:53.251 --> 01:05:53.251
<v Speaker 3>retarded criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because most people that are struggling,</v>

1489
01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:58.360
<v Speaker 3>a huge organizations and the compliments</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government has to do with it for </v>

1490
01:05:58.481 --> 01:06:01.300
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone and some some aspect.</v>

1491
01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.230
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If these are,</v>

1492
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.200
<v Speaker 3>if these people want to do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1493
01:06:05.201 --> 01:06:07.720
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's who's making money off the drugs.</v>

1494
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:08.710
<v Speaker 3>They probably feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1495
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:10.740
<v Speaker 3>the bad guy's going to make money off of</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs anyway.</v>

1496
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Let's just cut them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll take the money.</v>

1497
01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.650
<v Speaker 3>Fucking drugs are going to be out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you do,</v>

1498
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.830
<v Speaker 3>and it's all like a nice little cycle </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the more people get arrested for</v>

1499
01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:22.831
<v Speaker 3>those drugs to more of the prison </v>
<v Speaker 3>private prison companies and companies </v>

1500
01:06:22.831 --> 01:06:26.551
<v Speaker 3>that own these gigantic prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more they're happy because more </v>

1501
01:06:26.551 --> 01:06:26.740
<v Speaker 3>people are in the prisons and the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are in private prisons,</v>

1502
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:29.590
<v Speaker 3>the more profit they make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they support are the shit.</v>

1503
01:06:29.591 --> 01:06:31.480
<v Speaker 3>So they actually support drugs being </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>

1504
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.060
<v Speaker 3>They want them to be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pushed for it.</v>

1505
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:36.280
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole,</v>

1506
01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:41.310
<v Speaker 3>the whole big package is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that the government is </v>

1507
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:42.010
<v Speaker 3>behind it all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's evidence of it just makes the</v>

1508
01:06:42.011 --> 01:06:42.850
<v Speaker 3>whole thing mindblowing.</v>

1509
01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Speaker 3>It's just so nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that the BDA,</v>

1510
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like in cahoots with the CIA and they</v>

1511
01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:54.631
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all like a big game at the very </v>

1512
01:06:54.631 --> 01:06:54.631
<v Speaker 3>top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all horseshit.</v>

1513
01:06:54.631 --> 01:06:56.590
<v Speaker 3>So I'll just profit and money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much fucking money save in Macon?</v>

1514
01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he must be so much money in drugs.</v>

1515
01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.170
<v Speaker 3>Who gets the money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1516
01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:03.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1517
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.640
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people are involved and where </v>

1518
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:08.640
<v Speaker 3>does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1519
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:08.640
<v Speaker 3>if the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone in the CIA,</v>

1520
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.300
<v Speaker 3>someone in the organization really is </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling drugs.</v>

1521
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Is it just every now and then or a rogue</v>
<v Speaker 3>agent goes fucking nutty and cut some </v>

1522
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:19.450
<v Speaker 3>deal with some fucking killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's all the time?</v>

1523
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.920
<v Speaker 3>If that's how it gets in the country?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1524
01:07:20.921 --> 01:07:21.490
<v Speaker 3>if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1525
01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many times has it happened?</v>

1526
01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:29.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much cocaine did we have already </v>

1527
01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:29.220
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>

1528
01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:29.220
<v Speaker 3>How long does cocaine last?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1529
01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:30.490
<v Speaker 3>if you bring in a whole gigantic ship </v>
<v Speaker 3>full of it,</v>

1530
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:35.820
<v Speaker 3>where would you keep it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long does it take to get it on the </v>

1531
01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:35.820
<v Speaker 3>street?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's bringing it in.</v>

1532
01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:35.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not these morons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1533
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.820
<v Speaker 3>They'd be getting busted left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that are so crazy,</v>

1534
01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.720
<v Speaker 3>they're willing to do something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

1535
01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Like some Mongo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million dollars for the cocaine in the</v>

1536
01:07:42.881 --> 01:07:46.480
<v Speaker 3>country because people are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people get busted doing shit.</v>

1537
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:51.510
<v Speaker 3>That's not an option that part of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they hire somebody to transport.</v>

1538
01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:53.840
<v Speaker 3>The more people you hire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more people are going to kill you.</v>

1539
01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:59.540
<v Speaker 3>The more people you hire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the worst year idea is because the </v>

1540
01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.460
<v Speaker 3>more people that can get busted and wear</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wire and put you in jail,</v>

1541
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.740
<v Speaker 3>it's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The smart move to do.</v>

1542
01:08:02.741 --> 01:08:05.290
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing something to hire as few</v>
<v Speaker 3>people as possible,</v>

1543
01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.470
<v Speaker 3>take your own ship over somewhere.</v>

1544
01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.730
<v Speaker 3>It might be a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might be the way to do it.</v>

1545
01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:11.440
<v Speaker 3>You might have to bring your own ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

1546
01:08:11.441 --> 01:08:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Some cartel guy transport to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys don't do it.</v>

1547
01:08:14.531 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 3>They hire other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

1548
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:20.381
<v Speaker 3>That's why they was living these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic compounds with 15 dogs and had </v>

1549
01:08:20.381 --> 01:08:22.130
<v Speaker 3>guns and no fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1550
01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that life in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've gone crazy.</v>

1551
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.980
<v Speaker 3>The Mexican drug war is just off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking chain.</v>

1552
01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.590
<v Speaker 3>When we talked to victor about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the dude,</v>

1553
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:36.620
<v Speaker 3>he just got out our guide from the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>who does a Spanish commentary.</v>

1554
01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:38.930
<v Speaker 3>He does my job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just got out of Juarez.</v>

1555
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:44.500
<v Speaker 3>He was living in Juarez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he says every time it's a </v>

1556
01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:44.500
<v Speaker 3>knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1557
01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.860
<v Speaker 3>Does he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1558
01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.910
<v Speaker 3>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I should have let that go.</v>

1559
01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.750
<v Speaker 3>That was my biggest regret is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not telling everyone.</v>

1560
01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Victor says this.</v>

1561
01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the lyric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I thought he did.</v>

1562
01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:04.970
<v Speaker 3>That was just saying because Michael k </v>
<v Speaker 3>one commentary and he goes really big </v>

1563
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:08.050

01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:17.600

<v Speaker 5>That's my favorite one.</v>

1580
01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Pirated.</v>

<v Speaker 3>White skin worth billions.</v>

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.610
<v Speaker 3>did the people that were kidnapped on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the yacht,</v>

1599
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.910
<v Speaker 3>like the guy and the girl and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like real travelers.</v>

1600
01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.440
<v Speaker 3>That's so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was attending about it.</v>

1601
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:51.610
<v Speaker 3>We are in 2010 and this is the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're gonna find out because I think </v>

1602
01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:54.320
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things about traveling</v>

1603
01:10:54.321 --> 01:10:56.730
<v Speaker 3>is that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1604
01:10:57.310 --> 01:11:01.010
<v Speaker 3>it gets fucking nerve wracking thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what is safe and what is not.</v>

1605
01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:03.250
<v Speaker 3>And all these losses of countries don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have overload.</v>

1606
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was in Brazil,</v>

1607
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:13.870
<v Speaker 3>that scared the shit out of me from us </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Brazil was A.</v>

1608
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Brazil was very much like a Sao Paulo.</v>

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.380
<v Speaker 3>horrible rough waters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climb on other people's boats and secure</v>

1659
01:14:05.381 --> 01:14:10.381
<v Speaker 3>their anchors because they didn't secure</v>
<v Speaker 3>their anchor correctly and their boats </v>

1660
01:14:10.381 --> 01:14:13.231
<v Speaker 3>were drifting and they had to worry </v>
<v Speaker 3>about their boats slamming into it as </v>

<v Speaker 3>couple of years putting daddy shit,</v>

1671
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:37.170

<v Speaker 3>Francisco and the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we thought the building was on fire,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1674
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 3>I was really thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to do this?</v>

1675
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:45.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're evacuating it was 15 flights </v>

1676
01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:47.881
<v Speaker 3>of stairs and people were going down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stairs in single file and people were </v>

1677
01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:47.890
<v Speaker 3>panicking and they were asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

1678
01:14:47.891 --> 01:14:52.891
<v Speaker 3>They were stopping the line and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were going really slow and they were </v>

1679
01:14:52.891 --> 01:14:52.891
<v Speaker 3>shitting their pants and while this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>all happening,</v>

1680
01:14:52.891 --> 01:14:57.870
<v Speaker 3>you could look down through the spirals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see the smoke coming up from the </v>

1681
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Speaker 3>bottom and I was ready to jump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was ready to just start climbing down.</v>

1682
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I was ready to just start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

1683
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:06.270

<v Speaker 3>People are panicking and they're not </v>

1684

<v Speaker 3>going fast enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and every floor they're merging.</v>

1686
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:11.710
<v Speaker 3>You start thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how someone could die.</v>

1687
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.710
<v Speaker 3>You can die like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get stuck in a fucking fire.</v>

1688
01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:15.880

1693
01:15:27.011 --> 01:15:27.011
<v Speaker 1>for some reason I guess high as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

1694
01:15:27.011 --> 01:15:31.320
<v Speaker 1>like when I go to a hotel second floor </v>
<v Speaker 1>we get because of that,</v>

1695
01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:34.460
<v Speaker 1>you know that that was one of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in my life.</v>

1696
01:15:34.461 --> 01:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the only time ever I thought I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would for sure was going to die</v>

1697
01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.910
<v Speaker 3>don,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought we were in a very,</v>

1698
01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:45.911
<v Speaker 3>very bad situation here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very thankful when we got out and </v>

1699
01:15:45.911 --> 01:15:46.970
<v Speaker 3>everything was okay and it turned out it</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't really a fire under the smoke was</v>

1700
01:15:46.971 --> 01:15:49.640
<v Speaker 3>actually the fire extinguishers because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's assholes.</v>

1704
01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.700
<v Speaker 3>The whole floor was covered in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke and the fire alarms went off,</v>

1705
01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.790
<v Speaker 3>I guess because they activated the a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1706
01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:13.680
<v Speaker 3>so it was no real fire,</v>

<v Speaker 3>walk.</v>

1723

<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you see smoke on the second </v>

1734
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.180
<v Speaker 1>You can't rub her belly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She likes to fight.</v>

1735
01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.810
<v Speaker 3>We'll be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

<v Speaker 3>calls and calls.</v>

1737
01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:27.880
<v Speaker 3>Eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to do?</v>

1738
01:17:27.881 --> 01:17:29.550
<v Speaker 3>A skype thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zoom,</v>

1739
01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:30.730
<v Speaker 3>skype.</v>

1740
01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.360
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do it right now.</v>

1741
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.490
<v Speaker 4>Fucking Johnny Depp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Live.</v>

1742
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:43.930
<v Speaker 4>Pirate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are already likes the pirates.</v>

1743
01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:58.820
<v Speaker 3>That's why I bring a collection of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheets just in case I need to tie them </v>

1744
01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.561
<v Speaker 3>together and dip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I wasn't thinking about </v>

1745
01:18:01.561 --> 01:18:03.841
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the lower I got the more I was </v>

1746
01:18:03.841 --> 01:18:03.841
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1747
01:18:03.841 --> 01:18:04.300
<v Speaker 3>maybe I can jump out from here and live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got to jump around from here.</v>

1748
01:18:04.301 --> 01:18:07.450
<v Speaker 3>And then you start thinking crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1749
01:18:07.451 --> 01:18:08.010
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1750
01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.630
<v Speaker 3>your survival instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really become an animal.</v>

1751
01:18:10.631 --> 01:18:12.490
<v Speaker 3>You become an organism that's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>

1752
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:17.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really think about anything </v>

1753
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:17.550
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

1754
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:17.550
<v Speaker 1>That's why this end of the road shit's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy when the zombies come and shit,</v>

1755
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:20.100
<v Speaker 1>because I'm going to be like the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that I eat,</v>

1756
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:22.980
<v Speaker 1>the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that somebody in our group.</v>

1757
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1758
01:18:26.311 --> 01:18:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think zombies.</v>

1759
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.450
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this whole idea of reincarnating</v>

1760
01:18:32.451 --> 01:18:34.460
<v Speaker 3>people after they're dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1761
01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:37.330
<v Speaker 3>like the whole cryogenics thing where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking people into freezing.</v>

1762
01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm like they did with Walt Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if there are really zombies,</v>

1763
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:42.920
<v Speaker 3>that's a Zombie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Zombie is when a person dies,</v>

1764
01:18:42.921 --> 01:18:44.960
<v Speaker 3>their soul goes the next stage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>

1765
01:18:44.961 --> 01:18:46.910
<v Speaker 3>their energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their essence can you just read,</v>

1766
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:49.340
<v Speaker 3>make their flesh and the flesh needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay alive,</v>

1767
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:51.470
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't think at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just moving on.</v>

1768
01:18:51.471 --> 01:18:56.471
<v Speaker 3>Instead of trying to keep things in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of it and try and bite your army </v>

1769
01:18:56.471 --> 01:18:56.471
<v Speaker 3>it because it's hungry.</v>

1770
01:18:56.471 --> 01:19:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Remember that old experiment with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog where they brought dogs back to </v>

1771
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:00.230
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that?</v>

1772
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Just the Russian film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

1773
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to look that up on Google there.</v>

1774
01:19:04.150 --> 01:19:09.150
<v Speaker 1>They have like this head of a dog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they hook it up to these chemicals and </v>

1775
01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:12.420
<v Speaker 1>the dog just starts coming back to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starts Licking his lips.</v>

1776
01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:15.150
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian Russian scientists.</v>

1777
01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dog Dead,</v>

1778
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but giant Black Madonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lack resilience.</v>

1779
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I rushed in sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead Dogs.</v>

1780
01:19:24.151 --> 01:19:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Severed head alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>

1781
01:19:25.791 --> 01:19:30.791
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the creepiest videos I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever saw and that's probably something </v>

1782
01:19:30.791 --> 01:19:30.791
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zombie dog right there.</v>

1783
01:19:30.791 --> 01:19:32.220
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a Zombie dog that kept alive with</v>

1784
01:19:32.221 --> 01:19:37.221
<v Speaker 1>electrical stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm imagining like if they made it a </v>

1785
01:19:37.221 --> 01:19:39.921
<v Speaker 1>thing that they could just put a collar </v>
<v Speaker 1>on its neck to do the same thing like a </v>

1786
01:19:39.921 --> 01:19:41.070
<v Speaker 1>executive or write things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can control it.</v>

1787
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for sure.</v>

1788
01:19:43.341 --> 01:19:45.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that those people.</v>

1789
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Here's the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1790
01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:48.260
<v Speaker 3>that's the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1791
01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.150
<v Speaker 3>Zombie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1792
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Is there a video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put it on twitter first so </v>

1793
01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.761
<v Speaker 3>we can all watch together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy Kimmel,</v>

1794

<v Speaker 3>is to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things work and you tweet it.</v>

1797
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:31.540
<v Speaker 3>That's a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>

1798
01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:32.490
<v Speaker 3>He's just explaining it,</v>

1799
01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:39.230
<v Speaker 4>explaining how he definitely was feeding</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dog.</v>

1800
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:51.310
<v Speaker 3>This is just a mad scientist shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to figure out what makes </v>

1801
01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:53.450
<v Speaker 3>flesh and tissue alive and this dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're feeding blood.</v>

1802
01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.900
<v Speaker 3>This dog's head while this fucking dogs </v>
<v Speaker 3>head is severed.</v>

1803
01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.110

<v Speaker 3>It's moving around.</v>

1808
01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.520
<v Speaker 3>It's reacting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he tickles his nose.</v>

1809
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Can't park has been a voicebox.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to put her eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose,</v>

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:36.290
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine doing that to like your </v>
<v Speaker 3>old pet because you want to make alive.</v>

1814
01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at that is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dog's head is completely removed </v>

1815
01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:43.440
<v Speaker 3>from his body and it's licking its </v>

<v Speaker 3>Know the ground with a hammer.</v>

1824
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:14.330
<v Speaker 3>You watch a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always reacting to that.</v>

1825
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:15.810
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to get away from the hammer </v>
<v Speaker 3>noise.</v>

1826
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>

1827
01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they cut his head off and put it </v>

1828
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:22.440
<v Speaker 3>right on that machine already?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chopped his fucking head off.</v>

1829
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.140
<v Speaker 3>They didn't bring it back to life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't kill them.</v>

1830
01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:30.141
<v Speaker 3>Don't know exactly how long it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this crazy guy did a bunch of these </v>

1831
01:22:30.141 --> 01:22:30.750
<v Speaker 3>kinds of experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

01:22:30.751 --> 01:22:32.930
<v Speaker 3>that's so scary.</v>

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:41.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1835
01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.221

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:26.180
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I threw water on her face,</v>

1950
01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:30.560
<v Speaker 2>so not the best judge you'd be online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the one I want to be up.</v>

1951
01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:32.830
<v Speaker 2>And then they started grilling me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1952
01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:38.330
<v Speaker 2>like right before I go on and Cameron </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked me this question before and I'm </v>

1953
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.330
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dancing,</v>

1954
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:40.330
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely thought about it,</v>

1955
01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.100
<v Speaker 2>but I'd love to cuddle situation so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

1956
01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I even said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1957
01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>

1958
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:49.630
<v Speaker 2>if I could be better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we all do from working at </v>

1959
01:27:49.630 --> 01:27:50.650
<v Speaker 2>the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so awkward.</v>

1960
01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.540
<v Speaker 2>I love it so much that I'm willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put myself through it.</v>

1961
01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Just to the awkwardness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1962
01:27:53.921 --> 01:27:56.650
<v Speaker 2>you know how when we were doing store </v>
<v Speaker 2>all those years,</v>

1963
01:27:56.651 --> 01:28:01.651
<v Speaker 2>we'd have those crazy late night shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think there's something about </v>

1964
01:28:01.651 --> 01:28:02.240
<v Speaker 2>those late night shows that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1965
01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:07.241
<v Speaker 2>like there's times when we did gigs </v>
<v Speaker 2>together where like if I did a Gig with </v>

1966
01:28:07.241 --> 01:28:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Tripoli or me and Bret Ernst and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1967
01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Mike Young did a show once in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida and everybody killed.</v>

1968
01:28:14.170 --> 01:28:16.540
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things with Brent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said when he killed,</v>

1969
01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.290
<v Speaker 2>like right after he was bringing me up </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store,</v>

1970
01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.920
<v Speaker 2>a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1971
01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:23.790
<v Speaker 2>and it was like joking around like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>clubhouse.</v>

1972
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:26.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1973
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:30.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're working hard situations.</v>

1974
01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:35.250
<v Speaker 2>The comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know the way it has always </v>

1975
01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:35.570
<v Speaker 2>been in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be that the criminals ran the,</v>

1976
01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:38.560
<v Speaker 2>the insane people run the asylum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now it's more,</v>

1977
01:28:38.561 --> 01:28:40.690
<v Speaker 2>it's managed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of sucks now because still the</v>

1978
01:28:40.691 --> 01:28:42.910
<v Speaker 2>door guys all want to be comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's a content.</v>

1979
01:28:42.930 --> 01:28:47.930
<v Speaker 2>They're outside smoking and drinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's five hecklers and they're </v>

1980
01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:48.040
<v Speaker 2>yelling at you and eventually someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>will get them.</v>

1981
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:50.110
<v Speaker 2>The places entirely black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's black.</v>

1982
01:28:50.111 --> 01:28:52.450
<v Speaker 2>The walls are black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the floor is dirty,</v>

1983
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.940
<v Speaker 2>the coloring is black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The building a whole building is black.</v>

1984
01:28:54.941 --> 01:28:59.941
<v Speaker 2>It's black building and it's just dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it used to be a nightclub where </v>

1985
01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Bugsy Siegel owned in the 19 thirties </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ship called Ciro's and it was like a</v>

1986
01:29:04.051 --> 01:29:04.890
<v Speaker 2>mob joint.</v>

1987
01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.450
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes were killed there,</v>

1988
01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:09.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's got this weird fucking feel too.</v>

1989
01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They chop people up and throw him in a </v>

1990
01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>fucking freezer in that place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1991
01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:18.670
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The window where they said that Louis </v>

1992
01:29:18.670 --> 01:29:22.460
<v Speaker 2>used to watch the opening acts from </v>
<v Speaker 2>their greenroom agreement has a window </v>

1993
01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:25.971
<v Speaker 2>you can and we can still use it today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go out there and you watch the main </v>

1994
01:29:25.971 --> 01:29:25.971
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they said that because of where they</v>

1995
01:29:25.971 --> 01:29:30.050
<v Speaker 2>point out for the bouncers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get him out so they wouldn't have </v>

1996
01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:30.930
<v Speaker 2>to go and make a hubbub in the room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just drag them out.</v>

1997
01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:33.780
<v Speaker 2>They said the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just.</v>

1998
01:29:33.781 --> 01:29:35.190
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing club.</v>

1999
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 2>There's three comedy rooms in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an upstairs,</v>

2000
01:29:37.690 --> 01:29:42.690
<v Speaker 2>little tiny one called the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a an original room that's like </v>

2001
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:43.850
<v Speaker 2>200 seats right about twitter and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a main room.</v>

2002
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:47.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like 400 seats and fucking club is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just so sick.</v>

2003
01:29:47.911 --> 01:29:52.911
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much fun shit has happened in that </v>

2004
01:29:52.911 --> 01:29:52.911
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great development room.</v>

2005
01:29:52.911 --> 01:29:54.330
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best place to write material.</v>

2006
01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.630
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's less about like,</v>

2007
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are so impressed with you there.</v>

2008
01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Don't showcase their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

2009
01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:07.100
<v Speaker 2>You'll eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible that you could never </v>

2010
01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:10.241
<v Speaker 2>tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the key to make a table that don't </v>

2011
01:30:10.241 --> 01:30:12.190
<v Speaker 2>make a tape of the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can never tell what's going to </v>

2012
01:30:12.190 --> 01:30:12.190
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never tell.</v>

2013
01:30:12.190 --> 01:30:15.170
<v Speaker 2>We've been showing situations where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are screaming things at each </v>

2014
01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:15.170
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights on stage,</v>

2015
01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:18.180
<v Speaker 2>always pulled his cock out at least 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>times that I know of.</v>

2016
01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:23.460
<v Speaker 2>If I would be willing to bet money that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pulled his dick out 10 times on </v>

2017
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.370
<v Speaker 2>that stage that I saw because you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2018
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:29.550
<v Speaker 2>to suppose balls at all time and just do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set of balls out Stephen.</v>

2019
01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:33.330
<v Speaker 2>So I put my balls who hated anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexual,</v>

2020
01:30:33.331 --> 01:30:38.331
<v Speaker 2>so I pulled my balls out and left a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>tee shirt over them because we're going </v>

2021
01:30:38.331 --> 01:30:40.971
<v Speaker 2>to bring them on and I had them out </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the entire set and there were a </v>

2022
01:30:40.971 --> 01:30:43.971
<v Speaker 2>couple times where I raised my hand like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and people would say just go up a </v>

2023
01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:43.971
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to be conscious of doing my set</v>

2024
01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:48.970
<v Speaker 2>my hands down whole time and then when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he got out because we were doing this </v>

2025
01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:52.911
<v Speaker 2>thing called cocking or would come </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind you and just put my ball when </v>

2026
01:30:52.911 --> 01:30:55.250
<v Speaker 2>you're at their arm bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just somewhere on your body.</v>

2027
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:56.970
<v Speaker 2>We never did the girls because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>creepy.</v>

2028
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:59.850
<v Speaker 2>That's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal to do is do dues too.</v>

2029
01:30:59.851 --> 01:31:01.080
<v Speaker 2>But if you call the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a bitch.</v>

2030
01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:02.700
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you ever do that to me?</v>

2031
01:31:02.701 --> 01:31:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to copy you.</v>

2032
01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:04.990
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2033
01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.530
<v Speaker 2>so I went to shake his hand and have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get off and I just pulled it in,</v>

2034
01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:11.400
<v Speaker 7>melted</v>

2035
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:16.750
<v Speaker 2>for 15 minutes with regular jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Not appreciate that there's </v>

2036
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:22.070
<v Speaker 2>something very fun and being juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2037
01:31:22.071 --> 01:31:27.071
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to get all mature and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to know that's all well </v>

2038
01:31:27.071 --> 01:31:27.780
<v Speaker 2>and good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bottom line is your,</v>

2039
01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.670
<v Speaker 2>this is a temporary life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2040
01:31:29.671 --> 01:31:34.671
<v Speaker 2>it's just temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking yourself or anything seriously </v>

2041
01:31:34.671 --> 01:31:38.000
<v Speaker 2>seems dumb to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you should be having as </v>

2042
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:38.000
<v Speaker 2>much fun as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even as silly,</v>

2043
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.040
<v Speaker 2>stupid shit on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

2044
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:42.200
<v Speaker 2>It could be a hundred years from now </v>
<v Speaker 2>forwarding on.</v>

2045
01:31:42.201 --> 01:31:47.201
<v Speaker 2>People are still going to be funny when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz comes over and then waves his </v>

2046
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:50.080
<v Speaker 2>hand in front of his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2047
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:51.920
<v Speaker 2>it's always funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always disgusting,</v>

2048
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:56.090
<v Speaker 2>but gets warmer clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time that would make you angry,</v>

2049
01:31:56.091 --> 01:31:57.890
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be so fucked up in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

2050
01:31:57.891 --> 01:32:02.891
<v Speaker 2>like you have to be in a terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if at any normal time in life when </v>

2051
01:32:02.891 --> 01:32:02.891
<v Speaker 2>it does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Brian and I were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were waiting for once and I forgot to </v>

<v Speaker 1>yelling out ketosis,</v>

2077
01:33:19.151 --> 01:33:21.290
<v Speaker 1>ketosis and nobody picked them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switch the fuck it.</v>

2078
01:33:21.630 --> 01:33:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2079
01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are killing me,</v>

2080
01:33:25.301 --> 01:33:26.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was scary.</v>

2081
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:28.410
<v Speaker 1>It was scary and so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2082
01:33:28.890 --> 01:33:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I got caught for shoplifting was when </v>
<v Speaker 1>CD's first came out and I was like 12 or</v>

2083
01:33:33.581 --> 01:33:36.610
<v Speaker 1>13 or something and I wanted a CD so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2084
01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I had a CD player for my birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had one CD.</v>

2085
01:33:38.891 --> 01:33:41.410
<v Speaker 1>It was a ghost buster to soundtrack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

2086
01:33:41.411 --> 01:33:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I need a new CD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The soundtrack sucks.</v>

2087
01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:46.120
<v Speaker 1>And so I went to the store with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and we,</v>

2088
01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:51.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stole three cds and got caught and it </v>

2089
01:33:51.121 --> 01:33:54.511
<v Speaker 1>was so embarrassing as the CDs were </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paula Abdul Mc Hammer and something </v>

2090
01:33:56.261 --> 01:33:57.850
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like van Halen or something like that.</v>

2091
01:33:57.851 --> 01:34:01.060
<v Speaker 1>But then his family are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of our families had to come.</v>

2092
01:34:01.061 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 1>We had to.</v>

2093
01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting caught shoplifting never got </v>

2094
01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:06.620
<v Speaker 2>caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got caught shoplifting,</v>

2095
01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:10.200
<v Speaker 2>shoplifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoplifting when I was about 13 or stole</v>

2096
01:34:10.201 --> 01:34:15.201
<v Speaker 2>a candy bar and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were about to leave and go to the </v>

2097
01:34:15.201 --> 01:34:15.420
<v Speaker 2>movies and as I'm walking out of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>

2098
01:34:15.421 --> 01:34:20.421
<v Speaker 2>this guy came up and grabbed my arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fucking went to a panty.</v>

2099
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you put in your pocket?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2102
01:34:24.931 --> 01:34:27.240
<v Speaker 2>I totally didn't even need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to see if I could do it.</v>

2103
01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:32.420
<v Speaker 2>I've done it a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd stolen like gum or something like </v>

2104
01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:32.420
<v Speaker 2>that and I just kept doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2105
01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.130
<v Speaker 2>when you're a kid you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just do it.</v>

2106
01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:34.770
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like 12.</v>

2107
01:34:34.771 --> 01:34:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing is you would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten in trouble with your parents.</v>

2108
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:39.050

2111
01:34:41.641 --> 01:34:46.641
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they even told my parents </v>

2112
01:34:46.641 --> 01:34:46.641
<v Speaker 2>just told me get the fuck out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a candy bar.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They put 10 in our pants and then we </v>

2134
01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.460
<v Speaker 1>would bury it outside of the store and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it back later because we didn't want</v>

2135
01:35:25.461 --> 01:35:27.890
<v Speaker 1>to come home and have like video games </v>
<v Speaker 1>in</v>

<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I thought were cool.</v>

2140
01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I put in my pocket and as I'm walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the door I'm like,</v>

2141
01:35:40.161 --> 01:35:41.780

<v Speaker 2>This thing goes off right now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I was like 17.</v>

01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:47.030
<v Speaker 2>It was like enough where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just charge me.</v>

2144
01:35:47.410 --> 01:35:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2145
01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.390
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's scary shit.</v>

2146
01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:53.420
<v Speaker 2>My girlfriend at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was 15 when she got caught,</v>

2147
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:58.660
<v Speaker 2>but she just wanted nice clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had nice clothes and she was </v>

2148
01:35:59.091 --> 01:36:04.091
<v Speaker 2>also a raised without a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when people are raised under </v>

2149
01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:04.220
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unbalanced,</v>

2150
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:06.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more subjects do crazy shit.</v>

2151
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Her mom worked all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2152
01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:11.090
<v Speaker 2>her mom didn't have enough money to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>care of her.</v>

2153
01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:13.250
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't put her in like a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice daycare.</v>

2154
01:36:13.251 --> 01:36:14.150
<v Speaker 2>So you grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2155
01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 2>single parents or single single parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single child,</v>

2156
01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.810
<v Speaker 2>you grow up a little crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2157
01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.070
<v Speaker 2>she just thought she could get away with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2158
01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.800
<v Speaker 2>She thought she was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was pretty smart.</v>

2159
01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Start to get away with it either because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was raised with no data are raised </v>

2160
01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:26.900
<v Speaker 2>with too much dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2161
01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.740
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't.</v>

2162
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:33.470
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't fucked up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just a little crazy.</v>

2163
01:36:35.850 --> 01:36:38.960
<v Speaker 2>You look back on on chicks that you knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in high school and say,</v>

2164
01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:40.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I got her pregnant too.</v>

2165
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I had a fucking kid with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I was still connected to her,</v>

2166
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:45.940
<v Speaker 2>but if I was pregnant and didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>money to the real answer is,</v>

2167
01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:47.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine though?</v>

2168
01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:50.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean not having money is one thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that does suck,</v>

2169
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.840
<v Speaker 2>but being young and not having money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how to raise a </v>

2170
01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.961
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you chose still trying to figure out </v>

2171
01:36:58.961 --> 01:36:59.300
<v Speaker 2>yourself in the best of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of your life,</v>

2172
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:01.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's so hard not to project on those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2173

2245
01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.920
<v Speaker 2>like a base very far away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of civilization.</v>

<v Speaker 2>La is 45 minutes away.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've moved further and further away from</v>

2254
01:40:23.911 --> 01:40:26.490

<v Speaker 2>go and just hear nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I love the most.</v>

2270
01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Medical.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you hear the silence.</v>

2275
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:19.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like a very specific sound of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

2286
01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douchey people are fucking trees had </v>

2287
01:41:48.630 --> 01:41:50.430
<v Speaker 2>been around for like a million years is </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic fucking treat.</v>

2288
01:41:50.431 --> 01:41:52.560
<v Speaker 2>It's as big as this room or what do they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>

2289
01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Have a big hole in the center of it so </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can drive their cars through the </v>

2290
01:41:58.140 --> 01:41:59.020
<v Speaker 2>fucking tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like a novelty goof.</v>

2291
01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Like they carved out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2292
01:42:00.321 --> 01:42:01.990
<v Speaker 2>that's where the road was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2293
01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.260
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the road was.</v>

2294
01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.320
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2295
01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:10.140
<v Speaker 2>it seems like more humane to kill the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tree than to use it.</v>

2296
01:42:10.730 --> 01:42:13.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking cherry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trees can feel.</v>

2297
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:15.260
<v Speaker 2>They just can't communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2298
01:42:15.261 --> 01:42:17.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very valid argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2299
01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:18.760
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that there's,</v>

2300
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:23.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this has been </v>

2301
01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:25.620
<v Speaker 2>scientifically validated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's been all sorts of studies </v>

2302
01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:25.620
<v Speaker 2>that prove that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that tree's like,</v>

2303
01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:28.780
<v Speaker 2>like feel something like there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>electrical impulse when you snip them.</v>

2304
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:31.310
<v Speaker 6>I will tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was an episode of Mamma's family,</v>

2305
01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:33.050
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in which the goofball son,</v>

2306
01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:38.200
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's a study that says a cauliflower </v>

2307
01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.930
<v Speaker 6>can feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Broccoli does not have that same </v>

2308
01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:40.930
<v Speaker 6>problem.</v>

2309
01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that was where all the work was </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

2310
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.520
<v Speaker 2>That's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who the fuck knows,</v>

2311
01:42:46.521 --> 01:42:47.040
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2312
01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.670
<v Speaker 2>who knows if it doesn't hurt their </v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings when you eat them,</v>

2313
01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:51.290
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good enough reason to,</v>

2314
01:42:51.291 --> 01:42:56.291
<v Speaker 1>to or not to do anything argued that </v>
<v Speaker 1>video game characters can probably feel.</v>

2315
01:42:56.540 --> 01:43:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're playing a pretty quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're fucking somebody up and </v>

2316
01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:03.140
<v Speaker 1>another dementia that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that video game.</v>

2317
01:43:03.141 --> 01:43:06.290
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that has feelings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As much as I'm a cabbage,</v>

2318
01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just where it starts getting </v>

2319
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.590
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then who cares?</v>

2320
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have lips.</v>

2321
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:14.990
<v Speaker 1>They won't eat anything that has a face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2323
01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:17.240
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like people who will eat,</v>

2324
01:43:17.690 --> 01:43:22.690
<v Speaker 2>they will eat things like they'll eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>like clams and they'll eat like some </v>

2325
01:43:22.690 --> 01:43:23.840
<v Speaker 2>shellfish and what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't eat anything with a face.</v>

2326
01:43:24.230 --> 01:43:29.230
<v Speaker 2>What does that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of faces creeping and mass </v>

2327
01:43:29.230 --> 01:43:29.230
<v Speaker 2>cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got someone's mouth.</v>

2328
01:43:29.230 --> 01:43:32.300
<v Speaker 2>They're not watching some girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for Brian just comes up with weird.</v>

2329
01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen us in a weird ass banners?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the thing that's on </v>

2330
01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:37.540
<v Speaker 2>my website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on Joe Rogan dot.</v>

2331
01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:37.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2332
01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.290
<v Speaker 2>there's weird bands and saw Brian.</v>

2333
01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to throw in a lot of subliminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>porn into it because it.</v>

2334
01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:45.780
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2335
01:43:45.781 --> 01:43:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

2336
01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:51.170
<v Speaker 1>When it makes you look at the poster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives down there by the end.</v>

2337
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2338
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:57.190
<v Speaker 2>It makes you look at the poster where </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of times if it's just you </v>

2339
01:43:57.190 --> 01:43:57.190
<v Speaker 2>with a microphone is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2340
01:43:57.190 --> 01:43:57.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2341
01:43:57.190 --> 01:43:59.100
<v Speaker 2>You just know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love them man.</v>

2342
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:04.300
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you just brighten the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contrast in there will be even more </v>

2343
01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:06.280
<v Speaker 2>excited with the n is I feel like I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2344
01:44:06.370 --> 01:44:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny that that's exciting to </v>

2345
01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:11.840
<v Speaker 2>almost see some tips or some policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can see just</v>

2346
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:13.360
<v Speaker 5>you can just go to a different website.</v>

2347
01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2348
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:22.430
<v Speaker 2>I can't live in a mountain man because </v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's like any of the road shit </v>

2349
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.990
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be around just in case I might</v>

2350
01:44:22.991 --> 01:44:27.991
<v Speaker 2>have to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even an end of the world and </v>

2351
01:44:27.991 --> 01:44:28.080
<v Speaker 2>you have to discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

2352
01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.450
<v Speaker 2>it was like overload.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much to too many days in a</v>

2353
01:44:31.451 --> 01:44:33.040
<v Speaker 2>row where it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2354
01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 2>that's why they're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I overloaded on the road,</v>

2355
01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:38.560
<v Speaker 2>on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes too much porn.</v>

2356
01:44:38.590 --> 01:44:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I just see it as maybe being animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either that or this way where I just </v>

2357
01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:47.581
<v Speaker 2>feel empathy for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about when you beat off and like </v>

2358
01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:49.190
<v Speaker 2>only a dribble comes out because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>all you got left like a three,</v>

2359
01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:52.390
<v Speaker 2>three day or four feet off like three </v>
<v Speaker 2>times in a day.</v>

2360
01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:57.480
<v Speaker 2>And you think you're doing it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll try and get some sleep like you </v>

2361
01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:01.120
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes I wake up and I'd get up </v>

2362
01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:01.120
<v Speaker 2>too early and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can sleep in.</v>

2363
01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.020
<v Speaker 2>I need my sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just turn it off real quick.</v>

2364
01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:04.920
<v Speaker 2>So jerk off and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get ready to go to the gym.</v>

2365
01:45:04.921 --> 01:45:07.240
<v Speaker 2>I it a little horny for the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just jerked off,</v>

2366
01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:12.740
<v Speaker 2>jerked off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll go and do the show and </v>

2367
01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:13.000
<v Speaker 2>then I go to the show to stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the for Jujitsu.</v>

2368
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes</v>

2369
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:17.910
<v Speaker 5>I want you to three times</v>

2370
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:21.350
<v Speaker 2>wash for Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very conscientious,</v>

2371
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:24.680
<v Speaker 2>listen to everybody jerks off and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes to Jujitsu.</v>

2372
01:45:24.681 --> 01:45:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that goes to Jitsu jerks off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then goes there.</v>

2373
01:45:26.841 --> 01:45:28.800
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long ago was.</v>

2374
01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it a year ago?</v>

2375
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:35.150
<v Speaker 2>They like to wipe it or they go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2376
01:45:35.190 --> 01:45:36.590
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

2377
01:45:36.591 --> 01:45:38.580
<v Speaker 2>And can trust people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust no one.</v>

2378
01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.200
<v Speaker 2>But then I'll go get home from the Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do a Gig,</v>

2379
01:45:42.290 --> 01:45:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll be wired and then I can of get some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep so I'll beat off man,</v>

2380
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:46.500
<v Speaker 2>get some sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2381
01:45:46.501 --> 01:45:49.230
<v Speaker 2>At the time I didn't know where it just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2382
01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.560
<v Speaker 5>I kind of already about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a sprayer.</v>

2383
01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:53.050
<v Speaker 5>Like when he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he chokes out,</v>

2384
01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:58.080
<v Speaker 5>it just blows up once in a while and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's based on the shoulder.</v>

2385
01:45:59.831 --> 01:46:04.831
<v Speaker 5>Why does it do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or do you like hold down the tip like a </v>

2386
01:46:04.831 --> 01:46:05.160
<v Speaker 5>garden hose and try to spread something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that?</v>

2387
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:06.400
<v Speaker 5>Probably the way I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2388
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:11.270

2392
01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:21.680

<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest about something.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What is better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is better?</v>

<v Speaker 2>great mode,</v>

2398
01:46:36.201 --> 01:46:38.600
<v Speaker 2>but not by much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not by much.</v>

2399

<v Speaker 2>it doesn't hurt though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were telling you about when I,</v>

2439
01:48:17.441 --> 01:48:22.441
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first started wearing a cup and </v>

2440
01:48:22.441 --> 01:48:23.821
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu I didn't use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to start wearing makeup because I </v>

2441
01:48:23.821 --> 01:48:28.411
<v Speaker 2>was rolling with Einstein and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to pass my card and he slammed </v>

2442
01:48:28.411 --> 01:48:29.710
<v Speaker 2>into me right into my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2443
01:48:29.711 --> 01:48:33.360
<v Speaker 2>not even like my shin hit my balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they need hit the Dick was,</v>

2444
01:48:33.710 --> 01:48:34.990
<v Speaker 2>the president had it a lot more.</v>

2445
01:48:35.050 --> 01:48:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you covering your head?</v>

2446
01:48:36.011 --> 01:48:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Because I hate this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh sorry.</v>

2447
01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:43.660
<v Speaker 2>But he's slammed it in my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To get hurt so much it was so fucking </v>

2448
01:48:44.081 --> 01:48:47.050
<v Speaker 2>painful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so I wait until I feel better,</v>

2449
01:48:47.051 --> 01:48:52.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a couple minutes to catch my </v>

2450
01:48:52.051 --> 01:48:52.051
<v Speaker 2>breath and then we started rolling </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2451
01:48:52.051 --> 01:48:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think anything of it until I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get changed.</v>

2452
01:48:52.751 --> 01:48:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I go in the locker room and I go to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>

2453
01:48:54.311 --> 01:48:59.311
<v Speaker 2>I take my pants off and I go to take my </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwear or my jock strap off and it's </v>

2454
01:48:59.311 --> 01:49:04.290
<v Speaker 2>filled with blood filled with blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blood is leaking out of the tip of my </v>

2455
01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2456
01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.000
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I broke my Dick.</v>

2457
01:49:07.090 --> 01:49:12.090
<v Speaker 2>So then I go into the bathroom and pee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go to p and blood is just coming </v>

2458
01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:15.210
<v Speaker 2>right out of tip my Dick Blood in urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I started thinking about it.</v>

2459
01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2460
01:49:15.881 --> 01:49:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to do something.</v>

2461
01:49:17.381 --> 01:49:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Now I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a problem.</v>

2462
01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I might have to get my teeth fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2463
01:49:20.141 --> 01:49:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought about it.</v>

2464
01:49:21.691 --> 01:49:22.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2465
01:49:22.151 --> 01:49:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this was my nose and blood was coming</v>

2466
01:49:25.181 --> 01:49:26.500
<v Speaker 2>out of my nose when I do anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2467
01:49:26.530 --> 01:49:27.520
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do shit about it.</v>

2468
01:49:27.521 --> 01:49:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I would just let it heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2469
01:49:29.051 --> 01:49:34.051
<v Speaker 2>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just let your Dick Hill and see </v>

2470
01:49:34.051 --> 01:49:34.051
<v Speaker 2>how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd get home that night and I say,</v>

2471
01:49:34.051 --> 01:49:34.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

2472
01:49:34.361 --> 01:49:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should go to the fucking doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2473
01:49:36.221 --> 01:49:38.140
<v Speaker 2>If my dick get hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go to the doctor.</v>

2474
01:49:38.290 --> 01:49:41.620
<v Speaker 2>So I jerked off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I jerked off and I shot a bloody load.</v>

2475
01:49:41.650 --> 01:49:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Is it pink?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will know.</v>

2476
01:49:43.031 --> 01:49:45.430
<v Speaker 2>It was like a chicken egg that has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>embryo in it.</v>

2477
01:49:46.630 --> 01:49:51.630
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a chicken egg and that's in the </v>

2478
01:49:52.391 --> 01:49:57.391
<v Speaker 2>Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a blue balloon is like an actual </v>

2479
01:49:57.391 --> 01:49:57.391
<v Speaker 2>embryo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a big ass.</v>

2480
01:49:57.391 --> 01:50:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Much more close to kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get one drop of blood in the what </v>

2481
01:50:02.370 --> 01:50:05.230
<v Speaker 2>you get all the time and then throw it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and use it separately.</v>

2482
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:07.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>

2483
01:50:07.721 --> 01:50:12.721
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the fuck happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That things bleeding there and that </v>

2484
01:50:12.721 --> 01:50:12.721
<v Speaker 2>blood is human life has we killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently than a human lives.</v>

2485
01:50:13.630 --> 01:50:18.630
<v Speaker 2>But not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably smart for like health </v>

2486
01:50:18.630 --> 01:50:18.630
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blood is just sitting in that egg.</v>

2487
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:21.190
<v Speaker 2>An egg can keep probably better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>

2488
01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Ken The border,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just speculation,</v>

2489
01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:29.820
<v Speaker 2>but your bottom line is I jerked off to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see if my dick was okay and I know it.</v>

2490
01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:36.550
<v Speaker 2>It didn't feel that good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the best jerk off session I've ever</v>

2491
01:50:36.551 --> 01:50:41.551
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then the next day I peed blood a </v>

2492
01:50:41.551 --> 01:50:43.771
<v Speaker 2>couple more times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are just a little bit less every </v>

2493
01:50:43.771 --> 01:50:44.080
<v Speaker 2>time for like three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I stopped.</v>

2494
01:50:44.081 --> 01:50:45.580
<v Speaker 2>There was no more blood and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's okay.</v>

2495
01:50:45.581 --> 01:50:50.581
<v Speaker 2>I think it would have only taken one day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would have freaked out and went </v>

2496
01:50:50.581 --> 01:50:50.581
<v Speaker 2>right to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't hurt.</v>

2497
01:50:50.581 --> 01:50:51.850
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2498
01:50:52.090 --> 01:50:53.090
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

2499
01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Well I was thinking I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was worried about was that it was</v>

2500
01:50:57.971 --> 01:50:59.020
<v Speaker 2>going to break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2501
01:50:59.021 --> 01:51:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Dick is not going work anymore.</v>

2502
01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:03.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm infinite off.</v>

2503
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:09.470
<v Speaker 2>You imagine if you get gang green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it were to rebuild one,</v>

2504
01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.910
<v Speaker 2>they have to take a chunk out of meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your forearm.</v>

2505
01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I saw that online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dude had his dick rebuilt and maybe it</v>

2506
01:51:14.981 --> 01:51:17.380
<v Speaker 2>was like a woman who had a dick rebuilt </v>
<v Speaker 2>to become a man.</v>

2507
01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:19.040
<v Speaker 2>It could be a fake Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2508
01:51:19.050 --> 01:51:24.050
<v Speaker 2>that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you be concerned at all at the </v>

2509
01:51:24.050 --> 01:51:24.100
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not joking that the doctor would</v>

2510
01:51:24.101 --> 01:51:29.101
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hadn't gotten hard so fast would </v>

2511
01:51:29.101 --> 01:51:29.101
<v Speaker 2>be okay with the fact that it broke the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seal or something.</v>

2512
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:34.350
<v Speaker 2>You weren't worried about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking that maybe my loads with </v>

2513
01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:35.680
<v Speaker 2>purified whatever injury I had in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my soldiers for the work on it,</v>

2514
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:36.640
<v Speaker 2>patch it up.</v>

2515
01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think urine is supposed to heal </v>

2516
01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.351
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you pee when you have a little </v>

2517
01:51:46.351 --> 01:51:47.680
<v Speaker 2>wound inside your dick is probably good </v>
<v Speaker 2>to piss out blood and cleans it out.</v>

2518
01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in sterile.</v>

2519
01:51:50.561 --> 01:51:51.880
<v Speaker 2>It's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>

2520
01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.610
<v Speaker 2>I bet it probably does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2521
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.780
<v Speaker 2>that was a close call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from then on I wear a coat,</v>

2522
01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.170
<v Speaker 2>so no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2523
01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:01.330
<v Speaker 2>no blood in my shit but some bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>loads.</v>

2524

<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

2526
01:52:06.501 --> 01:52:11.501
<v Speaker 2>What you sort of lead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I don't do shit that involves </v>

<v Speaker 2>You should wear one dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get an extra one too.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sounds fishy smelling Ben Gay.</v>

2531
01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Tried it on and do with fucking Dave's </v>
<v Speaker 2>insanity sauce and it won't even kick in</v>

2532
01:52:32.021 --> 01:52:34.210
<v Speaker 2>until you start sweating and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Dick would be on fire.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a Burrito with days and Saturday sauce </v>

2535
01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:42.780
<v Speaker 2>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2536
01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that some residue on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>finger.</v>

2537
01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:46.790
<v Speaker 2>And I touched the head of my deck and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

2538
01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:49.300
<v Speaker 2>it was melting like a Mexican below </v>
<v Speaker 2>John.</v>

2539
01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that for all of the sunflower </v>

<v Speaker 2>that big.</v>

<v Speaker 2>desk.</v>

2543
01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:02.720
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to punish the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't ask.</v>

2629
01:56:41.641 --> 01:56:46.641
<v Speaker 2>and really good economy of words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good craftsman know </v>

2630
01:56:46.641 --> 01:56:47.820
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I show is so fine.</v>

2631
01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:49.500
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met him,</v>

2632
01:56:49.770 --> 01:56:52.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a new job I did.</v>

2633
01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't steal somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily somebody else called.</v>

2634
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I stole it from that pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2635
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:58.410
<v Speaker 2>He got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they fight.</v>

2636
01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:00.540
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want him for the actual show</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they hired me.</v>

2637
01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:01.890
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't,</v>

2638
01:57:01.891 --> 01:57:03.900
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was already bad before me.</v>

2639
01:57:03.901 --> 01:57:04.680
<v Speaker 2>I just took it from him.</v>

2640
01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:06.120
<v Speaker 2>But Ray was a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2641
01:57:06.121 --> 01:57:08.010
<v Speaker 2>So it was weird to run into him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2642
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:09.840
<v Speaker 2>but then all of a sudden he got his </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

2643
01:57:09.841 --> 01:57:14.841
<v Speaker 2>which was like 100 times more successful</v>
<v Speaker 2>in radio and was perfect because he </v>

2644
01:57:14.841 --> 01:57:15.570
<v Speaker 2>controlled the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>

2645
01:57:15.571 --> 01:57:16.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were hanging out,</v>

2648
01:57:24.050 --> 01:57:26.450
<v Speaker 2>and ray was like obsessive harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if I have the guy come in like </v>

2649
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:28.800
<v Speaker 2>this and just kept going.</v>

2652
01:57:35.751 --> 01:57:35.751
<v Speaker 2>it in his head and he was obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2653
01:57:35.751 --> 01:57:38.610
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was any good luck at all with him.</v>

2654
01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:44.660
<v Speaker 2>He had to take this hbo special back </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it really meant something and they </v>

<v Speaker 2>he's black and he's talking to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good and he's good.</v>

2741
02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:25.410
<v Speaker 2>He went to the thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was bob</v>

2742
02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:28.240
<v Speaker 6>or stuttering John Thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might've turned out,</v>

2743
02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:30.080
<v Speaker 6>but they went with someone else </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely,</v>

2744
02:01:30.110 --> 02:01:33.570
<v Speaker 6>but they went downtown and asks about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2745
02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:39.040
<v Speaker 6>what do you think about Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think was running mates </v>

2746
02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:39.040
<v Speaker 6>therapy when people are gone?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think she's great.</v>

2747
02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:39.380
<v Speaker 6>I think it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who Do you,</v>

2748
02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 6>are you a Democrat</v>

2749
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:40.910
<v Speaker 2>or Republican?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Republican,</v>

2750
02:01:40.911 --> 02:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about,</v>

2751
02:01:42.051 --> 02:01:44.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that forever.</v>

2752
02:01:44.391 --> 02:01:49.391
<v Speaker 2>I watched that Gonzo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Thompson back in the 19 seventies </v>

2753
02:01:50.061 --> 02:01:53.030
<v Speaker 2>when he was running fewer loading on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign trail was the same thing.</v>

2754
02:01:53.031 --> 02:01:55.340
<v Speaker 2>They were asking all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and who you're voting for it.</v>

2755
02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:58.990
<v Speaker 2>No one had a fucking clue why anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2756
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.490
<v Speaker 2>not that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2757
02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:01.670
<v Speaker 2>not that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2758
02:02:02.090 --> 02:02:04.220
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck are you voting for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that guy's vote counts.</v>

2759
02:02:04.230 --> 02:02:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Just as much scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2760
02:02:06.531 --> 02:02:11.531
<v Speaker 2>They like Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know he wants to go to war with </v>

2761
02:02:11.531 --> 02:02:13.871
<v Speaker 2>Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we feel about that as well for </v>

2762
02:02:13.871 --> 02:02:13.871
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you.</v>

2763
02:02:13.871 --> 02:02:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that there Obama has any </v>
<v Speaker 2>say or do you think it's all horseshit?</v>

2764
02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:18.020
<v Speaker 2>What do you think literally happens when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2765
02:02:18.021 --> 02:02:23.021
<v Speaker 2>When do you think that you've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>briefed before the editor when I said </v>

2766
02:02:23.021 --> 02:02:24.140
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be given an agenda.</v>

2767
02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:27.230
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be asked to follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain protocol.</v>

2768
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:32.350
<v Speaker 2>You'll you will consult with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people before any decision before any </v>

2769
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.390
<v Speaker 2>press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be reviewed.</v>

2770
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think they're also just met with </v>

2771
02:02:38.410 --> 02:02:41.650
<v Speaker 2>with checks and balances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way harder to get things done when </v>

2772
02:02:41.650 --> 02:02:42.590
<v Speaker 2>you think you don't have to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>allegiances and you have to give certain</v>

2773
02:02:42.591 --> 02:02:44.300
<v Speaker 2>things in order to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely,</v>

2774
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:45.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

2775
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:47.170
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely a lot.</v>

2776
02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:48.680
<v Speaker 2>We'll just get something done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that easy.</v>

2777
02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:50.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no it's not but.</v>

2778
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:55.390
<v Speaker 2>But okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's with him saying that he </v>

2779
02:02:55.390 --> 02:02:57.911
<v Speaker 2>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all bullshit that you don't want </v>

2780
02:02:57.911 --> 02:02:57.911
<v Speaker 2>to have troops over there and then all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden he pulls them out of our ach</v>

2781
02:02:57.911 --> 02:02:59.450
<v Speaker 2>and sends him off to Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that all.</v>

2782
02:02:59.451 --> 02:03:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Because I think she realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2783
02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't just pull them out so it creates</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vacuum of power that will be terrible </v>

2784
02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>and what I wanted to do.</v>

2785
02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Now I know more than what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

2786
02:03:08.810 --> 02:03:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I think what they've gotta do at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time,</v>

2787
02:03:11.391 --> 02:03:16.391
<v Speaker 2>they've got to have some map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they really want to get people to </v>

2788
02:03:16.391 --> 02:03:17.570
<v Speaker 2>like the United States and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

2789
02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:22.720
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some massive goodwill </v>
<v Speaker 2>operation where we go to these </v>

2790
02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:26.951
<v Speaker 2>impoverished countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these places that had been wrecked by </v>

2791
02:03:26.951 --> 02:03:26.951
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by devastation,</v>

2792
02:03:26.951 --> 02:03:31.061
<v Speaker 2>by all these different things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on and we have to help the fuck </v>

2793
02:03:31.061 --> 02:03:33.731
<v Speaker 2>out of them because if we don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then other people are going to look at </v>

2794
02:03:33.731 --> 02:03:33.731
<v Speaker 2>us and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2795
02:03:33.731 --> 02:03:37.551
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would we look up to the United </v>

2796
02:03:37.551 --> 02:03:40.210
<v Speaker 2>States just because it used to be just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's the biggest super power </v>

2797
02:03:40.210 --> 02:03:40.210
<v Speaker 2>because they have the most missiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2798
02:03:40.210 --> 02:03:43.370
<v Speaker 2>why would we give a fuck about them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the people at the very top aren't</v>

2799
02:03:43.371 --> 02:03:48.371
<v Speaker 2>the most generous than the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole system below you seems unfair </v>

2800
02:03:48.371 --> 02:03:48.680
<v Speaker 2>and people get fucking pissed off.</v>

2801
02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Something that Old Testament or a light </v>
<v Speaker 2>unto the nations,</v>

2802
02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:55.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead by example of what you want them to</v>

2803
02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:56.120
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2804
02:03:56.121 --> 02:04:01.121
<v Speaker 2>If you're in that position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the position to be </v>

2805
02:04:01.121 --> 02:04:01.121
<v Speaker 2>generous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the position to help,</v>

2806
02:04:01.121 --> 02:04:02.630
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just we're just ganking shit.</v>

2807
02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:04.490
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want the oil.</v>

2808
02:04:04.491 --> 02:04:09.491
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give us that natural socket and we're </v>

2809
02:04:09.491 --> 02:04:09.491
<v Speaker 2>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's those poppy seeds?</v>

2810
02:04:09.491 --> 02:04:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Where's the heroin ground?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right here.</v>

2811

<v Speaker 2>space ships that fly around you by </v>

2813
02:04:18.881 --> 02:04:19.790
<v Speaker 2>remote control and shoot missiles into </v>
<v Speaker 2>canyons.</v>

2814
02:04:20.850 --> 02:04:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>sayings all over his body.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's like really fucking really bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>tattoos,</v>

2934
02:09:36.341 --> 02:09:37.260
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2935
02:09:39.020 --> 02:09:44.020
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a see a real trend that guys are </v>

2936
02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:45.650
<v Speaker 2>getting these really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like prison tattoos.</v>

2937
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:46.730
<v Speaker 2>But the crazy thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2938
02:09:46.731 --> 02:09:47.610
<v Speaker 2>it comes from self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gangster,</v>

2939
02:09:47.611 --> 02:09:52.611
<v Speaker 2>all this crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he goes to jail and the first thing </v>

2940
02:09:52.611 --> 02:09:52.611
<v Speaker 2>you did was go into protective custody.</v>

2941
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they're afraid of.</v>

2942
02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:56.540
<v Speaker 2>How did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just apply.</v>

2943
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question man.</v>

2944
02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I had a head of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you get the camera and say,</v>

2945
02:10:03.141 --> 02:10:07.720
<v Speaker 2>my client is a very wealthy man who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2946
02:10:07.730 --> 02:10:09.740
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people could get a name off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beating him up.</v>

2947
02:10:09.741 --> 02:10:12.180
<v Speaker 2>He's not a very big man and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned for her safety.</v>

2948
02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 2>My favorite things is when it is like us</v>
<v Speaker 2>to walk through the law and what we </v>

2949
02:10:17.481 --> 02:10:19.370
<v Speaker 2>would say to the judge in order to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>things done.</v>

2950
02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:25.300
<v Speaker 2>We're only going off old law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were sort of guessing old </v>

2951
02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:30.100
<v Speaker 2>episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you have to do is tell the </v>

2952
02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:30.100
<v Speaker 2>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your honor,</v>

2953
02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:34.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what to monitor when </v>
<v Speaker 2>TV shows have you that you could tell it</v>

2954
02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:37.370
<v Speaker 2>like if a cop was like undercover cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd say,</v>

2955
02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:39.260
<v Speaker 2>are you a cop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have to tell you the truth.</v>

2956
02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:44.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She taught me that off this time lefty,</v>

2957
02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:49.200
<v Speaker 2>but next time you already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you guys are never going to </v>

2958
02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.840
<v Speaker 2>trick me like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would never do that.</v>

2959
02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:52.610
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to tell you they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>cops.</v>

2960
02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:54.410
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing something illegal.</v>

2961
02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:58.160
<v Speaker 2>A cop can let you do that illegal shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do illegal shit with you.</v>

2962
02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:01.430
<v Speaker 2>They can do fucking cocaine with you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrest you for cocaine.</v>

2963
02:11:01.431 --> 02:11:06.431
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's legal and they can get away with </v>

2964
02:11:06.431 --> 02:11:06.431
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how many is that?</v>

2965
02:11:06.431 --> 02:11:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Because if they go under cover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have to do drugs with </v>

2966
02:11:10.630 --> 02:11:10.630
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're doing drugs and you want to be</v>

2967
02:11:10.630 --> 02:11:12.320
<v Speaker 2>a part of some motorcycle gang,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2970
02:11:14.581 --> 02:11:19.581
<v Speaker 2>I'm on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll dump it off the side or the one </v>

2971
02:11:19.581 --> 02:11:19.581
<v Speaker 2>special episode where they had to do it.</v>

2972
02:11:19.581 --> 02:11:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2973
02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:22.550
<v Speaker 2>They throw their fake it on amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2974

<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an antidote pill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will immediately notify the </v>

2975
02:11:27.590 --> 02:11:29.891
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as you take it and make your </v>

2976
02:11:29.891 --> 02:11:30.860
<v Speaker 2>way into the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost gotten credit for job interviews.</v>

2977
02:11:30.861 --> 02:11:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2978
02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hear about that all the time with </v>

2979
02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:40.211
<v Speaker 2>dea agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the DEA agents get addicted to drugs </v>

2980
02:11:40.211 --> 02:11:42.911
<v Speaker 2>because they have to do with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people to get in with them and </v>

2981
02:11:42.911 --> 02:11:43.210
<v Speaker 2>then also I think they just see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking lifestyle.</v>

2982
02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:48.220
<v Speaker 2>They become crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see how many people are getting </v>

2983
02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:50.291
<v Speaker 2>away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you were in the position to </v>

2984
02:11:50.291 --> 02:11:50.750
<v Speaker 2>really be investigating drugs in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

2985
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:52.760
<v Speaker 2>you would see there's so much trucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in.</v>

2986
02:11:52.761 --> 02:11:55.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like an unstopped before he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>start wondering like,</v>

2987
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:56.900
<v Speaker 2>what are we putting our resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards?</v>

2988
02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't this shit legal?</v>

2989
02:11:58.190 --> 02:11:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Where they can tax it and make money off</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

2990
02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:02.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't they just go after the illegal</v>

2991
02:12:02.001 --> 02:12:03.890
<v Speaker 2>people there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like prohibition.</v>

2992
02:12:04.130 --> 02:12:05.930
<v Speaker 2>When prohibition happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties,</v>

2993
02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:07.640
<v Speaker 2>all that shit did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the twenties,</v>

2994
02:12:08.140 --> 02:12:13.140
<v Speaker 2>it was like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like 1933 or something that all it did </v>

2995
02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:15.500
<v Speaker 2>was just made people that were more </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous sell.</v>

2996
02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:17.930
<v Speaker 2>It made people that weren't afraid to </v>
<v Speaker 2>break the law.</v>

2997
02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:23.050
<v Speaker 2>It just made organized crime strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kept a lot of people's hands and </v>

2998
02:12:23.050 --> 02:12:24.890
<v Speaker 2>most of my stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

2999
02:12:24.891 --> 02:12:27.890
<v Speaker 2>I think it made people angry about </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting busted with it and selling it,</v>

3000
02:12:27.891 --> 02:12:29.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think most people want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>

3001
02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:32.300
<v Speaker 2>I kind of aren't going to break the law </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather risk it,</v>

3002
02:12:32.410 --> 02:12:33.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people who are like,</v>

3003
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:35.080
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we can have it anymore.</v>

3004
02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ever research or just speculate?</v>

3005
02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm just speculating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they made cigarettes illegal,</v>

3006
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:45.010
<v Speaker 2>completely illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people will start to </v>

3007
02:12:45.010 --> 02:12:46.960
<v Speaker 2>wonder if it would be like Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>school girls and being horse because </v>

3008
02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:50.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a disproportion amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say some.</v>

3009
02:12:50.630 --> 02:12:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Growing up around a lot of Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>school girls,</v>

3010
02:12:52.401 --> 02:12:55.700
<v Speaker 2>it was common knowledge amongst my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends that Catholic school girls,</v>

3011
02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:59.210
<v Speaker 2>they go religious Jewish school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

3012
02:12:59.510 --> 02:13:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Catholicism is so ridiculous </v>

3013
02:13:04.510 --> 02:13:07.180
<v Speaker 2>that I think even like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing with a religion </v>

3014
02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:11.351
<v Speaker 2>where a gigantic percentage of the men </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are in power are fucking little </v>

3015
02:13:11.351 --> 02:13:12.650
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one got caught.</v>

3016
02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I said it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another anti gay rights.</v>

3017
02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3018
02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:18.220
<v Speaker 2>That was Roy Ashburn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3019
02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:23.300
<v Speaker 2>that was the guy who is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy driving proposition </v>

3020
02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:23.300
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got caught.</v>

3021
02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:23.660
<v Speaker 2>He admitted he was gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that guy's not a priest.</v>

3022
02:13:23.661 --> 02:13:24.530
<v Speaker 2>He's not fucking kids.</v>

3023
02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:25.800
<v Speaker 2>He's just gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3024
02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:30.820
<v Speaker 2>they're all the same fucking pedophiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You loved this guy in with a pedophile.</v>

3025
02:13:31.490 --> 02:13:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Would that religion is so ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's.</v>

3026
02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:38.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant percentage of the men </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are pushing this religion are also </v>

3027
02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>fucking horrible pedophiles that ruin </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's lives.</v>

3028
02:13:41.010 --> 02:13:44.130
<v Speaker 2>If you know anybody that's Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you grew up in a Catholic community,</v>

3029
02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:46.350
<v Speaker 2>you know a bunch of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been molested.</v>

3030
02:13:46.590 --> 02:13:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know two people that got hit on by </v>

3031
02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:52.680
<v Speaker 2>priests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know my friend Tony,</v>

3032

<v Speaker 2>he had a fight off a priest and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend John had to fight off a priest.</v>

3033
02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:01.880
<v Speaker 2>They get attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his priests fucking drool on them and </v>

3034
02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:02.670
<v Speaker 2>breathe on and pull the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend bought another dude.</v>

3035
02:14:02.671 --> 02:14:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I know three dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3036
02:14:03.541 --> 02:14:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Three dudes that got a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all Catholic.</v>

3037
02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:07.230
<v Speaker 2>No girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That money from a settlement.</v>

3038
02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many settlements.</v>

3039
02:14:09.210 --> 02:14:14.210
<v Speaker 2>If you stop and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know New Mexico has some crazy </v>

3040
02:14:14.210 --> 02:14:17.241
<v Speaker 2>ass fucking law or they used to at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time where you could if you had</v>

3041
02:14:17.431 --> 02:14:19.680
<v Speaker 2>sex with a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a man cannot have sex.</v>

3042
02:14:19.681 --> 02:14:22.620
<v Speaker 2>We grow like it's normal age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The age of consent was like 18,</v>

3043
02:14:22.890 --> 02:14:26.670
<v Speaker 2>but if a man to have sex with a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the age of consent was like 13.</v>

3044
02:14:27.090 --> 02:14:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>

3045
02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:31.920
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why supposedly this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>inactive,</v>

3046
02:14:31.970 --> 02:14:35.040
<v Speaker 2>so the Catholic church put pressure on </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to keep this in place that they can</v>

3047
02:14:35.041 --> 02:14:40.030
<v Speaker 2>fucking ship all their sweet boy ass and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would sneak it.</v>

3048
02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all speculation.</v>

3049
02:14:41.911 --> 02:14:45.810
<v Speaker 2>This is all in the Internet faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that speculation,</v>

3050
02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:50.190
<v Speaker 2>the fact is that the age of consent for </v>
<v Speaker 2>male to boy was 13.</v>

3051
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:51.680
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3052
02:14:51.710 --> 02:14:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Same sex males is like 13.</v>

3053
02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Whereas opposite sex like boys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>

3054
02:14:56.190 --> 02:15:01.190
<v Speaker 2>what's really crazy now is the sexting </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where kids are going to jail for </v>

3055
02:15:01.190 --> 02:15:01.820
<v Speaker 2>child pornography because they're taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>a picture.</v>

3056
02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:04.130
<v Speaker 2>They really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came down at some point with like a</v>

3057
02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:05.790
<v Speaker 2>no tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you've made it,</v>

3058
02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:08.950
<v Speaker 2>but you can't have on your hard drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one can have a well there.</v>

3059
02:15:09.010 --> 02:15:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Those laws like we can make an exception</v>
<v Speaker 2>for anyone.</v>

3060
02:15:11.150 --> 02:15:15.390
<v Speaker 2>They are attacking slots for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sending pictures of their pussy.</v>

3061
02:15:15.391 --> 02:15:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're attacking silly.</v>

3062
02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:21.990
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you mine.</v>

3063
02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:24.720
<v Speaker 2>It all played that when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the problem is then it gets out</v>

3064
02:15:24.721 --> 02:15:26.420
<v Speaker 2>to fucking pedophile for maximum go </v>

<v Speaker 2>They didn't want anyone to have it at </v>

3066
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.430
<v Speaker 2>this twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about again,</v>

3067
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:33.630
<v Speaker 2>the point is send us some sweet pictures</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a 13 year old Bush.</v>

3068

<v Speaker 2>This is important shit because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>

3069
02:15:43.530 --> 02:15:48.530
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you can put kids in jail </v>

3070
02:15:48.530 --> 02:15:48.530
<v Speaker 2>because they take pictures of their </v>

<v Speaker 2>Now he's locked in a cage.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's a charge in whipping your decap.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you cover someone's Dick up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna want to whip it out.</v>

3076
02:16:00.010 --> 02:16:01.770
<v Speaker 2>We all lived naked and free.</v>

<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3078

<v Speaker 2>We all live naked and free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be able to trust anybody </v>

3080
02:16:12.650 --> 02:16:12.650
<v Speaker 2>ever where someone will actually fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>by accident would have to happen.</v>

3081
02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering how much suppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3082
02:16:15.810 --> 02:16:19.050
<v Speaker 2>we really have by walking around naked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how much different we would we'd be</v>

3083
02:16:19.051 --> 02:16:20.570
<v Speaker 2>if we walked around naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3084
02:16:20.690 --> 02:16:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking around all closed up.</v>

3085
02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:24.390
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much more different I </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior that will tell you this.</v>

3086
02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:28.220
<v Speaker 2>This is the comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that so any sort of nudity is like a.</v>

3087
02:16:28.270 --> 02:16:30.840
<v Speaker 2>It was like a novelty when I was showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gear.</v>

3088
02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:32.410
<v Speaker 2>When I went to touch women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3089
02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:34.840
<v Speaker 2>when I would touch them even on the arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like,</v>

3090
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:37.170
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like an electric sort of feel the</v>

3091
02:16:37.171 --> 02:16:42.171
<v Speaker 2>other way more sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think covering up and stopping </v>

3092
02:16:42.171 --> 02:16:44.161
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you more sexual so that if you </v>

3093
02:16:44.161 --> 02:16:44.161
<v Speaker 2>were completely unclothed you'd be way </v>
<v Speaker 2>calmer.</v>

3094
02:16:44.161 --> 02:16:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Makes it more urgent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3095
02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:47.950
<v Speaker 2>When I first came to La and our first </v>
<v Speaker 2>acted in a sitcom,</v>

3096
02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like being here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like this.</v>

3097
02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:54.820
<v Speaker 2>The sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole say comp situation was really </v>

3098
02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:54.820
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of negative energy that said a lot</v>

3099
02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:57.120
<v Speaker 2>of fighting going on in the network and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the producers and the writers and uh,</v>

3100
02:16:57.150 --> 02:17:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I'd broken up with my girlfriend and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved out here and we were still talking</v>

3101
02:17:00.191 --> 02:17:00.980
<v Speaker 2>about home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't,</v>

3102
02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anybody here.</v>

3103
02:17:02.290 --> 02:17:04.390
<v Speaker 2>And I was out here for a few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't talk to anybody,</v>

3104
02:17:04.410 --> 02:17:06.850
<v Speaker 2>didn't hang out with anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this chick,</v>

3105
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:12.270
<v Speaker 2>we were laughing about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She gave me a hug on the set and she </v>

3106
02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:12.790
<v Speaker 2>gave me a hug and it was the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling in the world.</v>

3107
02:17:12.970 --> 02:17:15.410
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a regular hug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She hit me with his hobby.</v>

3108
02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:16.930
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like I needed it.</v>

3109
02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Like she gave me a glass of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3110
02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:21.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just a hug man.</v>

3111
02:17:21.581 --> 02:17:25.390
<v Speaker 2>She's just being nice and she gave me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice hug and rub my back and I was like,</v>

3112
02:17:25.391 --> 02:17:26.770
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that felt so good.</v>

3113
02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:29.580
<v Speaker 2>I just felt you need that human contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3114
02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:32.110
<v Speaker 2>if you go like a few weeks or a month </v>
<v Speaker 2>without touching anybody,</v>

3115
02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:34.960
<v Speaker 2>that guy that we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier that lives in the Arctic,</v>

3116
02:17:35.170 --> 02:17:35.900
<v Speaker 2>he went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3117
02:17:35.950 --> 02:17:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I think eight months at one point by </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself just up there hunting.</v>

3118
02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:40.900
<v Speaker 2>And he said it was way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he went crazy.</v>

3119
02:17:41.790 --> 02:17:43.810
<v Speaker 2>That guys just live in wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to see it.</v>

3120
02:17:43.811 --> 02:17:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Some VBS TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his name is Heinemann high,</v>

3121
02:17:46.630 --> 02:17:50.560

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>documentaries ever.</v>

02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:57.820
<v Speaker 2>You stopped to think about it like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy has chosen to live like that in this</v>

3125
02:17:57.820 --> 02:18:02.820
<v Speaker 2>day and age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas we think if we had to live like </v>

3126
02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:02.820
<v Speaker 2>that will be hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Brian,</v>

3127
02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:06.511
<v Speaker 2>how do you think you would feel if like </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden civilization dropped </v>

3128
02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:06.580
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no power and you had a fucking</v>

3129
02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:11.730
<v Speaker 2>light fires with wood and kill animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay alive and it was fucking </v>

3130
02:18:12.011 --> 02:18:13.570
<v Speaker 2>freezing cold out and you were an </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

3131
02:18:14.060 --> 02:18:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I need.</v>

3132
02:18:15.670 --> 02:18:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't live on top of a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't be like that because that </v>

3133
02:18:20.670 --> 02:18:20.670
<v Speaker 2>shit didn't happen.</v>

3134
02:18:20.670 --> 02:18:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be on top of a mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>it all by myself.</v>

3135
02:18:21.581 --> 02:18:26.581
<v Speaker 2>I want to be around civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around civilization.</v>

3136
02:18:27.010 --> 02:18:28.900
<v Speaker 2>There's no food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's growing anything.</v>

3137
02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:32.500
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of mooches and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Want to see some more self sustaining,</v>

3138
02:18:32.501 --> 02:18:33.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3139
02:18:33.170 --> 02:18:35.200
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like,</v>

3140
02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean my family grew up on farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to me it's just like,</v>

3141
02:18:38.590 --> 02:18:39.880
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if some food,</v>

3142
02:18:39.881 --> 02:18:41.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think by,</v>

3143
02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:44.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time if he runs out,</v>

3144
02:18:44.081 --> 02:18:45.460
<v Speaker 2>we'll have tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have,</v>

3145
02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:47.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a serious work ethic to</v>

3146
02:18:47.951 --> 02:18:49.900
<v Speaker 2>run a farm so you can't slack off at </v>
<v Speaker 2>three weeks.</v>

3147
02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anything about farms until</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started working for the UFC and then </v>

3148
02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:58.381
<v Speaker 2>you start talking to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real pharmacy and I'll talk to Matt </v>

3149
02:18:58.381 --> 02:19:01.300
<v Speaker 2>Hughes and all these guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they do like a in depth reports,</v>

3150
02:19:01.301 --> 02:19:02.620
<v Speaker 2>are these guys in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3151
02:19:02.621 --> 02:19:07.621
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Spears and another one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they offered him a fight recently </v>

3152
02:19:07.621 --> 02:19:08.260
<v Speaker 2>and he couldn't take the fight because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in the middle of the harvest.</v>

3153
02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:09.240
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3154
02:19:09.730 --> 02:19:10.830
<v Speaker 2>that's real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3155
02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:15.840
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're out there working hard working </v>

3156
02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:15.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're working all day,</v>

3157
02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:17.830
<v Speaker 2>every day and it's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard work.</v>

3158
02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And there's a mentality that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys love the work.</v>

3159
02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:24.790
<v Speaker 2>There is something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something very satisfying.</v>

3160
02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3161
02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:28.730
<v Speaker 2>that goes back to our days when we first</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered agriculture,</v>

3162
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a visceral Schumann,</v>

3163
02:19:30.741 --> 02:19:35.741
<v Speaker 2>reactional you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel rewarded for having produced </v>

3164
02:19:35.741 --> 02:19:36.790
<v Speaker 2>all this food as a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That juice shit.</v>

3165
02:19:37.290 --> 02:19:39.680
<v Speaker 6>There's a fable that God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he loves his children,</v>

3166
02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:44.920
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gave us a plentiful cattle and crops </v>

3167
02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:48.941
<v Speaker 6>without us having to work for it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the man went crazy and started </v>

3168
02:19:48.941 --> 02:19:49.970
<v Speaker 6>working on itself was so then he took </v>
<v Speaker 6>that power away.</v>

3169
02:19:49.971 --> 02:19:52.490
<v Speaker 6>Then you had to actually toilet soil and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then people were waiting for calmer.</v>

3170
02:19:53.410 --> 02:19:56.170
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you in planning?</v>

3171
02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I've got to take off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take off too.</v>

3172
02:19:59.110 --> 02:20:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Don't just unplug the battery charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calm Down Joe.</v>

3173
02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what we're just talking</v>

3174
02:20:07.511 --> 02:20:09.530
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you start about?</v>

3175
02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Brand farms and that's why hunting this </v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy Chemo,</v>

3176
02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:16.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that's his name that lived in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Arctic.</v>

3177
02:20:16.181 --> 02:20:21.181
<v Speaker 2>That's why he was talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfying it is to be a hunter and </v>

3178
02:20:21.181 --> 02:20:21.181
<v Speaker 2>gatherer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3179
02:20:21.181 --> 02:20:23.290
<v Speaker 2>that he thinks that that's where </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization fell apart.</v>

3180
02:20:23.470 --> 02:20:26.230
<v Speaker 2>That man is most happy when he's out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there providing for himself.</v>

3181
02:20:26.231 --> 02:20:28.000
<v Speaker 2>He says he loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves living up there.</v>

3182
02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Just hunting and fishing and getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>food that way.</v>

3183
02:20:30.310 --> 02:20:31.150
<v Speaker 2>It makes them happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3184
02:20:31.151 --> 02:20:31.960
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go for it.</v>

3185
02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's something to it though.</v>

3186
02:20:34.331 --> 02:20:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you did it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like ultra stimulating.</v>

3187
02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of everything.</v>

3188
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's different situations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people wouldn't,</v>

3189
02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:43.460
<v Speaker 2>but he's doing like natural exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

3190
02:20:43.540 --> 02:20:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Everyday is hiking and he's shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>Caribou and he's dragging.</v>

3191
02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:49.420
<v Speaker 2>He's cutting the meat and he's hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
