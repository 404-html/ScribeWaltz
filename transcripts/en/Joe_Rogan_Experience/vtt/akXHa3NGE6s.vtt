1
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.550
Sweet baby jesus.
We are back again.
Ah,

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.390
ah.
Satisfaction relief,
tension fulfilled,
fulfilled,

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.320
exploded,
whatever.
Listen,
San Diego,

4
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:18.630
you fucking savages were off the chain this weekend.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.610
I want to thank the fuck out of every one of you.

6
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:24.120
It was amazing that that was a one of my favorite shows ever in San Diego.

7
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:27.310
Even with hecklers,
it was great.
It was just a couple of douchebags.

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.570
Somebody boot,
Joey [inaudible],
Joey Diaz.
When he got on stage.

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.470
I think it's the same guy who heckled me later.
He yelled out,
boom,
sure.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.500
It's just some,
some port duty.

11
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.010
Probably if you signed up for the army when he was 18 something.

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.540
There's a lot of those down there,
but the audience was fucking incredible.

13
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.450
It's just got,
damn.
I love San Diego.
That is a,

14
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:48.300
that is what one of the most underrated all time cities.

15
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:52.140
It really is placed incredible.
Further,
we'd fear,
well,

16
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:53.580
it's because of the military thing.

17
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.850
I mean they definitely have an issue with with marijuana down there.

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.980
They shut down all the shops.
It's fucking,

19
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:00.360
there's military everywhere down there.

20
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:04.110
It's crazy if you have military and weed because then they start getting high

21
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.350
and going,
let's just run to Mexico,
man.
It's right there.
Let's just fucking,

22
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.660
let's get outta here.
Fuck this dude.

23
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:14.130
I don't want to shoot anybody anymore anyway.
Uh,
thanks everybody.

24
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.790
Fuck a fantastic show this weekend.
Montreal sold out.

25
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:22.650
Bitches suck at no tickets.
Tough Shit.

26
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:26.040
You always sell out in Canada.
You should probably just get super big.

27
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.750
I should probably just move there as well.
I should probably do.

28
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.020
Canada is fucking awesome.
Um,

29
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.670
even in November in Montreal with the Duncan Trussell,

30
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.140
we are going to be there and eventually see George Saint Pierre going to fight

31
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.530
Carlos condit.
Oh shit son.

32
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:46.730
What a wild weekend that will be.
Um,

33
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.660
this podcast ladies gentlemen,

34
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:53.400
it's brought to you by taking one of our newest sponsors and what Ting is,

35
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.200
ladies and gentlemen is a fair and ethical mobile company.

36
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.370
What do I mean by that?

37
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.170
They don't have all the goofy fucking laws or rules rather set in place by a lot

38
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:07.950
of these cell phone companies,
especially the one that really bites my ass.

39
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.850
And that's the one we have to pay money.
If you want to cancel your contract.

40
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.170
That shit to me is ridiculous.
That's like going to the supermarket and saying,

41
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:18.780
I want to buy milk,
and them saying,
well,
if you want milk,

42
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:22.530
you got to pay for your milk every day and when you no longer want to pay milk

43
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.010
for milk,
we have to get some extra money from you.
That's how I look at it.

44
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:29.520
I don't look at cell phone services,
any other kind of,
I as a good,
you're,

45
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:32.130
you're selling goods just like you're selling milk to me,

46
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.850
maybe in my logic is faulty and if,
look,
if you were smart,
don't get me wrong,

47
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.010
and you were sitting here and you wanted to argue that point with me,

48
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:41.820
you'd probably win.
But my point is it doesn't make any sense.

49
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.100
I know why they do it,
whether the way,
the reason why they do it,

50
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:44.934
it's kind of tricky.

51
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.900
Like when you buy a cell phone from Verizon and it's as 300 bucks,

52
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.690
it's the phone cost more than 300 bucks.

53
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.650
So they sort of tacked that money onto your bill and then if you tried to cancel

54
00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:56.280
early,

55
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.500
then you have to like make up the difference and pay for what the phone really

56
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:00.480
would have been like.
Phones,

57
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.850
like a good iPhone or something that's really fucking expect 600 to $700.

58
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.720
Tim doesn't have that set up.
The way [inaudible] works is you want to cancel,

59
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.840
just fucking cancel.
If you don't use all your minutes,

60
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.210
like say if you have a higher,
um,

61
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.880
plan with more minutes and you don't use it,

62
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.690
they automatically bump you down to the next plan and your next bill and save

63
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:21.910
you money.
Like it is a very,

64
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:26.911
very fair and ethical company and they work off this sprint backbone so they

65
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:30.760
have excellent cell phone service.
Joey Diaz,
a sprint that sprint for years.

66
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.630
If you try to take sprint away from Joey Diaz,

67
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.260
who will fucking stab you fucking sprint cock sucking my shit never goes.

68
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.140
I can make calls from the fucking plane in the air.

69
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.890
You've got a phone call on the air ones.
I Dunno how he did it,

70
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.470
but we were sitting there and his fucking phone Joe,

71
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.890
he never turns his phone off.

72
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.800
You know how they say turn your phone off on a plane?
He's never turned it off.

73
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:51.970
Once he doesn't do it.

74
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.430
<v 1>I always try to like turn it on like about 20 minutes before you land and see if</v>

75
00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:59.450
I can get service.
A lot of times you can,
well yeah,

76
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.500
a lot of times it's planes crashing.
People died.

77
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.960
You have fuck you fucking techno Weirdo,

78
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.860
<v 0>but a rogan.ting.com they will give you $50 off of your first ting device and</v>

79
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:13.680
the devices are all top of the line.

80
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.300
They have a bunch of sick fuck an android phones,
including the one that I have,

81
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.950
the Samsung Galaxy three which I love and I have raved about this phone.

82
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:26.160
It is very hard to go back to an iPhone after you see that big giant,

83
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:29.430
luscious Samsung Galaxy s three screen.
And by the way,

84
00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:32.040
they just outsold a iPhone for the first time ever.

85
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.540
So the galaxy s three right now is the number one selling cell phone in America.

86
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.800
Why?
Yeah,
because

87
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.600
<v 1>the Chinese can't make the iPhone five [inaudible].
They're rioting.</v>

88
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.020
That's what it is.
I know it.
That's a true,
oh,
I would tell the truth,

89
00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:49.610
man looks at Samsung did get that official lead though.
You know what I'm saying?

90
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.090
It's like when James Irv and blew out his knee is because they use American

91
00:04:53.091 --> 00:04:56.680
workers,
right,
Joe?
Exactly.
No,
they don't.
No.

92
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.630
I don't know if there's an ethical cell phone to buy folks.

93
00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:03.170
There's certain shit in this day and age you're going to have to ignore unless

94
00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:08.030
you get a cell phone.
Maynard Montana had a fucking deer antlers and old scrap.

95
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.350
I think they fucking sell shit.
I just pay for one of these tings.
Phones.

96
00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:15.240
Should I just not wait for these guys?
Go obviously not.
You know,

97
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.930
listening to him,
they were like down with the Wikipedia.

98
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.740
<v 0>We wiki people were [inaudible] people do not want to recognize Brian red band</v>

99
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.000
as an official celebrity,

100
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.750
and I say that's bullshit because they recognize a lot of people that are less

101
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:28.430
famous.

102
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.710
<v 1>Porn stars,
every single porn stars in there.</v>

103
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.370
Is there something about the day or not accepting this medium,

104
00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:37.640
and this is a you fuck heads,
better comp color.
Correct.

105
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.400
This is a legitimate medium.
This internet business.
I was in the,

106
00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:43.400
in the newspapers and newspaper sort of.

107
00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:46.610
It looks like Doug's Doug and to me,
but you know,
whatever buddy.

108
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.630
I'm sure they printed.
It's like a missing child.
Have you seen this boy

109
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.640
when he went down to Tijuana to buy valiums and we never saw him again?

110
00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.140
Um,

111
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.640
<v 0>anyway,
go to rogan.ting.com that's our sponsor on it.com was one of ours,</v>

112
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.620
other sponsors on it.
It's got a bunch of new shit in folks.
We finally got that.

113
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.670
We were selling that video that I used to talk about even back in the day before

114
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:14.060
on it,
the extreme kettlebell cardio workout.
We started selling that.

115
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.970
It's amazing.
We also started selling Blendtec blenders,

116
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:19.910
which I just started using a couple of weeks ago.
I used to use a Vitamix,

117
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:24.350
which is bad ass.
It's a very good blender,
but the BLENDTEC is even better.

118
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:28.430
It's incredible how much it just liquefies everything.

119
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:31.520
It's the most amazing blender that I've ever,
ever used.

120
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.270
We were selling it and give it away.
Free hemp force protein powders,

121
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.800
but Blendtec won't let us do that anymore.
It's like a violation of the cars.

122
00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:42.400
We sell it really cheap anyway.
Yeah,
we sell it for $200 less,

123
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.920
more than $200 less than the manufactured suggested retail price.

124
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.770
You can't sell that cause then the competitors,

125
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.770
they don't have that advantage of and the free hemp force giveaway a free him.

126
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.780
We should do.
You should have a coupon code that if you happen to buy a blender,

127
00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:00.020
you can put this coupon code in.
It adds it for you.
So it's,

128
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:03.650
you're not selling it with it.
Yeah.
I still think that's loophole.

129
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.120
We sell it as maybe look at you.
What do you marketing genius.
Yes.

130
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.130
There's loopholes.
She's going to get a suit this fuck.
He doesn't even care.

131
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.090
Hemp for us,
uh,
is another product of on it.
And uh,
I had some this morning,

132
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.680
most delicious protein powder on earth.
It's made out of the everything at on.

133
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:21.850
It is what an honor.
It is like essentially a supplement company,

134
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.660
health nutrition,
fitness company.

135
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.450
Everything we sell is literally the best shit we can find.

136
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.810
We said what is the best blender?
They said blend,
pick,
boom.

137
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.990
We've got a blend tech.
I didn't even have one when we did that deal.

138
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.680
We did it because of these videos where you see a Blendtec blender blend,

139
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:39.320
a fucking iPhone in a powder.
Why would you do that?

140
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:42.110
Because they're amazing because they just want to show you how WIC maybe it was

141
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.850
like an old phone.
My phone is dying,
man.
I gotta yeah,

142
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.730
my new one's supposed to be on the way when a five.
Yeah,
I got a five.

143
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.680
Well about time it's the Samsung Galaxy s three sons.
I don't know.

144
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.580
I wouldn't know about that.

145
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.740
You wouldn't know us into the commercial saying what the Fuck Ting you're paying

146
00:07:57.741 --> 00:07:58.431
for these commercials.

147
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:03.431
Get Brian Read Ben a cell phone but smells a new mood is another product of a on

148
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.800
it.com.
That's a fence.
Fascinating product.

149
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:11.000
It's a five HTP and l tryptofan product with actually it actually bikes calling

150
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:12.370
it new mood.
That's like a,

151
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.150
it's really a legit name for it because it actually does change your mood.

152
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.230
It boosts your brain's output of Serotonin.
It has two factors.
Um,

153
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.750
the way it's explained to me with my feeble nonscientific mind is that one is h

154
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.890
five HTP,

155
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.850
which converts to Serotonin and there's also El Tryptofan,

156
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:36.530
which converts to five HTP,
which converts to Serotonin.

157
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.400
So it gives you a time released effect as it's been explained to me.

158
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.880
But what I do know is this stuff really works.
It's a,

159
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:46.060
it's great right before bed.
It's just,
it makes you feel better.
Your,

160
00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:49.820
your brain is concocted,
have a bunch of different shit.
And we,

161
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:52.540
we know that there's certain chemicals,
especially when you're,

162
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.520
you're dealing with vitamins and supplements not dealing with anything
dangerous.

163
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.380
There's no drugs.
It's not an Ssri,
but it has a very similar effect in,
in fact,

164
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.380
a lot of people who are taking antidepressants,

165
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.410
which essentially raise your brain's output of Serotonin.

166
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.760
The doctors tell you not to take five HTP as well.
They tell you that it's,

167
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.850
it's too much of it.
You'll,
you'll literally develop too much serotonin.

168
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.030
What that says to me,
I'm not a doctor,
but it says to me is that you should be,

169
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.610
I have to tell you I'm not a doctor.
I think that's a dollar a joke.

170
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.740
It's it in steel.
You joked dumb.
Um,

171
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.020
which I think it's telling you that you can,

172
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:30.240
you can get there with nutrition as well.

173
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:32.070
And I think with nutrition and exercise,

174
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.530
there's a lot of people that fill up shit that would feel a lot better,
David.

175
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:38.910
Tell.
I'm just saying,
I'm just saying,
wow.
Put away the cigarettes,

176
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.470
get on it.
Oh.
And,

177
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:44.670
and it used the code name Rogan and save yourself 10% off the number one

178
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.300
supplement for men or something like that.
Um,
this is my new t shirt.

179
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:52.590
This is the gas mask.
Chimpanzee higher primate tee shirt.

180
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.430
You can't see it now,
you know,
for the rest of the podcast.
Yeah.

181
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:59.250
Now you know for the rest of the podcasts with,
fuck,
I'm wearing a,

182
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:03.530
but we have uh,
three new designs in at higher primate and uh,

183
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.880
there's also,
what do you happen to have now?
It's so funny.

184
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.910
<v 1>Garner but yeah.
Fuck you want so I knew David towl.
No,
I was going to say,</v>

185
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.340
what's the difference between the Serotonin and the Melatonin?

186
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.170
Melatonin is my puts you to sleep.

187
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.350
Melatonin is what relaxes you and puts you to sleep.
Yeah.
That's great.

188
00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:22.640
Before sleep to Serotonin is what actually makes you feel happy.
Yeah.

189
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.370
Like dopamine,
serotonin.
Because that take you the wrong one.

190
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.670
Okay.
Well you have like a little tip to your filter.
Like a little,

191
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.680
this is a hunter s Thompson for 2012.

192
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.780
You want to shoot ogres out in the parking lot.

193
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.980
I would love to use that for your teeth.
Is that why you do it?

194
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.230
I do it for my teeth and I'm also trying to stop smoking.

195
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:45.330
So I figured the further I get away from the cigarette,
the more I will.

196
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.730
You need to get a real estate.

197
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.210
I went to smoke it for me and I just do the second hand.
But yeah,

198
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.400
very fucking observant.
Yeah.
We're on top of the ball.

199
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.380
<v 0>That's not the way it's supposed to say.
We're on the ball.</v>

200
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.800
We say we're on top of the pot.
The bumping it fucking show.
Ladies and gentlemen.

201
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:03.600
It doesn't start until I heard music.

202
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.190
It doesn't officially start until Brian cues the track.
And then,

203
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.530
then we moved,
move

204
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.420
<v 1>experience trying my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night.</v>

205
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.390
Powerful.
David.
Tell what's up my brother.
Welcome back.
Thanks for having me,

206
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.530
gentlemen.
Pleasure.
Every time I come to la I'm always helping.
Like,

207
00:11:27.531 --> 00:11:31.500
can I hang with Joe and we're doing it.
Thank you.
Thank you for doing it,
man.
Um,

208
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:31.911
you know,

209
00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:35.570
it's one of the coolest things about being a professional comedian is you get to

210
00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:37.810
hang out with other professional comedians.
You know,

211
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.560
I talked to Stan hope once and he was,
uh,
he was drunk of course.

212
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.330
And uh,
he looked like he was Douggie.
It was just got back from the road.

213
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.740
He was like,
you know what man?
He goes,
I could quit standup,

214
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.640
but I couldn't quit hanging out with standups.
That's how I feel too,
man.
I mean,

215
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:57.190
it's a,
we're so lucky that we have,

216
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.150
I couldn't imagine if I had a deal with like if I had just worked with a bunch

217
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:03.910
of people who weren't funny and hung out with only a bunch of people who weren't

218
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:06.370
funny.
Oh,
we drag drag.

219
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.600
Is there anything worst and non funny people?
Well,

220
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:15.010
I just know that every time I talked to Doug who we both think is amazing,

221
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.370
he's half in the bag and he's at an airport bar.

222
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:23.380
He's like the lax airport board drunk.
I know in America he doesn't play.

223
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.270
I don't,
but people weren't funny.
Don't get offended.
I don't mean if you're not,

224
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.630
I mean,
if you're not funny and you try to be funny,
that's what I mean.

225
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.310
There's nothing worse than that.
If you're not funny,

226
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:36.010
just got to accept that shit.
Although that's bullshit really.

227
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:38.510
Because how the fuck do you ever become funny?
I mean you got to,

228
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.920
everyone was not funny at one time.
I'm a hypocrite.

229
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.440
It's hard because of the phones.
Everyone's on their phone all the time.

230
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:46.900
So there's like very little connection.
You know what I'm saying?

231
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.630
Everybody's like looking at stuff and tweet.

232
00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:52.790
You think it's harder to be funny today than it was back in the day?
I Dunno.

233
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.280
I think that like for me personally,

234
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:57.340
my funny stem from a lot of awkward situations where I was like,

235
00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:58.870
how the fuck am I going to get it out of this?

236
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.140
And like I said something and they laughed and then I fucking bolt it.

237
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:06.340
So I don't know about you.
But that really helped me in my earlier years of like,

238
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:08.290
hey,
it's going to wrap a sense of humor,
you know?

239
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.910
And then unless she could become a comic,

240
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:12.550
then you realize there's other guys like that,
you know?
And then like,
you know,

241
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:16.270
we kind of all gel together and we also have like a perspective on things that a

242
00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:17.410
lot of other people don't like.

243
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:20.990
A lot of people are looking for like happiness and fulfillment and closure.

244
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.310
And I think as a comic you kind of like roll with the way things are and just

245
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:27.580
see the humor in it,
you know?
So I also,
at this point,

246
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:32.490
I feel like I have this a massive obligation to continue to put out material.

247
00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:35.830
You know,
when you got sands and you've really appreciate them and they tell you,

248
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:38.110
oh my God,
we have the best time.
We love you.
You know,
keep,

249
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:41.950
don't ever stop doing this.
Like,
wow,
I can't,
I can't stop.
I got to,

250
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:43.960
I got to work harder because of it.

251
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:46.690
It mean I used to not believe that when people used to say that,
you know,

252
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.390
that they do it for their fans,
but you really have to,

253
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.780
that's the only way you can do it.
You gotta do it for them.
Well,

254
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:56.950
how cool is it when a guy comes up to you and says like,
Dude,
I love this joke.

255
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.190
Or like,
you know,
you didn't do that joke that I love and like,

256
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:02.380
it's like joke that you like and you're like,
aw man,

257
00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:05.230
there is a reason to do this.
Somebody.
Somebody is listening,
you know,

258
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:07.600
I like that.
Do you still love standing up the art form?

259
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:09.520
Do you still like watching it?
Well,
you know,
we,

260
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.640
I think we went to this last time.
It's like I don't consider myself an artist.

261
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.180
I mean,
I consider pretty much everybody else.
I know an artist to some degree,

262
00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:21.181
but I very few tools in my toolbox and one of them is midget and Dick Jokes and

263
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.690
that tool is really been used a lot.
So it doesn't matter.
I don't know.

264
00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:28.660
I feel like I'm more tricky than I am like funny and like,
uh,

265
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.500
I do take a lot of chances,
but I don't really,
I don't know.

266
00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:36.340
I feel like after doing a 26 years that I should have it more together than I

267
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:38.500
did.
I don't,
you know,

268
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.720
Stan hope used you as an example in saying why there was someone not to do

269
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.530
teaching.

270
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:49.150
Someone was teaching a comedy class and he was talking about how confidence is

271
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:52.000
like one of the most important things you have to know funny.
And they

272
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.880
<v 0>use you as an example.
He said,
that is the dumbest fucking example of it.</v>

273
00:14:54.881 --> 00:14:58.470
It's not true.
There's no like hard,
fast rules cause look at a towel,
you know,

274
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.930
brilliant.
Never believes.
I don't believe it.

275
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:04.280
But you are one of my favorite comedians.

276
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.580
<v 2>Well I,
I really come at it from the point of like,</v>

277
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.070
I work really off of negativity.
So I think that that's,

278
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.810
that's Kinda like my zone.
That's where you have power.
My,
you know,
uh,

279
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.700
iron man fucking thing in my chest.

280
00:15:15.701 --> 00:15:19.480
So you have to hate even your own act in order for it to work so much.
Hey,

281
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.280
I have to fly in a day early to pick up all the hate that I know I haven't.

282
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.540
What does that cost from,
what does it all go?
I don't know.
I mean,
it's like,

283
00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:30.790
you know,
first of all,
like,
uh,
you know,

284
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:36.330
it's kind of a great gig if you do hate yourself because you're alone so much.

285
00:15:36.821 --> 00:15:40.950
Like standing in front of an airport chain smoking in 30 degree weather,
uh,

286
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.640
San Francisco,
uh,
where it was.
Uh,

287
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.070
there's nothing but like reevaluating your life,
your act,
you know,
the mistakes,

288
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.550
all that kind of shit.
So I think it's like perfect for me,
you know,
I mean,

289
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.860
I don't know how you,

290
00:15:52.861 --> 00:15:57.130
you roll with like a very cool crowd of like excellent fans really.
You know,

291
00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:00.640
you call your own shots and I just look up to you,
man.
I mean I bow to you,

292
00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:01.900
but I probably had to blowing you.

293
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.950
<v 0>Well that's ridiculous cause too early in the podcast,</v>

294
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.300
one of my favorite comedians is only a few guys that I will go out of my way to

295
00:16:10.301 --> 00:16:13.260
see.
And you're,
you're,
you're certainly one of the,

296
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.210
one of the things that we do different than anybody else is that we go on the

297
00:16:16.211 --> 00:16:20.920
road with each other.
Like we bring,
like if we go on the road,
it's Brian,
it's me.

298
00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:25.510
It's already,
it's Dunkin,
it's Joey.
We bring our,
it's a family.

299
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.830
I just take essentially your family.

300
00:16:26.831 --> 00:16:30.400
So if we go to eat when we go to eat a fucking thousand times a year,

301
00:16:30.401 --> 00:16:34.420
you know it's more than sprite.
Mostly all Fogo de Chao.
Yeah,
we've eaten it up.

302
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.480
Fogo de Chao is in almost every city in the country.

303
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.580
You know those Brazilian steakhouses.
Have you ever chair hit me?

304
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.610
It's the most amazing creation of culinary excellence.

305
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.630
They give you like a little a puck,
like a hockey puck.
Puck looking thing of me.

306
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.150
No,
no,
no.
This is a,
um,
it's like a Chester coaster.
Yeah.

307
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.500
And it's green on one side and red on the other side.

308
00:16:56.501 --> 00:17:01.000
And when it's green they keep common with one of those.
But in Brazil.

309
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.570
Oh,
in Brazil?
Yeah.
It's called a two husker Rhea.
Wow.

310
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.150
And they come,

311
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:10.810
they come with just fucking skewers of meat that's cooked over open flames.

312
00:17:10.811 --> 00:17:12.250
I didn't know you were.
Oh,

313
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.210
<v 2>I thought you were like,
you know,
like very organic and you know,</v>

314
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.920
<v 0>well I eat mostly grass fed meat.
Okay.</v>

315
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.200
My goal is to ultimately eat grass fed meat and game.
I want to,

316
00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:23.970
I want to aim really wild game.
Like,

317
00:17:23.971 --> 00:17:27.240
what will be your ultimate animal to like of all the animals that ever lived

318
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.090
dear delicious.
No,
but there's all the ones that ever lived.
Oh.

319
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.260
Like if I could go back in time and like a dinosaur dinosaur stake.

320
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.210
Could you imagine what a t rex steak would be like?

321
00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:39.690
Like TRX tenderloins or dental wings?
Well,

322
00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:43.370
you can eat alligators and people eat alligators on a regular basis.

323
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:47.520
Swamp people.
They did all the time for breakfast.
Yeah,
I've had it.

324
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.070
It's not bad.
It's not,
they say it tastes like chicken.

325
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:53.270
It definitely does taste like alligators.
That's what alligator.

326
00:17:53.271 --> 00:17:57.270
It tastes like evil to swampy.
Just an evil fucking dinosaur.
Isn't it?

327
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.510
An angry monster.
Yeah.
It's like the panda of the dinosaurs.

328
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:02.790
It was like chill a hundred million years old in that shape.

329
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.320
They haven't changed.
Wow.
So they were,

330
00:18:05.321 --> 00:18:10.321
as they existed more than a hundred 130 years before the big asteroid hit,

331
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:12.420
the killed all the dinosaurs.

332
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.600
He had already been around 130 million years in this form.

333
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.810
Shall we see them wandering around?
They like the rats of the,
the water war.

334
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.790
The lizard world.
Yeah,
they'll eat anything.
They'll just,
they're monsters.

335
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.490
It's even scary than them is that they got pythons in,
um,
in,

336
00:18:27.491 --> 00:18:32.130
in Florida going through the alligator areas now a while and now the pythons

337
00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:35.340
have started eating alligators.
Tow Shit.
I'd love to see that now.

338
00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:37.290
That would be the ultimate,
it's kind of folk put,
pull it,

339
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.060
pull up the Python eating yogurt.
We've,

340
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.180
we've talked about this in the podcast before because it's just the most crazy

341
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:45.270
thing ever.
These,
the snakes have no natural predators.

342
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.880
I would have bet on the alligator.
I would've thought so too.
I would have,

343
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.160
I felt no matter how big the fucking snake is,

344
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.460
it's not going to eat an alligator.
Yeah,
exactly.
Does it make,

345
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.620
it's like all just fucking nothing.
No bones.

346
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.300
But they're so snakes are so gangster snakes do not give a fuck up on an

347
00:18:59.301 --> 00:19:01.920
alligator.
He's not poison.
It's,
he's just a rapper.
He rides around,

348
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:06.030
crushes you and bite you.
That's the point.
You see that,
oh shit,

349
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.270
that's a 20 foot python with the alligator coming out of its body.
Oh my God.

350
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:15.030
Hail burst through the body.
And the thing died.
Oh fuck that sad thing.

351
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.910
That thing is fucking enormous.

352
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.150
I mean it's really hard to imagine how big that must be in real life.

353
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:26.130
If you were out there on that wall,
it's,
oh,
it's wide around like a man's waste.

354
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.200
Shit's fucking huge.

355
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.030
<v 1>That would be the ultimate like Christmas cards to send to somebody you hate</v>

356
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.880
<v 0>thinking of.
You may have alligators by python.</v>

357
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.840
It's,
we have this weird thing about keeping those fucks alive too.

358
00:19:43.841 --> 00:19:47.470
There's these people in Florida right now that are working really hard to bring

359
00:19:47.471 --> 00:19:50.530
back the crocodile,
the American Croswell what isn't at the alligator.

360
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.990
No crocodiles at different species,
it's more aggressive there.

361
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.370
They have a longer point,
your sound and they're,

362
00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.010
they're more aggressive and explosive and one of them just ate a dog in the
keys.

363
00:20:00.011 --> 00:20:02.740
The Florida keys,
that is the worst.
Pull the dog off a dock,

364
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.130
<v 1>losing a dog to a CROC.
That's probably the word monster.</v>

365
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.380
But in Australia that's going to happen like every three minutes or so.

366
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.770
They have scarier crocs.
They have the big crocs.
American crocs are not that big.

367
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.520
What isn't a screen Australia.
Right.
Really on it.

368
00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:18.050
So you go in the ocean is a great way hanging out.

369
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:22.160
There's an alley and there's the dogs,
the dingoes.
Wow.
It just snakes.
Yeah,

370
00:20:22.161 --> 00:20:25.190
Australia.
And you going eat live in a certain part of it?
Yeah,
exactly.

371
00:20:25.191 --> 00:20:26.330
The whole middle kind of sucks.

372
00:20:26.331 --> 00:20:29.920
The whole middle is death is fucking the bush and it's just death.

373
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.550
But that what a great place to disappear.

374
00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:33.350
There's gotta be like no cell phone service there.

375
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.400
<v 0>Yeah.
If you wanted,
if you were like some dude who could survive and you,</v>

376
00:20:37.401 --> 00:20:40.500
you were down with trying to live in the woods,

377
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.360
you could escaped Australia and they wouldn't even go looking for it.

378
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.213
They built it.

379
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.160
<v 1>Jail Man.
I was in New York during the,
uh,
you know,
uh,
hurricane</v>

380
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.470
<v 2>sandy and we were talking to us a little bit before the show,</v>

381
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:53.590
but like you got a doomsday prep.
I mean like,

382
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.620
unfortunately I prepped for the wrong dooms day,
but uh,

383
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.930
which one did you prep for?
I Dunno,
a invasion of clowns.
I,

384
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.190
I prefer a good one.
A good one,
but annoying.

385
00:21:04.191 --> 00:21:07.270
Like clowns would be everywhere and we have to fight them off with like water

386
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:09.640
guns and stuff like that and wrappers.
Yeah,
exactly.

387
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.300
When this was like just fucking,
it was like apocalyptic.
It really was.

388
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.260
That's hilarious.

389
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.780
<v 0>Ooh,
no power.
Did you expect it to be like that?</v>

390
00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:20.310
It was at way crazier than you expected?

391
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.970
<v 2>You know,
the thing about New York though is since nine 11,</v>

392
00:21:22.971 --> 00:21:27.110
like our first responders are like top notch.
They really like step up.

393
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.020
They know what they do,
they got plans and all that kind of stuff.
But nobody,

394
00:21:30.021 --> 00:21:32.210
I guess expected like New York City,

395
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:36.710
a tsunami like wave hitting us knocking out power for like two weeks.

396
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.910
And then there's like Staten Island Jersey where they got it even harder.
But uh,

397
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.120
you take the power out in New York City and you got Somalia basically.

398
00:21:44.121 --> 00:21:46.670
It's just a freaky,
weird,
scary town,
you know?

399
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.270
<v 0>Yeah.
It's really strange when you see how easy the,
the,</v>

400
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:55.350
the film that covers civilization can be removed and Pete savage becomes

401
00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.820
absolutely arrival.

402
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.130
You really have to worry about survival because the first responders are

403
00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:04.890
excellent,
don't get me wrong,
but they're overwhelmed.

404
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.560
There's just the sheer numbers impossible to deal with.

405
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.880
<v 2>There was parts of the city where like I was just walking around and it was just</v>

406
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.810
dark and like guys would roll up on you like you can't see him and I'm pretty

407
00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:17.840
good.
Like nick,
no.
And what's happening?
It got to roll up on me and I'm like,

408
00:22:17.841 --> 00:22:19.130
Whoa,
this is like a Chuck Norris,

409
00:22:19.131 --> 00:22:20.700
you know that scene and every Chuck Norris movie.

410
00:22:20.701 --> 00:22:23.960
What was that like in the factory box?
Knocks over.

411
00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.220
It was like that kind of thing.
Like just weird,
scary faces.

412
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:32.060
<v 0>Just sounds like to walk around a street at night with no gun</v>

413
00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:37.880
<v 2>gone.
No.
I was like,
fuck,
what am I gonna find him with sarcasm?</v>

414
00:22:37.881 --> 00:22:38.714
What's going on here?

415
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.410
<v 0>Walking to where you had to go to and fro in your neighborhood,</v>

416
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.000
but there was no lights on for days.

417
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.920
<v 2>No lights.
It I,
where I lived there was lights,</v>

418
00:22:47.921 --> 00:22:50.650
but when you like we did shows at the comedy cellar,
which is in the village.

419
00:22:50.651 --> 00:22:52.690
They had no lights up until almost the last day.

420
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.460
And we were doing shows to generators,

421
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:58.720
which is kind of cool in a way but bad cause it went out when I was on but uh,

422
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.350
and went out and all these flashlights and candles started popping out of the

423
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:04.480
crowd.
It was like that scene in requiem for a dream,

424
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.780
you know that saying like why they're like asked to ask the flashlights on the

425
00:23:07.781 --> 00:23:10.990
check and all that kinda stuff.
So it was really,
it was really a freak show,

426
00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:14.230
but it was a good show.
But when you're walking around the streets you're like,

427
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:18.790
okay,
this is like,
you know,
what do I,
what can I fight?
Whoever comes at me with,

428
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.050
with a weapon and there's a lot of like homeless people coming off of their meds

429
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.180
too.
So there's like they have like the extra evil in them,
you know?

430
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.350
Oh that's right because they can't get their meds cause there's no power.

431
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:33.010
So it was like Zombie Style Zombie.
I was walking dead kind of shit.

432
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.580
That's scary as fuck now.
Whizzer a lot of that.

433
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.180
Like we like was there a lot of muggings was there,
a lot of it was right.

434
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.300
There was some looting,
there was some whatever,
but it wasn't like Katrina,

435
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:45.650
cause I talked to guys who were in Katrina and they're like,
you know,

436
00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:48.260
everybody's like this is our Katrina.
It's like fuck no,

437
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:50.810
this is like Katrina was like the end of the earth.

438
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.690
That was the end of the world there.
That was like weeks and weeks and weeks,

439
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.080
no help,
you know,
and no power and it was hot and all that stuff.

440
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.870
In New York it was a little bit better than that.
That's for sure.

441
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.460
So I can better than an APP,
but it's still,
it was bad.

442
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.970
She lets you know what can go wrong in the biggest city in the world.
Yeah,

443
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.480
exactly.
When that happens,

444
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:11.510
when the biggest city in the world gets essentially shut down for two weeks,

445
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:14.000
that's a real eyeopener.
Oh absolutely.
You know,

446
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:17.290
like people trying to get into the city and they had to do,
you know,
like buses,

447
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.740
all the trains were like,

448
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.460
exactly like somebody should the Kayak through these tunnels just to do it.

449
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:23.510
Like I say,
like I did it,

450
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.560
I didn't even think about what it must be like at night with no power.

451
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.150
I didn't even think about it.
I would've stayed inside.
Yeah.
Not have left.
Well,

452
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:36.620
you kind of,
it's kind of like,
how do you see where you're going?
It's scary.

453
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:40.010
So unless it's a full moon,
how do you see where you go and exactly.
You know,

454
00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:42.710
the scariest thing I saw was when I was like driving around,

455
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:45.350
like I was in a cab and uh,
calves by the way,

456
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:48.030
were like incredibly hard to get at that point.
But,
uh,

457
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.380
there was like a candle in a window of a project and I'm like,

458
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.960
this is what it's gonna look like after a nuclear winter.
Like,

459
00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:58.700
just like one holdout guy in a,
in a project somewhere.
Like,
um,
you know,

460
00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.030
like Charlton Heston in the light,
you know,
and the Omega man kind of thing.

461
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.390
And you know,
uh,
I was like,
this is it.
This is what it looks like.
You know,

462
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.720
I was it free freak a lot of people out.

463
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:11.090
But then I think the guests thing freak them out even more.

464
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:13.850
The fact they couldn't get gas for their generators and cars and shit.

465
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.190
They're online for like 12,
15 hours.

466
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.600
Talked to a friend who said he was online.
It was two 30 in the afternoon.

467
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:22.550
He had been there since six in the morning.

468
00:25:22.551 --> 00:25:26.210
And you still haven't gotten gas easily?
Easily.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
We never,

469
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:28.790
we never,
I don't think even the,
uh,
government,

470
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:32.780
local whatever state thought like there's going to be a gas problem,
you know,

471
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.920
and nobody was ready,
so wow,
you need that gas for the generators too.

472
00:25:36.921 --> 00:25:39.830
So Jesus Christ by bringing everyone down.

473
00:25:39.831 --> 00:25:43.550
But it was good as bad material from it at all.
Oh yeah.
I've got tons of,

474
00:25:43.551 --> 00:25:47.890
I mean like a,
you know,
the whole idea of like,
um,
you know,
basically,
uh,
doing uh,

475
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.380
shows like in New York,
like the top of the line like guys who,

476
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.650
who pulled the most prone are like,
you know,
the hedge fund guys,
you know,

477
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.910
the club Dj,
you know,
the male model who's,
you know,
by or whatever.

478
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.660
But that week it was all like Renaissance Fair skills like candle maker,

479
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.340
blacksmith,
you know,
any guy who could hook a bike up to a light,
you know,

480
00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:08.880
he would get like,
you know,
uh,

481
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.830
definitely at least the reach around that Yukon man show.

482
00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:14.930
Have you ever seen those shows were important.

483
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:19.010
They have generators that work on waterflow.
Oh,

484
00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:21.050
they take a generator,
they set it up at their camp,

485
00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:23.750
they have a fish camp and they put this generator,

486
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.770
they set it up and then they attach these tubes to it and they stick the tubes

487
00:26:27.771 --> 00:26:31.310
and the creek and the water coming down.
The creek goes through the tubes.

488
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:34.190
And by the time it,
you know,
it focuses in this one area,

489
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:37.340
it's spins this thing around and start to generate.
I want that,

490
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.480
I want to get that crazy I,
and he pulls the cord and it's going on.

491
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.340
I've got electricity 1% from the creek

492
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.490
<v 0>spinning this generator.
So as long as this generator keeps working,</v>

493
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.490
he had his lights on the whole,
the whole thing.
It's crazy.

494
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.650
<v 2>That really is the one thing that you need is like power.
You know,</v>

495
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.780
it really is the one thing that separates us from animals.

496
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.370
<v 0>Well we've somehow or another just accepted that that's going to be around,</v>

497
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.880
even though it's only been here for 150 years or whatever the hell it's been.

498
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.160
We were so used to it,
you know,

499
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:08.850
a million years of human beings and 150 years of power.

500
00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:11.280
We're just like this how we do it.
We've got power.

501
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.550
I could see myself going to my ex girlfriend's house and just hanging out cause

502
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:17.130
she would have like all the candles and the rural like

503
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:24.980
candles a girl has is directly proportionate to exactly how long she will cry.

504
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.133
FDF section.

505
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.930
<v 2>Yeah.
Girls were prepped a little bit harder than the dude's candles.</v>

506
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:33.570
Mentos you know there's like 30 candles,

507
00:27:33.571 --> 00:27:36.120
that bitch just going to cry for a little while and this petroleum base,

508
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.330
you know whatever girl Shit.
Yeah.
But uh,

509
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.450
we have a lot of different things to help you in survival situation and I'll

510
00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:45.360
tell you,
you know,
who really did not step up for this crisis,

511
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.410
the dogs of New York City because like every other person in New York has a dog,

512
00:27:49.411 --> 00:27:52.020
but it's all these faggot.
He has a little dogs and I was like,

513
00:27:52.021 --> 00:27:55.950
they've been genetically built all the cool like wolf qualities that would have

514
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:58.320
helped look on.
So they're like,
what,

515
00:27:58.321 --> 00:28:03.020
are we going to do any food there when the snow hit afterwards?
No,

516
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.000
I was already out of there,
but that was like a one,
two punch of like sad

517
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:11.450
<v 0>man,
a blizzard.
And the really scary things that they're saying.
Well,</v>

518
00:28:11.451 --> 00:28:14.750
who's the governor Cuomo?
Andrew Cuomo.
Yes.
Yeah.
He's a good guy though.

519
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.180
He seems like a good guy.
He said something really interesting.
He said,

520
00:28:17.181 --> 00:28:19.710
I don't want to use the term climate change.
I'm kidding.

521
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.810
I'm paraphrasing him because it's such a loaded topic.
He said,
but you know,

522
00:28:23.811 --> 00:28:28.340
his father had to deal with in 12 years he had to deal with two major storm

523
00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:29.540
events and he's like,

524
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.220
I've been here for 12 months and I've had to deal with three.
Wow.
You know,

525
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:37.270
so he's saying like there's,
it's very possible.
Something's going on the,

526
00:28:37.271 --> 00:28:40.310
I think there's definitely something going on that's never happened in New York

527
00:28:40.311 --> 00:28:40.910
before.

528
00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.940
<v 2>Well,
you know,
a buddy of mine,
I,</v>

529
00:28:42.941 --> 00:28:47.140
I assume you know I'm too a big Jay Oakerson yes.
He's a great guy.
Love Him.

530
00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.280
Do you know of him?
Okay.
Yeah.
You probably haven't worked with them yet,

531
00:28:49.281 --> 00:28:52.730
but really funny guys toured with me a couple times.
His house was wiped out.

532
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.050
He was like in the flood is flood zones zone a whatever.
I said,
uh,
you know,

533
00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.860
it really is weird.
Like when a flood comes at your house.
So I'm lucky.

534
00:29:00.861 --> 00:29:03.920
I like lift up,
you know,
up in that it skyscrapers.

535
00:29:03.921 --> 00:29:06.920
But the scary part about that is like if the power goes out then you're like

536
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:10.840
Kinda Kinda of stuck up there until like,
you know,
you know,
whatever happens.

537
00:29:10.841 --> 00:29:14.060
So you're stuck up there until the water drains out.
Exactly.
You know,

538
00:29:14.061 --> 00:29:17.660
it's like a skeleton,
you know,
basically born.

539
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.580
I believe in the theory that it was a terrorist attack and I think all the

540
00:29:22.581 --> 00:29:26.990
terrorist are now high.
Whether ladies with beards,
Neptune,
Lawton.
Yeah.

541
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.710
<v 0>Well your first part made sense.</v>

542
00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:32.370
The second part is just like your Hitler cat with a fucking dynamite strapped to

543
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:34.050
his chest.
I don't know what you're trying to do that.

544
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.730
<v 2>And a lot of people were just basically milling around a lot of like fires,</v>

545
00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:41.500
you know,
on the street.
Like people make them fires and quick get on the street,

546
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:42.070
which I

547
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.570
<v 1>think they should allow them to do.
Why not?
You know,</v>

548
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.560
you keep a sense of a social exact connectedness,
but yeah.

549
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:55.630
Well it was bad with their food shortages.
A supermarket or a question?
Yes.

550
00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:58.690
Like the first night,
like everybody prepped in terms of like,

551
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.220
you better buy milk and bread.
They always say that milk and bread,
all the uh,

552
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:05.620
you know,
uh,
which were called French toast that we make.

553
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.290
And then like the next day,
you know,
you're like,
okay,
there'll be more,
nothing.

554
00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:12.124
There was nothing left.

555
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.730
All the people from downtown who didn't have access to food came uptown like a

556
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:18.790
horde and like,
nope,
no,
a watchman call it,

557
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.550
it was good that they did it because they had no food and they,
uh,

558
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.890
kind of swept through all the Bodega's and stuff like that.

559
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:27.850
So it was like wiped out.
Wow.
That must've been strange.
Yeah.

560
00:30:27.851 --> 00:30:30.790
I mean like you always assume in America there's going to be food.
You know,

561
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.910
the other thing is the cell phone towers were down,
down.

562
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.460
So even if you had a cell phone,
you couldn't call anybody.

563
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:41.110
My friend Tommy said he drove,
he drove six hours to make a cell phone call.

564
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.690
You got to just drive around until he could find service.

565
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:48.640
But it was six hours before.
That's crazy.
Coco had service though.

566
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:49.431
Did you see the video?

567
00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:53.110
She was posting of her like in the rain with ice teas wife.

568
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.220
She has special bling service.
She had cell phone service.

569
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.910
I said cell phone servers and she has this posting,

570
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.160
these awesome videos of her in the hurricane like rain hitting her while she's

571
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:05.440
wearing like no clothes and she's like,

572
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.230
oh it's so rainy outside is great.

573
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.220
That's how rap video what tee shirt?

574
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.810
It was entire wet t shirt cause and like Jersey you play dot Atlantic city many

575
00:31:17.811 --> 00:31:18.644
million times.
Right.

576
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.850
I've only played it a couple times cause that that place without power is

577
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.810
fucking [inaudible] next to these terrifying with power.
It really is.

578
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:27.270
It's a strange place.
It really is.

579
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:32.260
Because that whole area around Atlantic city is dark,
scary,

580
00:31:32.261 --> 00:31:33.880
fucking depressed area.

581
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.180
The last thing you ever want to do is be a young black kid growing up in Camden.

582
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.990
Yeah.
No,
I mean that's a,

583
00:31:40.991 --> 00:31:45.100
that's a fucking bad part of the country right now that I have to say.

584
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.880
I don't know if the,
if the governor or whatever told you to like evacuate.

585
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:52.180
Would you do it?
I mean,
well,
it all depends on how much money you have.

586
00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:54.610
That's part of the problem with some people can evacuate.

587
00:31:54.611 --> 00:31:56.740
There's nothing they can do.
You go anywhere,
right?

588
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.800
I mean we have to accept the fact that there's been a bunch of these massive

589
00:32:01.811 --> 00:32:05.280
events.
Is that cocoa look behind you,
you,
it's,

590
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:10.150
it's library that is the most ridiculous.
That really is ridiculous.

591
00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:15.100
She
bags of water.
It's like,
look at my boobs,
how wet they are.

592
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.500
That's her tropical storm outfit.
It's crazy.

593
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.900
She must be awesome enough conversations.
I love no wonder why.
I just,

594
00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.960
he's always playing video games.
What are you talking about?

595
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.960
Plays video games and he's like,
come over here with this body.
She has the,

596
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.960
you love the body.
I love the fee that fake,

597
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:34.270
but when I was in Dayton there was a girl really liked that.

598
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.180
I think it's the next boot for real.
She,
this girl in Dayton,

599
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:41.270
a stripper had a fake butt and it was like the Double D's of fake butts.

600
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.030
It was so amazing looking.
She looked like a cartoon character.
Is that,

601
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.610
what does that affect the way they sent a no,

602
00:32:47.611 --> 00:32:52.430
she stopped really well and she dirt bike ride.
No,
and she left me,

603
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:54.050
she left me feel them like,
cause I was,

604
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.570
I wanted to see if I could feel it like a fake boob.
It just felt like,

605
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:58.670
but cause I guess there's so much fat back there,

606
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.000
there's a lot of fat to hide the implants behind.

607
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.950
So it felt like a fake but,

608
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.120
and each one looked like a triple double d boobs,
like a humongous boot.

609
00:33:08.121 --> 00:33:12.710
Like you can put a drink on top of it if that's the latest thing in porno
movies,

610
00:33:12.711 --> 00:33:15.500
right?
Like yeah,
you see that a lot is the fake butts now.

611
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:19.400
I forgot what they call that.
But yeah,
the baton,
you know,
make it the booty.

612
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:22.220
A reboot,
I guess you'd call it.
But yeah,

613
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:27.380
it's been an amazing that the shape of the ASCE has that much of an effect on
us.

614
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:32.060
It's monkey chinks.
It's more even then like then the personality,

615
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.140
like a girl,

616
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.170
the nice personality and she turns around and I asked is just ridiculous.
Like,

617
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:40.680
oh my God.
It's like you're like a bay one or what are you like,
Oh yeah,

618
00:33:40.681 --> 00:33:45.681
I love shapely tones round.

619
00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.320
I mean that's,
that's what it looked like.
Hers was a little bit bigger than that.

620
00:33:50.321 --> 00:33:51.650
That might be real,
bro.
No,

621
00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:55.900
this is photography that looks like it's pointing that,
okay.

622
00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.980
Somebody to shut up that shit now when we were doing the porn show,

623
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.090
you know what I mean?
Joe,

624
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.650
like you were one of them are amazingly greatest guests.
Uh,
we were kind of,
uh,

625
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:07.990
you know,
I think,
uh,

626
00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:12.880
have difference of opinion with Dave's old porn is a show on showtime and uh,

627
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:13.490
it's,
uh,

628
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:18.490
Dave and his friends sitting around watching videos of old porn and you were one

629
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:23.180
of the ultimate,
you are the Hawkeye of the lesson monkey gives a porn.

630
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.430
You know what you're doing.
You're really embarrassing.
Taja Ray,

631
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.420
you kept throwing that out and I was like,
Holy Shit.

632
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:33.470
I had to like go through my porn,
you know,
head to find out.
I was like,
excellent.

633
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:38.060
So thank you.
There was so many and your shows Thursday.
Yeah.

634
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.820
Your episodes Thursday Joe's episode.
Yeah.
This this week.

635
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:45.440
Joe and Ginger Lynn show toe for some reason.
Joe,
you know her,
she,
well,

636
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:49.310
she did my first CD.
She did an introduction to this.

637
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:53.300
A song that I wrote.
Yeah,
she was on my first CD.
Oh Man.
She's very nice.

638
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.200
She used to come around the comedy store all the time.
That's how I knew her.

639
00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.680
Well,
she's a very nice person.
Her body,
by the way,

640
00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:03.230
ginger lanes body I think is perfect.
Yeah.

641
00:35:03.231 --> 00:35:06.620
Well back in the day you couldn't get much better.
She was like,

642
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.360
she looked like she was athletic when she was younger,
but she's just,

643
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:15.030
she was just curvy,
tall,

644
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.110
not too big and she had an amazing body.
Her,

645
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:23.180
her rack is like,
I guess you could say it's like a B or something like that,

646
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.760
but like it totally fits with her body and her face.

647
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:28.850
She's just like a little angel.
It was really,
she was a hard,

648
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:32.180
hardest episode to edit.
She was rotted.
Breaks

649
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:39.510
not jerking off to you.
I was turned your while you were on the screen,

650
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:41.760
but there's a lot of hard to do.
A lot of hard work though.

651
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.740
It's kind of a funny show with z.
You have us and the like what we're saying,

652
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.740
we're sitting on the couch and the couch will like grow or shrink depending on

653
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:53.550
where their genitals are in the scene.
So the cat,
that's what it is.

654
00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:57.840
The couch is like covering the sex organs while they're doing it.

655
00:35:57.841 --> 00:36:00.750
And then we're commenting on the,
on the video.
It was fun,
Dude.

656
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.920
I really enjoyed it.
You of course,
knowing porn.

657
00:36:02.921 --> 00:36:06.000
So while you brought up something that a lot of guys have problems with juice,

658
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.530
which is the male star and not being able to get what you don't like that.
Well,

659
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:14.550
she told us you don't like it.
She told us what it was about ginger did.

660
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:17.760
She said they were all coked up.
There's a lot of blow,
which makes sense.

661
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.360
So that's going to be embarrassing.
It's fuck for the guy.
I,
you know,

662
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:25.170
somehow it all leads to Tony.
What some are calling Lance Armstrong.

663
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.900
Well they shouldn't never use the footage.
It does.

664
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:31.200
Like there's footage where this guy never gets a hard on and he's,

665
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.820
he's banging her in.
His Dick is like half limp,
right?

666
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.930
Like he's like barely shoving it in and he's like pretending.
It's amazing.

667
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.740
Like you shouldn't,
that's it.
That's a terrible piece of work he did there.

668
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.830
Like that sexy that doesn't get you excited.

669
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.900
It's like getting drunk before you go on stage.
It's like,

670
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:48.950
can't you just wait an hour?
Yes.
Son of a bitch.

671
00:36:48.951 --> 00:36:51.180
I mean really it is a sad thing.
Well,

672
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:54.090
it's a fun thing when a guy's drunk on stage and he's having a great time.

673
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.630
Like I've seen crusher hammered on stage killing it.
You know,
I've seen,

674
00:36:57.631 --> 00:37:01.470
I've seen videos of guys pull it off.
Ron White pulls it off,

675
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:05.690
but it's sad when you drunk on stage you're not doing well.
Yeah,
it's sad.
It's,

676
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:09.050
Brian is a good drinker.
Ron is one of my buddies and he is like,

677
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.810
he's a classy drinker.
He was like a black belt.
Yeah,
he's excellent at it.

678
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.330
He's a black belt and drinking.
But in the porn world back,

679
00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:17.420
especially in the seventies and eighties,
like,
you know,

680
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.610
blow back then was like considered,
I don't know you,
you said Adderall.

681
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:25.350
It was kind of the Adderall of our,
uh,
of our time and,
uh,
people just did it,

682
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:28.140
you know,
it was like fun and it kind of got him up and uh,
you know,

683
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:32.520
it's a sexy gig and so they,
uh,
you know,
maybe they overdid it,
but still,
I mean,

684
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.400
hey,
you know,
I'm sure that blow is a lot better than the shit out there now.

685
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.380
You think so?
I,
I have like the real stuff back then.
I,
yeah,

686
00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:40.200
I think it was a lot of pure,
more like,
you know,

687
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:43.140
that was like the heyday of like,
you know,
just powder.

688
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:47.040
So funny that they just accept the fact that that's going to be cut up.

689
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.240
It's like,
it's so,
coke is so,
it's such a watered down drug.

690
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:55.890
Everybody accepts the fact that it's been cut up.
Yeah.
Well universal,

691
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.010
you can imagine like you ever watch the show was like,
you know the drug ink,

692
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.630
like when they show the guys making in Colombia,
you know,

693
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.290
and they just chew on the leaves.
Like I wonder what that's like.
I've had that,

694
00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.590
I've had that good in a tea form.
They take the,

695
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:11.790
the those leaves and just make a tea out of it.
Oh,
I,
it's,
it's love.
Very apy.

696
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.070
Gives you like a,
an update.

697
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.930
I didn't like it because what I didn't like about it is I couldn't shut the fuck

698
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:20.790
up.
And uh,
you mentioned the podcast if you are on that.
Oh,

699
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:24.060
it would be brutal.
I,
even though it was with Stan hope when I did it,

700
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.840
we did mushrooms.
It was the day of the Iraq war.
It was a,

701
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.380
we were in the desert trip in our balls off and uh,

702
00:38:31.381 --> 00:38:34.950
I was drinking this tea and I drank the tea first and t kicked in,

703
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.130
the mushrooms even kicked

704
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.930
<v 3>out.
I was like,
wow,
this tea is killing me.</v>

705
00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.910
<v 1>How did you guys even like,
he is like,
amazing this,</v>

706
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.060
he's like the den or whatever.
The Timothy leary of the ship.

707
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.820
How do you guys t how do you get that?

708
00:38:46.821 --> 00:38:51.530
I mean like I got it from a buddy who had just gotten back from Peru.

709
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.070
Peru is the place Inca tea,

710
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.460
<v 3>they chew those leaves.
You know what's fascinating?</v>

711
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:01.900
The Coca Cola is the number one importer for coca leaves in this country.

712
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.710
I didn't know that they,
they literally take the coca leaves.

713
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:06.544
That's like one of the,

714
00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.630
the secret ingredients in Coke Cola than it used to have cocaine in it.

715
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.500
That's like one of the big things.
Well it doesn't have cocaine in it anymore,

716
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:15.363
but it's still,

717
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:20.490
they still use the extract of the coca leaf and they have like some deal with

718
00:39:20.951 --> 00:39:25.000
some medical,
a manufacturing firm that a,

719
00:39:25.001 --> 00:39:28.930
that takes not manufacturing from extraction from that takes,
uh,

720
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.100
the leaves and takes the cocaine out of them.
So cocacola gets it.

721
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.470
They use it for like the flavonoids or whatever the fuck they use.

722
00:39:37.471 --> 00:39:41.740
That makes it a taste a certain way.
And this company a makes cocaine out of it.

723
00:39:41.741 --> 00:39:46.570
I,
I read this whole article describing how it's all done.
It's fucking banana.

724
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.430
<v 1>So they have like a special take the fun out of the,
yeah.</v>

725
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.200
What they're going to do with weed.
Pretty sad people.

726
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.790
It's going to say that in Israel they're doing that thing now where they're

727
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:58.960
taking out all the fun of the weed just for the medicinal.
Why?
Yeah.
Really?

728
00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:01.530
It's like uh oh duels of weed or something.

729
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:02.880
<v 3>Yeah,
well they're,</v>

730
00:40:02.881 --> 00:40:06.240
they're figuring out that there's different things that do different things

731
00:40:06.241 --> 00:40:10.890
inside of marijuana and one of them cbds I guess.
And those that,
those,

732
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.370
I dunno,
something else.
It's not the,

733
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.620
not exactly canabinoids it's or maybe it is a cannabinoid,

734
00:40:16.621 --> 00:40:19.800
but it's a non psychoactive one.
But it does.
It helps.

735
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.130
It helps you a different ailments.
Well,
marijuana is like very healthy.

736
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:28.440
Eat hemp.
Yeah.
Not even hemp.
Like the actual plant itself.

737
00:40:28.441 --> 00:40:32.670
If you could juice it,
if you juice hamp,
it's really good for you.

738
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.060
<v 1>If you don't,
we're like,
let's say like a doomsday prepping question here.</v>

739
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.240
If you were like in a place where there was only like pot plants to eat,

740
00:40:39.241 --> 00:40:42.120
you could eat them.
Oh yeah.
You can eat them.
They're super nutritious.

741
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:42.841
That's what I'm saying.

742
00:40:42.841 --> 00:40:45.930
You can make a salad out of them and it wouldn't get you high at all.

743
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:51.090
Really healthy.
I guess you'd have to try it out though.
Oh,
okay.

744
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.930
Cause that would be kind of cool.
Like a little like pot cereal.
Yeah,
the poor.

745
00:40:54.931 --> 00:40:56.750
Some us soy milk on it or the cocoa.

746
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.740
What's the stuff that you guys are doing here?
Coco cafe.
They sent me,

747
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.780
um,
it's uh,
it's,

748
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:08.570
it's coconut juice or coconut water.
That would be the mixed with coffee.

749
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.670
That'd be so cool for your kids.

750
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.140
You'd have to be the worst parent or the coolest Marin.

751
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:18.270
It was like kids time for school and I hear some of your pot coco coffee.

752
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.260
I think it's hard enough being a kid going to school high.

753
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.550
Really delicious dude.
It's go,
it's great,
isn't it?
It's like chocolate milk.

754
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:30.660
Do you want one of these ma'am?
Oh sure.
That's great.

755
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.190
They sent me a couple of cases.
Where do you get,

756
00:41:32.191 --> 00:41:33.520
can you just get these like anywhere?

757
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.870
<v 0>It was called Coco cafe.
Oh my God.
It's like chocolate milk.</v>

758
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.930
I like the packaging too.
You know what I mean?
It's excellent.
It's Yummy.

759
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:42.770
It's very good.

760
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:47.250
There's a lot of these coconut water combinations that really suck at deck.
Wow.

761
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.130
Some of them are terrible kind of water and vodka is pretty good.

762
00:41:50.131 --> 00:41:54.470
That's why I drink.
Oh yeah.
It was good taste.
But a lot of these companies,

763
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.370
they have shitty tastes and coconut water.
You got to get coconut water.

764
00:41:58.371 --> 00:41:59.900
Like the reason why I see two o's,

765
00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:02.630
coconut water is the most delicious is they get there.

766
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.650
It's a totally different coconut tree.
They get their toe coconuts from Thailand,

767
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:10.850
from one small place,
one plantation,
and the coconuts,

768
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.970
the trees are short treats and I'm like five feet tall.

769
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.060
Is it totally different tree like you picture those big tall coconut trees.

770
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:20.270
Those apparently tastes like dog shit.
That's,

771
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.180
that's most people are getting their coconut water from those.

772
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.040
But the boutique places like c two o like c two o there,
they're really cool.

773
00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:30.830
And they send us free shit too.
Um,
and they're,

774
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:34.650
they have the most delicious coconut water.
It's like very sweet.
It tastes good.

775
00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.020
But ultimately you can't fuck with fresh coconut water.
You ever get it?

776
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.190
Like right from a coconut Thai restaurant.

777
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.370
If you go to a Thai restaurant or even some Chinese are wetter,

778
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.590
but you can the law,

779
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.380
I have fresh coconuts and I never knew this and they just split the top off and

780
00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:51.980
it's delicious.
Then you take a spoon and eat the white shit.
When is that again?

781
00:42:51.981 --> 00:42:54.050
The white shit in there talking to me of come.

782
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.790
It's really super healthy for you too.
That will,
especially that water,

783
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:01.280
that water from a fresh coconut.
It's just,
Oh,
it feels so good.

784
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:05.780
After you've worked out.
Just delicious.
Yeah.
To this day,
Coca Cola steel imports,

785
00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:09.080
cocoa leaves,
which are used to manufacture cocaine in the United States.

786
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.170
It's not announced anything that you know,
hey,
I'm for it though.

787
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.750
I'm for all legalization of all drugs.
Colorado.

788
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:18.890
They just legalized recreational pot and Washington.

789
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.800
It was going to be interesting to see what the federal government decides to do

790
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:24.920
about that.
Yeah.
They step in and decide to start arresting.

791
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.560
I think leave them the fuck alone.
That's a long time ago.
I just let it happen.

792
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:33.410
I mean,
the problem is it doesn't ever seem like anybody wants to relax the,

793
00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:36.260
in this country.
Yeah.
Everybody's always trying to rest.
There's no,

794
00:43:36.261 --> 00:43:40.700
there's no relaxing of laws.
It's like an acceleration of laws.
Especially.

795
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.990
The other problem is that the economy's down and when the economy's down,

796
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.800
it's hard to tell people,
you know,

797
00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:52.670
we're going to change laws and put people out of work who are law enforcement

798
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:54.920
officers.
Cause that's what would happen.
I mean if you,

799
00:43:54.921 --> 00:43:59.510
if you all of a sudden made marijuana completely legal and you didn't need DEA

800
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:02.980
agents to chased after,
we'd have a lot of fucking unemployed people.
There's,

801
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.140
there's a lot of people that they're the,
a lot of rest,

802
00:44:06.141 --> 00:44:07.520
if you look at all the arrests,

803
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.570
there's millions of arrest attributed every year that are marijuana related.

804
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.400
And those all equal law enforcement officers have to work,
you know,

805
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:20.060
to people to jail.
There's like lawyers court fees,
there's,

806
00:44:20.061 --> 00:44:22.970
there's money to be made and keeping it illegal.

807
00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:26.990
And so that's one of the hardest parts about making anything legal is the money

808
00:44:26.991 --> 00:44:29.960
behind it.
But how has it worked like he live in Colorado?
Okay,

809
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:31.830
so you want to buy some pot.

810
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.170
<v 2>So what do you do?
You go to a store,
is there a truck?</v>

811
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:35.820
You flag it down like an ice cream truck.

812
00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.980
<v 0>You're going to have a certain amount you're allowed to have.</v>

813
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:45.250
And right now it's the only medical set up in the country that where they allow

814
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:50.180
the growers to make a profit in California and not supposed to make a profit.

815
00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.080
Meticulous.
Yeah.
So in California,
like when you see these big places,

816
00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.970
so those are the ones that get shut down because you know,

817
00:44:55.971 --> 00:44:59.390
they're making like x amount of millions of dollars a year selling pot.
Well,

818
00:44:59.391 --> 00:45:02.720
you're not supposed to be doing that.
And when you do do that,

819
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:05.420
I think the only way to do it is you have to give all the money back to the

820
00:45:05.421 --> 00:45:08.240
community or you know,
make it,

821
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:13.090
make it so that all the money goes to charities or you know,
funds are there.

822
00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.830
There's some sort of a workaround where you get a,
um,

823
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:20.150
a fair wage from working there and everyone,
including the owner,

824
00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:22.640
would get a fair wage and then the money has to get distributed.

825
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.740
Colorado doesn't have it like that in Colorado.

826
00:45:24.741 --> 00:45:27.450
You could just make money selling weed.
That's how it should be.
Yeah.

827
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.400
That'll be like,
you know,
the pot bearings farming,
man,
that's what it is.

828
00:45:31.401 --> 00:45:32.540
It's fucking farming.

829
00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.740
And this idea that it's different because it's a drug that it's so stupid.

830
00:45:36.741 --> 00:45:39.620
There's plenty of drugs available in this country to pretend this country is

831
00:45:39.621 --> 00:45:42.350
anti-drugs is one of the dumbest fucking things ever.

832
00:45:42.351 --> 00:45:44.630
Everybody looks forward to doing drugs and this country,

833
00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.350
we look forward to drinking.
It looked forward to smoking.

834
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.840
They look forward to having a cup of coffee and these are all of these are
drugs,

835
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:51.440
you know?

836
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.870
<v 2>Yeah.
It's like,
let the people be adults,
you know?
I mean,</v>

837
00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.590
there's so much pain and suffering out there.
Might as well.
Like if this,

838
00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.500
if this takes some of the edge off of that,
let it happen,
you know?

839
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.300
<v 0>Yeah.
You're not going to stop it by making things illegal.</v>

840
00:46:03.301 --> 00:46:06.180
You just going to create an industry off of keeping it illegal.

841
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:11.300
The only way you get people to not do things is through education.
And you know,

842
00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:13.020
whether it's their own personal education,

843
00:46:13.021 --> 00:46:16.020
like if they get to watch people fuck up.
You know,
I,
I've never done coke.

844
00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.770
I've never done coke because I watched people who when I was a kid who did coke

845
00:46:19.771 --> 00:46:21.930
and their life fell apart,
I saw it happen.
I was like,

846
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.850
Oh keep that shit away from me.
But

847
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.760
<v 2>plus you're an athlete.
So I mean like as an athlete you can't do certain things.</v>

848
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.220
<v 0>Yeah.
Cooks.
It's certainly a bad one.
Yeah.
A bit of butter.</v>

849
00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:31.510
A lot of athletes do it,
man.

850
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:35.420
<v 2>Yeah.
Like in the 70s I like a lot of the sports guys,
especially like a baseball,</v>

851
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:37.850
you know,
hockey,
that's kind of those kind of,
they were like,

852
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.510
they were a racked out on that.

853
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:43.820
<v 0>So I'm too impulsive.
I don't trust myself if I really enjoyed it.
Yeah.</v>

854
00:46:43.821 --> 00:46:45.710
I don't trust myself.
I don't want to,

855
00:46:45.711 --> 00:46:48.400
I don't want to have anything in my system that's addictive like that.

856
00:46:48.401 --> 00:46:51.770
Cause it seems like cocaine is very physically addictive.
Yeah.

857
00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.140
Heroin's very physically addictive,
right?

858
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:58.350
<v 2>Heroin.
Yeah.
I don't,
I don't know about that one.
That one I could see being uh,</v>

859
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.570
uh,
which call it,
they should,
uh,
if people have a heroin addiction,

860
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:04.270
they should have the needle exchange and all that kind of stuff.
But yeah,

861
00:47:04.271 --> 00:47:07.210
nobody should promote heroin.
I mean,
you can't make it into a cookie.

862
00:47:07.211 --> 00:47:08.044
There's no fine,

863
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:13.310
you're a musician then it should be a law that you have to at least try it.

864
00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:18.690
Can you imagine if every musician had to do heroin?
Like some of that Babak?

865
00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:22.000
I'm shit out there.
I would have a whole different,
whole different take on it,

866
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:22.600
you know?

867
00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.760
<v 0>Yeah,
no kidding.
The dog.</v>

868
00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:29.680
Nothing shook up the music world more than heroin.
Marijuana.

869
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.350
<v 3>Yeah.
I guess I want to shut that up a lot too.</v>

870
00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:37.150
But there was the bands who did heroin had very specific sort of,

871
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.230
they had like a,
an intensity and an emotion and an honesty to their,

872
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:44.530
their stuff that the bubble gum people,
you know,
if it's weird,

873
00:47:44.531 --> 00:47:47.980
if you go back and listen to like buddy Holly or something like great music,

874
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.370
but listen to like what that guy was doing and then,
you know,

875
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:54.990
listening to Nuvana listen,
you know,
listen to the hip with frank,

876
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.310
Frank Zappa and Alice in chains.

877
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.630
<v 2>That guy was on every,
I think Frank Zappa was like almost the uh,
you know,
yeah,</v>

878
00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.800
it was like a one stop shopping kind of drugs.
I mean,

879
00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:09.090
but he was on cooler drugs too,
like ecstasy and uh,
you know,
I guess,
uh,
Lsd,

880
00:48:09.091 --> 00:48:12.360
stuff like that where the words are the best when you don't really know.

881
00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.450
I don't want to say,
but I think he,
when I was 15,

882
00:48:15.451 --> 00:48:19.200
I would listen to Zappa tapes in the church parking lot and just that first time

883
00:48:19.201 --> 00:48:21.990
smoking weed and you're just like listening to his crazy shit.

884
00:48:21.991 --> 00:48:26.850
It was like watching,
it was like virtual acid trips.
That guy is an artist.

885
00:48:26.851 --> 00:48:28.920
That guy was really,
there's no one like that guy

886
00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.760
<v 3>unusual.
I got introduced to him when I was,
I was probably like 10 years old.</v>

887
00:48:33.761 --> 00:48:36.770
My friend's dad was into him.
He was,
yeah,

888
00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.970
Frank Zappa and the mothers of invention.
He was the guy.

889
00:48:39.971 --> 00:48:44.790
I remember the dude drove a sob.
She was like 1970 dude had a sob.

890
00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:49.060
I was like,
what is that thing?
That's crazy ass car and he was in a Frank Zappa.

891
00:48:49.061 --> 00:48:50.350
He's just a cool ass dad.

892
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:53.460
<v 2>Well that's the whole thing about like this whole now like with rich people,</v>

893
00:48:53.461 --> 00:48:56.400
you know it's like you know how much money the rich people need.

894
00:48:56.401 --> 00:48:58.860
I guess now like the ultimate park has a private jet,

895
00:48:58.861 --> 00:49:02.400
but back then it would have been like a car.
You know,
Butler

896
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:03.770
<v 3>and I had obsessive.</v>

897
00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.730
I think you look at it like some of these hedge fund guys where they were

898
00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:08.691
talking about,

899
00:49:08.691 --> 00:49:13.550
there was one guy whose wife got some of the bailout money because the bail out

900
00:49:13.551 --> 00:49:16.940
money,
a lot of it was in the form of loans and this guy was worth,

901
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:20.960
who knows how many hundreds of millions of dollars.
But they showed his house,

902
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.530
they live zoomed in on his house in the Hamptons and it was just fucking,

903
00:49:24.531 --> 00:49:28.220
it's sad.
Huge craziness.
This guy,

904
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:32.180
I mean you can't even call it a compound.
It was a castle.
He had a castle,

905
00:49:32.181 --> 00:49:34.940
he has a castle in the Hamptons.

906
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:38.870
<v 2>See I don't even like that when I go to a hotel.
Like if it's too fancy,
you know,</v>

907
00:49:38.871 --> 00:49:42.590
like a whatever they,
you know,
four seasons.
Yeah.
Like I like,
I don't do any,

908
00:49:42.591 --> 00:49:45.660
I don't rate any of that.
I don't,
I know it's not in my ride or anything.

909
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:47.920
I like hotel or I can do my laundry.
That's what,

910
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.610
that's like the ultimate perk for me.

911
00:49:49.611 --> 00:49:52.790
It's like if I can do my shitty laundry cause I'm on the road so long,

912
00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:56.150
then I feel good.
But there's some hotels where like everybody is like,
Oh yeah,

913
00:49:56.151 --> 00:49:58.190
this is going to get a massage and all that kind of thing.

914
00:49:58.191 --> 00:50:01.940
I'm not into that courtyard Marriott.
It's like a little house,

915
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:03.470
a little home away from home.

916
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.730
<v 3>Yeah.
Courtyard Marriott.
That's a good spot.
It's a good middle ground.</v>

917
00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.070
<v 2>Like when I told her with Norton and uh,
already Lang,
you know,</v>

918
00:50:10.071 --> 00:50:13.880
we're on the antisocial tour,
you know,
those guys,
I think they like it a little,

919
00:50:13.881 --> 00:50:17.840
like more.
I think they like it better when it's like that.

920
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:19.910
I just don't like it,
you know?
But,
uh,

921
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.820
we usually all stay at the same place and that's a fun tour because,
you know,

922
00:50:22.821 --> 00:50:27.340
those guys,
they're just good guys.
And uh,
you know,
we're all so old now and uh,

923
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:27.771
you know,

924
00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:31.280
we've all been through the ringer to some degree and Norton is just incredibly

925
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:35.510
fearlessly funny and rd is naturally probably one of the best comics I've ever

926
00:50:35.511 --> 00:50:39.470
seen in my life.
And,
uh,
you know,
uh,
it,
it's just fun to hang with these guys.

927
00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:41.060
Cause now we're at that age where it's just like,

928
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.260
it's just fun to be around guys that,
you know,
and you can just fucking,
you know.

929
00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:48.680
Yeah.
And we please casinos and like,
you know,

930
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.500
it's like our biggest thing is like,
where are we going to eat?
Let's eat.

931
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.500
You know,
like that's a big,
that's a big fun of the night.
You know,

932
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:58.110
<v 3>it's so fun going on tour with friends and it really makes it the whole</v>

933
00:50:58.111 --> 00:50:59.250
experience way better.

934
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:03.540
I just did a San Francisco and Seattle last weekend with Fitzsimmons.

935
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.560
<v 2>Oh,
he's one of my best friends in comedy.
Yeah.</v>

936
00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:10.530
<v 3>I love that guy.
And we sprayed,
we had such a good time,
man.
It was so fun.</v>

937
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.470
<v 2>He is one of the most underrated comics cause his comedy is so,</v>

938
00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:19.390
it's so good.
It's so dry and funny and well thought out.
And uh,
you know,

939
00:51:19.391 --> 00:51:21.160
I know this turns to a big stroke festival comedy,

940
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:23.650
but if you're anywhere what Greg is touring,

941
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.980
go see him because he really is a great comic.
I like them.

942
00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:31.030
<v 3>Yeah.
He killed it.
He killed it in San Francisco and Seattle.
It was awesome.</v>

943
00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.580
He was really,
really fucking funny.
It's not attack style.
Boston Commons.

944
00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:38.590
Yeah.
We started out together for the summer.

945
00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:40.630
We were like a week apart from each other.

946
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:44.240
<v 2>Boston is like turning out to be,
this is the,
you know the,</v>

947
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:49.220
the generation of the Boston comics,
you know,
you Greg Louis of course.

948
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:51.410
Nick Depalo.
Yeah.
These are the guys.

949
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.340
<v 3>Well there was a lot back then man.</v>

950
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:58.280
It was a very unusual time as far as like the development of standup.
You,

951
00:51:58.281 --> 00:52:03.210
you had one area where you had so many clubs and so many comics in this one town

952
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:05.610
like you could go to.
I would always amazed,
amazed me.

953
00:52:05.611 --> 00:52:09.060
Like I would go to like Pittsburgh or Philly and I'd be like,
where's the scene?

954
00:52:09.061 --> 00:52:10.770
Where do you guys go?
And you got an Nick's comedy stop.

955
00:52:10.771 --> 00:52:12.420
You've got to have stitches.
They didn't have anything.

956
00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:16.320
Nothing like we had so many places to go.

957
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.440
Like if I knew I like open mic night was a Sunday night.

958
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:23.610
I knew that if I went to open mic night,
I would see Teddy Bergeron.
I would see,

959
00:52:23.611 --> 00:52:27.750
you know,
Tony v Tony's via all those guys.
They'd be working out,

960
00:52:27.751 --> 00:52:31.200
they'd be hanging out,
they would go up and do sets.
You would see them,

961
00:52:31.201 --> 00:52:33.960
they would do sets on Sundays and Monday nights it would go up at the end of the

962
00:52:33.961 --> 00:52:38.790
show and perform mean it was like a real community of standup comedy.

963
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:41.370
But it's not like that.
Even there anymore.
It died.

964
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:45.530
<v 2>Yeah,
there's,
I was just at the,
at the theater in Boston and you know,</v>

965
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.070
if you want to run around and do other sets,
these really not many places at all.

966
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:51.800
And if you're starting out there,
I can only imagine how you do it,
you know,

967
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.060
I don't know what happened.

968
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.960
I think that they overdid it because every other place,
like,
you know,

969
00:52:56.961 --> 00:52:59.360
there's the Hooky Lau and the,
uh,
you know,

970
00:52:59.361 --> 00:53:01.020
the place in chickopee like Chinese food,

971
00:53:01.021 --> 00:53:03.080
the restaurants were doing shows that like,

972
00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:07.880
the crowds I guess got baby it or like,
you know,
spoiled and they're like,

973
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:09.830
there's plenty of comedy out here.
I don't have to go see it.

974
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.330
And there were a lot of like,
you know,

975
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.970
for every good comic there's like three or four hacks,
you know,

976
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:16.440
so I guess after a while,
like,
you know,
uh,

977
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:19.880
they always say the cream rises to the top,
but you know,
it's a pretty big rise.

978
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:22.670
There's a lot of guys who would just,
you know,
EC and by what they're,
you know,

979
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:23.440
clapper Joe.

980
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:23.670
<v 3>No,</v>

981
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:27.150
it's interesting though in the beginning there were less bad guys and more good

982
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:31.530
guys.
If you go back to like the Jimmy tingle error,
Jimmy tingle,

983
00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:36.110
Barry Crimmins,
Tony v,
Lenny Clarke,
that that era,
they're,

984
00:53:36.111 --> 00:53:37.020
they're all killers.

985
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:41.790
There was like more great comics back then than there were mediocre guys.
Wow.

986
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:45.660
You know,
when I started out,
I started out in 88 and I got to see,

987
00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.620
I've got to see,
you know,

988
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:50.520
like some of the best comic he's ever like the local guys.

989
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:52.860
I got to see them like all the time.

990
00:53:52.861 --> 00:53:56.580
There was so much good comedy and that one place there was,

991
00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:00.180
I would say it was one of the rare instances there where there was more good

992
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:01.770
comedy within,
there was bad comedy

993
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:05.060
<v 2>that always got me about the Boston guys compared to the New York I was on.</v>

994
00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:06.870
I hope I didn't say this last time it was on your show,

995
00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:08.790
but they came to New York.

996
00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:11.910
You guys all eventually came to New York and you guys were ready to headline

997
00:54:11.911 --> 00:54:13.800
like almost immediately.
Whereas the New York guys,

998
00:54:13.801 --> 00:54:15.840
like we were like years away from headlining.

999
00:54:15.841 --> 00:54:17.790
Like we were just trying to like work the weekends.

1000
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:21.790
It was a slower process because there was just too much.
Uh,

1001
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:26.850
I guess open mic too much.
Uh,
you know,
too many comics and not enough stage time.

1002
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.710
So you really had to fight for the stage time,

1003
00:54:28.711 --> 00:54:32.520
but you guys definitely knew who you were.
You,
you had an act,

1004
00:54:32.521 --> 00:54:35.700
you had a perspective and then you,
uh,
definitely,
you know,

1005
00:54:35.701 --> 00:54:39.120
came to the scene and made it way better.
It made it way better.

1006
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:43.470
<v 3>Well,
you know what it was is that Boston guys had a chance to work long sets.</v>

1007
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.633
We would do,

1008
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.410
we would work for like the comedy connection had a bunch of gigs and Barry Katz

1009
00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:50.101
at a bunch of gigs,

1010
00:54:50.101 --> 00:54:52.950
all these different people at gigs and there were all over the place and you

1011
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:57.180
would do 45 minutes.
You can do an hour here,
half hour here in 45 minutes here.

1012
00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:00.780
So we weren't just doing the short sets in town when I was,

1013
00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.440
when I went to New York and I saw that everybody would dictate cab and go from

1014
00:55:04.441 --> 00:55:07.650
one cry crowd to another crowd doing seven minutes here in seven minutes.

1015
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.050
I was like,
that's crazy.
That doesn't make any sense.
Like I'd,
we live for years.

1016
00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.680
So even when I lived in New York,

1017
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:17.250
I did almost all my sets on the road cause it all my sets in Connecticut.

1018
00:55:17.251 --> 00:55:21.090
I was like I can go to do a John Schuler Gig in Connecticut and make 150 bucks

1019
00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.690
or I could go do a set in the city and make like 10 or something like that,

1020
00:55:24.691 --> 00:55:27.960
whatever.
What a danger fields paid the most.
They paid like 50 or something.

1021
00:55:27.961 --> 00:55:28.340
Right.

1022
00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.200
<v 2>Well like governors,
which is on long island.</v>

1023
00:55:30.201 --> 00:55:32.090
That's kind of where I kind of started out.

1024
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:36.650
I just recently was there and the guys who run governors now are so pro comedy,

1025
00:55:36.651 --> 00:55:39.560
so pro like supporting comedy,

1026
00:55:39.561 --> 00:55:41.720
bringing up new new talent and all that kind of stuff.

1027
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.510
And it's really great to see because for a long time,
you know,

1028
00:55:44.511 --> 00:55:48.230
like the outline clubs were really just like,
you know,
Jersey,
the island,

1029
00:55:48.231 --> 00:55:49.100
Connecticut,
you know,

1030
00:55:49.101 --> 00:55:51.920
you just went there for money and now it's like this is like a good place to

1031
00:55:51.921 --> 00:55:52.670
work out.
Yeah.

1032
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:55.760
<v 3>Well governors was always really good governance was topline club.</v>

1033
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:59.690
That was always really good.
And um,
the,
the,
the brokerage,

1034
00:55:59.691 --> 00:56:02.600
remember the brokerage brokerage pub?
Yeah,
that was a great place.

1035
00:56:02.601 --> 00:56:05.450
So there was always a lot of good places to do standup,
you know,
of course,

1036
00:56:05.451 --> 00:56:10.040
rascals,
rascals,
east end,
rascals down the shore.
Rascals.

1037
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.060
<v 2>Such a hearty cause that was a great,
great club.
And,
uh,
you know,</v>

1038
00:56:13.061 --> 00:56:14.080
you talk about jersey,

1039
00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:18.700
that was like the place where like dice would come in and dom and all those guys

1040
00:56:18.701 --> 00:56:20.080
that would come in,
it'd be a big event.

1041
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:24.160
<v 3>Ah,
yeah.
I don't remember.
It was a go see you guys when I lived in New York</v>

1042
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.970
<v 1>and someone would say,
you know,
hey,
this guy's going to be,
you know,
at a,</v>

1043
00:56:27.971 --> 00:56:31.630
at rascals.
Like we would drive wow.
Relays to watch the show.
Yeah.

1044
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:35.140
Cause it was a place where you could see someone do a real long set,
you know,

1045
00:56:35.141 --> 00:56:38.440
like a Caroline's or something like that where you get to see them do like 45

1046
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:40.910
minutes or an hour.
Yeah.
Caroline's and Gotham

1047
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:45.460
<v 2>the big like,
you know,
you get to do an hour in the city and um,</v>

1048
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.960
the great and you know,

1049
00:56:46.961 --> 00:56:50.110
it's hard on the crowd I think just to some degree because you know,

1050
00:56:50.111 --> 00:56:53.560
there's a lot of like expenses,
a parking and food and all that kind of stuff.

1051
00:56:53.561 --> 00:56:55.960
But at the end of the day it's kind of cool that you get to see,

1052
00:56:55.961 --> 00:56:59.440
like we just worked with Amy Schumer.
She's so funny.
She's so good.

1053
00:56:59.441 --> 00:57:02.800
Like I started at Gotham and she fucking rocked out and,
uh,
you know,

1054
00:57:02.801 --> 00:57:05.310
I'm going to be playing Caroline's down the road and uh,
you know,

1055
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.960
you always like it when you get to do a long set in your hometown.

1056
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.310
<v 1>Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
I love Gotham for that very reason too.
I just,</v>

1057
00:57:11.311 --> 00:57:14.070
I never really did many sets at the other places.

1058
00:57:14.071 --> 00:57:17.300
I occasionally I would do like Boston comedy or the seller or,

1059
00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:20.490
or the comic strip,
but it just,
it always seemed to me like I,

1060
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.070
if I could do a long set,
it would be better for my act.

1061
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:26.070
<v 2>Well,
the seller now has like,
become this like a,</v>

1062
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.460
I guess you could call it like the,
uh,
the Alamo of comedy.

1063
00:57:29.461 --> 00:57:32.960
Like people come in and they just take a picture of the front because of Louis.

1064
00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:33.240
You know,

1065
00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.600
Louis has like put it on the map and Louie who was probably one of the best

1066
00:57:36.601 --> 00:57:40.890
comics ever,
he,
he goes down there and test sets and rock and uh,
you know,

1067
00:57:40.891 --> 00:57:42.740
Chappelle when he's in town.
And,
uh,

1068
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:44.880
I guess there's other guys like Aziz and things like that.

1069
00:57:44.881 --> 00:57:47.670
So you do get to see like some celebrity comics there.

1070
00:57:47.671 --> 00:57:51.990
But the majority of the guys working there are like pretty hardcore headlining,

1071
00:57:51.991 --> 00:57:55.650
you know,
top of the line comedy and the people who run it are,
you know,

1072
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.980
therefore comedy like did not promoters like let's you know,

1073
00:57:58.981 --> 00:58:03.270
like turn this into a,
you know,
a website or kind of know cartoon or something.

1074
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.190
<v 1>Well they must feel so fortunate when that does happen.</v>

1075
00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:10.270
When you get a place where a bunch of great comics like Louis and Chris Rock and

1076
00:58:10.271 --> 00:58:13.750
all these different gun you show up and decided to do sets there on a regular

1077
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:16.640
bank.
So I bombed there,
I'd say every other time.
But uh,

1078
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.720
for the other guys it is a great experience at the time.
Yeah.

1079
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:22.120
Cause like I never try and do,
like I always,
you know,

1080
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:24.850
when back in the day when I would go on the road I'd be like,
okay,

1081
00:58:24.851 --> 00:58:27.790
I'm back on the city now and I want to do something different.

1082
00:58:27.791 --> 00:58:32.200
I want to do different jokes.
I want to like,
you know,
explore comedy,
you know,

1083
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:36.130
and that involved bombing to some degree.
So I would,
uh,
you know,

1084
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.930
do this stuff that I knew wouldn't work,

1085
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:41.050
but I still thought was funny and the crowd used to roll with that.

1086
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.270
But now nowadays the crowds are not like that.

1087
00:58:43.271 --> 00:58:45.880
They really want to see a performance.
They want to see it tight.

1088
00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:49.030
Like ever onstage sometime you're like,
oh that one didn't turn out.

1089
00:58:49.031 --> 00:58:51.280
And you could see in the crowd they like kinda disappointed.
I'm like,

1090
00:58:51.281 --> 00:58:54.220
don't worry guys.
The next one will be funny.
Don't worry.

1091
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:57.130
I don't think a lot of people are aware of the process,

1092
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:02.590
the creating new material process,
which involves a lot of risks.
Yeah.
You know,

1093
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:03.840
and they,
they,
I,

1094
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.680
I just throw them in my sets and I'll do like Zach knew best way,

1095
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:10.970
just chuck them in the middle and,
and whether or not it works,
we'll,

1096
00:59:10.971 --> 00:59:13.840
we'll find out.
But sometimes they don't go well,

1097
00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:18.740
sometimes you're not exactly sure what the right,
the right order it is for the,

1098
00:59:18.741 --> 00:59:22.000
you know,
the pieces in it.
And like we were talking about Doug,
I saw him

1099
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:26.000
<v 2>at Caroline's probably like a year ago and he was up there just basically he had</v>

1100
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:28.220
just done an album.
He was in the England,

1101
00:59:28.221 --> 00:59:31.460
he was like coming off of like a hardcore tour and he was up there.

1102
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:35.090
I would say he was still in like,
you know,
he was doing his job,

1103
00:59:35.091 --> 00:59:38.240
he was getting laughs,
but he also was doing just like some thoughts,

1104
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:41.660
some things that he just wanted to talk about.
And as a fan of comedy,

1105
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:45.530
because I wasn't a comic,
I wasn't Wa,
you know,
thinking I'm going on.
I was like,

1106
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.880
this is what I love watching.

1107
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:50.040
Like when a guy's like just thinking it out and he doesn't know where it's going

1108
00:59:50.041 --> 00:59:53.630
to go.
And I think that's kind of cool and exciting.
But for the fan,

1109
00:59:53.631 --> 00:59:55.730
like especially people who've like,
you know,

1110
00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:58.970
they've seen comedy on TV or they like no one person,

1111
00:59:58.971 --> 01:00:01.430
then they come and see these unknown people.
They,

1112
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:05.360
I always feel like they're disappointed and I used to get really angry at them,

1113
01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:07.340
but now it's like,
I just feel sorry for him.
It's like,

1114
01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.560
wouldn't it be cool if you've got to see the stones?

1115
01:00:09.561 --> 01:00:13.850
Not to equate like what we do to like stones but like them working on start me

1116
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:15.560
up like I think that would be cool.

1117
01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:19.380
<v 3>Well this is the only standup comedy is the only art form where you really need</v>

1118
01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:22.830
an audience to perfect the bit.
Absolutely.

1119
01:00:22.831 --> 01:00:26.640
They're involved in the creation process cause as they laugh things evolve and

1120
01:00:26.641 --> 01:00:29.850
change and as you feel them enjoying the bit,

1121
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:31.970
it's really hard for anybody who does,

1122
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:35.640
has never done stand up to describe that feeling when something's killing.

1123
01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:39.690
Like you know the timing you feel where to jump in,

1124
01:00:39.691 --> 01:00:43.740
you feel where to let things sit and you really needed audience to do that.

1125
01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:47.400
<v 2>Yeah.
And I always like when you push it past the point of funny to like what the</v>

1126
01:00:47.401 --> 01:00:50.430
fuck?
Because then you know the next time you're like,

1127
01:00:50.431 --> 01:00:54.630
okay so that's the end of it.
So then next time I'll pull back or you know,
go,

1128
01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:57.690
go in a different direction.
That's just my,
I guess process

1129
01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.690
<v 3>[inaudible] sometimes you can go further.</v>

1130
01:00:59.691 --> 01:01:03.740
Sometimes it's there's different days where you have a different amount of

1131
01:01:03.741 --> 01:01:07.610
enthusiasm and and chasing the,
the darker aspects of a subject.

1132
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.760
<v 2>But people don't like dark the way they,
your crowd is cool.</v>

1133
01:01:10.761 --> 01:01:15.220
Like they like comedy and they see the funny and sadness in,

1134
01:01:15.221 --> 01:01:16.130
in life.

1135
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:20.030
But I think the majority of young audiences who've never failed at anything,

1136
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.230
it's kind of like weird when you,
when you do a joke and like it does,

1137
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:26.920
there's not a like a win or a happy ending at the end.
They're like,
aw,

1138
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:28.490
<v 3>as long as it's really funny.</v>

1139
01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:32.840
I think there's less tolerance for self-indulgent angriness today.

1140
01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.500
Oh see is,
I think people are more aware of what it actually is now.

1141
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:40.730
Whereas before someone would say something shocking and fucked up and people

1142
01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:44.120
would go with it and go,
oh,
he's an edgy comedian and now you know,

1143
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:47.420
the majority of people are where I'll know that's just a fucked up guy.

1144
01:01:47.421 --> 01:01:51.500
And he's like pushing your buttons by saying something shocking,
but it's not,

1145
01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:55.790
there's no real thought behind it.
And he's not really trying to say anything.

1146
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.030
He's just trying to make something shocking.
Make it work,

1147
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:03.020
using it as a tool to get a reaction from the crowd and people don't want that

1148
01:02:03.021 --> 01:02:07.400
but,
but dark,
great humor.
It's fucking,
it's always funny if it's funny,

1149
01:02:07.401 --> 01:02:11.510
it's funny,
it's stands up.
Shit is still sent.
Very dark and very hilarious,

1150
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:15.330
<v 2>incredibly dark and like a,
you know,
people talk about like,
you know,</v>

1151
01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.490
develop a following and all this kind of stuff.

1152
01:02:17.491 --> 01:02:21.630
It's like what does the people who Stan hope are really the,

1153
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.660
you know,
the darkest motherfuckers out there and God bless him because a,

1154
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.850
he really does not.
He doesn't sugarcoat any of his shit.
You know,
I love him.

1155
01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:31.590
His new CD is fantastic.

1156
01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.770
It's one of his best ones ever and that's what I'm thinking about him,
man.

1157
01:02:34.771 --> 01:02:39.060
He always bangs out like a new hour,
like every year and a half or whatever,

1158
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.900
constantly working.
It's so important to have a guy like that around

1159
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:46.980
to all of us.
We all like Louie.

1160
01:02:46.981 --> 01:02:50.280
It's so important to have a guy like that around a crazy work ethic.

1161
01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.810
Another guy who every year or so has another hour.
And besides that,

1162
01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:58.290
like his crowd is so connected to him that,
uh,
you know,

1163
01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:01.110
I feel that his stuff,
you know,

1164
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:05.070
it's so personal that like somehow they relate to it in a whole different way

1165
01:03:05.071 --> 01:03:07.510
that I can't even understand,
you know.
Yeah.
He,
well,
he,

1166
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:11.850
he develops like different parts of his actual real life.
Yeah.

1167
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:16.320
It puts them in there.
It's fucking a downer dude.
It's got a TV show.

1168
01:03:16.321 --> 01:03:17.340
Step it up.
Huh.

1169
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:22.380
People don't like caring about people suffering anymore.
I know.
Right.

1170
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.750
And positive energy,
especially since the secret.

1171
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:30.450
But you gotta give comedy a bone for one thing during that whole like New York

1172
01:03:30.451 --> 01:03:34.620
thing,
Broadway shut down.
Um,
the big apple circus.

1173
01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:39.450
No Way.
The only thing rolling out a funny wise was comedy.
And,
uh,

1174
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:41.970
I thought that was good.
I was like proud to be a comic.
I was like,

1175
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:45.030
the seller was rolling out with a generator there.
We rolling out with generated,

1176
01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:47.190
they would close the first couple of days like everybody else.

1177
01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:49.760
But then they like what we got to do some shows and uh,

1178
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.830
I think Tom Papa was behind that.
Who's another really good guy.
Really,

1179
01:03:52.831 --> 01:03:55.470
really funny guy.
And uh,
uh,
this new club,

1180
01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:58.470
this stand they would do in shows the candle lights.
So that was like,

1181
01:03:58.471 --> 01:04:02.360
he can't get any more renaissance fair and that,
you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1182
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:05.790
That's amazing.
I've been on stage before in the power's gone out.
It's weird,

1183
01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:09.060
isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Strange.
Because now you're just a guy talking.

1184
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:12.630
You have no microphone.
You have fun.
Did a whole set the candle light once.

1185
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.170
That won't be a cool stage.

1186
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:16.770
I don't have friends that he was onstage and the power went off and it was

1187
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:18.090
pretty clear it wasn't coming back on.

1188
01:04:18.091 --> 01:04:22.170
So we just did the whole set to candlelight.
Wow.
Yeah.
I don't know,
man.

1189
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:23.603
It was a little,

1190
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:28.440
my act is so filthy dirty that the romantic candlelight situation does not

1191
01:04:28.441 --> 01:04:32.160
match,
feel saying they're perfect.
You know,

1192
01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:34.920
I'm somewhere in between candlelight and cross burning.
You know what I'm saying,

1193
01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.820
like that kind of thing.
I can't fire a campfire and a tarring and feathering.

1194
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.770
But anyway,
I have to tell you,
man,

1195
01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.640
you rocked out on the porn show and I don't want to be a whore and just talk

1196
01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:49.110
about porn.
But uh,
you know,

1197
01:04:49.111 --> 01:04:54.111
this is the new season and David's old porn on showtime and I got to say that

1198
01:04:54.211 --> 01:04:55.680
like a,
you know,
having you there,

1199
01:04:55.681 --> 01:04:59.100
it really helped me cause I knew you had my back with the pouring and we watched

1200
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.960
some of ginger's greatest cause cause we had like so much ginger Lynn,
you know,

1201
01:05:03.961 --> 01:05:07.860
clips,
loops,
movies and like you've got to give it to it cause she's like a,

1202
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:11.640
you know,
she's like I guess you would call like a Delta force of a porn star.

1203
01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:14.520
She was out there and like once you got into it she was into it full tilt,

1204
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:18.120
you know,
anal,
you know,
three ways,
all that kind of stuff.
[inaudible] homes,

1205
01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.040
jot home,
she'd Bang John Home Shit.
I mean like,
just like,
you know,

1206
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:22.990
you forget that like in the 80s,

1207
01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:27.850
like there's a crossover between like the 70s people and then the 80s and Ginger

1208
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:31.840
and Christy Canyon I think are the Uber Babes of the,
of the 80s.

1209
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:33.900
And I have both of them on the show and I feel like,
yeah,

1210
01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:37.380
<v 1>that's a win.
Christy Canyon was there when we were leaving.
Yeah.</v>

1211
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.370
<v 2>Christy is with Mark Marin and that's a whole different ball game.</v>

1212
01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:43.470
That'll be later in the season.
But,
uh,

1213
01:05:43.471 --> 01:05:48.060
I just did their radio show on playboy radio and,
uh,
it's really cool because a,

1214
01:05:48.061 --> 01:05:51.780
they're out there,
you know,
they're still talking the talk and they're sexy.

1215
01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.090
I mean,
I,
there's a sexiness to him.
I don't know what to tell you.

1216
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.360
They still get me,
you know,
going there.
They're hot,
you know,

1217
01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.620
even though they're a little older,

1218
01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:00.660
<v 1>hey,
we're all older.
What are you trying to say?</v>

1219
01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:02.520
I'm just saying that they're fucking a,

1220
01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:06.770
you're ready for a Christy Canyon gingerly wish I sent to Chris.
Yeah,

1221
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:11.730
<v 2>guy.
I've had a crush on youth since like 1986.
You know,
it's just crazy.
But,
uh,</v>

1222
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.250
she is like the,
you know,
I don't know.

1223
01:06:14.251 --> 01:06:18.450
She's beautiful and had a shot plates.
No,
nothing.
No.

1224
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:20.400
I think that a lot of those girls,
like,
you know,

1225
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:24.570
it was the hairbands and the 80s and then I'm sure a lot of our movie star

1226
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.500
[inaudible] guys,
you know,
all that kind of stuff.

1227
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:29.410
<v 1>Probably Tired of Dick by now.
They were like police.</v>

1228
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:34.220
I think that they're all from me,
some Dick.
And when I was in San Francisco,

1229
01:06:34.221 --> 01:06:38.300
Serena who is,
I think one of the hottest women ever to do porn.

1230
01:06:38.301 --> 01:06:42.950
She's a redhead,
strawberry blonde,
uh,
Serena who was,
uh,
you know,

1231
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:46.430
up for anything man,
like her scenes,
never boring.
And uh,

1232
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:49.940
she came to my show when I was working at Cobbs and it's just cool to hang with

1233
01:06:49.941 --> 01:06:51.230
her,
you know,
she's just really cool.

1234
01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:54.740
It weird that they're still making porn if you really think about it.
No,

1235
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:58.780
that's not what I mean.
I mean,
that anybody's still near enough to jerk off too.

1236
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.700
It's like there's no way you could ever possibly seen all the porn that's there.

1237
01:07:04.701 --> 01:07:07.190
It's like buying books and you haven't read any of them.
Yeah.

1238
01:07:07.191 --> 01:07:08.870
Like we could have built like a,
a like a,

1239
01:07:08.871 --> 01:07:13.600
a seawall with old porn around Manhattan and I've never done it would have been

1240
01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:16.040
as dry as a bone.
If you stop and think about it.

1241
01:07:16.041 --> 01:07:19.600
And how many porns have been made like [inaudible] and millions of porn.

1242
01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:23.300
There's no way anybody who's jerked off to all the porn that's ever been made.

1243
01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.553
I'm trying,

1244
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:31.060
do you have a specific category that you automatically go to?
I don't know,

1245
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:35.900
<v 2>talk about a lot of time,
but like I love a amateur casting,
you know,
any era.</v>

1246
01:07:35.901 --> 01:07:38.750
But I love it from the eighties and nineties more than now,

1247
01:07:38.751 --> 01:07:42.200
even though there's like four or five different,
like a genre is for casting,

1248
01:07:42.201 --> 01:07:44.780
but a peer Woodman who's a French dude,

1249
01:07:44.781 --> 01:07:48.560
he used to do this thing called private casting and I love his stuff.
And uh,

1250
01:07:48.561 --> 01:07:51.860
you know,
if he was in America,
like I would have him on in a second,

1251
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:54.980
even though like,
I don't think I could show any of this stuff.
It's too,
too late.

1252
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:59.420
But,
uh,
I,
I like the retro stuff now a lot more than I used to ever like it.

1253
01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:02.420
And you know,
I guess now that's like the new kink for me.
You know,

1254
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:04.820
<v 1>people love that amateur shit.
Like were,
you know,</v>

1255
01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:09.880
they come in for it cause it's like this first time ever and they're awkward as

1256
01:08:10.011 --> 01:08:12.950
opposed to like the girl who you lift up her skirt.

1257
01:08:12.951 --> 01:08:15.700
She's already fingering asshole training.

1258
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.550
Training is just already there and ready to go.
And you know like Oh my God,

1259
01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:23.390
this is like the thousandth thick you've seen this week.
This is not special.

1260
01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.470
You're just doing an act.
Well when we were doing ginger show,
uh,

1261
01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.180
like just luck of the draw.

1262
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:33.650
We pulled one of her tapes where she did her first anal and we were like,
Whoa,

1263
01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:37.160
this is amazing.
You know,
box back then too.
But we both,

1264
01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:40.610
you said that you didn't really mind the hair.
Does that turn on me?
Not at all.

1265
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.450
It doesn't bother me.
Yeah,
it was,

1266
01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.360
she's so cute that she could get away with a nice little tuft.
It doesn't matter.

1267
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:51.110
They're hot.
Like you mean if there was like a lot like asshole hair,
too much.

1268
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:54.640
Some grieving if you date like one of those eastern bloc women.
Dark Room ones.

1269
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:59.060
Yeah.
You can only imagine that Iron Curtain Pussy.
That must be crazy.

1270
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:00.980
There's gotta be some hairy bitches up there,

1271
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:04.560
especially up north where it gets really cold.
Yeah.
Like a vampire or something.

1272
01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:10.670
The upper legs.
No,
but I would have to say that,
uh,
you know,

1273
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:14.930
now what shaving that a lot of the younger girls or letting it grow out a bit

1274
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.780
because,
uh,
it's cool and I think they realized that like,
fuck,

1275
01:09:17.781 --> 01:09:18.950
what am I doing this for?
You know,

1276
01:09:18.951 --> 01:09:22.850
it's like honestly doesn't have to be shaving shamans.
Weird.
It's a vagina.

1277
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:26.900
It beats everything.
So labs.
Exactly.
Yeah,
exactly.
APPS can hide in there,

1278
01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.050
but I think what they do is they did the strip most of the girls,

1279
01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:33.380
or they'll do diamond,
you know,
and uh,
I think that works.

1280
01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.930
That's the best way to go.
But you're right,
the anal hair,
that's,
yeah,

1281
01:09:35.931 --> 01:09:38.990
you got to bleach that problem.
Trim that out.
Get some illegals in there.

1282
01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.970
You're good.
Every girl.

1283
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.350
I mean it's sort of just universally accepted that hairy legs are disgusting.

1284
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:47.750
No one bucks that trend.
Esther.

1285
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:53.300
Esther doesn't shave your hair longer.
Hair on her legs and my chest.
Wow.

1286
01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:57.800
How did she get away with that?
She just wears pants all the time.
Wait a minute.

1287
01:09:57.830 --> 01:10:02.690
Are you serious?
I swear to God asked her,
does not shave her legs or armpits,

1288
01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:06.440
but when you watch like all these like old school things like game of Thrones or

1289
01:10:06.441 --> 01:10:08.060
something like that,
you know,
think about it.

1290
01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:13.010
Every chick was Harry disgustingly look hairy.
Like the,

1291
01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:17.860
the,
the,
the hot mother.
The mother to the,
yeah.
Yeah.

1292
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:18.530
She's really hot.

1293
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:22.490
She doesn't look like she has hairy legs and now she's not period friendly,

1294
01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:27.460
stress it and whatnot.
Yeah.
She's not in the correct.
Uh,

1295
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.790
did they shave their legs back then?
No.
No,
not at all.
I wonder when that started,

1296
01:10:31.791 --> 01:10:34.910
the shaping of the leg and I think the early 80 soon as someone realizes how hot

1297
01:10:34.911 --> 01:10:38.180
it was,
like why fuck when you have legs were really is.

1298
01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:42.350
That's the hottest thing ever.
It's a weird thing.
Girls with long hot legs,

1299
01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:43.460
shapely legs.

1300
01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:47.720
Oh one the girl just shaved like up to the knee high and know like they'll just

1301
01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:51.650
shave like what they need and everything else is like this disgusting.

1302
01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:56.140
<v 4>It's hard being a girl.
Wow.</v>

1303
01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:59.080
<v 1>So that's all they can get out of that way.
Hard.
It's hard.
It's a lot of work.</v>

1304
01:10:59.081 --> 01:11:02.880
You can get pregnant.
Do you imagine every time you have sex,

1305
01:11:02.881 --> 01:11:07.380
all of a sudden it could mean another person's growing inside you fucking drag.

1306
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.700
Meanwhile,
guys don't have to think about it.

1307
01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:14.180
Love or just our design to just go shoot

1308
01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:15.013
<v 3>him off.</v>

1309
01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:20.570
Marlo undeniable impulse to constantly be shooting off loads.

1310
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:23.420
<v 2>Well here's the bit I was working on,
which uh,
maybe you can help me out with.</v>

1311
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:24.950
Is that the hot load?

1312
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.980
You know how guys always assume their loads are incredibly hot,

1313
01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.050
so do you back away so that by the time it hits it's a Luke warm kind of a nice

1314
01:11:33.051 --> 01:11:36.310
feel.
Well if you a cordius you blow on it.
Yep,

1315
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:42.530
exactly.
Shoot a load in their face.
At least you could do is treat it like a,

1316
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:46.130
like a soup.
Take a step back so that there's,
you know,
some of them fire,

1317
01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:47.330
you know,
the fireball.

1318
01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.180
Isn't it amazing that you can blow on soup and it actually cools it off?

1319
01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.093
It's great.

1320
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:54.290
<v 5>Isn't it amazing that you can blow out hot air or cold air?</v>

1321
01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.260
You can just go and it's hot or it's cold and like,

1322
01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:00.250
how do you change it?

1323
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:03.720
<v 3>I didn't know that you could do that until right now.
I didn't even realize that,</v>

1324
01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.830
but he's right.
If you do like,
you get it from like the,
the deep inside your body

1325
01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:11.710
<v 5>is that it's hot.
It never runs out.
You got to keep on doing it.</v>

1326
01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.510
I could barely breathe,
so I'm going to have to go on your way.

1327
01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:17.080
That's totally true.
I know it.
Strippers did it on my crotch through my,

1328
01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:19.630
you son of a bitch.
There you go.

1329
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:23.930
<v 2>Strip club guidance to go all the time now.
Now I feel like a,
you know,</v>

1330
01:12:23.931 --> 01:12:27.530
what's the last line you're here?
I don't,
I don't care about like a,
you know,

1331
01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:31.040
<v 5>I heard it.
I heard,
uh,
you were the only person I ever,</v>

1332
01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.150
somebody told me that you really liked it.
The body shop in Hollywood.

1333
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:38.300
I was there,
went during the fire,
they had a fire there and all that.
Yeah.

1334
01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:42.660
<v 2>The next day they had like this incredible fire,
wait what you say again?</v>

1335
01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:43.181
I didn't really,

1336
01:12:43.181 --> 01:12:46.510
I don't really like the club but that was definitely one of those cups were
like,

1337
01:12:46.511 --> 01:12:48.130
hey you can walk to it.
You know,

1338
01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:50.110
like you're all the place across the street from the store.

1339
01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.570
Like you go play the comedy store,
you want to do something and so you're like,

1340
01:12:52.571 --> 01:12:53.830
hey you go over to the body shop.

1341
01:12:53.831 --> 01:12:57.520
But I went to like a one or two times and I would say that,
you know,

1342
01:12:57.550 --> 01:13:00.460
the girls were really hot but I feel like a lot of them were not like pros.

1343
01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:04.120
A lot of them were just like party girls who want to make some coin and you
know,

1344
01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.580
we went there,
there was like girls I am guys came with us.

1345
01:13:06.581 --> 01:13:08.740
So like they were all over the girls and the guys,
you know,
like,

1346
01:13:08.741 --> 01:13:12.610
like watching that for some reason I never really give a shit about that,
but um,

1347
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:14.140
I would say it's a good club,
you know?

1348
01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:15.280
<v 5>Yeah.
I remember the,
somebody,</v>

1349
01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:18.550
somebody told me you liked that club and then you said like the next day after

1350
01:13:18.551 --> 01:13:20.220
going to a burned down.
Right.

1351
01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.940
The one place that I found that burnt down like me cock sucking it.
Yeah.

1352
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.863
It was crazy.

1353
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.660
<v 3>Yeah.
That place was across the street from the comedy store,</v>

1354
01:13:28.661 --> 01:13:32.120
but we only went to it like twice and it was the only one,
someone's in town.

1355
01:13:32.121 --> 01:13:34.240
I was like,
Hey,
you want to go down to the body shop?

1356
01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:36.250
And it was always somebody else's idea.

1357
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.250
<v 5>I don't like places that don't serve liquor,
strip clubs that don't serve.
Yeah.</v>

1358
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:43.060
I would like to have alcohol.
They make you buy to coax.

1359
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.610
You don't look at a $9 water,

1360
01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:48.490
<v 3>a bit about it and vagina vagina's and alcohol.
For some reason,</v>

1361
01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:52.660
this just as volatile combination in California,
you can't see that.

1362
01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.720
Like you could have a girl can have a bikini bottom on show your tits and you

1363
01:13:55.721 --> 01:13:57.940
could barely keep it together for,
with a beer.

1364
01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:01.450
But if you have like actual alcohol and see a vagina,

1365
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:03.070
that's just be too much chaos.

1366
01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.180
<v 2>Well that's why I want to go to Thailand at some point.</v>

1367
01:14:05.181 --> 01:14:08.660
Cause supposedly they have like the ultimate,
you know like stripper Bar,
Bang,

1368
01:14:08.661 --> 01:14:12.070
Bang,
Gerhard's soapies have you heard us?
Soapies no,
some,
some

1369
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.430
<v 5>guy just told me in Columbus,
uh,
we were there and he,
he said,
uh,</v>

1370
01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:17.690
there's these things called soapies where you,

1371
01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.820
you lay down and I know they put soap all over you and then they get completely

1372
01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:25.030
naked and they just like wash your body with their body.

1373
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:28.660
Like they just lay on you and squish around and stuff like that.
No.

1374
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:31.030
And then they dry you off and then you fuck them.

1375
01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:34.570
But a lot of time and you pick out load.

1376
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.930
When you first get to know there's like 30 people and they all hold up a number

1377
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:41.200
and you'd pick which one you want.
That's for a guy on vacation.
That's,
that's a,

1378
01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:45.940
that's a still going on or was that something going on at the Vietnam War thing?

1379
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.210
It's still going on.
I was actually looking at flights from,
uh,
Ohio,

1380
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:50.560
like just to see how much it was.

1381
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.120
It was $1,200 but you're going to go to Thailand?
Yeah,
but,

1382
01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:57.560
but it was a 24 hour flight and I was like,
fuck that.
I'm not 24 hours,

1383
01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.400
four hours.

1384
01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.090
That's gotta be a weird feeling because everybody on that plane is a pervert.

1385
01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.310
There's nobody going.
They're like,
hey,
you know,
I just,

1386
01:15:03.311 --> 01:15:07.020
I'm going to University of Thailand.
Okay.
Really a 24 hour flight.
Yeah.

1387
01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.380
That's like a plank.
It's staying in the air for 24.
No,

1388
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.180
I think there was a layover or stopped somewhere,
I think,
but yeah,

1389
01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:18.400
that's a weird one.
I've been to Australia,
which is a 16,
I think.
Yeah.

1390
01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:20.950
I've never done that flight.
I got to do that at some point.

1391
01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:24.650
I've never done one of those comedy festivals in Australia or South Africa or in

1392
01:15:24.651 --> 01:15:28.480
South Africa.
That one's fucking amazing.
And,
uh,
the Australian one is like,

1393
01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.330
how long has that been going on?
Like 15 years.
20 years now.

1394
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.770
It's really bad for you.
What the Australian plate.

1395
01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.380
<v 0>It's bad for you.
I just did the Brazil one where I went,
uh,</v>

1396
01:15:37.381 --> 01:15:40.080
11 hours from Brazil to Miami and then five of us from my,

1397
01:15:40.081 --> 01:15:44.100
and I got sick and I never get sick.
It's just like,
why I won't make you sick.

1398
01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.940
Yeah.
It's terrible for you and you're,

1399
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:49.920
you're constantly around other people's fucking diseased,
coffee,

1400
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.920
breath and shit.
And people are spitting and touching things

1401
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:57.430
<v 5>like being on a submarine,
but there's really no a glory to it.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

1402
01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.730
it's just super bad fit.

1403
01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:02.460
Just something about that research related air to that just really diminishes

1404
01:16:02.461 --> 01:16:06.280
you aspire to be better.
I'm flying to stinks and it's getting harder and harder,

1405
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.630
Brian.
It's not supposed to,

1406
01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:11.040
but I know I saw a special on it that they said that the air filtration systems

1407
01:16:11.041 --> 01:16:16.020
in planes are so amazing that it really does.
It's actually really good for you.

1408
01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:17.160
<v 0>Well,
this is what it is.</v>

1409
01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:21.780
That air that comes out of those little tubes is actually a very clean air.

1410
01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:24.600
Those things be you blow on you that's actually very clean.

1411
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:29.870
However you are in a tube right where there's no fresh air and you are recycling

1412
01:16:30.511 --> 01:16:32.520
everyone's breath and that's the problem.

1413
01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:36.110
When you have that tube on you the whole time,
well that can help you,
but the,

1414
01:16:36.111 --> 01:16:41.070
the amount of air that's in that is limited and it's all being recycled with

1415
01:16:41.071 --> 01:16:44.320
people breathing out.
That's the issue is you're,

1416
01:16:44.321 --> 01:16:47.070
you're constantly around other people's breath and it doesn't really have

1417
01:16:47.071 --> 01:16:50.310
anywhere to go and so there is like a research collation.

1418
01:16:50.311 --> 01:16:51.930
There is a filter filtration of it,

1419
01:16:51.931 --> 01:16:56.130
but you're still going to take in breaths filled with other people's shit.

1420
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:59.730
There's no way around it.
That's why the fart smell was so bad on airplanes,

1421
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.850
someone farts on an airplane,
it's not even like farting in a restaurant.

1422
01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:06.780
It's like farting in your face.
It's like it just is no word for it to go.

1423
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:09.890
<v 5>That's why like when you're stuck on the tarmac for five hours</v>

1424
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.330
<v 2>and you realize like this place,</v>

1425
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.470
this plane is built only for the air and like the toilets start backing up and

1426
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:17.750
there's no hair and you feel trapped.

1427
01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.140
I get incredibly claustrophobic on the plane.
So you know,

1428
01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:23.710
once that door shuts I'm like fuck dude,
now I'm now,

1429
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.180
I'm in this tube now for the next six,
seven hours.
Huh?

1430
01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:29.260
<v 0>Well it's a part of our job to be on planes and I hate it.</v>

1431
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:30.640
It's not the best part.

1432
01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:34.170
<v 2>But back in the old days like when it was all like just torn like road,</v>

1433
01:17:34.171 --> 01:17:36.560
like driving cars,
you and another guy that was the,

1434
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:38.820
you know I've done like a lot of that and there is like,

1435
01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:42.320
even though it takes a while,
there was some fun to that,
you know,

1436
01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.860
<v 0>it's fine if it's a good comic,
it's fun guy.</v>

1437
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:47.980
I did a lot of main gigs with a lot of Boston guys.

1438
01:17:47.981 --> 01:17:50.530
We did a lot of driving up to Vermont and shit like that.

1439
01:17:50.531 --> 01:17:53.440
Four and five hour drive.
So it was great.
It was a lot of fun.

1440
01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.500
<v 2>But now everybody is so like,
you know,
PC and all that kind of stuff.</v>

1441
01:17:56.501 --> 01:18:00.250
It's like it,
let's stop and you know,
go apple picking.
There's really no,
like,

1442
01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:01.850
there's no like adventure to it.

1443
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:07.140
<v 0>Yeah.
Like nobody,
I want to pick up Delft,
China set for my mom.</v>

1444
01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:11.250
I'll go on tour with you.
You feel like you're the last of a dying breed?

1445
01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.070
I'm self destructive comics.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1446
01:18:14.710 --> 01:18:18.760
<v 2>It's kind of hard to explain to the new guys like the road to them.
You know,</v>

1447
01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:22.420
like a lot of them like I hate the road.
I've done two gigs.
I'm like too,

1448
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:23.500
and you hate it already.

1449
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:28.030
You've got to be about 10,000 before you get that real good hate of it,
you know?

1450
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1451
01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.070
Joey Diaz and I have been on some fucking adventures across this great land of

1452
01:18:32.071 --> 01:18:32.910
ours.
That guy

1453
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:36.530
<v 2>been on the road like before,
I dunno.
Before the road.</v>

1454
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.190
I mean like he must've started out working like state fairs and shit like that.

1455
01:18:40.191 --> 01:18:41.750
I mean he's,
he's hardcore.

1456
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:45.680
<v 0>Yeah.
He's like that Johnny Cash song.
The highway man done this and other lives.</v>

1457
01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:48.160
He's done this.
And other of,

1458
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:51.910
<v 2>he's like me,
he's probably more comfortable on the road than he is ever at home.</v>

1459
01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:53.860
You know?
Cause I never feel like at home I'm like,
ah,

1460
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:57.410
<v 0>Joey's most comfortable I think on stage.
Oh,
okay.
You know,</v>

1461
01:18:57.411 --> 01:19:00.530
I think he just wants to,
I think he just loves getting out there.
Yeah.

1462
01:19:00.710 --> 01:19:04.100
He's just a hustler too.
You know,
Joe,
he's always got something going on.

1463
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:07.780
<v 2>Yeah.
Well that's the cool thing about it man.
It's like,
you know,
uh,
this,</v>

1464
01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:11.830
the good thing about comedy is that like,
you know,
every day is a new day,

1465
01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:15.850
you know,
and like you can,
you know,
it's really up to you to make it happen.

1466
01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:16.780
And everybody's like,

1467
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:19.690
if I only knew the right guy and if somebody read this screenplay,
it's like,

1468
01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:22.720
yeah,
but that's not about comedy.
Comedy's about like getting funnier.

1469
01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.660
You just getting out there.
Really.
That's,
that's what I tell them.

1470
01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.500
Everybody's like,
how do I meet an agent?
I'm like,
why?

1471
01:19:28.501 --> 01:19:32.470
So some guy can not take your calls right now.
You're doing more for your career,

1472
01:19:32.471 --> 01:19:35.380
going on,
doing seven minutes and this Douche bags going to do for you ever.

1473
01:19:35.410 --> 01:19:36.243
So you know,

1474
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:38.690
<v 0>at the end of the day it all becomes about that engine,</v>

1475
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:41.660
the engine that propels your life as you,
your work,
your,

1476
01:19:41.661 --> 01:19:42.860
your comedy that you create.

1477
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:47.360
And everybody is wrapped up on getting auditions and getting a show and getting

1478
01:19:47.361 --> 01:19:49.010
a series and getting all these things,

1479
01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:53.520
which ultimately are not the best thing for your,
your standout.
Yeah.
No,

1480
01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:58.140
it hurts your standard sitcoms kill you.
You're on a second,
right?
It's like the,

1481
01:19:58.150 --> 01:20:00.060
did you feel funnier and you have to get it now?

1482
01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:02.950
I felt less funny first I had of work long hours.
You know,

1483
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:06.380
you were on the set long hours a day and I got lazy and I stopped writing

1484
01:20:06.381 --> 01:20:07.980
material and all and there

1485
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.910
<v 3>was no encouragement,
you know?
No one,</v>

1486
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.640
no one thought that the produce even said it to me once.
Like why?

1487
01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:15.120
Why are you still doing standup?
You're an actor now.
Yeah.

1488
01:20:15.121 --> 01:20:19.140
I hate when they say that.
So crazy.
But,
but it's great money and that,

1489
01:20:19.141 --> 01:20:21.120
so that's why everybody wants to do it.

1490
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:24.420
But ultimately the real money's in standup.

1491
01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:27.690
I mean the real happy money because you're,
you're doing,

1492
01:20:27.691 --> 01:20:31.130
which actually enjoy being on a bad set of you ever been on a bad side?

1493
01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.660
<v 2>I dish and for every,
I think that's a calm that never made it.</v>

1494
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:40.910
I don't even do acting like that's like the least thing I could give a shit

1495
01:20:40.911 --> 01:20:44.120
about it.
I'm like in my late forties now and I'm like,
dude,

1496
01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:47.840
I could give a shit if I ever get on the Big Bang theory or any of that stuff.

1497
01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:51.590
I know guys are like,
I follow me.
I could get on there.
And I'm like,
you know,

1498
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:54.470
I'd rather be able to say what I want to say when I want to say it,

1499
01:20:54.471 --> 01:20:57.110
where I want to say it.
Then for low money,

1500
01:20:57.111 --> 01:21:00.620
then be on a sitcom where I walk out and it's like,
watch out fellas.

1501
01:21:00.621 --> 01:21:02.850
It's time for break.
You know like some stump,

1502
01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:06.140
some line that has been overwritten by a bunch of guys.
I don't know.

1503
01:21:06.141 --> 01:21:10.130
Sitting there in the writer's room,
you know,
so maybe I'm a dick.
I Dunno.

1504
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:14.750
It's just never,
it never,
it never excited me enough to be do that.

1505
01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.880
And like I always was like,
peg,
this the guy,

1506
01:21:16.881 --> 01:21:21.050
I like the setup to the funny guy and I hate that,
you know,
like,
you know,

1507
01:21:21.051 --> 01:21:23.900
what are you doing Waldo?
And then he would say the funny line that'd be like,

1508
01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:27.590
<v 3>Wham,
wham.
You know,
we were,</v>

1509
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:32.300
I think a lot of comics sort of led in that direction in the 80s when you saw

1510
01:21:32.301 --> 01:21:37.190
like Roseanne and Tim Allen and these guys go to have series and Seinfeld and

1511
01:21:37.191 --> 01:21:39.230
these series make millions and millions of dollars.

1512
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:43.100
And so that became like a direction where everybody was sort of like thinking,

1513
01:21:43.101 --> 01:21:46.140
well,
I,
I guess I got to do that.
I guess I've got to do that.
Um,

1514
01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:51.140
and then the idea of just being a standup was like,
nobody appreciated that.

1515
01:21:51.141 --> 01:21:54.680
Nobody was like,
oh,
he just wants to be a stand up.
They'd be like,
why?
Why,

1516
01:21:54.681 --> 01:21:57.260
when you can do movies.
Why?
When you can do a Sitcom,

1517
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:58.670
why wouldn't you do a television show?

1518
01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:01.930
<v 2>But they're awesome guys who are like legitimately like,
you know,</v>

1519
01:22:01.931 --> 01:22:06.310
I'm a standup but I'm also an actor so I give it to them,
like not down,

1520
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:08.590
but like Seinfeld who was really a standup,

1521
01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:12.040
who became an actor went back to stand up.
So like that's what he does now.

1522
01:22:12.041 --> 01:22:16.630
He does his standup.
Roseanne I think is like so creative,
you know,

1523
01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:19.840
like all over the place that she could do stand up if she wanted to.

1524
01:22:19.841 --> 01:22:23.470
But I think once you make that TV money and then going back to stand up,

1525
01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:27.070
you feel like you failed but you shouldn't because it's like it's fun and like

1526
01:22:27.071 --> 01:22:28.480
you should see the fun in it,
you know?

1527
01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:29.451
<v 3>Well it's,</v>

1528
01:22:29.451 --> 01:22:33.000
it's sort of like the only art form where you're expected to transition and turn

1529
01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:36.380
from a caterpillar into a butterfly.
True.
Whereas if you're a rapper,

1530
01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:40.530
nobody's expecting you to go into movies.
You might,
it might go into some movie.

1531
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.190
Most,
most rappers just essentially stay rappers.

1532
01:22:44.191 --> 01:22:45.180
And that's where people love him.

1533
01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:49.320
<v 2>Well,
but I think all the rapper guys,
they want to be like an action hero,</v>

1534
01:22:49.321 --> 01:22:53.250
you know,
like kinda guide in the,
in their head and then,
you know,

1535
01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:56.220
cause I don't think they're making that much money rapping anymore.

1536
01:22:56.221 --> 01:23:00.890
Nobody makes any money,
you know,
off to cds.
Yeah.
Often tour though.
Yeah.

1537
01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.910
On towards where the real money is.
But yeah,

1538
01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:06.550
I think they definitely want to and they have incredible rapper confidence.

1539
01:23:06.551 --> 01:23:09.830
They're like always so confident,
you know,
sense confident,

1540
01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.160
you know the opposite of comedy.
Yeah,
exactly.

1541
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:16.360
You can't have like a a guys self hating himself as he blows away.
Dude,

1542
01:23:16.361 --> 01:23:20.020
we're only 47.
You can have your blog.
Okay,
that's true.
There is some,

1543
01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:23.240
there was a racial thing too.
It's a cultural thing.
Yeah,
exactly.
You know,

1544
01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.350
it's very different.
That's why like,
uh,
you know,

1545
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:30.360
I would say that comics who do sitcoms and I know a lot of them who did sitcoms,

1546
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:33.160
when they come back to the comedy,
they're always like,
you know,

1547
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.980
I'm a little rusty.
I'm like,
are you really?

1548
01:23:35.981 --> 01:23:38.980
I mean it's just like you should've done stand up the whole way through.

1549
01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.890
You know,
and it wouldn't have been that way.
I know a lot of guys quit.

1550
01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.750
Kevin James Basically quit.

1551
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:46.750
Really occasionally it goes on and does he shows with a Ray Romano.

1552
01:23:46.751 --> 01:23:50.530
But once he started acting just a really doesn't have the time for it and he

1553
01:23:50.531 --> 01:23:54.240
does a lot of movies too.
A lot of uh,
like kids friendly movies and that,

1554
01:23:54.241 --> 01:23:56.560
that to me would be the worst to be like in a kid friendly movie.

1555
01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.450
And then you have this dirty filthy act,

1556
01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.480
you know like I think it happens to Tracy Morgan a lot where they seem on 30

1557
01:24:01.481 --> 01:24:04.060
rock,
which is like a,
you know,
you know,
it's a smart,

1558
01:24:04.061 --> 01:24:07.330
funny show and then they see him live and he is just fucking out of control.

1559
01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:11.730
I did two Kevin's movies.
I've done a zookeeper,

1560
01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:15.070
which is a family friendly movie.
And then I did,
here comes the boom,

1561
01:24:15.071 --> 01:24:18.700
another family friend.
But I played myself in that one.
Okay.
But you know,

1562
01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:20.950
Kevin has been my friend since we were like,
we started out.

1563
01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:23.230
It was a great comic tone.
Yeah,
very funny comic.

1564
01:24:23.231 --> 01:24:26.630
That's why it kind of bums me out.
But he doesn't do it that much.
Yeah.

1565
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:27.790
A lot of people don't even know.

1566
01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:33.040
I started with him on Long Island and he like always knew who he was a well east

1567
01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:37.450
side and governors and t uh,
him and his brother who also has a comic Valentine,

1568
01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:42.370
they were there all the time and uh,
you know,
but Kevin was Kevin and ray,

1569
01:24:42.371 --> 01:24:45.400
they kind of like,
you know,
are like soul brothers in a way,

1570
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:49.380
even though both of them are the widest guys and they kind of the same comedy,

1571
01:24:49.381 --> 01:24:51.100
you know,
it's like very,
it's endearing.

1572
01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.720
I don't want to offend anybody then when a family,

1573
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.680
but it's still like raise comedy is still really so well written.
Like,
you know,

1574
01:24:56.681 --> 01:25:01.090
from what I remember from the past,
I don't know,
he did a one of those um,

1575
01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:02.530
Kevin and bean does,

1576
01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.090
they do an April foolishness show in la and he did it I think two years ago.

1577
01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.660
Oh Wow.
He was great.
Yeah.
He should be on the road.
Cause he's funny guy,
man.

1578
01:25:10.770 --> 01:25:14.350
You know,
he's got a lot of kids and you know,
it's the mirage every now and then.

1579
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:19.330
Hi,
they human Kevin do like gigs together.
And I think he was doing a new show,

1580
01:25:19.331 --> 01:25:23.410
but it was like a drama.
Right?
Wasn't he doing like he was,
it was a,

1581
01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:28.060
I'm not men behaving badly,
but men of a certain age.
So it was uh,

1582
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:31.120
uh,
executive produced by Michael Royce who,
uh,

1583
01:25:31.121 --> 01:25:34.510
is a guy I started doing comedy with and he's a great guy.

1584
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:38.560
He worked on Louise First show on HBO.
He's worked on ratio.

1585
01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:42.070
He's a great writer and a,
he was a comic too.
So,
you know,

1586
01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:47.110
how did you get from stand up to this idea of doing porn?
Showing old?

1587
01:25:47.111 --> 01:25:49.000
Was this your idea?
Yeah,
this is my idea.

1588
01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:52.300
And a Stuart Bailey who is the executive producer of the show,
we,
uh,

1589
01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:56.830
we pitched it to another network and they said no,
and uh,
you know,
they,
they,

1590
01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.390
we made the pilot with them and this is years and years ago now.
So,
uh,
they said,

1591
01:26:01.391 --> 01:26:04.280
no,
uh,
but it's too dirty,
but it's funny.

1592
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:06.920
And then I went over to showtime and that's what we did.

1593
01:26:06.921 --> 01:26:10.280
And it really is kind of like you did it.
It's a two dimensional show.

1594
01:26:10.281 --> 01:26:13.280
It's me and the comic ragging on these clips.

1595
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:16.490
And like basically just Dick joke in and around unscripted.

1596
01:26:16.491 --> 01:26:20.390
We didn't script anything.
And then we go right to,
uh,
you know,

1597
01:26:20.391 --> 01:26:21.380
the tribute part of the show,

1598
01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:24.920
which is bringing out the legend or in some shows I bring out young porn.

1599
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:27.170
So it's like the last show of the season,
I'm going to give it away.

1600
01:26:27.171 --> 01:26:32.060
Now we've got like asa,
Akira,
Jesse Jane,
Caden Bras,
Shawn Michaels,

1601
01:26:32.061 --> 01:26:36.440
who's,
uh,
uh,
one of the coolest dudes ever to do porn,
you know.
Uh,

1602
01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:41.180
he's black,
but he,
he is so cool.
And,
uh,
he,
uh,

1603
01:26:41.181 --> 01:26:43.730
it's really weird for the dude's important,

1604
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:45.290
especially like guys like Shawn Michaels.

1605
01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:48.470
You got to give him a tip of the hat because like,
you know,
they are definitely,

1606
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:51.410
you couldn't have porn without them,
but yet they don't get any of the credit,

1607
01:26:51.411 --> 01:26:55.050
any of the money that the chicks do.
So it was great to have a guy like there,
uh,

1608
01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.460
like that on the show and he's so smooth and so just like charming and

1609
01:26:58.461 --> 01:27:03.260
interesting.
And then Andy Dick was on the show and Adrian Currie,
who is really,

1610
01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.570
really cool.
It was like guys check sober.

1611
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:09.950
Andy Dick was sober and he was a little disappointed because I didn't have much

1612
01:27:09.951 --> 01:27:11.150
retro gay porn,

1613
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:15.050
<v 1>but I did the best I could.
And there's a lot of retro gay porn out there.</v>

1614
01:27:15.051 --> 01:27:18.290
It's just,
I wasn't sure what the network would think about it.
You know,

1615
01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:19.940
guy on Guy Peter North,

1616
01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:24.200
there's a funny one because I'd love that famous four loads.
Yeah.

1617
01:27:24.230 --> 01:27:26.950
Famous for giant loads,
absolutely loads.

1618
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.970
It's pretty ridiculous as that guy's loads.
Oh,
amazingly.
They like,
uh,

1619
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:35.510
just whatever it is,
a banana clip he has on the bottom of his dick,

1620
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:38.750
just like 50,
60 loads in there,
Joe.

1621
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:42.250
That Zma shit really has affected my loads.
It's humongous now.

1622
01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:47.450
Zinc and magnesium,
it boosts your testosterone and makes your loads more frothy.

1623
01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.690
So that's the cool thing about you guys show.
It's like helpful tips,
you know,

1624
01:27:50.691 --> 01:27:53.570
like Doctor Oz stuff.
We're trying to spread a little positivity there.

1625
01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:59.090
David towl.
We're trying to enrich the world.
We're trying to power up people,

1626
01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:03.530
get them excited about life.
God dammit.
But the dude up dude

1627
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:08.300
<v 2>do porn like a Ron,
Jeremy and Jeremy Have Morris.
We have him coming out.</v>

1628
01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.800
Herschel savage.
Uh,
who else?

1629
01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.710
<v 1>John Holmes job homes.
Not here.</v>

1630
01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:17.270
I'm just saying how Ginger Lynn was very proud of the fact that John Holmes

1631
01:28:17.271 --> 01:28:20.210
always got it up with her.
Yeah.
Because that was the thing with John Holmes.

1632
01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:24.980
He had this giant rubber Dick.
A lot of times it'd be like half hard,

1633
01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:28.910
but with her she's like,
he was always excited.
That's good.
She was very,

1634
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.230
very proud of that.
Yeah.
I would like to,
she's a real,
she's a real trooper.

1635
01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.920
She feels like she was proud of her work that wasn't just like punching in at

1636
01:28:36.921 --> 01:28:39.670
Wendy's.
Exactly.
She was doing some art.
Yeah.

1637
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:43.100
<v 2>And uh,
you know,
with,
with the,
with the dude's in the porn,</v>

1638
01:28:43.101 --> 01:28:45.540
like there's so many great ones.
Eric Edwards,
um,

1639
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:49.640
who I didn't even know he was into it,
but if we do it again,

1640
01:28:49.641 --> 01:28:54.140
I'm definitely getting him on it.
Uh,
Randy,
uh,
w w oh shit.

1641
01:28:54.170 --> 01:28:58.700
What's his name?
Up and comers.
You know what I'm talking about,
Randy Blah,
blah,

1642
01:28:58.701 --> 01:28:59.930
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
He

1643
01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:02.220
<v 1>no,
for op and commerce series</v>

1644
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.180
<v 0>a,
you know,
uh,
uh,
he used the one to Bang Jenna Jamison.</v>

1645
01:29:06.181 --> 01:29:09.500
I bigcommerce number 11.
It's probably one of the best known scenes in a,
in uh,

1646
01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:13.860
in porn.
So,
oh,
up to getting them on.
You're talking about Jenna's first one.

1647
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.590
Randy.
I forget his name,
but he's not a good looking fellow.

1648
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:20.610
I think he's going to look it does know.
Very big deck.
Seems like a nice guy.

1649
01:29:20.611 --> 01:29:24.670
He's like a regular guy,
good guy.
And a,
you know,
like I said,
Peter North,
uh,

1650
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:28.860
Joey Silveria,
he's,
he's a fucking,
he's a genius.
He's great.

1651
01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.780
It must've been a weird time for those guys.
That eighties porn.

1652
01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:37.470
Cause there was no,
there was no real seventies porn.
I mean,
it was so rare.

1653
01:29:37.471 --> 01:29:40.740
It was like,
you know,
you had deep throat and behind the green door,

1654
01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:44.120
whatever it was that,
that movie,
yeah,
behind the green door,
whatever it was.

1655
01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.610
So anyway,
thank you.
So I mean,

1656
01:29:47.611 --> 01:29:52.440
all of a sudden these guys come along in like the 1980s and it's just crazy

1657
01:29:52.441 --> 01:29:56.760
porn.
They become stars v.
It's the VHS era.
Like it was a,

1658
01:29:56.810 --> 01:30:00.840
the world that didn't exist before because the porn that was done before that

1659
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:04.830
literally had to be streamed as a movie.
You had to have a project was the movie.

1660
01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:08.170
Nobody had a fucking projector and they're gonna go reel to reel and Ugh,

1661
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:13.110
too much nonsense.
But when a VHS tape came along,
changed that game,

1662
01:30:13.111 --> 01:30:15.480
you can just stick that sucker right in the VCR,

1663
01:30:15.481 --> 01:30:19.470
which everybody had in the 80s everybody started watching porn and there was the

1664
01:30:19.471 --> 01:30:21.600
whole section that you would go to at the video.

1665
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.450
I remember my mother was very upset when that came out.
Like,
oh,

1666
01:30:24.451 --> 01:30:29.220
this is just right here.
You had a great first point story.
It was like,
you know,

1667
01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:30.570
I asked,
everybody comes to the Chicago,
like,

1668
01:30:30.571 --> 01:30:32.040
what do you remember the first time you saw porn?

1669
01:30:32.041 --> 01:30:33.570
That's like the big end of the interview.

1670
01:30:33.571 --> 01:30:36.950
I'm not an interview on Charlie rose or anything,
but your,

1671
01:30:36.951 --> 01:30:39.570
your story was interesting where you said like,
you were at a buddy's,

1672
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:43.320
you went over either a buddy's house or like you just found his porn or

1673
01:30:43.321 --> 01:30:46.020
something like that.
And it was like an uncomfortable situation.

1674
01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:50.430
I don't remember it,
but it wasn't,
it was a very good story and a,
you know,

1675
01:30:50.431 --> 01:30:54.810
I'm going to turn it into a animated series.
Awesome.

1676
01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:58.680
Everybody's first born.
I mean,
uh,
I remember finding porn in the woods,

1677
01:30:58.681 --> 01:31:00.570
like magazines.
We both talked about it.

1678
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.510
I was in the scouts and there would be like fucking,
well,

1679
01:31:03.511 --> 01:31:07.080
I lived in Florida and we,
we lived near this.
Uh,

1680
01:31:07.081 --> 01:31:10.120
I lived near a in Gainesville,
Florida,
and it was

1681
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:15.270
really,
I think Tavaris from there.
It's a lot of alligators around.

1682
01:31:15.271 --> 01:31:18.570
There is a lot of woods when we,
we'd go out in the woods,
me and my friends,

1683
01:31:18.571 --> 01:31:20.790
we'd find like snapping turtles and shit.

1684
01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:24.660
We'd make slingshots and we would always find porn.
Always.

1685
01:31:24.661 --> 01:31:29.430
It would be wet bags of porn,
like a plastic bag talked under a log.

1686
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.960
You know,
we found a bunch of that shit.
It's weird.
It's weird.
And went from that.

1687
01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:36.870
That was the only way you get it.
It's magazines,
you know?

1688
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:40.140
And Dude's always had to be half hard.
They couldn't be fully hard.

1689
01:31:40.141 --> 01:31:43.020
They had rules like you couldn't have a full heart on.

1690
01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:48.230
So scene after scene would be this girl who's like pretending to be in total

1691
01:31:48.991 --> 01:31:51.600
moaning,
ecstasy,
spreading her pussy apart.

1692
01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:55.650
And the dude would like lay his dick on her like a drowning victim.

1693
01:31:56.420 --> 01:32:00.420
You know,
I was like this poor like dead Dick.
It was like,
what?

1694
01:32:00.421 --> 01:32:01.720
What is the message here?

1695
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:06.200
<v 2>I think it's so important for young kids to see magazine porn cause it really is</v>

1696
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:09.980
it.
First of all it's an adult,
but it's not like real porn.

1697
01:32:09.981 --> 01:32:12.680
So it's not like you're not going to blow his head out.
You know?

1698
01:32:12.681 --> 01:32:15.300
It's kind of like just enough.
You know what I'm saying?
Like,
it's like a,

1699
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:18.770
it's like the training wheel on,
you know,
it gets you started.
Yeah.

1700
01:32:18.771 --> 01:32:22.490
Like you don't want your kid to immediately go into like high fi wifi download

1701
01:32:22.491 --> 01:32:25.840
porn,
you know,
it's like,
here's a magazine,
you know,
it's hustler.
It's great.

1702
01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:29.630
Take a look.
You know,
I remember feeling that you'd get when you found a hustler,

1703
01:32:29.631 --> 01:32:33.360
like,
Whoa,
you'd be peop,
you know,

1704
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:37.580
turning the pages.
Oh Man.
Jerking off to just reading the art,
reading the jokes,

1705
01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:43.720
drip of saliva from his tongue to her dick.
Go like,
what the fuck am I?

1706
01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:48.610
<v 0>This is crazy.
She's sucking to suck his dick.
She's going to do it.</v>

1707
01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:50.430
<v 2>Well,
the cool thing about the girls today,</v>

1708
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.470
and I know we're talking way too much about porn,
but I appreciate it.

1709
01:32:53.471 --> 01:32:56.410
It's very few places where you can talk about porn.
So,
uh,
we,

1710
01:32:56.411 --> 01:33:00.180
we had Joanna Angel on and Rob Zombie and Judah Friedlander to do this,

1711
01:33:00.181 --> 01:33:04.350
like horror porn.
And I have like the worst horror movie porn.
It's like,
you know,

1712
01:33:04.590 --> 01:33:06.570
they'll good titles I couldn't get rights to.

1713
01:33:06.571 --> 01:33:10.200
And the ones that I have are just like joking,
cheesy,
fucking bad porn.

1714
01:33:10.530 --> 01:33:15.240
But a Joanna who is like,
you know,
super hot punk chick,
you know,
tad it up,

1715
01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:18.300
really cool.
And a great business woman by the way,
she runs her own company,

1716
01:33:18.301 --> 01:33:21.090
makes her own films,
you know,
she's watching this point and she's like,
you know,

1717
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:25.500
this is horrible.
Like this is like you don't shoot Dick that way.

1718
01:33:25.501 --> 01:33:29.070
And it was cool to get her perspective on it such as director,
you know.
But uh,

1719
01:33:29.071 --> 01:33:32.310
you know,
I was like,
wouldn't it be cool if like a,
you know,

1720
01:33:32.311 --> 01:33:35.790
they could redirect these porins like to today's standards.

1721
01:33:35.791 --> 01:33:38.790
I think it would be almost impossible,
you know?
That would be a good idea.

1722
01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:41.310
It really would be cool if they could like whatever that is,
you know,

1723
01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:42.750
I'm exited or something

1724
01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.940
<v 0>porn.
Did they,
they're not,
they don't like every loop.
It a lot.</v>

1725
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:49.430
They get a lot of like Debbie does,
Dallas is,
and they did a,
you know,
they've,

1726
01:33:49.431 --> 01:33:53.890
they've done the same movie like over with different people.
Yeah.
Once they hit,

1727
01:33:53.891 --> 01:33:57.040
I like a theme that works like deep throat,
sore throat,
sweet throat.

1728
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:58.810
They do like a million versions of it,

1729
01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:02.610
you know it is different if you watch the old porn compared to say like there

1730
01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:06.190
they are definitely better at filming shit and showing you more and better

1731
01:34:06.191 --> 01:34:09.580
angles and stuff.
Like a lot of the old porn was like a little awkward.

1732
01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:11.890
He couldn't really see what was going on.

1733
01:34:11.891 --> 01:34:16.630
They like what looks good and what feels good is two different things sometimes.

1734
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:21.160
And so sometimes like someone has to like turn sideways and they're having sex

1735
01:34:21.161 --> 01:34:22.210
and like an angle,

1736
01:34:22.211 --> 01:34:25.900
like a sideways angle just so they could show you the genitals better.

1737
01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.750
Whereas they didn't really do that nearly as much in the old days.

1738
01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:31.870
Brian's leaving,
he's got the shit,
he's got to go jerk off.
It just went totally.

1739
01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:35.380
He can't take it anymore.
He's calling it a pest but a,
it's going to be,

1740
01:34:35.381 --> 01:34:37.300
why is going to rub it out?
He's going to bang went off.

1741
01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.790
But I think what the old porn that,
uh,
that doesn't happen

1742
01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:43.900
<v 2>today is that you have a lot of guys who did old porn that were really actors,</v>

1743
01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:48.040
you know,
and that day that the old porn was like to pay the bills at today.

1744
01:34:48.041 --> 01:34:51.280
Like you have a lot of guys who were just like everything and they do porn,

1745
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:54.760
you know,
like uh,
you know,
uh,
personal trainers,

1746
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:57.500
they're all these different things.
They all want to be actors I think.

1747
01:34:57.530 --> 01:35:00.530
I think at some point everybody wants to be an actor who does porn because

1748
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:03.200
they've got an amazing confidence to be able to fuck in front of other people.

1749
01:35:03.201 --> 01:35:04.790
That's like,
just like balls.
You know,

1750
01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.760
<v 3>something happens.</v>

1751
01:35:05.761 --> 01:35:09.060
I think to a lot of people when they first come to la where they have this idea

1752
01:35:09.061 --> 01:35:11.430
that they're going to make it in show business that might be an actor.

1753
01:35:11.431 --> 01:35:16.170
And then they came out here and they see what a process it is.
They see the,
the,

1754
01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:21.200
the infinite field of gears and machines in front of them.

1755
01:35:21.361 --> 01:35:24.300
They're going to have to get ground through before they pop out on the other

1756
01:35:24.301 --> 01:35:27.810
side.
And some people just,
they lose,
they lose hope and it pretty quick.

1757
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.903
<v 2>Yeah,
that's the thing man.</v>

1758
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:32.840
It's like all those people who were like an extra on like an ed show like 18 or

1759
01:35:32.841 --> 01:35:35.300
something like that.
I'm always wanting to like what happened to that guy?

1760
01:35:35.301 --> 01:35:37.820
What happened to this chick?
You know,
like where are they?
You know,

1761
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.720
but I assume they were around in La,
you know,
just making it happen and you know,

1762
01:35:41.721 --> 01:35:44.210
just trying to get day to day built a bill,
whatever.

1763
01:35:44.290 --> 01:35:48.580
<v 3>Yeah.
Isn't it funny that when you used to be someone famous and then you aren't?</v>

1764
01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:53.170
It's sad.
But if you see someone and they were never famous,
it's not sad.

1765
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:57.220
No.
If it's a trauma,
regular guy with a regular job at a Deli,

1766
01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.870
you never get sad when he see him.

1767
01:35:59.110 --> 01:36:04.090
But if you went and you know one of the guys from different strokes is in a
deli,

1768
01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.320
you'd be,
you'd feel sad.

1769
01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:07.230
<v 2>I used to get that all the time.
And you know,</v>

1770
01:36:07.231 --> 01:36:09.690
I'll only say this to you because I think,
feel like we're both,
you know,

1771
01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:13.110
the same kind of boat here.
It's like after I stopped doing the insomniac show,

1772
01:36:13.111 --> 01:36:14.970
people used to come up to me all the time and go like,

1773
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:17.970
what happened and Blah Blah Blah.
And I was like,
well,

1774
01:36:17.971 --> 01:36:20.970
we were just done doing the show,
you know,
and like,
they're like,

1775
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.580
how could you ever be done doing TV?
You do TV forever.

1776
01:36:23.581 --> 01:36:25.860
And to some degree they're right.
But I'm was also like,

1777
01:36:25.861 --> 01:36:28.650
I don't want it to be cheesed out like where it keeps going and going and going.

1778
01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.290
And people would be like,
you know,
come and see me live.
And they were like,

1779
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:36.270
you know,
like,
oh,
this guy's a failure in show business when they,
in my head,

1780
01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:39.510
they don't know that.
Like I could give a shit about television.

1781
01:36:39.511 --> 01:36:42.960
It was really about being able to do stand up because I did stand up before the

1782
01:36:42.961 --> 01:36:46.890
show,
during the show,
after the show.
And that was really my dream.

1783
01:36:46.891 --> 01:36:49.470
Like if somebody said to you like,
Dave,
you can never do stand up again.

1784
01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:52.560
But you can have a shitty reality show.
I'd be like,
fuck you,

1785
01:36:52.561 --> 01:36:54.630
I'm not going to do that.
I mean it's like I love,

1786
01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:59.520
I love the ability and freedom of doing standup and there are a lot of people

1787
01:36:59.521 --> 01:37:01.800
that think you're a loser though of yes.
It's their dream.

1788
01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:05.210
It's there and mine wasn't canceled so it was just like we're,

1789
01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.090
we're done doing it.

1790
01:37:06.091 --> 01:37:08.820
I mean you get tired of doing that show too because people are constantly trying

1791
01:37:08.821 --> 01:37:12.150
to get hammered with you.
There was that,
but there was also like the real like,

1792
01:37:12.151 --> 01:37:12.471
and I'm,

1793
01:37:12.471 --> 01:37:15.810
I'm pretty business like you know when I work it's like w it was getting harder

1794
01:37:15.811 --> 01:37:20.070
and harder instead of easier and easier to get access to things outside of bars.

1795
01:37:20.071 --> 01:37:24.690
Like you know,
working late stuff.
I'm like really just cool.
Like events.

1796
01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.510
Like we would either get there like a week late a week early

1797
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:28.470
<v 3>for folks who don't know.</v>

1798
01:37:28.471 --> 01:37:32.070
INSOMNIAC was a show that Dave [inaudible] central on comedy central was really

1799
01:37:32.071 --> 01:37:36.230
cool.
He would do his show and then he would go out and you know the nightlight,

1800
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:38.370
he's an insomniac.
You'd go see what the fuck's going on.

1801
01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:42.390
<v 2>I really am an insomniac.
And the sad part about it is being,
you know,</v>

1802
01:37:42.391 --> 01:37:45.390
I don't drink anymore.
So it's like being up for three days,

1803
01:37:45.391 --> 01:37:48.300
editing porn and like having to do radio and all that kind of stuff.

1804
01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.440
There's no fun in that kind of up,
you know what I'm saying?
But uh,

1805
01:37:52.590 --> 01:37:55.210
you don't like doing radio?
I love doing radio one.

1806
01:37:55.211 --> 01:37:56.850
It's somebody like you or like,

1807
01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.230
oh and a stern like where I get to like just talk about other shit and just be

1808
01:38:01.231 --> 01:38:04.800
funny.
A lot of these stations that they have me on sometimes like the soccer mom

1809
01:38:04.801 --> 01:38:08.070
stations,
there's a lot of stuff you can't talk about.
But then there's also like,

1810
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:10.410
you know,
they want jokes,
like when I do Bob and Tom,

1811
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:14.370
I love doing those guys because they are older dudes.
They know porn,

1812
01:38:14.371 --> 01:38:16.770
they know all the porn things and like,
you know,

1813
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:20.880
there's definitely some standards there,
but it's,
it's not,
I can work with it.

1814
01:38:20.881 --> 01:38:24.510
I love it,
you know?
And I like being able to be,
I'm pretty good on my feet,

1815
01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:27.210
you know,
I could talk about a lot of different things going on in the news,

1816
01:38:27.211 --> 01:38:30.510
whatever,
politics,
all that kind of stuff.
And I,
I like that it's,

1817
01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:33.690
it's exciting and it tests me,
but when it's all about like,
you know,

1818
01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.000
you did this and like,
you know,
give us a setup for,
uh,
you know,

1819
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.960
the football game and shit like that.
I don't like it.
You know,

1820
01:38:40.050 --> 01:38:44.370
<v 3>there's not that many really good radio people.
That's why the podcasts are cool.</v>

1821
01:38:44.410 --> 01:38:47.200
A dozen or so in the whole country where you look forward to him.

1822
01:38:47.201 --> 01:38:50.020
There's a few guys and different radio stations where you go,

1823
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:52.310
this is going to be a fun show,
but a lot of,

1824
01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:56.310
a lot of bad uninterrupted meaning you guys in San Francisco,
they gay guys,

1825
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:58.980
they're great.
They're amazing.

1826
01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:00.330
<v 2>And Johnny Darr,</v>

1827
01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:03.540
who we call who I call Johnny blaze last time I just did his show,

1828
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:05.890
he is so,
uh,

1829
01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:09.240
he's cool because Johnny knows the porn people,

1830
01:39:09.241 --> 01:39:13.140
he knows the business and he's a lot of fun,
you know?
So I think it's great that,

1831
01:39:13.141 --> 01:39:14.150
uh,
you know,

1832
01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:18.220
<v 3>yeah,
he has a fun show.
Can't say Johnny dare shout out.</v>

1833
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:22.810
There's a bunch of good radio still Kevin.
And being in La still one of the best.

1834
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:25.510
Yeah,
it was just,
you know,
it's a dying market.
It,

1835
01:39:25.511 --> 01:39:29.530
the radio is slowly getting absorbed.
Don,
when I say a dying thing,

1836
01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.340
what I mean it's like that morning fun personality that really Howard Stern

1837
01:39:33.341 --> 01:39:36.310
invented that's not that common anymore.

1838
01:39:36.311 --> 01:39:41.311
Like that slowly being phased out by these Jack FM channels and can sort of

1839
01:39:41.711 --> 01:39:44.680
shows and people that,
you know,
quite honestly,

1840
01:39:44.681 --> 01:39:46.750
they don't really have that engaging a personality.

1841
01:39:46.751 --> 01:39:50.140
They just know how to keep things moving along and sound like a radio host.

1842
01:39:50.290 --> 01:39:52.900
Play the right songs.
Well let's take a quick breaks.

1843
01:39:52.930 --> 01:39:56.170
You would know better than me.
What does that,
that computer that tells him like,

1844
01:39:56.171 --> 01:39:58.780
you know,
they can tell when people aren't listening and listening.

1845
01:39:59.050 --> 01:40:01.330
So they have that.
They kind of like stifled by that.

1846
01:40:01.331 --> 01:40:05.350
So this probably a lot of cool dudes who now have to kind of like suck the man's

1847
01:40:05.351 --> 01:40:09.840
Dick to keep the show on the air.
And it sucks my man,
willy and less Willie.

1848
01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:12.450
And in Denver,
uh,
the,
the,

1849
01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:16.900
the thing that they try to do when you try to put a formula to something,

1850
01:40:16.901 --> 01:40:19.930
you can't put a formula to something being entertaining.

1851
01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:22.130
And the only way you find out if someone's entertaining.

1852
01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:23.350
So you've got to let them be themselves.

1853
01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.220
And when you start fucking with this and tweaking that and changing that,

1854
01:40:27.370 --> 01:40:31.660
people that are PR people that are creative understand what's going on there,

1855
01:40:31.661 --> 01:40:34.720
that it's a stifling sorta put the people that are uncreative,

1856
01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:36.030
they just trying to fix it there.

1857
01:40:36.031 --> 01:40:37.330
So we're just trying to make more money with this.

1858
01:40:37.331 --> 01:40:40.810
We're just trying to make this a better radio show.
Well,
we need a girl.

1859
01:40:40.811 --> 01:40:45.430
We need a sidekick.
The numbers show a women don't feel represented on your show.

1860
01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:49.000
Like you just,
it's got to be good.
It's gotta be entertaining.

1861
01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:52.690
And the only way to find out if it's good or entertaining is to someone's

1862
01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:56.080
actually them be allowed to create the show.
It's like,

1863
01:40:56.081 --> 01:40:59.290
it's gotta be the vision of one or a couple of people.

1864
01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:03.620
As soon as you start adding producers and noncreative people in there going to

1865
01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:06.250
fuck it up,
it's going to fuck it all up.
There's no way around it.

1866
01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:10.150
Every show I've ever done where the show wasn't doing well and the producers

1867
01:41:10.151 --> 01:41:12.890
came in and the executives came in and they had notes,
ah,

1868
01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:15.370
let's fucking notes were terrible and they ruined everything.

1869
01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:20.140
<v 2>Well,
you know,
like you said,
it's got to be someone's vision like Ron and Fez,</v>

1870
01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.360
these guys like I listened to them,
you know,

1871
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:25.450
and like they definitely have a point of view or perspective and there's like

1872
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:28.900
definitely a chemistry with the people in the room there.
So it's,
it's,

1873
01:41:28.901 --> 01:41:31.430
it's intriguing to watch.
Same thing with,
uh,
you know,

1874
01:41:31.630 --> 01:41:34.690
Nick Depalo and Artie Lange.
They've got a sports show on and like sports,

1875
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:39.040
unless you're hardcore sports guy,
you know it,
it's Kinda,

1876
01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:40.390
it's Kinda hard to listen to it,

1877
01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:45.420
but they do like a fun show about sports and both of them who I respect the most

1878
01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:48.580
as comics and is just cool dude.

1879
01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:51.010
It's cool that they got to think together and they have great,

1880
01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.410
I guess you could say like back and forth chemistry.
So

1881
01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:56.990
<v 3>depaulo is one of the most underrated comic.
Exactly,
exactly.
Amazing.</v>

1882
01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:00.560
Depaulo was one of the guys when I was a starting out,

1883
01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:04.040
I was like an open mic or nick was already in it a couple of years,

1884
01:42:04.041 --> 01:42:07.790
I think one or two years and he was already solid.
He was already working.

1885
01:42:07.791 --> 01:42:10.160
And I remember he would be the first guy,
he says,

1886
01:42:10.161 --> 01:42:12.860
big fucking muscular foot fucking guy.
Yeah.

1887
01:42:12.861 --> 01:42:15.560
And some mother fucker would a full head of hair and I was like,
oh,

1888
01:42:15.561 --> 01:42:18.680
you can look like that and still be funny.
Like I,
you know,
I thought you had to,

1889
01:42:18.681 --> 01:42:22.100
you know,
be like awkward or stranger.
He,
he,

1890
01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.600
<v 2>his stuff is so well written and it comes at it from such an interesting</v>

1891
01:42:25.601 --> 01:42:29.890
perspective for Boston guy.
Like you always feel like he's a true Boston guy,

1892
01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.540
but his stuff is like,
so,
uh,

1893
01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:36.810
sophisticatedly fucking evil.
I love it.
And you know,

1894
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:40.000
hungry and yeah,
like pure anger,
true anger.
And the,

1895
01:42:40.001 --> 01:42:42.370
I always find that's like the ultimate funny,

1896
01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.100
like just like somebody who's like really fucking angry about something,

1897
01:42:45.101 --> 01:42:45.910
you know?
I like that.

1898
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:50.170
So the world needs more angry comedy and Nick Depalo to check him out because

1899
01:42:50.171 --> 01:42:52.030
he's fucking cool.
And uh,
you know,

1900
01:42:52.031 --> 01:42:54.910
there's a whole bunch of young guys coming up now that I work with who I think

1901
01:42:54.970 --> 01:42:58.870
also have the same heart and soul of these.
Like,
you know,
Jay Jay,

1902
01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:01.690
Kurt Metzger.
I'm very funny.

1903
01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:05.280
Like Vicky on Kurt has some of the funniest shit I've ever heard.
And uh,

1904
01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:08.140
you know,
he's just now working his way through the system.
But you know,
I took,

1905
01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:11.980
I worked with him in Nyack at the,
uh,
levity live.
That's a great club,
by the way.

1906
01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:16.840
What did that used to be?
It's in the mall.
So it was,
it was imax or something.

1907
01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.390
There was a Gig in Nyack way back in the day.

1908
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:23.560
I wonder if it's the same gig but levity live is like does the same boots that

1909
01:43:23.561 --> 01:43:26.470
do standup live in Phoenix.
I couldn't fill it out.

1910
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.290
I couldn't fill it up but I brought uh,
to the big place.

1911
01:43:29.730 --> 01:43:33.800
It's probably like 500 seats and I'm making these big giant places now.
Yeah,

1912
01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:34.421
but do you like it?

1913
01:43:34.421 --> 01:43:37.780
Cause you could definitely feel that kind of standup live in Phoenix.

1914
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:41.200
I loved that.
Loved it club that I've ever done.

1915
01:43:41.201 --> 01:43:45.060
Like it felt like it felt like a club but didn't feel like a theater.

1916
01:43:45.610 --> 01:43:48.700
And I liked working downtown Phoenix and everybody used to play the Tempe
Improv,

1917
01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:49.653
which is fun.

1918
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:52.250
But I like downtown Phoenix cause that's like the heart of the fucking,

1919
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:55.450
<v 1>you know that the town is that,
that's a hardcore town.
Crazy town.
Yeah.</v>

1920
01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.020
So you get like a whole different crowd now.

1921
01:43:57.021 --> 01:44:01.070
It's not just college kids and that's a wild west town.
It is.
Yeah.

1922
01:44:01.071 --> 01:44:03.190
You can carry a gun.
There were better.

1923
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.490
Don't realize how nutty Phoenix is as a town.
We were in Scottsdale.

1924
01:44:07.491 --> 01:44:09.860
I'm never told the store on the air before,
I don't think,

1925
01:44:09.861 --> 01:44:14.861
but we came out of a club once and there was all these people laying on the

1926
01:44:15.471 --> 01:44:18.170
ground.
It was really weird.
Um,

1927
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:23.290
a guy had gotten his key from the valet and he was hammered and he just plowed

1928
01:44:23.691 --> 01:44:28.691
through this line of people sent people flying through the air and we came out

1929
01:44:28.791 --> 01:44:31.160
like literally seconds after it happened.

1930
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:35.180
And it was so strange because it was just eerie silence.

1931
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:39.140
We walked out and it was literally seconds after it happened and people were

1932
01:44:39.141 --> 01:44:43.580
lying on the ground shit and the car was stopped and no one believed what they

1933
01:44:43.581 --> 01:44:47.720
had seen that this guy had just stomped on the gas and ran a bunch of people

1934
01:44:47.721 --> 01:44:51.380
over,
send some people fly in.
I believe people got like seriously,

1935
01:44:51.381 --> 01:44:55.340
seriously injured.
I think people might've even died from it.
It was,
was that,

1936
01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:59.270
it was,
man,
I guess it had to be the early two thousands.
Oh,

1937
01:44:59.770 --> 01:45:02.030
like 2000 2001 it was when I,

1938
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:06.080
I think I first started doing the Tempe Improv in the late nineties,

1939
01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:09.170
so it could have been around there too.
It could have been like 99 maybe.

1940
01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.020
That was a great club.
That was very close.
That was one of the best.

1941
01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:15.500
I'm going to play the DC Improv and I think that's the best improv in the

1942
01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:20.210
country.
The improv in DC,
Irvine,
NTC are probably the last two really great ones.

1943
01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.170
Three is very underrated too.
I couldn't fill it.
Couldn't fill it up.

1944
01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:26.800
How dare you.
I know.
I felt bad.
You know why I love the people.

1945
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:29.560
I didn't know if they knew they would be,
there would be seniors.

1946
01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:34.040
That's the thing.
Fuck Outta here.
That's the thing about this social media stuff.

1947
01:45:34.041 --> 01:45:37.150
It's like,
it allows people to know where you're going to be.
Uh,

1948
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:40.790
I think it's the beach crowd too.
I Dunno.
I always blame it on like,
you know,

1949
01:45:40.791 --> 01:45:43.040
like it's near Huntington beach,
so it must be like,
you know,

1950
01:45:43.041 --> 01:45:47.660
the surfer people didn't come out.
They didn't connect with you.
I had never,

1951
01:45:47.661 --> 01:45:50.630
like I never do any more excuses except I will ask what,

1952
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:54.830
what else is going on in town and if it's high school football and you're still

1953
01:45:54.831 --> 01:45:56.300
not selling out,
then I'm like shit,

1954
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:59.390
I better fucking call a cousin and get a job doing something because this is

1955
01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:04.040
dude stop it.
You just need to get more active on Twitter.
It's just podcast.
Yeah,

1956
01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:06.940
podcasts would be great or let us know anytime you have a shovel,

1957
01:46:06.941 --> 01:46:09.410
a tweet it for you and I were just talking.
We got to do like,

1958
01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.560
I just want to hang out and do a show with you.
I would love to do that.

1959
01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:14.120
I would love,
this is not about money.
It's just about,

1960
01:46:14.121 --> 01:46:15.470
I want to like get in front of your crowd.

1961
01:46:15.471 --> 01:46:17.660
I feel like your crowd would get my shit immediately.

1962
01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:21.170
They love you 100% and I went down,
step it up.
I would not walk through the show.

1963
01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:22.010
I would get to my age.

1964
01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:25.790
I believe you would have just a couple of midget jokes and you know whatever

1965
01:46:25.791 --> 01:46:27.350
Obama.
Either way,
man,

1966
01:46:27.351 --> 01:46:29.840
the people that listen to the show would love to see you wherever you are.

1967
01:46:29.841 --> 01:46:31.970
So just tell me where you're going to be and I'll tweet it.
Well,

1968
01:46:31.971 --> 01:46:35.330
I'm going to San Diego this weekend and I don't even really know the club,

1969
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:35.871
but uh,

1970
01:46:35.871 --> 01:46:40.520
I'm looking forward to it cause I have San Diego comedy club or is it the other

1971
01:46:40.521 --> 01:46:44.390
one?
Oh Shit.
A comedy madhouse.
I think it's the mad house supposedly.
Great.
Yeah.

1972
01:46:44.391 --> 01:46:47.750
So I'm into doing it and I'm going to be selling days.
All porn shit there too.

1973
01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:50.250
So,
or a shirt or

1974
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:53.120
<v 3>some booty shorts.
See I guess on that.</v>

1975
01:46:53.210 --> 01:46:55.820
<v 2>There you go.
So I'll be doing that shit.
So I'll be hanging out.</v>

1976
01:46:55.930 --> 01:46:57.970
<v 3>It's more that people don't know you,
man.</v>

1977
01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:00.560
We lit a service we offer here at the Joe Rogan experience.

1978
01:47:01.330 --> 01:47:03.860
We use my Twitter and like we sold out a,

1979
01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:08.890
Brian counseled out Philly really in advance.
Another great week in at helium.

1980
01:47:09.250 --> 01:47:12.160
Yeah.
And he's never done that before.
He said it was just from,
from Twitter,

1981
01:47:12.190 --> 01:47:14.740
putting it on Twitter.
I had to Columbus sold out shows because

1982
01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:20.580
it's um,
you guys did the man,
you are the king makers.
Well comedy,

1983
01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:24.070
but we've figured out a way to get through the fence and now we're just letting

1984
01:47:24.071 --> 01:47:25.900
other cool people through the fence.
I'd find a hole.

1985
01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:28.890
<v 2>I appreciate it was speaking for the other comics.</v>

1986
01:47:28.891 --> 01:47:32.250
We appreciate what you do and anything that helps.
Good,

1987
01:47:32.251 --> 01:47:36.060
cool people come see really raw hardcore comedy is good,

1988
01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:39.750
is good for the industry.
It's good for the comics and it's also a,
you know,

1989
01:47:39.751 --> 01:47:41.540
let's face it,
it's a,
we're in the,

1990
01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:44.970
nobody has money so you might as well just come and you know,
check it out.

1991
01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:46.290
<v 3>Well it's worth doing.</v>

1992
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:51.060
Standup comedy in its best form is one of the most entertaining things in show

1993
01:47:51.110 --> 01:47:52.290
business.
In my opinion.

1994
01:47:52.291 --> 01:47:55.910
If I had a choice between seeing a great comic and seeing anything else,

1995
01:47:55.930 --> 01:48:00.300
movie a band,
I would love comedy over all those things like as a,

1996
01:48:00.301 --> 01:48:05.250
as an art form and then in an easy to get right.
It's not easy.
We all know a guy,

1997
01:48:05.251 --> 01:48:07.890
a lot of guys we don't want to watch.
We all know,
a lot of guys,

1998
01:48:07.891 --> 01:48:11.490
we walk in the room,
we see him on stage or wonder out of there.

1999
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:14.970
That's how the audience feels too.
So when we find something that's good,

2000
01:48:15.090 --> 01:48:18.040
we promote the shit out of it.
Well now

2001
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:19.510
<v 2>doing it over 26 years,</v>

2002
01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:24.370
I've never appreciated more of the people that get the comedy.
Then now like,

2003
01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.310
you know,
back in the day it was like,
you know,
the drinking party Frat guys,

2004
01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:29.830
now it's like any,
they're older now,
they're all married,

2005
01:48:29.831 --> 01:48:32.260
they bring their wives and they're like,
what the fuck is this kind of shit.

2006
01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:36.520
But I really appreciate the comedy fan who gets the jokes and like sees like,

2007
01:48:36.521 --> 01:48:40.420
you know,
hey dude,
I saw you with Mitch Hedberg and Lewis Black on tour and like,

2008
01:48:40.421 --> 01:48:42.280
you know,
that was the best tour.
And you know,

2009
01:48:42.281 --> 01:48:45.760
I love Mitch and all kinds of like that kind of shit.
Like I never get tired of.

2010
01:48:45.761 --> 01:48:49.510
So you know,
I've gotten,
I've gotten it a lot from people who've seen you.

2011
01:48:49.511 --> 01:48:51.730
They'll like,
you know,
her,
you on the,
on the uh,
you know,

2012
01:48:51.731 --> 01:48:54.520
on Rogan's podcast and it's really cool to hear you guys,
you know,

2013
01:48:54.521 --> 01:48:55.690
chew it up about the comedy.

2014
01:48:55.691 --> 01:48:58.300
So there are definitely a lot of comedy fans out there.

2015
01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:01.350
We just need you guys to like fucking come to the clubs.
Yeah,

2016
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:03.300
<v 3>well they just need to find out where you're at.</v>

2017
01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.070
I guarantee you that's a big part of it.

2018
01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:07.980
There's a lot of people that are huge David tell fans they just wouldn't know

2019
01:49:07.981 --> 01:49:11.880
that you are going to be somewhere.
Yeah,
you gotta be real because only one way.

2020
01:49:11.881 --> 01:49:14.220
It's like to really reach people you,
you got,

2021
01:49:14.221 --> 01:49:15.630
it's got to be a social media thing.

2022
01:49:15.631 --> 01:49:17.970
You have to have a website that you update on a regular basis.

2023
01:49:18.190 --> 01:49:21.570
You have to have Twitter and not about flyers and that doesn't really only in

2024
01:49:21.571 --> 01:49:24.970
parking lots or hire a guy flyer for a couple of hours.

2025
01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:28.980
Flyer on my car yesterday.
World famous psychic,

2026
01:49:29.190 --> 01:49:32.070
I should give out a number on the air.
Should I,

2027
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:33.600
that was one of the funniest things I ever saw.

2028
01:49:33.601 --> 01:49:35.430
An airport security was a crystal ball.

2029
01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:38.530
Like somebody who was trying to get a crystal bone airport security and then

2030
01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:41.940
they took it from them.
And you're like,
the joke,
of course,
the easy joke.

2031
01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:46.610
Didn't they know that they were?
No,
but I mean honestly that was hilarious.

2032
01:49:46.611 --> 01:49:48.030
What did they think?
It was still

2033
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.770
<v 2>kind of bomb a neutron EMT blast fucking space.</v>

2034
01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:55.890
<v 0>Paul.
Yeah.
Inside there.
A lot fucking explosion.</v>

2035
01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:00.870
And I'm in Indiana.
Indianapolis.
Holy Shit Dude.

2036
01:50:00.871 --> 01:50:05.350
Some house exploded.
Most likely a gas leak.
Oh,

2037
01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:09.680
shit happen sometimes.
Uh,
it happened was another one on my message board.

2038
01:50:09.681 --> 01:50:14.250
A guy was saying that a one happened four miles from his house and he said he

2039
01:50:14.251 --> 01:50:17.430
could feel the blast on his chest.
Holy Shit.

2040
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:21.000
From four miles away from his house.
Yeah.
Oh,
hey.
There it is.

2041
01:50:21.001 --> 01:50:24.000
Like when you see what,
what it looks like,
that ain't shit.

2042
01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:28.170
You got to see the overhead.
There's an overhead shot.
That's unbelievable.

2043
01:50:28.171 --> 01:50:31.380
It doesn't even make sense.
Look at that man.
Like a drone strike.
Look at that.

2044
01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.640
It looks crazy.
Yeah,

2045
01:50:32.641 --> 01:50:35.580
it looks just like a drone strike or like some sort of a missile strike.

2046
01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:37.710
Go to go to images and uh,

2047
01:50:37.730 --> 01:50:40.980
there's a one large photo of a,

2048
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:45.510
an overhead image where it shows,
um,
there's one of them right there.

2049
01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:48.630
Click on that one.
All right,
here's a video of it.
Oh yeah,
but go to the,

2050
01:50:48.631 --> 01:50:52.530
go to the images just cause there's,
there's one image that's so insane.
It just,

2051
01:50:52.531 --> 01:50:55.740
you can't even wrap your head around how big the explosion was.

2052
01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:57.993
<v 6>Yes.</v>

2053
01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:04.370
<v 0>I don't know if that's it.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
Wow.</v>

2054
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:09.150
Look at that.
Fuck Dude.
They're splinters there.

2055
01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:13.160
Then we'll reduce the splinters.
The houses fucking exploded.

2056
01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:15.680
<v 2>What a heartache that must be like,
how many do you see your house?</v>

2057
01:51:15.681 --> 01:51:18.710
It's just fucking,
or people for road.
Yeah.

2058
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:23.100
<v 0>Zero.
Well that's something that we have to remember is that we have fucking gas</v>

2059
01:51:23.101 --> 01:51:27.480
pumping into our houses.
It's amazing.
Right?
Doesn't happen on a regular basis.

2060
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:30.860
<v 2>It's like a gas stove.
Before I got both.
I got to go to these other stuff.
But uh,</v>

2061
01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:33.500
Scad,
another shoe to do it.
Yeah.
Sorry Dude.
I really,

2062
01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:37.190
because I can stay here for fucking nine hours and it would never get boring.

2063
01:51:37.191 --> 01:51:41.460
But,
uh,
what is it going to say?
My house,
I thought I had a gas leak so you know,

2064
01:51:41.461 --> 01:51:43.630
I get the handy guy to come in and he's like,
uh,

2065
01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:47.540
well first of all you don't have gas.
And I'm like,
you sure about that?

2066
01:51:47.541 --> 01:51:49.190
And he goes,
yeah you don't.
So then I'm like,

2067
01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:51.500
why do I have this blinding headache?
You know?

2068
01:51:51.501 --> 01:51:53.660
Cause that's what I thought because it with gas,
like you always thinking like,

2069
01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:56.690
oh you know,
like they always tell you dizzy,
blinding headache.
And I'm like,

2070
01:51:56.900 --> 01:52:01.370
Oh okay.
So I'm really just basically on deck for a stroke.
You know,

2071
01:52:01.371 --> 01:52:04.730
I went through the normal luck kid.
I was like,
it's gas,
it's not me.
It's like,

2072
01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.610
oh no,
my brain aneurysm,
something's going to happen.

2073
01:52:07.650 --> 01:52:12.020
So you sent the guy in cause you had a headache and you
smell gas.

2074
01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:16.980
I buy please fucking reeks of just,
it's horrible.
So I mean,

2075
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:21.630
do you live in New York?
I live in Manhattan,
so you know,
what's the address?
Okay,

2076
01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:25.580
cool.
Yeah.
With apartment.
I live in battery park right near the memorial.
No,
uh,

2077
01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.630
it was a washed out.
Now it's an aquarium.
Yeah.
No,
but I live a,
you know,
in the,

2078
01:52:29.631 --> 01:52:31.280
in the city.
So I figured it was like,
you know,

2079
01:52:31.281 --> 01:52:34.850
they're on gas or something like that and it turns out there's no gas there.

2080
01:52:34.851 --> 01:52:39.730
And I was like,
Oh shit.
Okay.
So then this is just a,
my neuro something,
uh,

2081
01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:43.820
you know about to be,
I'll be eating,
you know,
baby food next time,
you know.

2082
01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:46.920
[inaudible] yeah,
some of it will be open the hanger.

2083
01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:49.230
<v 3>Do you live in the thick of it where you look,
look out your window,</v>

2084
01:52:49.231 --> 01:52:50.670
you see nothing.
My skyscrapers,

2085
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:53.060
<v 2>everything is,
skyscrapers is,
there's no good view anymore.</v>

2086
01:52:53.061 --> 01:52:56.180
You've got to be like Donald Trump to have a view where you're just like a deck

2087
01:52:56.181 --> 01:53:00.140
and you just laugh,
you know?
But everybody wants to be on the,
on the park.

2088
01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:02.960
I never,
never got that whole idea.
I like,
you know,

2089
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:07.490
like I like being in a place where I can get in a cab and like get to the

2090
01:53:07.491 --> 01:53:10.800
airport because I'm a comic.
You know,
it's all about like getting Adam and Adam,

2091
01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:15.140
which is impossible now because the mayor shut down all these streets and like

2092
01:53:15.141 --> 01:53:18.640
there's bike lanes,
there's like,
you know,
unicycle lanes.
There's like,
you know,

2093
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:22.900
you know,
skip to my Lou lanes.
It sucks.
So this is post hurricane you mean?
No,

2094
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:25.940
this is like been here last two years where they made it more like walking

2095
01:53:25.941 --> 01:53:29.010
friendly and in Manhattan,
honestly,
you know,
it's like you just,

2096
01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:31.880
it's so hard to get around to begin with.
It just made it impossible.

2097
01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:34.260
<v 3>Is it the only city that has cabs like that?</v>

2098
01:53:34.290 --> 01:53:37.860
Cause I've never been to a city which dominated by cab.
So a Manhattan is,
I mean,

2099
01:53:37.861 --> 01:53:41.490
I can't think of another place that's so strange where they've just decided to

2100
01:53:41.491 --> 01:53:45.120
like,
look,
you can't park.
Forget it.
Don't,
don't even try it.

2101
01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:46.500
Just let us take care of you.

2102
01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:46.671
<v 2>Well,</v>

2103
01:53:46.671 --> 01:53:48.920
the cool thing about living in Manhattan is that you don't have to have a car

2104
01:53:48.921 --> 01:53:51.530
because it the subway and then there's cabs and then his bosses.

2105
01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:54.110
<v 3>Yeah.
But you learn all these other people drive for you all the time.</v>

2106
01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:57.510
<v 2>Yeah.
But I mean,
I mean come on,
it's not like a limo.
I mean,
you know,</v>

2107
01:53:57.511 --> 01:53:59.250
you're some guy from Senegal,

2108
01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:03.810
<v 3>you got to trust this guy around.
You don't even know this guy.
True.</v>

2109
01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:07.690
You never know when that goes to car.
Well it's also,
it's a weird thing.

2110
01:54:07.691 --> 01:54:11.980
You constantly interacting with all these other people like in close proximity

2111
01:54:12.190 --> 01:54:13.030
and cabs.

2112
01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:16.810
<v 2>Well that's why I like going to Minneapolis because it's like the widest town</v>

2113
01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:21.250
with the most African cab drivers,
boy soldiers,
you know,

2114
01:54:21.251 --> 01:54:24.520
they brought him over there and like they're all cab drivers and you know,

2115
01:54:24.521 --> 01:54:27.190
they know the town pretty well cause they're pretty into not going back to

2116
01:54:27.191 --> 01:54:30.340
wherever the fuck they're from.
So they're on it in New York.
The guys are like,

2117
01:54:30.370 --> 01:54:31.203
Eh,

2118
01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:36.440
<v 3>one year where the,
the shot like 48 cab drivers in a year.</v>

2119
01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:41.060
Oh right.
Yeah,
that's right.
It was like a cereal.
Wow.
Really bad.

2120
01:54:41.061 --> 01:54:43.670
They were robbing cab drivers.
So they would take,

2121
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:46.400
and that's one of the reasons why cab drivers would stop picking up.

2122
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:50.210
Urban's really stopped picking up the urban kids blank.

2123
01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.630
Um,
they would,
they would,
uh,

2124
01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:55.970
they would take them somewhere and they would just shoot him in the head and

2125
01:54:55.971 --> 01:54:58.460
take all their money.
Wow.
It was really common.

2126
01:54:58.461 --> 01:55:02.090
Like I believe it was like 48 was like the record one year and it was pretty

2127
01:55:02.091 --> 01:55:06.200
spooky for these fucking cab drivers,
especially those gypsy cabs,
you know,

2128
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:08.750
there's a lot of people that are operating as cab drivers that had like

2129
01:55:08.751 --> 01:55:12.990
different licenses are no licenses and they're just sort of sneak out of rides.

2130
01:55:13.050 --> 01:55:14.720
Undercover Shit.
Yeah.

2131
01:55:14.721 --> 01:55:16.970
If you mean you could just sneak around and give people rides.

2132
01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:20.810
We got that in England.
A guy give us ride wasn't even a cab driver,

2133
01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:22.310
but those guys give us a deal.

2134
01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:24.060
<v 2>Don't they have to go to like cab driving school there?</v>

2135
01:55:24.061 --> 01:55:25.710
They have to learn the knowledge.
You know,

2136
01:55:25.711 --> 01:55:29.730
they have to like learn all this England.
Yeah.
I don't know it,
I know they do.

2137
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:31.470
They have to like go through this incredible,

2138
01:55:31.490 --> 01:55:34.650
there are also like are their father was a cab driver and their father's father.

2139
01:55:34.651 --> 01:55:34.780
Yeah,

2140
01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:36.780
<v 3>kind of bullshit.
When we were in,
um,</v>

2141
01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:40.860
I think it was in Manchester with my friend Dave Bishop.

2142
01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:44.350
We got a ride with some dude who was just a,
uh,
illegal cab driver.

2143
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:47.200
<v 0>I was like a lot of illegal cabs because there's not enough regular cabs.</v>

2144
01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.430
So there's like these dudes who like have a little navigation systems like you

2145
01:55:50.431 --> 01:55:52.710
need to run.
Okay,
I got Ya.
All right,
20 bucks and you're like,

2146
01:55:52.711 --> 01:55:54.660
negotiate with them and just hop in his car.

2147
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:57.600
It was like a fucking Toyota Tercel good idea.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2148
01:55:57.990 --> 01:56:00.330
I think it's pretty common.
I think it's illegal though.

2149
01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:01.950
I think they can get in trouble if they do it,

2150
01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:05.310
but it's like there's so much demand for it because there's not enough cabs

2151
01:56:05.311 --> 01:56:08.520
huffily porn pornstar start doing that since they're going to all be at a work

2152
01:56:08.530 --> 01:56:12.240
site.
What is the deal now how the porn stars reacting too?

2153
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:13.710
For folks who don't know,
there's a,

2154
01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:16.260
Brian said they're going to be out of work because they just passed some crazy

2155
01:56:16.261 --> 01:56:16.830
new

2156
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:20.360
<v 5>out of work.
It's just that they've made it a lot more annoying.</v>

2157
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:23.930
Now they have to go outside of La county to do porn.

2158
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:27.290
They can go to the owl condoms.
Yeah.
Yeah,
they can,
they have to all go out.

2159
01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:32.100
But a lot of these girls,
California state wine,
no,
it's just Los Angeles County.

2160
01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.170
So all you're going to find it,

2161
01:56:34.171 --> 01:56:37.940
it just made more annoyed and more porn stars are going to be late to set and

2162
01:56:37.941 --> 01:56:38.774
it's going to,

2163
01:56:38.970 --> 01:56:43.180
<v 2>I don't know,
when I do the Avms,
I'm sure that I'll,
that'll be like a,</v>

2164
01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:46.260
a topic or something like that.
But they will keep making porn.

2165
01:56:46.290 --> 01:56:50.370
They'll keep losing money,
making porn.
There'll be more like,
you know,

2166
01:56:50.371 --> 01:56:52.200
illegal download it pouring,
all that kind of stuff.

2167
01:56:52.201 --> 01:56:56.930
So it's a lose lose proposition all the way around.
And then making it a,

2168
01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.470
you know,

2169
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:59.730
<v 0>well explained to people don't know what it is,
what we're talking about.</v>

2170
01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.550
<v 2>Well I don't really,
I'm not from here,</v>

2171
01:57:01.551 --> 01:57:03.520
so I kind of know they have to wear condoms.

2172
01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:07.710
<v 5>It's prop B,
which was a,
I think it was property,
but uh,
it passed.</v>

2173
01:57:07.711 --> 01:57:09.960
And what what that means is they have to wear condoms now.

2174
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:14.220
If they're doing a blow job,
they have to have like the,
the mouth condom.
They if,

2175
01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:18.240
but what sucks is they had all these hidden things built into it.

2176
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:22.560
Meaning like if you're married at home and you want to go on my free cams or

2177
01:57:22.561 --> 01:57:25.440
whatever your Webcam,
Webcam show,
do a Webcam show,

2178
01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:28.860
you have to have a permit that costs up to like something ridiculous like

2179
01:57:28.861 --> 01:57:33.830
$60,000 just to do that.
Just that form with your own wife,
Webcam.

2180
01:57:33.850 --> 01:57:37.200
So there's like all these like hidden things that they put in there on top of it

2181
01:57:37.201 --> 01:57:40.440
and everyone knows that aids is not real.
So yeah,
well yeah

2182
01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:45.740
<v 0>Dr Peter Duesberg but we are not really,
we really shouldn't be saying age is,</v>

2183
01:57:46.230 --> 01:57:47.550
<v 2>well you know there's things about,</v>

2184
01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:51.360
the thing about making porn now it's like there's such little money in it.

2185
01:57:51.361 --> 01:57:56.040
Like I think a lot of girls think like I'll just do porn for a while and that

2186
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:58.890
that'll be like this amazing amount of money and then I'll go off and do other

2187
01:57:58.891 --> 01:58:00.650
things.
But porn is like,
I,

2188
01:58:00.670 --> 01:58:05.040
I'd say it would be like working like the Maitre d at like a fancy restaurant.

2189
01:58:05.041 --> 01:58:07.890
You're making that kind of money but you're doing it in like an afternoon.

2190
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:09.990
But like,
you know,
instead of work in a whole week,

2191
01:58:09.991 --> 01:58:12.720
you're going to make that much money and they work scene to scene unless they're

2192
01:58:12.721 --> 01:58:15.930
a contract girl and the contract girls probably make some more money and they

2193
01:58:15.931 --> 01:58:20.340
also get a lot more publicity.
But unless the girls actually,
uh,

2194
01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:23.130
control their image and own their material,

2195
01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.740
their chances of making the sizable amount of money,

2196
01:58:25.741 --> 01:58:30.150
which they're due by the way they are definitely do money.
Uh,
it's very low.

2197
01:58:30.210 --> 01:58:31.043
And you know,

2198
01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:34.500
I think the industry itself is going through a big transition about like,

2199
01:58:34.501 --> 01:58:37.350
what are we gonna do?
How are we going to make the network for us?

2200
01:58:37.351 --> 01:58:40.620
Cause it definitely works for the people watching.
You know that,
I mean,

2201
01:58:40.621 --> 01:58:42.710
there would be no internet without porn,
you know that.
Right.

2202
01:58:42.770 --> 01:58:46.250
<v 3>Well it's an interesting thing the way it happened where they all of the sudden</v>

2203
01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:50.960
didn't have an outlet to make money anymore.
Yeah.
Just like no more DVD sales.

2204
01:58:50.970 --> 01:58:54.560
They completely went away.
I still buy DVDs.
The last guy.
Yeah.

2205
01:58:55.490 --> 01:58:59.070
What do you think,
what does the drop off like how it was an enormous travel,

2206
01:58:59.110 --> 01:59:02.270
cause I used to have a lot of porn producers.
Um,
the,

2207
01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:04.190
a lot of guys used to come to Jujitsu.
Yeah.

2208
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:07.280
I used to train at John Jock's place in the valley and they uh,

2209
01:59:07.281 --> 01:59:11.240
they were rich as fuck.
They had these big ball in cars and,
and those guys,

2210
01:59:11.241 --> 01:59:15.710
a lot of them lost their houses,
got their houses repossessed.
Those really common

2211
01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:17.860
<v 2>I think important to people live for the moment.</v>

2212
01:59:17.861 --> 01:59:21.880
So there's probably a lot of guys who have money but they like want to show it

2213
01:59:21.881 --> 01:59:25.360
off kind of like rapper type.
Yeah.
And you know,

2214
01:59:25.361 --> 01:59:27.490
they think the money's can always be coming an end and like,
you know,

2215
01:59:27.491 --> 01:59:29.200
might as well buy that car and like a boat.

2216
01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:33.970
And then a lot of girls also live kind of high high up there and you know,

2217
01:59:33.971 --> 01:59:35.890
now they realize that like,
you know,
I really should say,

2218
01:59:36.230 --> 01:59:40.080
<v 3>well at least the girls still getting some money.
Right.
The guys,
the producers,</v>

2219
01:59:40.081 --> 01:59:43.410
that shit's done,
man,
it's over.
I don't know how they make money now.

2220
01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:46.560
<v 2>I have no idea who's making money and how it's being made.</v>

2221
01:59:46.561 --> 01:59:50.100
I know that there was a big buyout on a lot of these companies where now they're

2222
01:59:50.101 --> 01:59:54.240
all kind of under one flag and that,
uh,
it's good and bad for porn where like,

2223
01:59:54.241 --> 01:59:57.780
you know,
a lot of,
a lot of these independent producers have been bought out.

2224
01:59:57.781 --> 02:00:01.140
Hopefully they made some money,
like a.com kind of thing.
But I doubt it.
And uh,

2225
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:03.960
you know,
now it's someone else's headache,
you know,
the whole like,
you know,

2226
02:00:03.961 --> 02:00:06.630
how you get it out of the distribution,
all that kind of stuff.
So it,

2227
02:00:06.710 --> 02:00:09.270
it's an interesting business because,
you know,

2228
02:00:09.271 --> 02:00:11.220
I don't know much about the actual making of the porn.

2229
02:00:11.221 --> 02:00:14.040
I just know about the licensing and all that kind of stuff and that a lot of

2230
02:00:14.041 --> 02:00:16.650
these titles,
you know,
it's a very gray area,
you know,

2231
02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:20.010
in terms of like who owns what,
uh,
who can show what.

2232
02:00:20.190 --> 02:00:22.000
And at the end of the day it's all going.

2233
02:00:22.001 --> 02:00:23.910
I ended up on the net and people are just going to watch for free.

2234
02:00:23.911 --> 02:00:26.760
So you know all that money you're spending for a lawyer when you realize you're

2235
02:00:26.761 --> 02:00:28.800
like,
ah,
you know,
is this worth it?

2236
02:00:28.801 --> 02:00:31.650
But you want to be on the up and up and you want the business to make money.

2237
02:00:31.651 --> 02:00:33.360
And I do,
I really want,
you know,

2238
02:00:33.361 --> 02:00:37.200
this show is about [inaudible] not only the old point source but making it a

2239
02:00:37.201 --> 02:00:40.890
cool place for young ones to come out and show everybody that they're funny and

2240
02:00:40.891 --> 02:00:42.450
cool and they're just,

2241
02:00:42.930 --> 02:00:46.440
you don't need seem naked without them being interesting and that,
you know,

2242
02:00:46.441 --> 02:00:49.650
it's great for comics to roll with this kind of shit since we all know the porn

2243
02:00:49.890 --> 02:00:53.220
and uh,
it,
it's,
it's kind of like,

2244
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:57.120
it's very important for me that the show works for the industry,
you know,
like,

2245
02:00:57.121 --> 02:01:00.720
and uh,
at the abns when I meet the people that go,
Oh,
I love the show.

2246
02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:03.780
I love what you're doing for pouring.
And I never really got it,
but now I get it.

2247
02:01:03.781 --> 02:01:07.200
Cause it's like it's a place for the people to see them do something besides
fuck

2248
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:10.210
<v 3>yeah,
I seen them in a positive light to exactly.
Yeah.</v>

2249
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:15.470
It's a weird thing with us with morals where we absolutely down on porn in a

2250
02:01:15.641 --> 02:01:20.050
strange way.
Yet it gets seen and used by so many fucking people.

2251
02:01:20.051 --> 02:01:24.630
If you look at the numbers,
the amount of people that are involved,
uh,

2252
02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:27.640
in watching porn is fucking staggering.

2253
02:01:27.641 --> 02:01:32.641
The amount of porn downloads at supposedly 40% or somewhere around there of the

2254
02:01:32.921 --> 02:01:34.810
Internet's entire traffic allied.
Yeah.

2255
02:01:34.930 --> 02:01:38.500
So what's crazy to me is that that industry,
when,

2256
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:39.980
when the internet boom

2257
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:43.340
<v 1>came along,
that industry was essentially dig gutted,</v>

2258
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:47.120
took the legs right off of it.
The,
the industry fell apart.

2259
02:01:47.210 --> 02:01:51.590
People were completely out of the business.
People lost jobs like crazy.

2260
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:55.070
But those jobs were never deemed to be legitimate.

2261
02:01:55.071 --> 02:01:56.750
So there was never any talk of a bailout.

2262
02:01:56.870 --> 02:02:00.230
There's never any talk of government assistance.
But Chevy's,
okay,

2263
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:03.590
we have to save Chevy.
Chevy is important.
Chevy makes cars.

2264
02:02:03.710 --> 02:02:07.820
We knew we can't lose Chevy jobs.
And so they went in to save Chevy or GM,

2265
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:11.080
but they didn't do shit about the porn business.
They just let it die.
They,

2266
02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.550
they'll always be pouring in.
They'll always be a porn business,

2267
02:02:13.551 --> 02:02:18.080
but they are scraping by bank bailouts.
Absolutely.
Porn bail outs,

2268
02:02:18.081 --> 02:02:19.940
no fucking way.
I don't even know how they do it.

2269
02:02:19.941 --> 02:02:23.080
Like I don't know how they looked at backers.
Do they,
you know,
it's,
it's like,
uh,

2270
02:02:23.090 --> 02:02:26.840
you know,
just some money they found like from jungle gold digging,

2271
02:02:26.841 --> 02:02:29.900
I don't know how they do it,
but has there been a business that fell apart?

2272
02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:34.580
That's that big of a business that was a dead almost completely evaporated in

2273
02:02:34.581 --> 02:02:38.300
such a short period of time.
The,
besides the music business,

2274
02:02:38.301 --> 02:02:42.320
I guess point of music and also to some degree,
I guess the comedy,
like,
you know,

2275
02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:43.610
comedy is,
Oh,
I don't think so.

2276
02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:46.230
I don't think comedy's really been affected by it and negative way.
I Dunno.

2277
02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.370
I tend the downloads and all that kind of stuff,
you know,
it helps us.

2278
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:52.220
I think it gives,
it,
makes people want to come see us live.
I hope so.

2279
02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:54.530
I think there's for artists,

2280
02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:58.280
I think it switched to a live performance model for for uh,
rather,
uh,

2281
02:02:58.310 --> 02:03:01.910
music artists.
But for porn,
man,
what are they going to fuck live?

2282
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:05.590
Maybe that's what I should do.
They should have live fuck shows.
This was a stony.

2283
02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:09.380
Yeah,
they would,
they would be doing it.
Why don't they do have a live fuck show?

2284
02:03:09.530 --> 02:03:13.490
Why can't like wouldn't you pay money to go see Danny D on Mon?
Fuck Brian.

2285
02:03:13.491 --> 02:03:16.780
They do live 10 black guys.
They have sex shows all the time.

2286
02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.860
Then I in Columbus was telling me no but legal.

2287
02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.490
That's not yet pit bull fights.

2288
02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:29.350
Alright.

some guy who,

2289
02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:32.030
you know,
holding on with a hot chicken is arm holding up a gold bar.

2290
02:03:32.031 --> 02:03:35.570
I got my money on.
I think they have that though in San Francisco.
Legally.

2291
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:37.310
I don't think so.
They have that.

2292
02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:41.250
They do things there.

2293
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:46.580
They would spit on dildos and shove him and yet he and gloves.

2294

Um,

2309
02:04:29.121 --> 02:04:31.160

2313
02:04:41.810 --> 02:04:45.300
Were born to robotics robot apocalypse.

2314
02:04:45.330 --> 02:04:49.250
I think Robo apocalypse is,

2317
02:04:58.051 --> 02:05:01.020
uh,
he's,
uh,
he wrote Robo Apocalypse,

2318
02:05:01.170 --> 02:05:04.320
which is a novel about a robotic insurrection against men,

2319
02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:07.440
basically like a terminator type movie that Steven Spielberg is going to turn

2320
02:05:07.441 --> 02:05:09.990
into a movie,
but he's a technology expert.

2321
02:05:09.991 --> 02:05:12.660
We're going to talk about military robots,
privacy issues,

2322
02:05:12.661 --> 02:05:13.950
artificial intelligence,

2323
02:05:13.951 --> 02:05:18.630
the future on how long until we start incorporating robotics technology into our

2324
02:05:18.631 --> 02:05:21.930
own bodies.
It's going to get freaky.
So that's tomorrow,

12,

2350
02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:52.260
I will likely be there for that,

Yo.
Um,

2352
02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:02.360
thanks to a on it.com go to [inaudible] and it and use the code name Rogan and

2353
02:07:03.091 --> 02:07:06.030
you will save 10% off any an all supplements.

2354
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:08.340
If you use the code word Sandy,

2355
02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:13.430
we will take that 10% and donate it to hurricane relief.
Um,
we uh,

2356
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:16.540
decided to go with the Salvation Army because we find that,
um,

2357
02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:21.660
in this instance they're giving 100% of the donations to,
uh,

2358
02:07:21.690 --> 02:07:25.320
to hurricane relief where some of them,
it gets down to as low as like 30%.

2359
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:26.370
That's kind of important.

2360
02:07:26.371 --> 02:07:30.920
Like when you know how much of your money actually goes to the,
to the,

2361
02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:35.010
not to the infrastructure of the charity,
but actually goes to help.

2362
02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:38.860
Um,

It's fucking amazing.

2368
02:07:54.731 --> 02:07:56.200
I can't wait until that one's gets released.

2369
02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:00.340
And a couple of shirts that he designed a that were based on posters for a

2370
02:08:00.341 --> 02:08:04.790
Chicago Gig and uh,
Atlanta Gig with Joey Diaz and Duncan Trussell.
Alright.
