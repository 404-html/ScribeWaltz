00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll usually just go out and they wake up or something or just changes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this kills you problems or breaking apart.</v>

10
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>That seems like more like what it would feel like.</v>

11
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.451
<v Speaker 1>Why is he,</v>

12
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:44.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

13
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:45.644
<v Speaker 1>I called your meatloaf.</v>

14
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.180
<v Speaker 1>He had his friend Jack had come back from beyond the grave and it was all</v>

15
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>covered in like rotten flesh news,</v>

16
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>calling a meatloaf,</v>

17
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>just having visions as he was turning into a werewolf,</v>

18
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>like leading up to it.</v>

19
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.433
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

21
00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

22
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.261
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

23
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>He was being visited by dead people that the Werewolf killed.</v>

24
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So it was his friend Jack First,</v>

25
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>and then it was until the blood line is broken,</v>

26
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 1>those people are stuck in like a purgatory state and only the Werewolf can see</v>

27
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>them and they're all just rotting.</v>

28
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>And so they become like these talking skeletons.</v>

29
