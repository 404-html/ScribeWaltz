<v Speaker 1>They have a bunch of proprietary blends </v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't like it,</v>

48
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:24.551
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way to make it as clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible that I am much more </v>

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.620
<v Speaker 1>concerned with you not feeling ripped </v>
<v Speaker 1>off than I am with making money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a real product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

51
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

52
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>It works for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain gives me like,</v>

53
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.790
<v Speaker 1>like a nice little peppy feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:42.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

55
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:47.081
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that stuff's a lot of people from </v>

56
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:47.081
<v Speaker 1>taking from taking drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>some people like to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it might not work.</v>

58
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be out $400 or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

59
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to take a chance on </v>

60
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might not work if I get some guarantee </v>

61
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>that'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be pretty good.</v>

62
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>We like drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean?</v>

63
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like any sort of like,</v>

64
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancers or like,</v>

65
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>or like whatever you need for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

66
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What drugs do people take a while?</v>

67
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>This is nothing like a drug though.</v>

68
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>None of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

69
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that would be close is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new mood,</v>

70
00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>the five htp supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a serotonin booster.</v>

71
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.540
<v Speaker 1>But even that it would be like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtlest of smiles that permeates your </v>

72
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

73
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever used five htp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't do much for me.</v>

74
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Didn't do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you taking the Neal Brennan size doses?</v>

75
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was taking a lot.</v>

76
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:33.091
<v Speaker 1>He said he just goes over the he </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fucking recommended da is </v>

78
00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack said and he just goes nuts.</v>

79
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

80
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I thought it was really fascinating</v>

81
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:42.210
<v Speaker 1>that he said that his doctor who had him</v>
<v Speaker 1>on some sort of an antidepressant,</v>

82
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.250
<v Speaker 1>she told him to get off the five htp </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was essentially like taking </v>

83
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.481
<v Speaker 1>to antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something where it can react </v>

84
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:51.481
<v Speaker 1>really badly with ssrs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's like happened.</v>

86
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Hundred precedence of that are Ssri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can,</v>

87
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>it can cause you some weird overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the SSRI?</v>

88
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:03.031
<v Speaker 1>What is the actual name for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like serotonin something </v>

89
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>reinhibitor ads or delete serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard,</v>

91
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also Brian,</v>

92
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>you read something about the dangers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>five htp online,</v>

93
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was that about?</v>

94
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Somebody sent me this because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday's podcast where I've been </v>

95
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.541
<v Speaker 2>talking about my arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we've talked to the doctor and he </v>

96
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:22.541
<v Speaker 2>said it's probably from podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

97
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Practicing.</v>

98
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 2>And then he made that song all about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>weak I was.</v>

99
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I know he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

100
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.130
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there was somebody set that on a web md </v>

102
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.110
<v Speaker 2>that five htp might be unsafe and not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it because people who.</v>

103
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.440
<v Speaker 2>There's been reports that people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it are getting a serious </v>

104
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.261
<v Speaker 2>condition with extreme muscle tenderness</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Myalgia and blood abnorm nor </v>

105
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 2>modalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those words.</v>

106
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.190
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

107
00:04:59.191 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.760
<v Speaker 2>said that you shouldn't take it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking it's a contaminant.</v>

109
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.350
<v Speaker 2>And and some five htp products and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

110
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.210
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not five htp,</v>

111
00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:13.211
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it pretty much starts like sour milk </v>

112
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>going around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And we're to,</v>

115

<v Speaker 1>I'll find out what the fuck that is.</v>

116
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.590

162
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.200
<v Speaker 4>a one for extreme endurance exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're a person who likes to do </v>

164
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.720
<v Speaker 4>this shroom tech sport is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a quarter's eps,</v>

165
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:28.420
<v Speaker 4>mushroom and 12 supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great for energy.</v>

166
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

167
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Chinese Olympic team was the first </v>

168
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.781
<v Speaker 4>to start using it like the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it's like a mushroom that </v>

169
00:07:36.781 --> 00:07:37.620
<v Speaker 4>enhances your body's ability to absorb </v>
<v Speaker 4>air.</v>

170
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

171
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.680
<v Speaker 4>You were in high altitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they noticed that cattle were </v>

172
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.821
<v Speaker 4>eating these mushrooms and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were much more lively so people started </v>

173
00:07:47.821 --> 00:07:47.821
<v Speaker 4>experimenting with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a mushroom pills.</v>

174
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.000
<v Speaker 4>You thought it was talking about</v>

175
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 3>bill must have those natural mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 3>because silicide Oh,</v>

176
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 3>that's done mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's dangerous.</v>

177
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friends,</v>

178
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.490
<v Speaker 3>my friends taken them and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just great man.</v>

179
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.070
<v Speaker 3>You don't get the upset stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

180
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Everything else was saying it's like thc</v>
<v Speaker 3>pills,</v>

181
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:06.210
<v Speaker 3>but it feel like then you're not working</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it as part of the mushroom </v>

182
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:06.210
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to get the dry,</v>

183
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:06.210
<v Speaker 3>the gifts,</v>

184
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.040
<v Speaker 4>you can eat that shitty body of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to try it.</v>

185
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where it gets them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is nothing like that.</v>

186
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.280
<v Speaker 4>This is just for endurance and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>another one for immune scald.</v>

187
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.130
<v Speaker 4>Trim Tech Immune,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a great one.</v>

188
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a really interesting way it works </v>
<v Speaker 4>is we explain.</v>

189
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:23.470
<v Speaker 4>Explained to me is there's this mushroom</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when your body detects it,</v>

190
00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 4>your body thinks that it's some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be a bug,</v>

191
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 4>like might be a cold or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

192
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.470
<v Speaker 4>so your immune system fires up for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight that never comes.</v>

193
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.180
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

194
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:36.190
<v Speaker 4>So this mushroom somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that tricks your body into thinking </v>

195
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.921
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nothing happens and so your immune </v>

196
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:38.921
<v Speaker 4>system fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

197
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:43.660
<v Speaker 4>pumps up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it pumps up for a fight and there's no </v>

198
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.031
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it really helps your immune system </v>

199
00:08:46.031 --> 00:08:46.031
<v Speaker 4>ward off colds quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

200
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in.</v>

201
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.380
<v Speaker 4>I think here's something to look into to</v>
<v Speaker 4>folks is probiotics I think are very </v>

202
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that a lot of people</v>

203
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probiotics are live cultures.</v>

204
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like acidophilus or Kombucha is my </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite.</v>

205
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I drink that Kombucha Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A drink that tea every day.</v>

206
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I really firmly believe it keeps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>from getting sick.</v>

207
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Oxidants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antioxidants.</v>

208
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

209
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a little different though.</v>

210
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>This is a live culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live culture is actually living things.</v>

211
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's an organism you're taking into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body that actually fights off bad shit.</v>

212
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it works.</v>

213
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.990
<v Speaker 1>This organism works symbiotically with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

214
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Does I don't know mushrooms or is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

215
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

216
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

217
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:32.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them will fucking kill you and </v>

218
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.210
<v Speaker 1>there's mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck up and eat the wrong ones.</v>

219
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.901
<v Speaker 1>You'll have instant liver failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's some serious failure </v>

220
00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms out there and somebody had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find that out,</v>

221
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:42.351
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had to eat those things and </v>

222
00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:44.841
<v Speaker 1>then they had like everybody stand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch them and then 20 minutes later </v>

223
00:09:44.841 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking black skinned and foaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the mouth and his whole body spasming</v>

224
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

225
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>now we know that mushroom is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking eat that.</v>

226
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>And they had to know this by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when there was no books.</v>

227
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write it down.</v>

228
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 1>You remember how honeysuckles we're okay</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat.</v>

229
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:02.030
<v Speaker 1>But that other barrier weren't what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember honeysuckles.</v>

230
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

231
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't pull the tick them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for them recently.</v>

232

244
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.390
<v Speaker 5>trying to get a smuggler for</v>

245
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Renzi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Rip Missouri for showing.</v>

246
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.420
<v Speaker 1>First I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find.</v>

247
00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:57.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was one all my favorites if you </v>

248
00:10:57.421 --> 00:10:59.230
<v Speaker 1>guys want to take part in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then somebody was like,</v>

249
00:10:59.231 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just pick them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all over really.</v>

250
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.690
<v Speaker 1>And I realized like I trust my drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealer over what we find in nature.</v>

251
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy came up to me after a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the creepiest dudes ever.</v>

252
00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:10.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just sweaty and weird and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he gave me a bag of mushrooms.</v>

253
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.220
<v Speaker 1>He man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked these myself.</v>

254
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

255
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I would fucking take your mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy face,</v>

256
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but you pick yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who you trust the regular drug.</v>

257
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird looking dude and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

258
00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:25.000
<v Speaker 1>you trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trust people who know people who are</v>

259
00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:26.330
<v Speaker 1>growing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

260
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you got to get into the Matrix of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>where to get the mushrooms.</v>

261
00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:32.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other ones are super poisoned.</v>

262
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

263
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicide mushrooms look than any other </v>

264
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:40.390
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

265
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>by the time I get them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all dried out and we'll just </v>

266
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:44.500
<v Speaker 1>take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen one.</v>

267
00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think out in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that red top.</v>

268
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that man that was on my </v>

269
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 1>property in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did you take that?</v>

270
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:52.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

271
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I just took pictures</v>

272
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.740
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

273
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 4>That was a red top of the dot with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the spots with the whites.</v>

274
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:59.640
<v Speaker 4>Mario brother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ones the emoney to Ms Dot Darian.</v>

275
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the one that.</v>

276
00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that the Marco Alegra?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

277
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:08.341
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that's why that's a very funky </v>

278
00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:08.341
<v Speaker 4>mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a really different mushroom.</v>

279
00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have silicide been in it.</v>

280
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 4>It works in a completely different way </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your body.</v>

281
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 4>It's a psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's completely different and it's </v>

282
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 4>seasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's variable genetically.</v>

283
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 4>It's variable from different climates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we're getting in America,</v>

284
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:23.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe is the same am miscarry </v>
<v Speaker 4>a mushroom.</v>

285
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a been a lot of debate on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>amongst all those psychedelic kind of </v>

286
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.381
<v Speaker 4>sewers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those people was terrence Mckenna type </v>

287
00:12:33.381 --> 00:12:33.381
<v Speaker 4>fellows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

288
00:12:33.381 --> 00:12:37.750
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the reasons why a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people have taken it and it doesn't do </v>

289
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took it once and it didn't do shit.</v>

290
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I took it with Doug Stanhope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not.</v>

291
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

292
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 4>Yon made it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

293
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John's a fucking.</v>

294
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.300
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a real head.</v>

295
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.110
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

296
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 4>he would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he did the,</v>

297
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 4>he did the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did it all right.</v>

298
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 4>But it just wasn't getting us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then was it when you had,</v>

299
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.780
<v Speaker 4>did you eat anytime near that time that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you took it?</v>

300
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.370
<v Speaker 4>That exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

301
00:12:59.371 --> 00:12:59.810
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

302
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.140
<v Speaker 4>We did it the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did it the right way,</v>

303
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 4>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

304
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:08.020
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we mixed it with psilocybin mushrooms </v>

305
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.680
<v Speaker 4>dug through and some syllabi assignment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we went to the fucking center of </v>

306
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.730
<v Speaker 4>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like mixing them together was a,</v>

307
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 4>was a wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a total mind fuck.</v>

308
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.000
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a,</v>

309
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:22.020
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that they believe is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Soma Soma is,</v>

310
00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:27.471
<v Speaker 4>was some sort of a mixture and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about with great reverence and </v>

311
00:13:27.471 --> 00:13:27.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

312
00:13:27.471 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Hindu texts and Soma is greater than</v>

313
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:32.370
<v Speaker 4>Brahma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>greater than the bill so much.</v>

314
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:32.820
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

315
00:13:32.821 --> 00:13:33.060
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

316
00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:33.670
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

317
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.530
<v Speaker 4>that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just stole the word.</v>

318
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.360
<v Speaker 4>Soma is like the greatest psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever apparently.</v>

319
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 4>So what does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know.</v>

320
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 4>That's the craziest thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's written with so much love,</v>

321
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:47.740
<v Speaker 4>but somehow somewhere they lost the </v>
<v Speaker 4>formula and nobody knows what it is.</v>

322
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.040
<v Speaker 4>So it's all debated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Gordon Wasson thought it was </v>

323
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.040
<v Speaker 4>dominated with scary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

324
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.320
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was siliciden.</v>

325
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.430
<v Speaker 4>They think it might be a common atory </v>
<v Speaker 4>drug with psilocybin mixed in with some </v>

326
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.181
<v Speaker 4>other stuff and some people think it </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be psilocybin and Amany to </v>

327
00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:03.181
<v Speaker 4>miscarry or they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>miscarriage.</v>

328
00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:04.530
<v Speaker 4>How does that hit you or what does that </v>
<v Speaker 4>do for you?</v>

329
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on where you get it.</v>

330
00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's getting,</v>

331
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I don't,</v>

332
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:12.730
<v Speaker 4>I can't speak from personal experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what I got didn't really work.</v>

333
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's hard to tell because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a few hours and it really </v>

334
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.750
<v Speaker 4>hadn't changed.</v>

335
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.630
<v Speaker 4>But without Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

336
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

337
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what form.</v>

338
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:28.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what part of the world you </v>
<v Speaker 4>got to get it.</v>

339
00:14:28.571 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 4>It's variable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

340
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.530
<v Speaker 4>that's the issue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not always psychedelic,</v>

341
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 4>but what it is is Santa Claus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking,</v>

342
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.680
<v Speaker 4>the image of Santa Claus being this red </v>
<v Speaker 4>and white guy,</v>

343
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the image of the trees underneath the,</v>

344
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:42.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pine,</v>

345
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

346
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:46.660
<v Speaker 4>the presence underneath the pine cones </v>
<v Speaker 4>are the pine trees.</v>

347
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has a microrisal relationship with </v>

348
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 4>birch trees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

349
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 4>it literally grows under these</v>

350
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.190
<v Speaker 1>fucking Christmas trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it grows.</v>

351
00:14:54.191 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 1>But wrapped in shiny colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

352
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.940
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shiny as fuck Eddie Griffin </v>

353
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:00.940
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

354
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.120
<v Speaker 1>but it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is.</v>

355
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:07.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole Christmas presents under the </v>

356
00:15:07.121 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 1>tree thing is directly related to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanita to miscarry mushroom.</v>

357
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It is red and white and the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive these mushrooms out,</v>

358
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:14.330
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they hang them over the fireplace.</v>

359
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.900
<v Speaker 1>That's why people have red and white </v>
<v Speaker 1>stockings hanging over their fireplace.</v>

360
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck else out to dry them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

361
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is,</v>

362
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.900
<v Speaker 1>so that it's become this stocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

363
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.990
<v Speaker 1>What would it used to be his red and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white mushrooms hanging underneath your </v>

364
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.450
<v Speaker 1>fireplace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the proof of that?</v>

365
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.070
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of poop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of proof.</v>

366
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 1>There's not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the old,</v>

367
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to all the old Christmas </v>

368
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all have mushrooms in them.</v>

369
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbology,</v>

370
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 1>big emanate a mushroom in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have Christmas.</v>

371
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.920
<v Speaker 1>All the old Christmas cards at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas.</v>

372
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>They know more than the elves are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you see when you take mushrooms,</v>

373
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.880
<v Speaker 1>if you take enough and then on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

374
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 1>the elves are always playing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

375
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>They always have this Aminay to miscarry</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mushroom and Santa Claus.</v>

376
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>If you go back and look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

378
00:15:58.011 --> 00:15:59.600
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought cola made up Santa Claus.</v>

379
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

380
00:16:00.691 --> 00:16:01.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

381
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.920
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

382
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:09.020
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was claimed.</v>

383
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>But then proof became proof that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an artist from a,</v>

384
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 1>at least I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

385
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 1>a decade or two before that who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributed to making Santa Claus Red and</v>

386
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:23.501
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought that Santa Claus was one </v>

387
00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:23.501
<v Speaker 1>color and then it was made red and white</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of,</v>

388
00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:28.331
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of Coca Cola cocreated the </v>

389
00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

433
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:18.621
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out the agents of the </v>

434
00:18:18.621 --> 00:18:18.621
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these,</v>

<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 1>these are like ancient fucking Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 1>card.</v>

437
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.930
<v Speaker 1>I see Santa Claus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not see it?</v>

438
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just like,</v>

439
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 1>why is this not talked about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

440
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:33.190
<v Speaker 1>like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this not on regular TV news?</v>

442
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the Tower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven of holidays,</v>

443
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 1>posture muscles are just in it for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many correlations.</v>

444
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to the connection.</v>

445
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they drive these fucking things </v>

446
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>out is twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

447
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.640
<v Speaker 1>they hang them on the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put them in the branches.</v>

448
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So they drive by the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or b,</v>

449
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 1>they hang them under the fireplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they do?</v>

450
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.800
<v Speaker 1>You see fucking stockings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hang on the train,</v>

451
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:05.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably literally grow under the </v>

452
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.661
<v Speaker 1>same tree that we use as a Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree and they are shiny packages and if </v>

453
00:19:08.661 --> 00:19:13.521
<v Speaker 1>you get them from the right place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently they make you trip the fuck </v>

454
00:19:13.521 --> 00:19:15.420
<v Speaker 1>out and then their response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mushroom that they believe is</v>

455
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

456
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.010
<v Speaker 1>the writings in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the sacred mushroom in the cross.</v>

457
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 1>The laminated must carry mushroom is on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cover of the sacred mushroom and the</v>

458
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:28.041
<v Speaker 1>cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes sense to me that if </v>

459
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:30.051
<v Speaker 1>scholars believe that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between this mushroom and </v>

460
00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:33.621
<v Speaker 1>religious texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course there was a connection </v>

461
00:19:33.621 --> 00:19:36.651
<v Speaker 1>between this mushroom and Santa Claus </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you add up all the things that </v>

462
00:19:36.651 --> 00:19:39.030
<v Speaker 1>line up as far as like hanging over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fireplace and putting it on trees,</v>

463
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 1>it totally could be possible.</v>

464
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:45.300
<v Speaker 1>So is if you go to the encyclopedia </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britannica headquarters in wherever that</v>

465
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:50.301
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Wisconsin and you go through them </v>

466
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:50.301
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

467
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:52.500
<v Speaker 1>what is this Christmas to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you guys have about the mushroom</v>

468
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.120
<v Speaker 1>thing that they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

469
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Get it out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippie.</v>

470
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

471
00:19:55.861 --> 00:20:00.861
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you think that they're not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to it to incorporate any sort of</v>

472
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.390
<v Speaker 1>illegal drug ideology into their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

473
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:09.650
<v Speaker 1>their work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably just would ignore it even </v>

474
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.931
<v Speaker 1>if there's a lot of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think sometimes that people that </v>

475
00:20:11.931 --> 00:20:14.511
<v Speaker 1>do a lot of mushrooms try to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections with everything and </v>

476
00:20:14.511 --> 00:20:16.890
<v Speaker 1>definitely they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what my judge.</v>

477
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.570
<v Speaker 1>If I had to judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if this was a game,</v>

478
00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:19.950
<v Speaker 1>she said that's what my judgment would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like.</v>

479
00:20:19.951 --> 00:20:24.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just some hippie that made this </v>

480
00:20:24.951 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>awesome connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great story and that's what.</v>

481
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:26.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm thinking.</v>

482
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a dumb way to think why.</v>

483
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Because scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sold on anything.</v>

484
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sold that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm definitely not sold on you just </v>

485
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.060
<v Speaker 1>talking off your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

486
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.791
<v Speaker 1>I'm just putting a counterpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The counterpoint to a fucking guy who </v>

487
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 1>was a scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

488
00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Marco Allegro studied the Tennessee </v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars that say the exact,</v>

489
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 1>not the only ones that do are religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

490
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.170
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

491
00:20:49.171 --> 00:20:50.640
<v Speaker 4>But who says that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Religious.</v>

492
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:56.160
<v Speaker 4>He was an encyclopedia Britannica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about soccer,</v>

493
00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just saying that going about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dead Sea scrolls wouldn't even been </v>

494
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.280
<v Speaker 4>encyclopedic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't it be a part of the part of the</v>

495
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Christmas originally Pagan holiday and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be part of that Pagan </v>

496
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 4>holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Worse.</v>

497
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 4>That ritual should definitely go over </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

498
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.740
<v Speaker 4>They use those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the.</v>

499
00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.740
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real question is what's the elves?</v>

500
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.320
<v Speaker 4>What's with the fucking mushrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these Christmas pictures.</v>

501
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.800
<v Speaker 4>What's with the correlations?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do these mushrooms exist?</v>

502
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:26.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in why do they coincide with this </v>

503
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:26.030
<v Speaker 4>holiday?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the big deal?</v>

504
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 4>But the big deal is these people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>tripping their fucking balls off.</v>

505
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

506
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 4>And it became somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets turned into a,</v>

507
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 4>a guy coming down the chimney and given </v>
<v Speaker 4>you presence.</v>

508
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.060
<v Speaker 4>What it was is this was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is some shit they found under the </v>

509
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.731
<v Speaker 4>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's much more likely to me if you've </v>

510
00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:43.701
<v Speaker 4>got to fucking plant that makes you trip</v>
<v Speaker 4>balls and an ancient people find out </v>

511
00:21:43.701 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They worshiped that shit.</v>

512
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.860
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes like a huge part of their </v>

513
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.051
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if your world was the </v>

514
00:21:52.051 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 4>regular world of people that live before</v>
<v Speaker 4>books?</v>

515
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're barely civilized.</v>

516
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.890
<v Speaker 4>Barely got it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just getting by everyday big gets</v>

517
00:21:58.891 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Speaker 4>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody know what the fuck was going on.</v>

518
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:03.520
<v Speaker 4>There was no doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just died,</v>

519
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:06.190
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just gave you some leaves to chew on</v>

520
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 4>and usually just fucking died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if they found something like this?</v>

521
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.310
<v Speaker 4>If they found that there was some </v>
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms and you would eat them and all</v>

522
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:17.311
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden you'd be lying in a field </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fucking spiraling through the </v>

523
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.640
<v Speaker 4>universe and the most wild ride of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

524
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of joy and ecstasy of your life,</v>

525
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.050
<v Speaker 4>and then he would.</v>

526
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.710
<v Speaker 4>You would want to fucking praise that </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

527
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.000
<v Speaker 4>You would want them to make that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

528
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.960
<v Speaker 4>You would want to create a holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd want to make it a part of your,</v>

529
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your everyday life.</v>

530
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.570
<v Speaker 4>You would be worshiping it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

531
00:22:36.571 --> 00:22:41.571
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the feeling behind a lot of </v>

532
00:22:41.571 --> 00:22:42.040
<v Speaker 4>people with why there was all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>cattle worship in the ancient world,</v>

533
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because no one can understand that.</v>

534
00:22:44.501 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 4>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you have these?</v>

535
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.410
<v Speaker 4>Like really aggressive primates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did worship cats.</v>

536
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:55.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they didn't worship him like people </v>

537
00:22:55.411 --> 00:22:55.411
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Hindus worship the cows.</v>

538
00:22:55.411 --> 00:22:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Cows are cows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just leave them alone.</v>

539
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 4>No Man eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't eat them.</v>

540
00:23:00.041 --> 00:23:03.550
<v Speaker 4>They consider them sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They consider them a site.</v>

541
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

542
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 4>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something cool.</v>

543
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:11.491
<v Speaker 4>They consider them something cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that has to do with the </v>

544
00:23:11.491 --> 00:23:13.270
<v Speaker 4>media says about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my mushrooms growing in the cow shit</v>

545
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.840
<v Speaker 3>is what we competed has about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About what Christmas is the relation for</v>

546
00:23:17.841 --> 00:23:19.300
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Santa Claus.</v>

547
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

548
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.440
<v Speaker 3>flyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Garrick's peer.</v>

549
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what flight algorithms are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Garrick's.</v>

550
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.690
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual plant.</v>

551
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:26.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

552
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Up here on Christmas cards and New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Year's cards from around the world as a </v>

553
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 3>symbol of good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ethno botanists.</v>

554
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:37.471
<v Speaker 3>Jonathan suggested the idea of Santa </v>
<v Speaker 3>Claus and tradition of hang stockings </v>

555
00:23:37.471 --> 00:23:37.990
<v Speaker 3>over the fireplace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They essentially,</v>

556
00:23:37.991 --> 00:23:42.991
<v Speaker 3>upon this mushroom itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that have had </v>

557
00:23:42.991 --> 00:23:44.290
<v Speaker 3>proposed in the red and white color </v>
<v Speaker 3>scheme.</v>

558
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:49.291
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a Santa Claus related to the </v>

559
00:23:49.291 --> 00:23:49.291
<v Speaker 3>mushroom.</v>

560
00:23:49.291 --> 00:23:49.291
<v Speaker 1>He also draws on parallels with flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>reindeer.</v>

561
00:23:49.291 --> 00:23:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Randy had been reported to consume the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom and prance around in an </v>

562
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.470
<v Speaker 1>intoxicated manner afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wild.</v>

563
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what what's up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but flying reindeer,</v>

564
00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.080
<v Speaker 1>reindeer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love emoney to miscarry mushrooms so </v>

565
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:02.080
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when people have these mushrooms and</v>

566
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>they trip out the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

567
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 1>they do well when people will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing about Avalina Mascara,</v>

568
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.600
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms is about recycling the urine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way to really trip your balls off is</v>

569
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 1>apparently a lot of whatever it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive inside the mushroom is.</v>

570
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.680
<v Speaker 1>It passes through your body and into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your urine and if you drink your urine </v>

571
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>kicks the whole experience to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

572
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean while you're on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you're tripping balls,</v>

573
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

574
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:34.601
<v Speaker 1>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who told me who did it said it </v>

575
00:24:34.601 --> 00:24:34.601
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

576
00:24:34.601 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 1>It was like he was tripping and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>

577
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:36.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have to pay,</v>

578
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.760
<v Speaker 1>you got to drink your pee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

579
00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:42.761
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to drink my pm already tripping </v>

580
00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:42.761
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>

581
00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:42.761
<v Speaker 1>This is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is good.</v>

582
00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:46.520
<v Speaker 1>And he drank his penis like through yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin mushrooms.</v>

583
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the case and we need to miscarry </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

584
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

585
00:24:50.691 --> 00:24:55.691
<v Speaker 1>don't trust her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just the mushrooms talking to </v>

586
00:24:55.691 --> 00:24:55.890
<v Speaker 1>not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Shaman talking.</v>

587
00:24:55.891 --> 00:24:57.890
<v Speaker 1>That's like the the ancient tradition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

588
00:24:57.891 --> 00:25:00.950
<v Speaker 1>If that's how you take it to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>level while you're in the middle of your</v>

589
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:04.070
<v Speaker 1>mushroom experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd drink your urine and whatever it is</v>

590
00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.730
<v Speaker 1>still listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Psilocybin,</v>

591
00:25:05.731 --> 00:25:06.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's passed through.</v>

592
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that the technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>components of it,</v>

593
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:12.580
<v Speaker 1>but apparently talking to several people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who've done this but this guy says,</v>

594
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.970
<v Speaker 1>is that if Santa Claus had one eye or if</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic urine to be part of his legend,</v>

595
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.820
<v Speaker 1>it'd be way easier to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

596
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.920
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's dispute because like </v>

597
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:23.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not super clear.</v>

598
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

599
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible that there was an </v>

600
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.631
<v Speaker 1>article about in the magazine Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday Times in 1980 and the new </v>

601
00:25:31.671 --> 00:25:33.200
<v Speaker 1>scientist and intensity to six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are,</v>

602
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.740
<v Speaker 1>those are legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

603
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.140
<v Speaker 1>well it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:41.141
<v Speaker 1>this is not my wacky idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an idea that's been kicked </v>

605
00:25:41.141 --> 00:25:41.141
<v Speaker 1>around for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People believe it,</v>

606
00:25:41.141 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

607
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:47.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're serious scholars that </v>

608
00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 1>believe in this silly idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

609
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:53.350
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of it being illegal is </v>

610
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>what's the most fascinating thing to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.870
<v Speaker 1>these mushrooms real legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is a,</v>

612
00:25:56.871 --> 00:26:01.871
<v Speaker 1>this is somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some person has decided to pass some </v>

613
00:26:01.871 --> 00:26:02.840
<v Speaker 1>sort of a law saying that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience this.</v>

614
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.200
<v Speaker 1>That's bad for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was walking out of a pot store once,</v>

615
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 1>early on at Zen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

616
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I still felt like it's like cool that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having drugs and I still the cop on </v>

617
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:13.540
<v Speaker 1>the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

618
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:13.540
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>

619
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding my truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized my other hand,</v>

620
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I had a bag of mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

621
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this I got to try not to be so weird.</v>

622
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 1>You'd fucking Dork walking under this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree with mushrooms in your hand.</v>

623
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just live in that crazy comedy </v>

624
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:28.450
<v Speaker 1>lifeson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

625
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.810
<v Speaker 1>you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care in la,</v>

626
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 1>but I hope it stays this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

627
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it's the real issue is the federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

628
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could find one cool spot and if </v>

629
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:41.080
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.931
<v Speaker 1>supported states rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could find a cool spot where we can </v>

631
00:26:43.931 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>make pretty much everything legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all got together</v>

632
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 4>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

633
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:48.500
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna have one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clarity state is a state where murders,</v>

634
00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 4>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crime theft,</v>

635
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:51.240
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

636
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:53.430
<v Speaker 4>That's all illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arson.</v>

637
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.220
<v Speaker 4>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

638
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 4>The rest of it shut up and the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it just shut the fuck up.</v>

639
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:01.050
<v Speaker 4>There's too many God damn laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>

640
00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:06.051
<v Speaker 4>This is how it's going to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is where the money's going to go </v>

641
00:27:06.051 --> 00:27:08.241
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be legal and this will </v>

642
00:27:08.241 --> 00:27:08.241
<v Speaker 4>be regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

643
00:27:08.241 --> 00:27:11.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to buy in the store will then </v>

644
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.430
<v Speaker 4>you'll know it's pure and it's tested by</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government.</v>

645
00:27:11.431 --> 00:27:13.560
<v Speaker 4>That's where the government can help out</v>
<v Speaker 4>test mushrooms.</v>

646
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.030
<v Speaker 4>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to help out,</v>

647
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 4>you want to really be of service to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

648
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.700
<v Speaker 4>This is what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get rid of some of the government job</v>

649
00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 4>at John Hopkins Study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

650
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:23.670
<v Speaker 4>And we bring the John Hopkins Study said</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people taking mushrooms,</v>

651
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.630
<v Speaker 4>even just one experience significantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>affected them for decades,</v>

652
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.900
<v Speaker 4>significantly affected their </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>

653
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:30.900
<v Speaker 4>change it for the better.</v>

654
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:36.400
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know psychedelic experience has </v>

655
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.361
<v Speaker 4>changed me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know every time I take them when I </v>

656
00:27:38.361 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 4>have like thoughts of what I need to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>right or what I'm doing wrong or what's,</v>

657
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:46.250
<v Speaker 4>what's fucking with me or that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are just jolts of reality that you</v>

658
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:50.400
<v Speaker 4>don't get unless you take a psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

659
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.840
<v Speaker 4>you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get,</v>

660
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 4>like when you meditate outside you </v>
<v Speaker 4>really easily.</v>

661
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 4>You could get pretty deep when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditating.</v>

662
00:27:58.411 --> 00:27:59.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm not above,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

663
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:04.910
<v Speaker 4>the idea that some people can get to </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic states naturally because </v>

664
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:05.580
<v Speaker 4>it's been written about by so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

665
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:07.650
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a discipline issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just like,</v>

666
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 4>like you could tell someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

667
00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:10.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

668
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.940
<v Speaker 4>I could teach you martial arts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could go and kick somebody's ass and</v>

669
00:28:14.941 --> 00:28:19.941
<v Speaker 4>then you're like really short and then I</v>
<v Speaker 4>give you like one lesson and throw you </v>

670
00:28:19.941 --> 00:28:21.750
<v Speaker 4>in there and the guy like Marcella </v>
<v Speaker 4>Garcia and you just get manhandled.</v>

671
00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could never fucking do this because I </v>

672
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.361
<v Speaker 4>don't think it's a one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think a lot of people that </v>

673
00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:32.210
<v Speaker 4>would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you think is possible due to </v>

674
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 4>meditation is based on your level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation.</v>

675
00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:34.170
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how deep have you taken it?</v>

676
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.660
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How relaxed do you get?</v>

677
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.180
<v Speaker 4>How centered do you get when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditate?</v>

678
00:28:39.181 --> 00:28:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Because some people get super distracted</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it never gets more than A.</v>

679
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It never gets more than a surface.</v>

680
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.790
<v Speaker 4>Sort of like a relaxation real deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With mushrooms I take a little bit like </v>

681
00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.040
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the universal truths sort of hold </v>

682
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 4>onto it barely for like a second or two </v>
<v Speaker 4>or like a day.</v>

683
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:58.250
<v Speaker 4>But then it's like the more I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more I can bring back and remember </v>

684
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.250
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

685
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.730
<v Speaker 4>this thing I gotta write all about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

686
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.100
<v Speaker 4>it's always humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Humbling.</v>

687
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

688
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't matter what you do.</v>

689
00:29:05.651 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 4>Once you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you do your,</v>

690
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:09.580
<v Speaker 4>you have intent and you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

691
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 4>will and you can spread positive energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

692
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 4>you do matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you matter.</v>

693
00:29:14.431 --> 00:29:19.431
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn this is a lot of us know and </v>

694
00:29:19.431 --> 00:29:21.210
<v Speaker 4>we're all a part of one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we all matter,</v>

695
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Speaker 4>then you matter as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that you don't matter,</v>

696
00:29:23.401 --> 00:29:26.940
<v Speaker 4>but God damn it's big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking giant.</v>

697
00:29:26.941 --> 00:29:29.940
<v Speaker 4>It's all encompassing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just your house,</v>

698
00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:34.941
<v Speaker 4>it's not just your car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just your street or your </v>

699
00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the whole fucking universe.</v>

700
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:38.250
<v Speaker 4>And it's all together in one giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking soup.</v>

701
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.980
<v Speaker 4>We just can't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just can't feel.</v>

702
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 4>We feel like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

703
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>there's distance between us and Mars </v>
<v Speaker 1>does no distance.</v>

704
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Everything between this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is something there.</v>

705
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's dark matter or shit you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't see or stuff we haven't </v>

706
00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.991
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is nowhere where there's not </v>

707
00:29:57.991 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

708
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:03.091
<v Speaker 1>even in a vacuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something if there's something </v>

709
00:30:03.091 --> 00:30:03.630
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Subatomic,</v>

710
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.880
<v Speaker 1>whether it's we are connected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything everywhere and that is </v>

711
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:14.881
<v Speaker 1>impossible to recognize without some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a full blown psychedelic </v>

712
00:30:14.881 --> 00:30:19.561
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes something like that to feel it </v>

713
00:30:19.561 --> 00:30:22.530
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise it's just a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>words because I thought all those words </v>

714
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:22.530
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

715
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought all of those words like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

716
00:30:23.261 --> 00:30:28.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of corrupting for all kind of </v>

717
00:30:28.261 --> 00:30:28.261
<v Speaker 1>connected and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think yeah,</v>

718
00:30:28.261 --> 00:30:32.791
<v Speaker 1>the universe is huge and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all those thoughts before </v>

719
00:30:32.791 --> 00:30:33.950
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics and I had them with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.740
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of clarity.</v>

721
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:41.190
<v Speaker 1>But there's a big difference between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it sucks you out and just </v>

722
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:45.181
<v Speaker 1>makes you seem like you're just one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in your state of so many people </v>

723
00:30:45.181 --> 00:30:49.231
<v Speaker 1>that you're just like a blip and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see time before you and after you </v>

724
00:30:49.231 --> 00:30:49.231
<v Speaker 1>when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

725
00:30:49.231 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

726
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:55.410
<v Speaker 1>It's insane to think that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have this short amount of time </v>

727
00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:00.061
<v Speaker 1>here and it seems like as the time goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and you just start figuring out what </v>

728
00:31:00.061 --> 00:31:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the fuck is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

729
00:31:00.871 --> 00:31:05.871
<v Speaker 1>like as you get to that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the thing about people </v>

730
00:31:05.871 --> 00:31:07.180
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live long enough to see the hustle.</v>

731
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.090
<v Speaker 1>We live long enough to see the bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

732
00:31:10.091 --> 00:31:11.560
<v Speaker 1>if we were Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

733
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.180
<v Speaker 1>we would all be long dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of us were not.</v>

734
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.360
<v Speaker 1>You're in your thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my forties.</v>

735
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 1>We're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were dead.</v>

736
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 1>There's no way we'd be alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally crippled.</v>

737
00:31:23.171 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 1>We'd have lion bites on our dicks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

738
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.480
<v Speaker 1>One of us will be missing an arm or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

739
00:31:28.481 --> 00:31:29.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

740
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.730
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get fucked up back then,</v>

741
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But today we can live and we live safely</v>

742
00:31:34.061 --> 00:31:39.061
<v Speaker 1>and we have enough nutrition and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating vitamins and everything and you </v>

743
00:31:39.061 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 1>live long enough to see like God damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>hustle.</v>

744
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Ten years ago they said one of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in England would live to see 100.</v>

745
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:48.470
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you learn to live in a castle </v>

746
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.101
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day like where you had the </v>

747
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:51.101
<v Speaker 1>little courtyards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little houses in between like inside the</v>

748
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:51.670
<v Speaker 1>vessel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

749
00:31:51.671 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 1>like a really big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be crazy.</v>

750
00:31:55.770 --> 00:32:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this one giant house and </v>

751
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.671
<v Speaker 1>everybody around you has little houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dumbest way to live mean </v>

752
00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:02.671
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be cool.</v>

753
00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Just to like experience it for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>three days or something.</v>

754
00:32:04.661 --> 00:32:09.661
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd like to have all those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in those little houses want to kill you </v>

755
00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:10.930
<v Speaker 1>is gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

756
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:15.931
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that if everybody else is </v>

757
00:32:15.931 --> 00:32:15.970
<v Speaker 1>starving and there's this giant house </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people that are eaten.</v>

758
00:32:15.971 --> 00:32:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Gold sandwiches.</v>

759
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Sound like you're describing Bashar </v>
<v Speaker 1>Assad.</v>

760
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Bashar Assad was a leader theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

761
00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone's starting to revolt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I stuck out the guns.</v>

762
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

763
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.820

<v Speaker 1>the whole Arab spring thing and what it </v>

764
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 1>does is nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>my death pool.</v>

766

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

767
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.280

<v Speaker 1>strange time for the whole part of the.</v>

768
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 1>They're all the internet making </v>

<v Speaker 1>the CIA had a little piece of outside </v>

777
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.070
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you shouldn't be listening.</v>

778
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the spies that are starting all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

779
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.340
<v Speaker 1>but maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

780
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.570
<v Speaker 1>that's the best way to overthrow them.</v>

781
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Get their own people to do it for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that shit don't work that way.</v>

785
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Make the new boss same as the old boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on in Iraq right </v>

786
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.671
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq apparently is just a fucking mess </v>

787
00:33:30.671 --> 00:33:30.671
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

788
00:33:30.671 --> 00:33:34.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a civil war about to break </v>

789
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.031
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they always say as soon as it </v>

790
00:33:36.031 --> 00:33:36.031
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as we left,</v>

791
00:33:36.031 --> 00:33:36.031
<v Speaker 1>I was just kind of happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

792
00:33:36.031 --> 00:33:36.031
<v Speaker 1>Course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

793
00:33:36.031 --> 00:33:36.031
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

794
00:33:36.031 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

795
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a vacuum and when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacuum someone's going to seek to fill </v>

796
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.281
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people that are </v>

797
00:33:45.281 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 1>still alive that were alive back during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Saddam era,</v>

798
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>

799
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.780
<v Speaker 1>those people are going to try to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of that bitch and then there's </v>

800
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 1>new people moving in and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the idea that,</v>

801
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the connection between Iraq and </v>

802
00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and all of our resources and</v>
<v Speaker 1>went where the fuck is this country </v>

803
00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:05.480
<v Speaker 1>going and why do we have 100 different </v>
<v Speaker 1>bases all over the country or the world.</v>

804
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we wasting our time and our </v>

805
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:10.480
<v Speaker 1>resources on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this really necessary anymore?</v>

806
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.321
<v Speaker 1>Or is this just a bunch of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have contracts and we keep giving them </v>

807
00:34:14.321 --> 00:34:15.320
<v Speaker 1>contracts because it's just what we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>always done.</v>

808
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:20.321
<v Speaker 1>And that's how they got involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they keep politicians in </v>

809
00:34:20.321 --> 00:34:20.570
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're stuck because that's.</v>

810
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.370
<v Speaker 1>It seems like what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked.</v>

811
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:28.820
<v Speaker 1>What really said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I occupied Wall Street finally sat </v>

812
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:28.820
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the problem is if you get sponsored</v>

813
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.320
<v Speaker 1>by a big corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

814
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:31.730
<v Speaker 1>they give you a bunch of money for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign,</v>

815
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:37.180
<v Speaker 1>they can effectively fire you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>withholding that money that you need to </v>

816
00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 1>get elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

817
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like good luck doing this without,</v>

818
00:34:41.531 --> 00:34:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$500,000,000</v>

819
00:34:42.611 --> 00:34:43.300
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

820
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:48.550
<v Speaker 1>in your ad budget this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or how much of that is probably a lot </v>

821
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.550
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

822
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:49.970
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

823
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:51.950
<v Speaker 2>You need to get those bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mushrooms.</v>

824
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

825
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need to do Christmas.</v>

826
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a good answer to a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting those bitches on mushrooms,</v>

827
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I tell it to eliminate people really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true either.</v>

828
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when's the last time we did some </v>

829
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:05.350

830
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:05.390
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like I did mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found something crazy.</v>

831
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a huge bag of really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and I took half of them and </v>

832
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.530
<v Speaker 2>trip my ass off hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you know,</v>

833
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.490
<v Speaker 2>super hard trip</v>

834
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 1>visual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hang on,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to get back to throw </v>

837
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.981
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where I realize everybody's </v>

838
00:35:21.981 --> 00:35:21.981
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got a super good and everybody says </v>

840
00:35:23.471 --> 00:35:25.601
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they really mean is mushrooms are </v>

841
00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:25.601
<v Speaker 1>super good.</v>

842
00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:25.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

843
00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:25.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

844
00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:25.601
<v Speaker 2>well then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>

845
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.610
<v Speaker 2>you ever got bad ones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

846
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I have the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time I took it had the </v>

847
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.171
<v Speaker 2>greatest time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second time I ate like two hours before </v>

848
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>and was just like sitting on a couch </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching time and</v>

849
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.460
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

850
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:43.461
<v Speaker 1>this is all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I took more the second time it </v>

851
00:35:43.461 --> 00:35:47.331
<v Speaker 1>was the same mushrooms and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I tripped my ass off </v>

852
00:35:47.331 --> 00:35:47.520
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't eat anything else the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole day.</v>

853
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it also could be,</v>

854
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of people getting mushrooms.</v>

855
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Actually it hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have mushrooms,</v>

856
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:57.790
<v Speaker 1>you'd set out some mold on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like food poisoning it,</v>

857
00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what's going to happen.</v>

858
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:05.901
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes you get sick from </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and that's usually because he </v>

859
00:36:05.901 --> 00:36:09.691
<v Speaker 1>had never gotten sick from barb to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time I got a billy goat stomach.</v>

860
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't eat some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never barked.</v>

861
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.450
<v Speaker 1>But my friend who gave it to me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time used to make them,</v>

862
00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.460
<v Speaker 1>her buddy was said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will get,</v>

863
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.140
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel nauseous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're gonna throw up.</v>

864
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't throw up.</v>

865
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Just sit down and look up in the air for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while.</v>

866
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:27.140
<v Speaker 1>The feeling will pass fear factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely changed my whole ability to </v>

867
00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.371
<v Speaker 1>withstand smells and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people vomit or you can handle </v>

868
00:36:31.371 --> 00:36:31.371
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm immune.</v>

869
00:36:31.371 --> 00:36:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely immune to getting sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching someone vomit,</v>

870
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I used to get.</v>

871
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I used to physically gag if I smelled </v>
<v Speaker 1>puke,</v>

872
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.230
<v Speaker 1>like I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I was getting knocked baby</v>
<v Speaker 1>was no problem for me,</v>

874
00:36:44.491 --> 00:36:45.580

<v Speaker 1>I just sat right through.</v>

875
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 1>The wind would shift and you catch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiff of it?</v>

876
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

877
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:54.200

<v Speaker 1>If you don't know it was the greatest </v>

<v Speaker 1>gag in the history of race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ari and I were there,</v>

<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But that's.</v>

894
00:37:29.511 --> 00:37:31.290
<v Speaker 1>This was a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about a different one,</v>

895
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.500

<v Speaker 1>I've seen him do some ridiculous shit </v>

896
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.650
<v Speaker 1>before this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had a bunch of their guys there </v>

<v Speaker 1>eggnog at the first place and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking like fucking gallons of it.</v>

902
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:54.810
<v Speaker 1>He's a big boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a double shot every 60 seconds.</v>

903
00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:00.170
<v Speaker 1>And he's up to like 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 glasses like chucking.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some people.</v>

906

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

908
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.860
<v Speaker 1>something because if he drank like 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>shots,</v>

909
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:12.850
<v Speaker 1>he'd be a dead man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be a dead.</v>

910
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.990
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what was your question?</v>

911
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:17.610
<v Speaker 1>When did people start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

912
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.790
<v Speaker 1>start Fokker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was the.</v>

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got up to like 70 shots.</v>

914
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was something insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>

915
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:29.991
<v Speaker 1>And he said he was going to puke and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to figure out what to do </v>

916
00:38:29.991 --> 00:38:31.690
<v Speaker 1>with the puke and just as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not think anybody would say that.</v>

917
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you have this kid leaned his </v>

918
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:37.100
<v Speaker 1>head into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>

919
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>the garbage pail and have pat throw up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his mouth.</v>

920
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I just came up with the dumbest shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever because like,</v>

921
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think anybody would say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were on edibles at the time,</v>

922
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.850
<v Speaker 1>probably put up 99 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always am if I do.</v>

923
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

924
00:38:56.411 --> 00:38:59.470
<v Speaker 1>so we were high as a kite and I never </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought anyway,</v>

925
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.020
<v Speaker 1>it was just going crazy extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well he's paying for video.</v>

1043
00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:04.280
<v Speaker 1>A video host.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1044
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:08.090
<v Speaker 1>But I tried to do it twice now and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video wouldn't play.</v>

1045
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:11.400
<v Speaker 1>His bandwidth must be fucked or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that goes.</v>

1046
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

1047
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:17.591
<v Speaker 1>I just did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he probably doesn't realize how </v>

1048
00:44:17.591 --> 00:44:18.110
<v Speaker 1>much money is going to have bandwidth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people don't realize,</v>

1049
00:44:18.111 --> 00:44:23.111
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if if you put something on itunes </v>

1050
00:44:23.111 --> 00:44:23.450
<v Speaker 1>and it is free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1051
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put your shit on itunes but </v>

1052
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.151
<v Speaker 1>someone has to be downloaded it from </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and you have to have a host </v>

1053
00:44:31.151 --> 00:44:32.580
<v Speaker 1>where they doubt like itunes is not like</v>
<v Speaker 1>storing</v>

1054
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 2>your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not providing bandwidth.</v>

1055
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:38.130
<v Speaker 2>They're basically providing a link to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>website,</v>

1056
00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:43.140
<v Speaker 2>a server that you pay for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's funny is that there's a lot </v>

1057
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.520
<v Speaker 2>of web hosts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like unfortunately I used dreamhost,</v>

1058
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.550
<v Speaker 2>which at all my life has has been great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had to switch to a cloud computing</v>

1059
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:52.830
<v Speaker 2>thing where like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was unlimited bandwidth.</v>

1060
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Unlimited storage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1061
00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

1062
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:59.300
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they don't tell you is no,</v>

1063
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:04.310
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't count like unlimited memory </v>

1064
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.321
<v Speaker 2>of the computer or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's too many people and yeah.</v>

1065
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:10.650
<v Speaker 2>So then you have to raise your bandwidth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's some bullshit.</v>

1066
00:45:10.651 --> 00:45:15.651
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is a fucking unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 2>bandwidth and they tell you they trick </v>

1067
00:45:16.531 --> 00:45:17.490
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they because then they're like,</v>

1068
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.800
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's unlimited debt,</v>

1069
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.330
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your memory,</v>

1070
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your computers,</v>

1071
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to have more,</v>

1072
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:25.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they trick in that.</v>

1073
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:29.510
<v Speaker 2>So they make you buy more hard drives or</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer program.</v>

1074
00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you mean by memory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean like data storage space or </v>

1075
00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:38.811
<v Speaker 2>is it like Ram Ram?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much so you buy more ram and </v>

1076
00:45:38.811 --> 00:45:40.770
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I like now you're done by Ram,</v>

1077
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 2>but what's bullshit is like dreamhost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1078
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start bashing you now,</v>

1079
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.050
<v Speaker 2>but a dreamhost like we'll have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream house.</v>

1080
00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:54.051
<v Speaker 2>You can search,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can search like how you can have </v>

1081
00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 2>graphs of how much you use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much ram you use every hour.</v>

1082
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you like,</v>

1083
00:45:56.611 --> 00:45:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm paying for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget how many,</v>

1084
00:45:58.171 --> 00:46:03.171
<v Speaker 2>let's just say a thousand ram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will not be using the 400 most of the</v>

1085
00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:07.140
<v Speaker 2>time and then out of nowhere my shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>will crash and they're like,</v>

1086
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to up your even more random.</v>

1087
00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I think they'll do.</v>

1088
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:11.340
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running a lot of traffic.</v>

1089
00:46:11.341 --> 00:46:11.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1090
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:16.560
<v Speaker 2>but what they're saying is that my ram </v>
<v Speaker 2>has doubled in one second and crashes </v>

1091
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.451
<v Speaker 2>the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't show it on the graph and </v>

1092
00:46:20.451 --> 00:46:20.451
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1093
00:46:20.451 --> 00:46:20.451
<v Speaker 2>let's just their spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1094
00:46:20.451 --> 00:46:24.351
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spice a doubling in one second and you </v>

1095
00:46:24.351 --> 00:46:24.351
<v Speaker 2>don't have it on your graph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1096
00:46:24.351 --> 00:46:25.050
<v Speaker 2>So then they make you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:46:25.051 --> 00:46:27.650
<v Speaker 2>They can't prove it to you for no </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

1098
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.140
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you got ganged.</v>

1102
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:43.950
<v Speaker 2>but when I was just spinning like $18 a </v>

<v Speaker 1>He always thought that that was gonna </v>

1149
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.270
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1150
00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:00.520

<v Speaker 1>it lowers expectations so it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1155
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1156
00:49:16.731 --> 00:49:21.731
<v Speaker 1>I realized as I got older than it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly my fault and I was attracted the </v>

1157
00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:23.740
<v Speaker 1>wrong person into my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1158
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:25.470
<v Speaker 1>you're tracking but you're tracking </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

1159
00:49:25.471 --> 00:49:25.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1160
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.700
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or just like the fuck.</v>

1161
00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:30.080
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn it on love.</v>

1162
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Part of it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of it is subconsciously,</v>

1163
00:49:32.321 --> 00:49:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I think you're just trying to attract </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong person possible.</v>

1164
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Subconsciously you don't think you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>worthy of anybody any good.</v>

1165
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:44.341
<v Speaker 1>So you can just get these nightmares </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know are never going to last </v>

1166
00:49:44.341 --> 00:49:46.760
<v Speaker 1>and then you get stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love how Dr you're always says that of</v>

1167
00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.100
<v Speaker 1>like you always say this type of person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1168
00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:49.650
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1169
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all hit me,</v>

1170
00:49:50.501 --> 00:49:52.330
<v Speaker 1>but what do you mean there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation?</v>

1171
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad had made.</v>

1172
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.020
<v Speaker 1>People are fucking strange with </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>

1173
00:49:56.021 --> 00:50:01.021
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's strange with getting locked into </v>

1174
00:50:01.021 --> 00:50:01.021
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1175
00:50:01.021 --> 00:50:03.930
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew dudes and I never understood </v>

1176
00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:04.000
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could not stop going to the track.</v>

1177
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 1>They would go to the race track and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them it was their crack man.</v>

1178
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.270
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was guys that didn't even have any</v>

1179
00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:15.271
<v Speaker 1>money and they would go and hang out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dudes who had money hoping that if </v>

1180
00:50:15.271 --> 00:50:20.101
<v Speaker 1>the guy wants something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would give them a gapper so they </v>

1181
00:50:20.101 --> 00:50:20.101
<v Speaker 1>could fucking put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1182
00:50:20.101 --> 00:50:24.150
<v Speaker 1>well that's the gamblers creed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gapper is he throwed 20 this guy's </v>

1183
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.790
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sweats your match.</v>

1184
00:50:24.791 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 1>You throw 50 his way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a big thing in the pool world,</v>

1185
00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>like say if</v>

1186
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you are hanging with a bunch of guys </v>

1187
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 4>and everyone's broken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one guy wins a bunch of money,</v>

1188
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.380
<v Speaker 4>he'll give his friend some money if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're hanging out with them and they </v>

1189
00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:38.550
<v Speaker 4>sweat is match,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch,</v>

1190
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 4>watch this match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's sort of like when you give guys</v>

1191
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:43.570
<v Speaker 4>gappers it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1192
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:50.130
<v Speaker 4>it's the right intention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It spreads a little money around that </v>

1193
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:53.021
<v Speaker 4>way one day when you're broke because </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the pool hustlers,</v>

1194
00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:58.550
<v Speaker 4>all all professional pool players at one</v>
<v Speaker 4>point in time we're probably broke or </v>

1195
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.590
<v Speaker 4>will be broke again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a tough one.</v>

1196
00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 4>You know when you're out there gambling </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're trying to play in tournaments</v>

1197
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:09.431
<v Speaker 4>and you can't get roles and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to make money and you're trying </v>

1198
00:51:09.431 --> 00:51:10.010
<v Speaker 4>to pay for hotel bills and it's a hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1199
00:51:10.011 --> 00:51:15.011
<v Speaker 4>Was the life of the professional pool </v>
<v Speaker 4>player at of all the skill games of the </v>

1200
00:51:15.011 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 4>world might be one of the hardest lines.</v>

1201
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.210
<v Speaker 4>They don't make that much money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1202
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.070
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a hard gig.</v>

1203
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:24.460
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to put it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's only a few guys at the very top </v>

1204
00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.921
<v Speaker 4>that really make money aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's how much easier your gigs the </v>

1205
00:51:26.921 --> 00:51:30.431
<v Speaker 4>easiest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to be funny if you're not </v>

1206
00:51:30.431 --> 00:51:32.561
<v Speaker 4>funny or Gigis to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't catch a break if you're not </v>

1207
00:51:32.561 --> 00:51:35.861
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our gig is the scariest thing in the </v>

1208
00:51:35.861 --> 00:51:35.861
<v Speaker 4>world for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys weren't supposed to be.</v>

1209
00:51:35.861 --> 00:51:37.280
<v Speaker 4>Comedians are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that weird?</v>

1210
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:38.990
<v Speaker 4>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1211
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.520
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all.</v>

1212
00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.040
<v Speaker 4>Everyone agrees you're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1213
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird how some guys,</v>

1214
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:46.640
<v Speaker 4>even though they're terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another,</v>

1215
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:51.641
<v Speaker 4>they wound up sticking around long </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to get paid for it occasionally </v>

1216
00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:53.240
<v Speaker 4>and not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but every now and then they'll get a gig</v>

1217
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:55.970
<v Speaker 4>here and a gig there and you'll have </v>
<v Speaker 4>plenty of money and you're like,</v>

1218
00:51:55.971 --> 00:51:57.200
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1219
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:58.430
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it just,</v>

1220
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:00.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making friends thing title?</v>

1221
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 4>And it's totally a lot of it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a few people that we know who </v>

1222
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:06.020
<v Speaker 4>they are and we to have to say any names</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1223
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.830
<v Speaker 4>but when they go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they're,</v>

1224
00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.930
<v Speaker 4>they're doing their best impression of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedian.</v>

1225
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:12.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1226
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.410
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody who starts comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1227
00:52:15.411 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Speaker 4>But these are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me get the impression.</v>

1228
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1229
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:24.941
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those will you work with them on the </v>

1230
00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:24.941
<v Speaker 4>road somewhere and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I seeing?</v>

1231
00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.400
<v Speaker 4>But they tricked somebody into hiring </v>
<v Speaker 4>them somewhere.</v>

1232
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:33.970
<v Speaker 4>I think there's enough comedians now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they don't ever have to do that </v>

1233
00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:33.970
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not necessarily one of us,</v>

1234
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's enough comedians,</v>

1235
00:52:35.871 --> 00:52:37.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just kinda like getting Qa.</v>

1236
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.310
<v Speaker 4>It needs to be a network where people </v>
<v Speaker 4>can find where the good ones are.</v>

1237
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.750
<v Speaker 4>I sent a resurgence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said I think comedy back all this junk</v>

1238
00:52:44.751 --> 00:52:46.950
<v Speaker 4>is helping a lot of people get to know </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were easier.</v>

1239
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:47.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1240
00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:49.430
<v Speaker 4>Podcast help for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1241
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:51.740
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these comedians are like cool thing sort</v>

1242
00:52:51.741 --> 00:52:53.570
<v Speaker 4>of talking and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

1243
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:58.571
<v Speaker 4>having having a podcast and having </v>
<v Speaker 4>people come to the shows because of the </v>

1244
00:52:58.571 --> 00:53:01.541
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think even besides outside of the </v>

1245
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:01.541
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1246
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:01.541
<v Speaker 4>like Louis Ck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1247
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:03.800
<v Speaker 4>his situation where selling is things </v>
<v Speaker 4>online.</v>

1248
00:53:03.801 --> 00:53:06.560
<v Speaker 4>I think that gives a big resurgence to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it too.</v>

1249
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:11.650
<v Speaker 4>People hear the story about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just remember the last comic standing </v>

1250
00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:11.650
<v Speaker 4>start at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Numbers went way up.</v>

1251
00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I had remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1252
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.460
<v Speaker 4>comedy.</v>

1255
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.440
<v Speaker 4>before I was ever a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was my favorite thing to do.</v>

1256
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:26.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never pay a lot extra for it on </v>

1257
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:26.500
<v Speaker 4>new years because I've seen too much or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's way harder.</v>

1275
00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Imagine being an ice road trucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do you want to hookers?</v>

1278
00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Cost cost $2 and it's the breakdown was </v>
<v Speaker 3>set 60 for the girl,</v>

1279

<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1282
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:25.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One dollar cleanup.</v>

1283
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Just spots and probably over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1284
00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Just just a ton of people all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Everything's going on during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still at full capacity in </v>

1286
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:42.651
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy how close that is to </v>

1287
00:54:42.651 --> 00:54:43.440
<v Speaker 3>San Diego that everybody used to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>as their trip.</v>

1288
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:48.580
<v Speaker 4>But could you imagine man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a person who lives in Tijuana and </v>

1289
00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.210
<v Speaker 4>just knowing that San Diego is right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and right there,</v>

1290
00:54:50.211 --> 00:54:55.211
<v Speaker 4>there's white people with $7,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million dollar houses on the beach and </v>

1291
00:54:55.211 --> 00:54:59.441
<v Speaker 4>they're drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Margarita does and talking about their </v>

1292
00:54:59.441 --> 00:55:01.610
<v Speaker 4>pedicure lady grows border town.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's just 20 minutes away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drive to their house in 20 minutes.</v>

1294
00:55:05.541 --> 00:55:08.390

<v Speaker 4>How weird is that?</v>

1295
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:09.140
<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it?</v>

1296
00:55:09.141 --> 00:55:12.950
<v Speaker 4>That is a third world and the peak of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first world.</v>

1297
00:55:12.951 --> 00:55:16.530
<v Speaker 4>San Diego is a pretty God damn nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful play.</v>

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:17.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one,</v>

1299
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.480
<v Speaker 4>there's one island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the island is.</v>

1300
00:55:20.481 --> 00:55:22.940
<v Speaker 4>It's off of San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a little,</v>

1301
00:55:22.941 --> 00:55:27.941
<v Speaker 4>a very small and very exclusive island </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's one of the richest pieces of </v>

1302
00:55:28.341 --> 00:55:31.460
<v Speaker 4>real estate in the country.</v>

1304
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:38.030
<v Speaker 4>This one is off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a small jump between this.</v>

1305
00:55:38.031 --> 00:55:42.710
<v Speaker 4>And I forget what it's called.</v>

<v Speaker 1>froze and became a hockey rink.</v>

1467
01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:30.890
<v Speaker 1>And me and my girlfriends or my brother </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my sister's boyfriend sat on the </v>

1468
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>roof and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We drank beers and watch cars crash.</v>

1469
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Slide down the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my favorite,</v>

1470
01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>but watching that we called the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We called the cops and the cops fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>They did the same thing.</v>

1472
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>We told them we saw the first car slide </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the house and we're like,</v>

1473
01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:49.770

1475
01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1476
01:02:52.471 --> 01:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>we opened up the door and looked and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like ice.</v>

1477
01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks wet for sure.</v>

1478
01:02:57.151 --> 01:02:58.590

<v Speaker 1>the whole street.</v>

1480
01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:01.440
<v Speaker 1>And we were on a hill.</v>

1481
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.480
<v Speaker 1>So the whole street is just a sheet of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice.</v>

1482
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.310
<v Speaker 1>And one after another car just came down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and boom,</v>

1483
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:12.410
<v Speaker 1>hit the curb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when flying off into the fucking </v>

1484

<v Speaker 1>over this habit.</v>

1485
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>So we called the cops immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cops came down.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cops slam into the other cars.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some people just slid with it and kind </v>

1496
01:03:42.141 --> 01:03:42.720
<v Speaker 1>of like straightened it out.</v>

1497
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They managed to come down the hill not </v>

1498
01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:48.110
<v Speaker 1>too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1499
01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:48.230
<v Speaker 1>That makes it more exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know what's going to have.</v>

1500
01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real,</v>

1501
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>the people that really fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucked up because they came down </v>

1502
01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>the hill like they were driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to drive.</v>

1503
01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>

1504
01:03:55.890 --> 01:03:58.350
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going 40,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell you were.</v>

1506
01:04:00.031 --> 01:04:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you hit that ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1507
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

1508
01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the Nascar is going to do it makes </v>

1509
01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1510
01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Fuck living anywhere where it's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>

1511
01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.090
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about this before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

1512
01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:09.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1513
01:04:09.991 --> 01:04:10.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1514
01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:15.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a icebound fuel tanker in Alaska.</v>

1515
01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.540
<v Speaker 1>It stuck in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:23.630
<v Speaker 1>The ocean is frozen around this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>boat and so they got to send a coast </v>

1517
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>guard ice cutter.</v>

1518
01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:30.650
<v Speaker 1>So the ice cutter is breaking the ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>around this Russian tanker and it's </v>

1519
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Russian tankers just stopped there in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>just gigantic skating rink.</v>

1520
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:41.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the ocean and it's just creeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>around pressing against the hall.</v>

1521
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Did you imagine the trillions of pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the.</v>

1522
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Just be so scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1523
01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:50.250
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking it's going to pop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing's gonna pop it.</v>

1524
01:04:50.251 --> 01:04:55.251
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna die right here on the top of </v>

1525
01:04:55.251 --> 01:04:55.800
<v Speaker 1>this fucking frozen bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an episode from frozen tanker.</v>

1526
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1527
01:04:56.911 --> 01:04:59.940
<v Speaker 1>They got frozen and then some virus was </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to kill them.</v>

1528
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Returning old.</v>

1529
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Super quick rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1530
01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>with the virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was about.</v>

1531
01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had to drink regular water.</v>

1532
01:05:08.731 --> 01:05:13.731
<v Speaker 1>The only water they had was infected and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it would make them turn old and I </v>

1533
01:05:13.731 --> 01:05:13.731
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get any worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were frozen in.</v>

1534
01:05:13.731 --> 01:05:14.640
<v Speaker 1>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they do,</v>

1535
01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>they got rescued right before the</v>

1536
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.010
<v Speaker 3>got sent back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1537
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 3>they get sent back to the regulates how </v>
<v Speaker 3>convenient.</v>

1538
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fed them regular water or say,</v>

1539
01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.590
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all it took.</v>

1540
01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:32.020
<v Speaker 3>We just need to get them saline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can reverse this fucking stupid </v>

1541
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:32.020
<v Speaker 3>plot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who wrote that?</v>

1542
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.370
<v Speaker 3>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoever you are.</v>

1543
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.460
<v Speaker 3>That was at the end of the x files when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were basically just phoning it in.</v>

1544
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think when that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1545
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:42.850
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't just to find something.</v>

1546
01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why they were out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That comes in time when some people just</v>

1547
01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:50.491
<v Speaker 3>fall it in certain amount of seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last we're done trying was why athletes </v>

1548
01:05:51.761 --> 01:05:56.761
<v Speaker 3>always post date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're giant contracts because like I </v>

1549
01:05:56.761 --> 01:05:56.761
<v Speaker 3>might get another contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

1550
01:05:56.761 --> 01:05:59.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm done working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be 30 million million.</v>

1551
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 3>They get more money as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the contract goes on your contract.</v>

1552
01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:05.320
<v Speaker 3>So you're making like three times as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much in the 10th year as you were in the</v>

1553
01:06:05.321 --> 01:06:05.830
<v Speaker 3>first year.</v>

1554
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1555
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 3>but that's when you're going to be way </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>

1556
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're some crazy person that's </v>

1557
01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:14.100
<v Speaker 3>completely dedicated to always be in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best ever.</v>

1558
01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:19.370
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How bad did Michael Jordan fall off </v>

1559
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:19.370
<v Speaker 3>before he quit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't.</v>

1560
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:20.440
<v Speaker 3>He did quit the first time he was mvp </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

1561
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:22.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not when he quit to play baseball.</v>

1562
01:06:22.121 --> 01:06:22.870
<v Speaker 3>When he quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit,</v>

1563
01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:23.440
<v Speaker 3>quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit.</v>

1564
01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he came back he wasn't quite as </v>

1565
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:28.560
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1566
01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:30.640
<v Speaker 3>he came back after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1567
01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was bad.</v>

1568
01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Then he said he really hurt the wizards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bullets really because everyone sort</v>

1569
01:06:35.021 --> 01:06:38.110
<v Speaker 3>of stand around and watch him Jordan's </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1570
01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.090
<v Speaker 3>So everyone else got worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1571
01:06:40.091 --> 01:06:42.010
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

1572
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:47.190
<v Speaker 3>So they got to give him the ball so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>jerry stackhouse and people had to like </v>

1573
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:48.730
<v Speaker 3>watch him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's got to be our first option.</v>

1574
01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:49.980
<v Speaker 3>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm the second one.</v>

1575
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:54.760
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm just not as into it really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fast and really heard the wizards</v>

1576
01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.190
<v Speaker 3>because they could have been like A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten up one or two pick,</v>

1577
01:06:57.191 --> 01:07:02.191
<v Speaker 3>but instead he just came.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they end up getting like eight or </v>

1578
01:07:02.191 --> 01:07:04.831
<v Speaker 3>nine pick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how long did he play with them for a </v>

1579
01:07:04.831 --> 01:07:04.831
<v Speaker 3>year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe two.</v>

1580
01:07:04.831 --> 01:07:06.700
<v Speaker 3>So that was that he took off the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>for baseball,</v>

1581
01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:09.640
<v Speaker 3>like one year you take baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe two,</v>

1582
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.380
<v Speaker 3>maybe one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

1583
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:12.970
<v Speaker 3>Why do we want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1584
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.310
<v Speaker 3>my dad's on my last game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His Dad got murdered.</v>

1585
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember about the side of the road in</v>

1586
01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:19.240
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck,</v>

1587
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then who's gonna buy the fucking </v>

1588
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Hornets when they were still in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlotte.</v>

1589
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.680
<v Speaker 3>But the owner got super juicy and greedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and he was like,</v>

1590
01:07:26.681 --> 01:07:27.970
<v Speaker 3>if you buy it will be worth more.</v>

1591
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:32.360
<v Speaker 3>So I don't want money on Michael Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 3>franchise.</v>

1592
01:07:32.361 --> 01:07:34.510
<v Speaker 3>What are you worth more so you gotta pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than this place is worth.</v>

1593
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:39.310
<v Speaker 3>What kind of ridiculous fucking is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lost it.</v>

1594
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.950
<v Speaker 3>People are funny that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1595
01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:44.230
<v Speaker 3>you hear some ridiculous claims that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people wouldn't want,</v>

1596
01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:49.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one thing sometimes it just makes </v>

1597
01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:49.700
<v Speaker 3>you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1598
01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:54.420
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty ridiculous one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reasonable that he brings that money to </v>

1599
01:07:54.551 --> 01:07:59.551
<v Speaker 3>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then some people will just unreasonable </v>

1600
01:07:59.551 --> 01:07:59.551
<v Speaker 3>cousins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1601
01:07:59.551 --> 01:07:59.551
<v Speaker 3>You see David Cross on Conan O'brien </v>
<v Speaker 3>last night?</v>

1602
01:07:59.551 --> 01:08:01.510
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you do it David Cross Jewish.</v>

1603

1605
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.610
<v Speaker 3>he was hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1606
01:08:06.611 --> 01:08:07.750
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was promoting,</v>

1607
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:09.710
<v Speaker 3>one of the movies he did was chipmunks </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1608
01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:10.990
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Atheist though.</v>

1609
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was promoting chipmunks too and he </v>

1619
01:08:40.691 --> 01:08:41.020
<v Speaker 2>was like one of those weird cuts where </v>

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1626
01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.160
<v Speaker 2>He just seemed like he was pissed off at</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

1627
01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:56.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying,</v>

1628
01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:57.160
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He be angry on</v>

1630
01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:06.540
<v Speaker 2>it was just doing it to separate himself</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the fact that he's doing shipwreck </v>

1631
01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:09.550
<v Speaker 2>mock all movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said the movie,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said even the movie is a giant </v>

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.010
<v Speaker 2>commercial for whatever that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the movie.</v>

1635
01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:21.100
<v Speaker 2>A boat company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's one of the cruise ships?</v>

1636
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.200
<v Speaker 2>One of the cruise ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1637
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:25.300
<v Speaker 2>it's just a big fucking commercial for </v>

1639
01:09:30.301 --> 01:09:30.301
<v Speaker 2>movie to that point where he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>the movies,</v>

1640
01:09:30.301 --> 01:09:33.120
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit and it's much worse than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the monks.</v>

1641
01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.080
<v Speaker 2>But he also did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was beautiful.</v>

1642
01:09:35.081 --> 01:09:37.750
<v Speaker 2>It was love to see it coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first one.</v>

1643
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I chose to take the money but just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit on it.</v>

1644
01:09:40.071 --> 01:09:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1648
01:09:49.411 --> 01:09:54.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a thing on his website where he </v>

1649
01:09:54.411 --> 01:09:56.781
<v Speaker 1>had to defend himself when he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it the first time that all these </v>

1650
01:09:56.781 --> 01:10:00.350
<v Speaker 1>hipsters were angry at him for doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chipmunks but that and like men in </v>

1651

1652
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.370
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you care?</v>

1653
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:05.280
<v Speaker 1>He's just doing a little kid's movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a shit?</v>

1654
01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1655
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>like the Santa Claus and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun scene.</v>

1656
01:10:11.851 --> 01:10:16.851
<v Speaker 1>Is a bunch of bullies who were picked on</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were younger and they became </v>

1657
01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not all.</v>

1658
01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say the whole scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the whole scene.</v>

1659
01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:25.080
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the alternative scene is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pointing fingers at people and </v>

1660
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.720
<v Speaker 1>talking down about people and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitting on people.</v>

1661
01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:33.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are nice </v>

1662
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.480
<v Speaker 1>people and I don't like the racks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're nice and I like seeing them.</v>

1663
01:10:33.481 --> 01:10:35.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that I like </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing names.</v>

1664
01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Seven can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can name a few that I wouldn't do it </v>

1665
01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:40.340
<v Speaker 1>on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be seven,</v>

1666
01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:42.380
<v Speaker 1>but it might be for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be five.</v>

1667
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of people you don't like.</v>

1668
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:45.720
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those people you don't like at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1669
01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they just,</v>

1670
01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:48.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's annoying people.</v>

1671
01:10:48.151 --> 01:10:50.400
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is there's,</v>

1672
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:52.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1673
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:56.360
<v Speaker 1>in an it club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1674
01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>being a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that scene,</v>

1675
01:10:58.651 --> 01:11:03.651
<v Speaker 1>the alternative scene and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very judgmental and sort of like </v>

1676
01:11:03.651 --> 01:11:03.970
<v Speaker 1>a bitchy little scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1677
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to generalize completely,</v>

1678
01:11:06.211 --> 01:11:11.211
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that I always got was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like the dorks in high school </v>

1679
01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>and now they're powerful if the power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

1680
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:19.930
<v Speaker 1>they're turning on other people the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way people turned on them in high </v>

1681
01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:19.930
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1682
01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not as bad as I did now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way better,</v>

1683
01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>but it just seemed like there was a vibe</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

1684
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Bert Bert Kreischer told me a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>story once about a,</v>

1685
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:30.030
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of alternative guy's being mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>

1686
01:11:30.031 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1687
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.570
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so stupid.</v>

1688
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1689
01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:39.021
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone like our thing just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like saying Brooklyn's the best or </v>

1690
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>stockton's the bath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's clearly not well,</v>

1691
01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:47.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just like saying our thing is </v>

1692
01:11:47.271 --> 01:11:49.550
<v Speaker 1>the people we run into are the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics in the world and it's like I'm </v>

1693
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560
<v Speaker 1>not other people that you randomly </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want it to.</v>

1694
01:11:49.561 --> 01:11:54.561
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also a thing where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want confirmation that they're on the </v>

1695
01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:55.500
<v Speaker 1>right track and the best way to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to shit on people.</v>

1696
01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:57.300
<v Speaker 1>We're on a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got To make your team then most powerful</v>

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And this is five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was five minutes of commercials.</v>

1724
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 1>What's it's on team Coco's website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1725
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.880
<v Speaker 1>You have five minutes with commercials </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you can watch them and I know you</v>

1726
01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:07.881
<v Speaker 1>get to watch like the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like $40 after 20 minutes or something </v>

1727
01:13:07.881 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they make you watch like a five</v>

1728
01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:10.280
<v Speaker 1>minute commercial break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they make me do it.</v>

1729
01:13:10.281 --> 01:13:13.560
<v Speaker 1>They do it just like it's too well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't find.</v>

1730
01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:15.580
<v Speaker 1>There's no youtube clips of that or Hulu</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

1731
01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a feeling that the ones I </v>

1732
01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:22.890
<v Speaker 1>will find will cut off before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at least at least this is sort of</v>

1733
01:13:22.891 --> 01:13:27.540
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an alternative for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to advertise on videos and,</v>

1734
01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:28.740
<v Speaker 1>and promote these videos.</v>

1735
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Getting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you'll,</v>

1736
01:13:30.231 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is watch some 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds clip here or there.</v>

1737
01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.610
<v Speaker 1>The South Park studios in between </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks.</v>

1738
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Do they like everyone's mother put a </v>
<v Speaker 1>32nd commercial.</v>

1739
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Not much though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have the kids cursing so it's </v>

1740
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.430
<v Speaker 1>way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Brian,</v>

1741
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:45.390
<v Speaker 1>did you find it online anywhere else </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than the team?</v>

1742
01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Coco website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I heard that uh,</v>

1743
01:13:48.471 --> 01:13:50.880
<v Speaker 1>that show was not doing very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratings wise.</v>

1744
01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1745
01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.470
<v Speaker 1>after people loved Conan O'brien when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on NBC in that time slot.</v>

1746
01:13:58.471 --> 01:14:00.990
<v Speaker 1>And for whatever reason why can't they </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow him?</v>

1747
01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Was why isn't it the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

1751
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 1>but he would think he didn't</v>

<v Speaker 3>really watch when he was on earlier.</v>

1800
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:34.630
<v Speaker 7>but there was one producer who everybody</v>
<v Speaker 7>else had my back and the director was </v>

1801
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.630

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:53.750
<v Speaker 7>one producer and I won't say who,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but she is the personification of what </v>

1811
01:16:57.811 --> 01:17:01.320
<v Speaker 7>people think about when they think </v>
<v Speaker 7>negatively about Jews</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what you're going to do.</v>

1953
01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to come off as like a guy who </v>

<v Speaker 1>Did you think that somehow or another no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is going to be okay.</v>

1956
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:34.460
<v Speaker 1>It's okay because people are reading it </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of a college for the to pass </v>

1957
01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.220

<v Speaker 1>I'll just copy someone else's work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do that anymore now because </v>

1959
01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:45.951
<v Speaker 1>if you have a file,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's programs now that they can run </v>

<v Speaker 1>plagiarism,</v>

1961
01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:52.701

<v Speaker 3>notes one day and the teacher was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He just stuck to his story.</v>

1976
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's not a word changed.</v>

1980
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1981
01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.650

<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of a teacher is that?</v>

1983
01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.480
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the nondual teachers be </v>

<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

1989
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>year after year.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you can get into that I'm not going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be satisfying to you.</v>

2067
01:27:01.611 --> 01:27:03.410
<v Speaker 4>You need to have to figure your way </v>
<v Speaker 4>through those.</v>

2068
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:05.210
<v Speaker 4>We need people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need someone.</v>

2069
01:27:05.211 --> 01:27:07.410
<v Speaker 4>We need war machines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

2070
01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:12.420
<v Speaker 4>Meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're trying to explain to them </v>

2071
01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:12.420
<v Speaker 4>why they're wrong or misguided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize they're so stupid.</v>

2072
01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:16.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to rethink how I'm going to </v>

2073
01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:16.890
<v Speaker 4>express this to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2074
01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:19.661
<v Speaker 4>the stuff that you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people just don't have enough </v>

2075
01:27:19.661 --> 01:27:19.661
<v Speaker 4>information in their head and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2076
01:27:19.661 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their view of the world is very limited.</v>

2077
01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:24.000
<v Speaker 4>I've met very few stupid people have met</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of uninsured.</v>

2078
01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:26.960
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say I met very few people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but much more.</v>

2079
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:29.120
<v Speaker 4>More people are uninspired than our </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>

2080
01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:31.610
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely stupid people though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It must be like explaining stuff.</v>

2081
01:27:31.611 --> 01:27:34.250
<v Speaker 4>Your kid now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because kids get things,</v>

2082
01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:36.410
<v Speaker 4>kids get things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have anything.</v>

2083
01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.020
<v Speaker 4>No kids get things and they bring it up </v>
<v Speaker 4>the next day.</v>

2084
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:43.240
<v Speaker 4>They have questions about the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're pondering an idea the kit.</v>

2085
01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:44.210
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2086
01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:47.720
<v Speaker 4>they don't have any prior programming </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have to fuck with.</v>

2087
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.410
<v Speaker 4>The real problem is a person who grew </v>
<v Speaker 4>their whole life and,</v>

2088
01:27:51.450 --> 01:27:53.810
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in their mind developed.</v>

2089
01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:56.260
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just stuck and I'm like,</v>

2090
01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:01.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get some poor guy who was a fucking </v>

2091
01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:03.491
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalist Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those crazy speaking in tongues </v>

2092
01:28:03.491 --> 01:28:03.491
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2093
01:28:03.491 --> 01:28:07.420
<v Speaker 4>and at 40 years old he's just starting </v>
<v Speaker 4>to branch out on his own and escape is </v>

2094
01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:09.210
<v Speaker 4>his former family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the guys last chances?</v>

2095
01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:12.170
<v Speaker 4>Good luck being able to do it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2096
01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:12.710
<v Speaker 4>if you.</v>

2097
01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:16.370
<v Speaker 4>But if you got that guy when he was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>baby and brought them up in a reasonable</v>

2098
01:28:16.371 --> 01:28:21.371
<v Speaker 4>household where people are logical and </v>
<v Speaker 4>loving and kind of like gave him a sort </v>

2099
01:28:21.371 --> 01:28:23.300
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a helpful boost,</v>

2100
01:28:23.301 --> 01:28:24.290
<v Speaker 4>but let them know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2101
01:28:24.291 --> 01:28:26.690
<v Speaker 4>this is a crazy world and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 4>understands it.</v>

2102
01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:30.350
<v Speaker 4>They play with close to the people you </v>
<v Speaker 4>love and enjoy yourself if you can,</v>

2103
01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:35.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really say with autistic kids </v>

2104
01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:35.710
<v Speaker 4>like early to get them to more normal as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can make them really,</v>

2105
01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:37.250
<v Speaker 4>you got to get them fully set in </v>
<v Speaker 4>patterns.</v>

2106
01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:42.120
<v Speaker 4>There's something to do with autistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids and you know,</v>

2107
01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:44.720
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is that's causing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there has to be.</v>

2108
01:28:44.721 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very unpopular opinion,</v>

2109
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:51.430
<v Speaker 4>but there has to be something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>autistic kids and the next stage of </v>

2110
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:52.250
<v Speaker 4>human evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean has to be.</v>

2111
01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Because there's so many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

2112
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:58.680
<v Speaker 4>So many people that have autism or </v>
<v Speaker 4>development or thought.</v>

2113
01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:03.830
<v Speaker 4>I think what they're experiencing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people were experiencing for </v>

2114
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:04.710
<v Speaker 4>whatever reason because of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>

2115
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:06.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2116
01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:06.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not,</v>

2117
01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:09.030
<v Speaker 4>not all of them can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the few that can,</v>

2118
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:14.270
<v Speaker 4>there's so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many super genius autistic </v>

2119
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.270
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2120
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 4>there's a million videos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can look at them,</v>

2121
01:29:14.761 --> 01:29:19.761
<v Speaker 4>I'm exaggerating obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of videos you can go </v>

2122
01:29:19.761 --> 01:29:22.371
<v Speaker 4>online and there's the one kid that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about that can look out the </v>

2123
01:29:22.371 --> 01:29:24.180
<v Speaker 4>window of a plane and draw the exact </v>
<v Speaker 4>scene perfectly.</v>

2124
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:26.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could just memorize things.</v>

2125
01:29:26.071 --> 01:29:28.470
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people that can do very,</v>

2126
01:29:28.471 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 4>very complex mathematics at a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>young age.</v>

2127
01:29:30.871 --> 01:29:35.871
<v Speaker 4>There's a kid that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got something like asperger's or </v>

2128
01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:36.540
<v Speaker 4>something and he says this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 4>composer.</v>

2129
01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:40.060
<v Speaker 4>He's composed like five symphonies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like 11 years old or something,</v>

2130
01:29:40.061 --> 01:29:42.420
<v Speaker 4>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>asperger's and things out of the store.</v>

2131
01:29:42.421 --> 01:29:44.850
<v Speaker 4>And all he does is make it socially </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable for everyone.</v>

2132
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:50.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's no one ever put a fucking </v>

2133
01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:50.480
<v Speaker 4>pair of drumsticks and that kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe you get that motherfucker on a</v>

2134
01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:51.090
<v Speaker 4>drum kit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

2135
01:29:51.091 --> 01:29:56.091
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see something that's hyper </v>

2136
01:29:56.091 --> 01:29:58.431
<v Speaker 4>human and it's also attached to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease belt webbing for Walter World,</v>

2137
01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:03.060
<v Speaker 4>right between their toddlers and shit's </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving forward.</v>

2138
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:04.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I wonder,</v>

2139
01:30:04.771 --> 01:30:09.771
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you see people capable of </v>

2140
01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:13.071
<v Speaker 4>incredible feats and they also have this</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible emotional and psychological </v>

2141
01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:14.310
<v Speaker 4>impairment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2142
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:17.110
<v Speaker 4>this inability to communicate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>connect with people or what,</v>

2143
01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:18.960
<v Speaker 4>or whatever it is that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2144
01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:20.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>personal kink they have.</v>

2145
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:23.480
<v Speaker 4>But to also have this superpower that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2146
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:24.390
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing man.</v>

2147
01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:29.540
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing when you watch those shows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whenever they have like an a and e </v>

2148
01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:32.631
<v Speaker 4>show or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they feature a bunch of people who </v>

2149
01:30:32.631 --> 01:30:32.631
<v Speaker 4>can do like ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2150
01:30:32.631 --> 01:30:36.681
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that literally are </v>

2151
01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:36.681
<v Speaker 4>another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

2152
01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:37.980
<v Speaker 4>they have a little bit of the new thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>in them,</v>

2153
01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:43.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I wonder how many more of them we </v>

2154
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:44.230
<v Speaker 4>have now than just 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2155
01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:49.240
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how many more people are born.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's obviously like super </v>

2156
01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.880
<v Speaker 4>geniuses always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always been guys like Tesla,</v>

2157
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:51.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2158
01:30:51.761 --> 01:30:56.761
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Stephen Hawking and due to that </v>

2159
01:30:56.761 --> 01:30:56.761
<v Speaker 4>nature alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:30:56.761 --> 01:30:56.761
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

2161
01:30:56.761 --> 01:31:01.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just people will go fuck them up.</v>

2162
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:03.030
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it came out feeling fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2163
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:08.240
<v Speaker 4>But like he's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's alive and making computations with </v>

2164
01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.070
<v Speaker 4>his fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That no idea.</v>

2165
01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:14.370
<v Speaker 4>When I heard about patrice not being </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to talk before he went,</v>

2166
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.390
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2167
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:16.520
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's who he is.</v>

2168
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:19.020
<v Speaker 4>That's everything I know about him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It revolves around his mouth.</v>

2169
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's horrible.</v>

2170
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:23.820
<v Speaker 4>This guys figured out a way to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2171
01:31:23.821 --> 01:31:25.710
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep it going to keep it going.</v>

2172
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:28.320
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ever seen his fingers move?</v>

2173
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:31.820
<v Speaker 4>He knows and he clicks on this thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can kind of moves and,</v>

2174
01:31:31.821 --> 01:31:34.860
<v Speaker 4>and chooses words from this screen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really amazing.</v>

2175
01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:37.260
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that all that junk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2176
01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.610
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2177
01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:41.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2178
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:47.540
<v Speaker 4>Don't want to downplay the wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what keeps a dude like that </v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your clear like biological imperatives </v>

<v Speaker 1>just like anybody want a strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation man.</v>

2189
01:32:13.811 --> 01:32:17.980
<v Speaker 1>To be trapped in your body like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing computations with your fingers and</v>

2190
01:32:17.981 --> 01:32:18.610
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click,</v>

2191
01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:19.210
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

2192
01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:19.960
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

2193
01:32:19.961 --> 01:32:20.350
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

2194
01:32:20.351 --> 01:32:23.410
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whose phone is next to the computer?</v>

2195
01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take to the addicted it.</v>

2196
01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Is it your phone Brian next to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>

2197
01:32:28.901 --> 01:32:29.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2198
01:32:29.381 --> 01:32:31.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing to do with the sound.</v>

2199
01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:32.190
<v Speaker 1>You sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2200
01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Well it doesn't sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come through that computer have </v>

2201
01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:37.740
<v Speaker 1>completely muted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely muted.</v>

2202
01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mute.</v>

2203
01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the electricity doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>

2204
01:32:42.671 --> 01:32:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's not the matter of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer being muted.</v>

2205
01:32:45.230 --> 01:32:46.920
<v Speaker 1>It is because you have the phone next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the computer.</v>

2206
01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like picking up a signal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:54.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not a mute thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's coming through like </v>

2208
01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:56.611
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sound so that when you're </v>

2209
01:32:56.611 --> 01:32:56.730
<v Speaker 1>shooting sometimes they'll turn your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones off or on mute off.</v>

2210
01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:57.880
<v Speaker 1>We were getting feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2211
01:32:57.881 --> 01:32:59.180
<v Speaker 1>It goes d to d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two to.</v>

2212
01:32:59.270 --> 01:33:02.500
<v Speaker 1>It'll do it in your car sometimes too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an illegal right nearest area.</v>

2213
01:33:02.501 --> 01:33:06.280
<v Speaker 1>If you have like a stereo for where your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cds or something didn't leave it there.</v>

2214
01:33:06.281 --> 01:33:07.330
<v Speaker 1>It'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real close.</v>

2215
01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:12.360
<v Speaker 1>It'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll find through how fucked is that </v>

2216
01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:12.360
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far does this signal that's having a</v>

2217
01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.681
<v Speaker 1>war inside your car have the battle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for dominance and meanwhile these were </v>

2218
01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:21.061
<v Speaker 1>all bouncing around and the reason they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you to turn your phones off on the </v>

2219
01:33:21.061 --> 01:33:21.061
<v Speaker 1>plan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>

2220
01:33:21.061 --> 01:33:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I think so because if everyone's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2221
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:22.870
<v Speaker 1>it could really come through it.</v>

2222
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phones make sense or what doesn't make </v>

2223
01:33:27.930 --> 01:33:28.180
<v Speaker 1>sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ipods.</v>

2224
01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.430
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems silly,</v>

2225
01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.140
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

2226
01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an exercise in getting people to </v>

2227
01:33:37.290 --> 01:33:39.331
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like moving your seat just to </v>

2228
01:33:39.331 --> 01:33:39.940
<v Speaker 1>get you ready for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the otherwise.</v>

2229
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:44.950
<v Speaker 1>How.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do three older women control an </v>

2230
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:45.040
<v Speaker 1>entire full of people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2231
01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:46.510
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to fall asleep now.</v>

2232
01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to turn it back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to listen to music the whole </v>

2233
01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:51.540
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I just fall asleep with it in?</v>

2234
01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Can't gonna kill us all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got caught on that.</v>

2235
01:33:55.841 --> 01:33:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Easy to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If all you gotta do is like,</v>

2236
01:33:57.701 --> 01:34:00.670
<v Speaker 1>keep an ipod on the plane would fall out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fucking sky.</v>

2237
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate.</v>

2238
01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:06.391
<v Speaker 1>His little jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened to space shutter </v>

2239
01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:06.391
<v Speaker 1>space shuttle.</v>

2240
01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:08.710
<v Speaker 1>All Jewish couple in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the tray table down for the kosher</v>

2241
01:34:08.711 --> 01:34:11.230
<v Speaker 1>meal and now you cannot take off with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kosher meal.</v>

2242
01:34:11.231 --> 01:34:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Tray down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually even tell people that if you </v>

2244
01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.160
<v Speaker 1>had your phone on it could be in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2245
01:34:21.161 --> 01:34:23.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's fix that.</v>

2246
01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>grounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say engineers after cracks or founded </v>

2262

<v Speaker 1>things you can find me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2263

<v Speaker 1>I would say to Singapore Air Super </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jumbos and one quantas.</v>

2264
01:34:57.861 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Both</v>

2265
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.620
<v Speaker 4>Airlines admit the cracks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but say the planes are safe.</v>

2266
01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:04.490
<v Speaker 4>What is their quote?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Here's what you got to do because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pot is not completely enclosed.</v>

2295
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:24.900
<v Speaker 3>So if any rich people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't turn your body towards.</v>

2296
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:26.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean from the,</v>

2297
01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:31.700
<v Speaker 3>from the opening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to turn towards it because </v>

2298
01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:31.700
<v Speaker 3>you're always worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody might be coming up.</v>

2299
01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.000
<v Speaker 3>We turn so you can see them come through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the netting,</v>

2300
01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:38.390
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they could see down there </v>

2301
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:39.871
<v Speaker 3>beating on her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beating off to put my head by where my </v>

2302
01:36:39.871 --> 01:36:40.310
<v Speaker 3>dick would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked at the lady behind me,</v>

2303
01:36:40.311 --> 01:36:43.260
<v Speaker 3>like who could get an angle at it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was asleep,</v>

2304
01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:44.580
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2305
01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:45.840
<v Speaker 3>How much time do you think you took?</v>

2306
01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Probably probably it was probably a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little longer.</v>

2307
01:36:48.450 --> 01:36:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Probably like two to four minutes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>four minutes.</v>

2308
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Were you furious or thought?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll stop.</v>

2309
01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:59.810
<v Speaker 3>You have real gentle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but based on the lefthand and jerker on </v>

2310
01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:00.090
<v Speaker 3>that with the right does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were doing,</v>

2311
01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:05.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was on the right side of the </v>

2312
01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:06.111
<v Speaker 3>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably good for your core as </v>

2313
01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:06.111
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just put yourself in that way.</v>

2314
01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:06.480
<v Speaker 3>We'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't fall over.</v>

2315
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:08.580
<v Speaker 3>And then would you shoot it into your </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pajama tops?</v>

2316
01:37:08.610 --> 01:37:09.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2317
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I shot it into the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the slipper socks,</v>

2318
01:37:12.391 --> 01:37:15.090
<v Speaker 3>like if you turn one of those inside out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shot it into it.</v>

2319
01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:20.310
<v Speaker 3>And then a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a peasant to use my regular socks.</v>

2320
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:24.600
<v Speaker 4>I was on a plane once with Melanie </v>
<v Speaker 4>Griffith and we're flying to England.</v>

2321
01:37:24.601 --> 01:37:29.601
<v Speaker 4>She was sitting right in front of me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a dude who was right beside </v>

2322
01:37:29.601 --> 01:37:32.931
<v Speaker 4>her and you know how when planes in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first class cabin there seats don't line</v>

2323
01:37:33.061 --> 01:37:38.061
<v Speaker 4>up like everyone's not head to toe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're kind of staggered because of </v>

2324
01:37:38.061 --> 01:37:39.240
<v Speaker 4>these big ass pods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2325
01:37:39.241 --> 01:37:44.241
<v Speaker 4>the way it was staggered was Melanie </v>
<v Speaker 4>Griffith head lined up directly with </v>

2326
01:37:44.251 --> 01:37:49.251
<v Speaker 4>this fat guys asked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was right across the aisle no more than </v>

2327
01:37:49.251 --> 01:37:53.811
<v Speaker 4>a couple of feet away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her head directly lined up with his ass </v>

2328
01:37:53.811 --> 01:37:57.280
<v Speaker 4>and he unloaded this dude unloaded in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the middle of the flight.</v>

2329
01:37:57.430 --> 01:38:01.290
<v Speaker 4>One of the most horrific hate like farts</v>
<v Speaker 4>are friend tate.</v>

2330
01:38:01.291 --> 01:38:03.570
<v Speaker 4>Fletcher is known for having the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>ferocious far.</v>

2331
01:38:03.571 --> 01:38:08.571
<v Speaker 4>It's because pizza big giant dude and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>takes a lot of protein powder and when </v>

2332
01:38:08.571 --> 01:38:12.201
<v Speaker 4>you eat a lot of protein like your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like rid of it because it's kind of a </v>

2333
01:38:12.201 --> 01:38:12.201
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>

2334
01:38:12.201 --> 01:38:12.450
<v Speaker 4>That extra shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2335
01:38:12.451 --> 01:38:15.590
<v Speaker 4>and it turns into farts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this dude just.</v>

2336
01:38:15.591 --> 01:38:16.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he ate,</v>

2337
01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:22.180
<v Speaker 4>but he was a big guy and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if it was his fault </v>

2338
01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:22.890
<v Speaker 4>because it's not like I have a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>locator,</v>

2339
01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:26.940
<v Speaker 4>but if you're on a plane and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fart and you see a fat guy,</v>

2340
01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:29.430
<v Speaker 4>that guy gets blamed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He blamed you,</v>

2341
01:38:29.431 --> 01:38:34.350
<v Speaker 4>gets blamed more than like black kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>get blamed for stolen things.</v>

2342
01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.600
<v Speaker 4>Fad people get blamed for farts on </v>
<v Speaker 4>planes.</v>

2343
01:38:36.601 --> 01:38:39.330
<v Speaker 4>Always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like the first person you look to</v>

2344
01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:40.070
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah,</v>

2345
01:38:40.071 --> 01:38:45.071
<v Speaker 4>it was him and the way it lined up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just his ass was just right </v>

2346
01:38:45.071 --> 01:38:45.600
<v Speaker 4>across from her face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was horrific,</v>

2347
01:38:45.601 --> 01:38:47.190
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was a.</v>

2348
01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:49.110
<v Speaker 4>It was a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fart.</v>

2349
01:38:49.410 --> 01:38:54.410
<v Speaker 4>And what are the odds in life that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would ever have your face or Melanie </v>

2350
01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.130
<v Speaker 4>Griffith face that close to your ass.</v>

2351
01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:00.900
<v Speaker 4>You could unload on her face like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>on her face.</v>

2352
01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:06.260
<v Speaker 4>I talked about it on stage that night in</v>
<v Speaker 4>England because it was so ridiculous </v>

2353
01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:08.550
<v Speaker 4>because I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just such a preposterous lineup.</v>

2354
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.480
<v Speaker 4>What I can never turn it into a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was really hilarious at the time.</v>

2355
01:39:12.481 --> 01:39:13.800
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't imagine.</v>

2356
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:15.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was thinking,</v>

2357
01:39:15.361 --> 01:39:20.361
<v Speaker 4>what if this guy had planned this out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I feel like came to melanie </v>

2358
01:39:20.361 --> 01:39:20.361
<v Speaker 4>griffiths agent and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2359
01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.070
<v Speaker 4>I'd be willing to pay a million dollars </v>
<v Speaker 4>to fart and ms Dot Griffin.</v>

2360
01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:25.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>

2361
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:27.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't bring your offer to her.</v>

2362
01:39:27.690 --> 01:39:29.650
<v Speaker 4>Bring it to them and they wouldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2363
01:39:29.710 --> 01:39:30.810
<v Speaker 4>Then the agent said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2364
01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:36.200
<v Speaker 4>I think we can work something out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been looking at how these planes </v>

2365
01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:36.200
<v Speaker 4>line up and this is what I want to show </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2366
01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.110
<v Speaker 4>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's your seat.</v>

2367
01:39:37.111 --> 01:39:38.180
<v Speaker 4>Here's Melanie Griffith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2368
01:39:38.530 --> 01:39:40.850
<v Speaker 4>look when you're acerbate liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got.</v>

2369
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:42.540
<v Speaker 4>I think we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we got a melody.</v>

2370
01:39:42.541 --> 01:39:47.541
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't even have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a little unethical to keeping </v>

2371
01:39:47.541 --> 01:39:47.541
<v Speaker 4>the money from Melanie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's part of my thrill.</v>

2372
01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:48.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2373
01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.620
<v Speaker 4>I'll just slip it into her bank account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2374
01:39:49.621 --> 01:39:54.621
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just a little extra money in her bank </v>

2375
01:39:54.621 --> 01:39:57.861
<v Speaker 4>account and it just opened his ass on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Melanie's head was hot.</v>

2376
01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.910
<v Speaker 4>It was a hot far for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some heat to it.</v>

2377
01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:08.090
<v Speaker 4>That was one way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might not have known how bad it was </v>

2378
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.090
<v Speaker 4>before you let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once you let it go,</v>

2379
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:12.270
<v Speaker 4>you realized how atrocious what a </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible person you are,</v>

2380
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:17.510
<v Speaker 4>but you should be despised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about all the shit particles from </v>

2381
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:21.021
<v Speaker 4>your ass and people were forced to </v>
<v Speaker 4>acknowledge and their nostrils word,</v>

2382
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:24.330
<v Speaker 4>word or we have one of those crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>positive Brazil.</v>

2383
01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:26.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it's going to be like.</v>

2384
01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to Brazil with me.</v>

2385
01:40:28.110 --> 01:40:29.940
<v Speaker 4>We're going to party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to party in Rio.</v>

2386
01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:34.620
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it's the nuttiest crowd for </v>
<v Speaker 4>mma ever.</v>

2387
01:40:34.621 --> 01:40:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Like you've never seen a more brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're all broadly on the car.</v>

2388
01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:39.870
<v Speaker 4>Lot of Brazilians in the card and a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>ones.</v>

01:40:39.871 --> 01:40:41.730
<v Speaker 4>Who some are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul Perez is fighting.</v>

2390
01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:43.590
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucking great fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2391
01:40:43.591 --> 01:40:46.020
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be interesting and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>must go nuts for it.</v>

2392
01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:47.640
<v Speaker 4>Although fighting Chad Mendez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2393
01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:49.650
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't want to be Chad Mendez in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazil.</v>

2394
01:40:49.890 --> 01:40:51.360
<v Speaker 4>She's Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although,</v>

2395
01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.470
<v Speaker 4>although in Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2396
01:40:53.471 --> 01:40:54.700
<v Speaker 4>like heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are heroes.</v>

2397
01:40:54.701 --> 01:40:55.330
<v Speaker 4>There are heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2398
01:40:55.331 --> 01:40:56.890
<v Speaker 4>there are two of three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really.</v>

2399
01:40:56.891 --> 01:41:01.240
<v Speaker 4>There's no country like Brazil man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where there's three UFC champions.</v>

2400
01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:02.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zoe,</v>

2401
01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:04.210
<v Speaker 4>how many weight classes now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's 35.</v>

2402
01:41:04.211 --> 01:41:05.440
<v Speaker 4>40th five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifty five.</v>

2403
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.030
<v Speaker 4>Seventy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>85.</v>

2404
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.870

<v Speaker 4>So there's seven weight classes and </v>

2406
01:41:12.871 --> 01:41:13.570
<v Speaker 4>three of them are dominated by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazilians.</v>

2407
01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.670
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>

2408
01:41:14.671 --> 01:41:17.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't have that in Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

2409
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:20.590
<v Speaker 4>Don't have as many Americans know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>George St Pierre who is one 70.</v>

2410
01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:25.620
<v Speaker 4>But then meg diaz and Carlos condit to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans are going to be fighting for </v>

2411
01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.580
<v Speaker 4>the interim belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of why.</v>

2412
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Tom Pill.</v>

2413
01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:35.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's means a lot because George is out </v>

2414
01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:35.160
<v Speaker 4>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's nice blown.</v>

2415
01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.160
<v Speaker 4>He had to get surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had to get a job.</v>

2416
01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:39.040
<v Speaker 4>You never can tell a tendon graph.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a big surgery.</v>

2417
01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.560
<v Speaker 4>The patella tendon graft is a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult one.</v>

2418
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:44.290
<v Speaker 4>The way they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a long road to recovery.</v>

2419
01:41:44.291 --> 01:41:46.620
<v Speaker 4>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take a chunk of bone out of your,</v>

2420
01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:51.780
<v Speaker 4>your kneecap and a chunk of bone out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your Shin and they sliced the Patella </v>

2421
01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:54.130
<v Speaker 4>tendon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they take a piece of it off and they use</v>

2422
01:41:54.131 --> 01:41:59.131
<v Speaker 4>that piece to recreate the acl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the anterior cruciate ligament that's </v>

2423
01:41:59.131 --> 01:42:00.220
<v Speaker 4>inside the middle of the need of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stabilizing ligaments.</v>

2424
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:02.170
<v Speaker 4>So then they have to screw that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

2425
01:42:02.171 --> 01:42:07.171
<v Speaker 4>They have to drill holes and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to take a little piece of bone we </v>

2426
01:42:07.171 --> 01:42:09.280
<v Speaker 4>took from your kneecap and stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 4>into your bone stuff into your,</v>

2427
01:42:09.281 --> 01:42:10.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your humorous.</v>

2428
01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the Femur?</v>

2429
01:42:13.061 --> 01:42:18.061
<v Speaker 4>Femur.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven in your femur and then they </v>

2430
01:42:18.061 --> 01:42:18.061
<v Speaker 4>stuffed it into the lower one to </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever your shin bone is.</v>

2431
01:42:18.061 --> 01:42:20.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gnarly shit for a long time.</v>

2432
01:42:20.471 --> 01:42:21.390
<v Speaker 4>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What have you had?</v>

2433
01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:27.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is actually a technique that </v>

2434
01:42:27.190 --> 01:42:28.150
<v Speaker 4>they've been using for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The patella tendon graft that more than,</v>

2435
01:42:28.151 --> 01:42:33.151
<v Speaker 4>more than 20 years because I hadn't done</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Patella tendon graft done in the </v>

2436
01:42:33.151 --> 01:42:33.151
<v Speaker 4>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had done,</v>

2437
01:42:33.151 --> 01:42:35.620
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was 93.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had it done.</v>

2438
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:39.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now they are more and more likely or</v>

2439
01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:40.400
<v Speaker 4>use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2440
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:42.700
<v Speaker 4>a graph from a dead person.</v>

2441
01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:45.670
<v Speaker 4>I have in my right knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A cadaver graft.</v>

2442
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They use the Achilles tendon.</v>

2443
01:42:49.450 --> 01:42:51.810
<v Speaker 4>Is He really doing new plastic news?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Artificial knees?</v>

2444
01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.970
<v Speaker 4>He has no cartilage in his knees either </v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2445
01:42:54.370 --> 01:42:59.370
<v Speaker 4>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our friend Sean rouse has a crazy form </v>

2446
01:42:59.370 --> 01:43:00.720
<v Speaker 4>of arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like super aggressive arthritis and</v>

2447
01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:05.780
<v Speaker 4>still happen now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they might have gotten bumped </v>

2448
01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:05.780
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2449
01:43:06.150 --> 01:43:08.860
<v Speaker 4>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I know a guy who works at whatever.</v>

2450
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:10.600
<v Speaker 4>So what are they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gonna you know how they do them and they</v>

2451
01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:12.590
<v Speaker 4>have to cut your knee off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2452
01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.640
<v Speaker 4>he's got pretty much nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever seen how they do hip </v>

2453
01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:17.640
<v Speaker 4>replacements?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gnarly,</v>

2454
01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.400
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take the socket out,</v>

2455
01:43:18.401 --> 01:43:23.401
<v Speaker 4>they cut it off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they saw it off and they put a new </v>

2456
01:43:23.401 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 4>socket in there and drive it into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking bone.</v>

2457
01:43:24.970 --> 01:43:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Screw this bolt into your bone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now you have this new ball and </v>

2458
01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:34.171
<v Speaker 4>socket set up in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably 100 times better than </v>

2459
01:43:34.171 --> 01:43:34.171
<v Speaker 4>the original.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2460
01:43:34.171 --> 01:43:35.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get everything replaced.</v>

2461
01:43:35.381 --> 01:43:38.750
<v Speaker 4>Sort of know because it's like it's also</v>
<v Speaker 4>an alien piece.</v>

2462
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:44.770
<v Speaker 4>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will start to resolve after about 15 </v>

2463
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:44.770
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is totally fine for him,</v>

2464
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:46.660
<v Speaker 4>but he goes off to where just into my </v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

2465
01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:51.620
<v Speaker 4>Well after 15 years and so then they go </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and replace it 15 years ago.</v>

2466
01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 4>They probably have</v>

2467
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:54.710
<v Speaker 1>amazing ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe probably they'll probably have one</v>

2468
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:59.711
<v Speaker 1>that's better than the human knee when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think with the lightweight </v>

2469
01:43:59.711 --> 01:44:04.421
<v Speaker 1>materials and if they could figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's way better </v>

2470
01:44:04.421 --> 01:44:05.840
<v Speaker 1>biocompatible surgeries just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't need it,</v>

2471
01:44:05.841 --> 01:44:10.841
<v Speaker 1>but fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if you've seen that dude who he's </v>

2472
01:44:10.841 --> 01:44:13.301
<v Speaker 1>got no legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost his legs and he's competing in </v>

2473
01:44:13.301 --> 01:44:16.661
<v Speaker 1>races with these artificial legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost his legs below the knee and so </v>

2474
01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.220
<v Speaker 1>they put the spring things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2475
01:44:19.221 --> 01:44:23.540
<v Speaker 1>these crazy fucking things and he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually,</v>

2476
01:44:23.541 --> 01:44:25.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like kicking ass with these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2477
01:44:25.281 --> 01:44:30.281
<v Speaker 1>He could run fast and some people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually saying like this is an unfair </v>

2478
01:44:30.281 --> 01:44:31.850
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't say that man.</v>

2479
01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Dude gets his legs cut off springs on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his leg though,</v>

2480
01:44:36.201 --> 01:44:41.201
<v Speaker 1>but they still running down unless he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking world records.</v>

2481
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:43.910
<v Speaker 1>You got to deal with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as it gets closer,</v>

2482
01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:44.390
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

2483
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless he's breaking world records.</v>

2484
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:52.090
<v Speaker 1>That would be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The humanity of guys started getting </v>

2485
01:44:52.090 --> 01:44:54.701
<v Speaker 1>their legs cut off so that they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>run as fast as him and getting these </v>

2486
01:44:54.701 --> 01:44:56.450
<v Speaker 1>artificial feet screwed on somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make these skates and whether they would</v>

2487
01:44:56.451 --> 01:45:01.451
<v Speaker 1>do is speed skates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would come slightly apart from the </v>

2488
01:45:01.451 --> 01:45:03.950
<v Speaker 1>skate as you were stepping up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll give you an extra split.</v>

2489
01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Second of ice time if it's touching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice.</v>

2490
01:45:06.111 --> 01:45:08.330
<v Speaker 1>The blade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the like slowly removed from your shoe.</v>

2491
01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Staying a little longer and all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

2492
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Swiss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2493
01:45:12.951 --> 01:45:16.370
<v Speaker 1>They're all fucking shattering records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ just from doing that.</v>

2494
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that amazing?</v>

2495
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Clever little monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

2496
01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Clever little monkeys figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember this last past a Olympics </v>

2497
01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.210
<v Speaker 1>with a dude died on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Forgot.</v>

2498
01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Gnarly man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm a huge proponent of </v>

2499
01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:34.180
<v Speaker 1>everyone should have to wear a helmet.</v>

2500
01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Karen's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Everyone to know that that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2502
01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:41.780
<v Speaker 1>We need to know that that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2503
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:47.430
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not something you should keep </v>

2504
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:48.941
<v Speaker 1>from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that are considering being a </v>

2505
01:45:48.941 --> 01:45:51.311
<v Speaker 1>bobsled person could die from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was saying how it was way too </v>

2506
01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:52.130
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was running way too fast.</v>

2507
01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at what they're doing,</v>

2508
01:45:55.731 --> 01:46:00.731
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fast flying in those fucking things </v>

2509
01:46:00.731 --> 01:46:01.970
<v Speaker 1>and I guess somehow or another you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>steering with your weight,</v>

2510
01:46:01.971 --> 01:46:03.610
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2511
01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2512
01:46:04.251 --> 01:46:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you must be doing something if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to turn.</v>

2513
01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2514
01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:10.460

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2515
01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:25.790
<v Speaker 1>quit fighting and to become a bobsled </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2521
01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2522
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:28.160
<v Speaker 1>That was just Walkerton bobsledding for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

2523
01:46:28.190 --> 01:46:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Did he totally mixed one gold when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

2524
01:46:30.741 --> 01:46:32.330
<v Speaker 1>they started rethinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

2525
01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need bobsledders.</v>

2526
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:36.650
<v Speaker 1>We need to fucking track people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need people that are fucking fast and</v>

2527
01:46:36.651 --> 01:46:38.780
<v Speaker 1>strong to push the Basic Osha Walker </v>
<v Speaker 1>made them win.</v>

2528
01:46:38.781 --> 01:46:40.690
<v Speaker 1>The goal you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he wants something,</v>

2529
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:42.020
<v Speaker 1>probably not the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds ridiculous.</v>

2530
01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Walker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad motherfucker,</v>

2531
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:45.480
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made the cowboys.</v>

2532
01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:49.350
<v Speaker 1>He's like 47 or 48 years old now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still fighting mma.</v>

2533
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:51.110
<v Speaker 4>A fondant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fondant.</v>

2534
01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Strikeforce twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least twice in one.</v>

2535
01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking show readed.</v>

2536
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:58.430
<v Speaker 4>He's ridiculously shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2537
01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:03.560
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's 48 years old and he apparently has </v>

2538
01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:06.700
<v Speaker 4>like super human discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never lifted a weight that you put.</v>

2539
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Well he says that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then other dudes say that he has </v>

2540
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:11.990
<v Speaker 4>lifted weights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has.</v>

2541
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2542
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:13.170
<v Speaker 4>He also has a multiple personality </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder,</v>

2543
01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:18.860
<v Speaker 4>so he could be saying that he's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifting weights and he's telling the </v>

2544
01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:22.200
<v Speaker 4>truth because he's not lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Clyde is in Clyde's the one that has</v>

2545
01:47:22.201 --> 01:47:27.201
<v Speaker 4>the past 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think I'm pretty sure I don't want</v>

2546
01:47:28.951 --> 01:47:33.951
<v Speaker 4>to talk out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm pretty sure I read on his </v>

2547
01:47:33.951 --> 01:47:35.931
<v Speaker 4>website that he has trauma related </v>
<v Speaker 4>multiple personality disorder from </v>

2548
01:47:36.151 --> 01:47:36.990
<v Speaker 4>football.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2549
01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:39.660
<v Speaker 4>And I read that and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

2550
01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:41.970
<v Speaker 4>Well why is this guy fighting in mma </v>
<v Speaker 4>then?</v>

2551
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:46.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems crazy that he would go from </v>

2552
01:47:46.970 --> 01:47:47.640
<v Speaker 4>that to fighting and mma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fights that he's had to,</v>

2553
01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:51.570
<v Speaker 4>he's just mauled people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's such a fucking super athlete.</v>

2554
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:56.870
<v Speaker 4>If Hershel Walker was around for mma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was around when Herschel Walker was </v>

2555
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.870
<v Speaker 4>young when he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2556
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:58.140
<v Speaker 4>If he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he had decided to do that.</v>

2557
01:47:58.230 --> 01:48:00.360
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's every now and then there's dudes</v>

2558
01:48:00.361 --> 01:48:03.120
<v Speaker 4>that can just throw people around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

2559
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:04.920
<v Speaker 4>they're just so dominant for a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>while.</v>

2560
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:06.690
<v Speaker 4>The Vikings pretty much true to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole team.</v>

2561
01:48:06.691 --> 01:48:11.691
<v Speaker 4>For him it was like everybody that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>good at draft picks for the next five </v>

2562
01:48:11.691 --> 01:48:12.580
<v Speaker 4>years while we want to map back to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2563
01:48:12.670 --> 01:48:14.030
<v Speaker 4>that's a super athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2564
01:48:14.031 --> 01:48:16.130
<v Speaker 4>It made the cowboys for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2565
01:48:16.190 --> 01:48:18.300
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether he wants to fight,</v>

2566
01:48:18.301 --> 01:48:19.140
<v Speaker 4>pick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pack man now?</v>

2567
01:48:19.190 --> 01:48:20.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's going to jail.</v>

2568
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that why?</v>

2569
01:48:21.150 --> 01:48:21.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the judge,</v>

2570
01:48:21.871 --> 01:48:25.650
<v Speaker 4>the judge will let him a postpone his </v>
<v Speaker 4>jail time until June.</v>

2571
01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:28.110
<v Speaker 4>So if he can get pack you out of fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>him in May,</v>

2572
01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.020
<v Speaker 4>he'll make a shitload of money and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>go to jail for 90 days.</v>

2573
01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.510
<v Speaker 4>So since the judge has allowed him to </v>
<v Speaker 4>postpone and he's like,</v>

2574
01:48:33.511 --> 01:48:34.080
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

2575
01:48:34.081 --> 01:48:37.080
<v Speaker 4>let's go after a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go fight problem.</v>

2576
01:48:37.081 --> 01:48:38.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will not be a lame fight.</v>

2577
01:48:40.090 --> 01:48:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Pacquiao was a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that um,</v>

2578
01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:46.670
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people feel that patio was </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed a little bit by Marquez.</v>

2579
01:48:46.690 --> 01:48:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Now while I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm all Marquez fight that they've had </v>

2580
01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:51.690
<v Speaker 4>three fights now and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2581
01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:55.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mark has felt like he won two of those </v>

2582
01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:55.880
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2583
01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.990
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not nearly the dominant victory that </v>

2584
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:02.451
<v Speaker 4>pack out hope for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of people I think are thinking </v>

2585
01:49:02.451 --> 01:49:02.451
<v Speaker 4>that of floyd mayweather.</v>

2586
01:49:02.451 --> 01:49:04.800
<v Speaker 4>It was scared of him before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he's like relaxed now he saw the way</v>

2587
01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.600
<v Speaker 4>Martin shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2588
01:49:06.601 --> 01:49:09.270
<v Speaker 4>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he box the shit out of Marquez when they</v>

2589
01:49:09.271 --> 01:49:11.370
<v Speaker 4>fought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Floyd didn't even take any damage.</v>

2590
01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:16.520
<v Speaker 4>Floyd Mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just technically and strategically </v>

2591
01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.181
<v Speaker 4>on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing about pack les packy out is </v>

2592
01:49:20.181 --> 01:49:20.181
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a beast.</v>

2593
01:49:20.181 --> 01:49:23.520
<v Speaker 4>He's got crazy power in his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous speed,</v>

2594
01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.380
<v Speaker 4>and he can catch anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if he,</v>

2595
01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:30.560
<v Speaker 4>if he tees off on floyd and he gets a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good rhythm and starts coming at him </v>

2596
01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.110
<v Speaker 4>with those wild combinations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything can happen.</v>

2597
01:49:31.230 --> 01:49:32.820
<v Speaker 4>But Floyd doesn't feel like he could do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2598
01:49:32.821 --> 01:49:33.900
<v Speaker 4>Floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things that could stop them.</v>

2599
01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:37.650
<v Speaker 4>Now he's doing one on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I had a gamble.</v>

2600
01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:41.970
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to bet against Pacquiao </v>
<v Speaker 4>because pack has been fighting.</v>

2601
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:45.270
<v Speaker 4>He's been fighting big guys too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he fought,</v>

2602
01:49:45.690 --> 01:49:48.700
<v Speaker 4>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he fought flux is named Margarito.</v>

2603
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:51.670
<v Speaker 4>He'd beat the shit out of Margarita.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Margarita was way bigger than him.</v>

2604
01:49:51.671 --> 01:49:54.760
<v Speaker 4>And Margaret is a dangerous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fucked Margarito up,</v>

2605
01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:57.040
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he broke his eye socket.</v>

2606
01:49:57.041 --> 01:49:58.660
<v Speaker 4>He broke his orbital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made him.</v>

2607
01:49:58.930 --> 01:50:01.270
<v Speaker 4>He has an artificial lens in his eye </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2608
01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:03.850
<v Speaker 4>Margarito does because of that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2609
01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:06.310
<v Speaker 4>I was 15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>16 pounds lighter than him.</v>

2610
01:50:06.311 --> 01:50:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe even more.</v>

2611
01:50:07.661 --> 01:50:11.560
<v Speaker 4>It might've been 18 pounds during fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>time because they weigh him on Hbo.</v>

2612
01:50:11.561 --> 01:50:14.770
<v Speaker 4>They way on the day of the fight too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they see how much it guys rehydrated</v>

2613
01:50:14.771 --> 01:50:16.930
<v Speaker 4>and they show you that statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is brilliant.</v>

2614
01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:19.210
<v Speaker 4>The UFC should probably incorporate </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that too,</v>

2615
01:50:19.211 --> 01:50:21.850
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think they wanted to meant </v>
<v Speaker 4>how much.</v>

2616
01:50:21.851 --> 01:50:26.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some guys are cutting like guys like </v>

2617
01:50:26.851 --> 01:50:26.851
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other Chatam,</v>

2618
01:50:26.851 --> 01:50:30.720
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Johnson's fight and Vito Belfort</v>
<v Speaker 4>this weekend in Brazil that's going to </v>

2619
01:50:31.571 --> 01:50:36.571
<v Speaker 4>be fucking car and he's fighting at one </v>
<v Speaker 4>85 for the first time to which for </v>

2620
01:50:36.571 --> 01:50:40.171
<v Speaker 4>Anthony's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right move if you've never seen </v>

2621
01:50:40.171 --> 01:50:42.181
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Johnson before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's another specimen or specimen </v>

2622
01:50:42.181 --> 01:50:44.420
<v Speaker 4>through a specimen and he's a big one </v>
<v Speaker 4>70,</v>

2623
01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:49.430
<v Speaker 4>like the biggest possible and he would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would see him walking around like in </v>

2624
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.720
<v Speaker 4>between fights and it was well over 200 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>

2625
01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.850
<v Speaker 4>It was enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looked like a heavyweight,</v>

2626
01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:53.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he would drop.</v>

2627
01:50:53.110 --> 01:50:55.960
<v Speaker 4>He said at one point in time he cut 60 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds to make,</v>

2628
01:50:56.220 --> 01:51:01.220
<v Speaker 4>to make one 70 a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm sure he did it over a long </v>

2629
01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:02.290
<v Speaker 4>camp but starved themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>60.</v>

2630
01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:05.590
<v Speaker 4>It was up to like 2:30.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know exactly.</v>

2631
01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile with him was mostly muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know it.</v>

2632
01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:11.050
<v Speaker 4>Most of them Meghan's body eat itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You dehydrating and eat itself.</v>

2633
01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:12.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's losing a little bit of fat,</v>

2634
01:51:12.371 --> 01:51:14.170
<v Speaker 4>but he's not a fat guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't get fat.</v>

2635
01:51:14.171 --> 01:51:16.420
<v Speaker 4>It's just an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's fucking brutal man.</v>

2636
01:51:16.421 --> 01:51:21.421
<v Speaker 4>It's like the a point of diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 4>returns and I can't do that because of a</v>

2637
01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:24.200
<v Speaker 4>brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when it's.</v>

2638
01:51:24.230 --> 01:51:26.200
<v Speaker 4>Most people are most susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain damage.</v>

2639
01:51:26.230 --> 01:51:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Then you won't cut it like they would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would.</v>

2640
01:51:28.810 --> 01:51:29.920
<v Speaker 4>They would cut anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2641
01:51:29.921 --> 01:51:30.670
<v Speaker 4>they cut anyway.</v>

2642
01:51:30.730 --> 01:51:32.800
<v Speaker 4>They always do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to have a wait.</v>

2643
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:34.960
<v Speaker 4>They used to have it in boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to have the day of,</v>

2644
01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:39.010
<v Speaker 4>but more people die of brain injuries </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of dehydration.</v>

2645
01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:42.580
<v Speaker 4>What happened after the fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think in the old days the box.</v>

2646
01:51:43.130 --> 01:51:48.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter if she lives all </v>

2647
01:51:48.130 --> 01:51:49.910
<v Speaker 4>weight during fight alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take a lot of people were hip to a ivs </v>

2648
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:52.000

<v Speaker 4>So when they would lose weight,</v>

2649
01:51:52.570 --> 01:51:53.530
<v Speaker 4>when they would lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2650
01:51:53.531 --> 01:51:57.040
<v Speaker 4>No eyeballs to replenish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To put your liquids back in.</v>

2651
01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:59.100
<v Speaker 4>That's the best way to look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So weak.</v>

2652
01:51:59.101 --> 01:52:02.050
<v Speaker 4>When are the winds are death?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen guys looked.</v>

2653
01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:03.230
<v Speaker 4>Terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think.</v>

2654
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:04.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2655
01:52:04.330 --> 01:52:06.100
<v Speaker 4>Breath is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2656
01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2657
01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:09.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean they don't eat for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2658
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.890
<v Speaker 4>they don't eat for a long time before </v>
<v Speaker 4>they get up there.</v>

2659
01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:14.400
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the guys except the </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweights heavyweights,</v>

2660
01:52:14.410 --> 01:52:14.710
<v Speaker 4>they're.</v>

2661
01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:17.560
<v Speaker 4>I love their jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

2662
01:52:17.670 --> 01:52:22.670
<v Speaker 4>About the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a few guys that have had to </v>

2663
01:52:22.670 --> 01:52:24.631
<v Speaker 4>cut weight at heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tim Sylvia had a cut weight once he </v>

2664
01:52:24.631 --> 01:52:25.540
<v Speaker 4>waiting over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that he was over to 65.</v>

2665
01:52:25.570 --> 01:52:28.930
<v Speaker 4>Brock's always made the weight cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He cuts to that.</v>

2666
01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he,</v>

2667
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:34.920
<v Speaker 4>if he wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets about 300 pounds if you want to </v>

2668
01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:34.920
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure we started packing on the Korea</v>

2669
01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:37.090
<v Speaker 4>team doing power lifting and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and eating all day,</v>

2670
01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:39.370
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think he can eat all day now</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of that.</v>

2671
01:52:39.371 --> 01:52:42.610
<v Speaker 4>A stomach thing I think is diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be very different.</v>

2672
01:52:43.610 --> 01:52:45.230
<v Speaker 4>That's not just time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2673
01:52:45.231 --> 01:52:47.840
<v Speaker 4>He had diverticulitis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could die from that shit,</v>

2674
01:52:47.841 --> 01:52:48.980
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People die.</v>

2675
01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:51.230
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never even heard of that before he got</v>

2676
01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:52.070
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never heard of that.</v>

2677
01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.370
<v Speaker 4>It should rename it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2724
01:54:58.870 --> 01:55:00.050
<v Speaker 4>nitric acid and nitric oxide,</v>

<v Speaker 4>cold steel to the point where it's </v>

2728
01:55:09.951 --> 01:55:12.170
<v Speaker 4>painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When your Dick is dying,</v>

2729
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:17.350
<v Speaker 4>it's expanded so hard that it's tearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally the cells are ripping apart </v>

2730
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:20.960
<v Speaker 4>from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's getting so big and so hard that the</v>

2731
01:55:20.961 --> 01:55:25.190
<v Speaker 4>cells are separating from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tearing in agony,</v>

2732
01:55:25.191 --> 01:55:30.191
<v Speaker 4>in screaming pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is happening to all your </v>

2733

<v Speaker 4>muscles.</v>

2735
01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:34.340
<v Speaker 4>And if you survive and most people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

2736
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:36.500
<v Speaker 4>but if you survive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be fucked.</v>

2737
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:38.120
<v Speaker 4>You'll be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might as well be dead.</v>

2738

<v Speaker 1>Thirteen days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2769
01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 1>But I'm an everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple times a day smoker.</v>

2770
01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard that you get dreams or </v>

2771
01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:56.460
<v Speaker 1>nightmares after three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nightmares.</v>

2772
01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was trying to put three days to try</v>

2773
01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:03.711
<v Speaker 1>to get the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nightmare to see what would happen </v>

2774
01:57:03.711 --> 01:57:03.711
<v Speaker 1>if you quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it took me,</v>

2775
01:57:03.711 --> 01:57:03.960
<v Speaker 1>it took me two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to give you some Alpha brain.</v>

2776
01:57:04.290 --> 01:57:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I've been out for brand would give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ridiculous.</v>

2777
01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:08.220
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people kept saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2778
01:57:08.250 --> 01:57:11.250
<v Speaker 1>it must be the Alpha brain or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was you really vivid dreams.</v>

2779
01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.340
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a combination of all the,</v>

2780
01:57:13.370 --> 01:57:15.920
<v Speaker 1>the neutral bigs and the B six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because B,</v>

2781
01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:20.940
<v Speaker 1>six on its own apparently can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the neutral box on their own </v>

2782
01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:22.800
<v Speaker 1>can give you some weird dream effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apparently all of them together with</v>

2783
01:57:22.801 --> 01:57:25.500
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] really kicks it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>every night.</v>

2784
01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Definitely did mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every night I would get the crate like </v>

2785
01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:31.270
<v Speaker 1>plot-driven dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like long and clear,</v>

2786
01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:33.340
<v Speaker 1>like a member of the for way longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2787
01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them was I was dropping the </v>

2788
01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:38.420
<v Speaker 1>jungle in Brazil and there was all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous predators,</v>

2789
01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:39.720
<v Speaker 1>but there's also tons of mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>spores.</v>

2790
01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:42.020

<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2791
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good to stop smoking pot </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a little bit.</v>

2792
01:57:44.251 --> 01:57:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good to stop doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything brick.</v>

2794
01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:51.780
<v Speaker 1>vegetables for like a couple of hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

2795
01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Just for the fuck of it.</v>

2796
01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:56.180

<v Speaker 1>Over the summer.</v>

2933
02:03:17.170 --> 02:03:18.410
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty nuts.</v>

2934
02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>3,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2935
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:22.910
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people laughing when the labs </v>
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>

2936
02:03:22.911 --> 02:03:24.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a boom and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2937
02:03:24.590 --> 02:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2938
02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:27.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go,</v>

2939
02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:29.070
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you go over 500,</v>

2940
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:32.150
<v Speaker 1>like the laughs are bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the connection is different.</v>

2941
02:03:32.151 --> 02:03:35.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's hard to like keep that </v>
<v Speaker 1>real intimate connection with pete.</v>

2942
02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Hell myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This last time I was able to get a </v>

2943
02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:40.580
<v Speaker 1>little better because I was like slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>between jokes on.</v>

2944
02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:45.380
<v Speaker 1>One's a lot longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but usually it's like it takes me 10 </v>

2945
02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:47.891
<v Speaker 1>minutes to like remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like it goes smoother when </v>

2946
02:03:47.891 --> 02:03:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you pause longer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it?</v>

2947
02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.300
<v Speaker 1>It allows them time to take it in.</v>

2948
02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:53.630
<v Speaker 1>He needs more time because it's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people bigger.</v>

2949
02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:56.660
<v Speaker 1>They all like when you're bouncing off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall and the belly room laughs.</v>

2950
02:03:56.661 --> 02:04:01.661
<v Speaker 1>It's like 80 people and those small </v>
<v Speaker 1>small rooms that place in boston that </v>

2951
02:04:01.661 --> 02:04:03.620
<v Speaker 1>upstairs my chinese place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like they all hear each other and</v>

2952
02:04:03.621 --> 02:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>react immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well also I think that the,</v>

2953
02:04:05.981 --> 02:04:07.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rooms,</v>

2954
02:04:07.050 --> 02:04:12.050
<v Speaker 1>acoustics are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way you process sound is different </v>

2955
02:04:12.050 --> 02:04:13.490
<v Speaker 1>when there's so much loudness around you</v>
<v Speaker 1>with laughter and then this,</v>

2956
02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:15.750
<v Speaker 1>this is projected from speakers at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>

2957
02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tricky thing and you can't </v>

2958
02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:22.100
<v Speaker 1>really see the guy really well so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get the facial expressions,</v>

2959
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:25.520
<v Speaker 1>the little non written cues like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to laugh.</v>

2960
02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when comedy gets weIrd.</v>

2961
02:04:26.961 --> 02:04:30.110
<v Speaker 1>When you have like giant screens where </v>
<v Speaker 1>your face is on these giant screens,</v>

2962
02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:31.670
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to.</v>

2963
02:04:31.710 --> 02:04:32.090
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

2964
02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:34.160
<v Speaker 1>No one can see you if you do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that big.</v>

2965
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Well dane would do those big places like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2966
02:04:36.171 --> 02:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but he would do it in round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would do them in the rounds.</v>

2967
02:04:38.971 --> 02:04:40.380
<v Speaker 1>They'd have to have somebody in on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

2968
02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>They'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to because otherwise you're </v>

2969
02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>looking at his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2970
02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>which some girls would love started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't done comedy and like a year I,</v>

2971
02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:52.470
<v Speaker 1>it's very word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Maybe he will.</v>

2974
02:05:00.150 --> 02:05:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he'll just do the podcast part </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2975
02:05:04.770 --> 02:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Some people still just fucking tired of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this show and he's like,</v>

2976
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:08.400
<v Speaker 1>keep asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

2977
02:05:08.401 --> 02:05:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not back yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

2978
02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to take more than a year off.</v>

2979
02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2980
02:05:14.761 --> 02:05:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Some people are just not happy with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

2981
02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:20.640
<v Speaker 1>This is what I heard that it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>slang pussies sold out like 15,000</v>

2982
02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:21.480
<v Speaker 1>seaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2983
02:05:21.481 --> 02:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2984
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:24.660
<v Speaker 1>that's the top of what you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

2985
02:05:24.661 --> 02:05:26.040
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I supposed to go?</v>

2986
02:05:26.070 --> 02:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>just keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nowhere else to go or she,</v>

2987
02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:29.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly for.</v>

2988
02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:33.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe that could be it or he's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2989
02:05:33.181 --> 02:05:35.510
<v Speaker 1>we all strive to get bigger followings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

2990
02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the biggest following and get.</v>

2991
02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his following definitely dropped off </v>

2992
02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:42.440
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I talked to people that worked in</v>

2993
02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:45.501
<v Speaker 1>places that where he was at where he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been there a couple of years before and </v>

2994
02:05:45.501 --> 02:05:49.251
<v Speaker 1>sold 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>seats and then he came back and sold </v>

2995
02:05:49.251 --> 02:05:49.251
<v Speaker 1>like seven.</v>

2996
02:05:49.251 --> 02:05:49.800
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't him was still huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>

2997
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:52.220
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't what it was at the peak of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity.</v>

2998
02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:58.180
<v Speaker 1>It's also a lot of negativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He dealt with a lot of people that were </v>

2999
02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:01.860
<v Speaker 1>not just warranted but even unwarranted </v>
<v Speaker 1>negativity.</v>

3000
02:06:01.861 --> 02:06:03.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that hated that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

3001
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3002
02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:09.590
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was warranted stuff like the </v>

3003
02:06:09.590 --> 02:06:09.590
<v Speaker 1>plagiarism stuff that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3004
02:06:09.590 --> 02:06:10.240
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of questionable it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3005
02:06:10.241 --> 02:06:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say questionable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a thought.</v>

3006
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably stopped.</v>

3007
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:18.150
<v Speaker 1>He's stopped doing that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was also.</v>

3008
02:06:18.151 --> 02:06:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it all went down,</v>

3009
02:06:19.561 --> 02:06:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it was very unfortunate for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3010
02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:24.180
<v Speaker 1>it looked horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3011
02:06:24.181 --> 02:06:29.181
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people were playing the louis ck </v>

3012
02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:29.430
<v Speaker 1>beds next to his bits and just became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of watch them on louis' show.</v>

3013
02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

3014
02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

3015
02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3016
02:06:34.201 --> 02:06:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I think I like the way louis like kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>like let them win because that's a,</v>

3017
02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:41.250
<v Speaker 1>that's in line with how lily would deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the situation.</v>

3018
02:06:41.250 --> 02:06:42.660
<v Speaker 1>That made sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3019
02:06:42.661 --> 02:06:44.280
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course is how louis did it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>louisa nice guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was just weird.</v>

3024
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just hard for god to recover from </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3025
02:06:55.921 --> 02:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

3026
02:06:56.361 --> 02:07:01.361
<v Speaker 1>when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get a label put on you and you </v>

3027

3057
02:08:19.890 --> 02:08:21.010
<v Speaker 4>would help that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3058
02:08:21.011 --> 02:08:22.570
<v Speaker 4>because you're not connected to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

3059
02:08:22.571 --> 02:08:24.250
<v Speaker 4>You're not doIng anything and he's got </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough money.</v>

3060
02:08:24.251 --> 02:08:29.251
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that he could just kick back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and relax for a few years so it doesn't </v>

3061
02:08:29.251 --> 02:08:33.060
<v Speaker 4>seem like a nutty spender.</v>

3062
02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:33.060
<v Speaker 4>for a few years and maybe while he's </v>

02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:34.660
<v Speaker 4>he's writing some stuff that he really </v>

3065
02:08:37.930 --> 02:08:39.580
<v Speaker 4>Took a year off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be too.</v>
