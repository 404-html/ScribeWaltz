00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.440
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience or was it a manner dangerous and that's why we have a</v>

2
00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>system called the Patriarchy took tact women.</v>

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Mike Michael Cost has a bit about a great system to protect women from the</v>

4
00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>dangers of men called Patriarchy and we threw it.</v>

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Speaker 1>We throw it away because the colleges,</v>

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to talk about patriarchy because I feel that young 20</v>

7
00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>year old women need their own Illuminati to talk about,</v>

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

9
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.290
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

11
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>In their failures on what's going on.</v>

12
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.591
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

13
00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:26.791
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

14
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:28.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's Illuminati for girls.</v>

15
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Finally telling conspiracy theory,</v>

16
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>

17
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.180
<v Speaker 1>ask for the set definition.</v>

18
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:34.841
<v Speaker 1>There isn't one.</v>

19
00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Is that as suspicious?</v>

20
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>The same with racism.</v>

21
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>There is one in the dictionary,</v>

22
00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 1>but I that's not the except to one.</v>

23
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Ask just any on my feminist.</v>

24
00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:41.170
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>

25
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

26
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it can be whatever you want to be like.</v>

28
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.591
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

29
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

30
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>it means you're my ex boyfriend named Jerry Click of mean girls is that</v>

31
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy are in a position of power,</v>

32
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.781
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the patriarchy.</v>

34
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>But men have been in the workplace for hundreds of years more than women is that</v>

35
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a real problem.</v>

36
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>The idea,</v>

37
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>the columns on it should be caught up.</v>

38
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>But what about when you hear this shit where somebody goes,</v>

39
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>when people wonder where all the female comedians?</v>

40
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

41
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.911
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

42
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>he said that dude there,</v>

44
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>people talking about it when it,</v>

45
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 1>when Louie got shellacked by that fucked up article where people were saying</v>

46
00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>that shit about,</v>

47
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

49
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>how come there's not an equal number of female comedians to males?</v>

50
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>because women are treated better in our society.</v>

52
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>If there's enough damage,</v>

54
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>amount of female Comedians,</v>

55
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>women are being abused way more than ever because you don't get in his job from</v>

57
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:25.144
<v Speaker 1>a happy,</v>

58
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>his job isn't about support.</v>

59
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.150
<v Speaker 1>It's you get last cause you fucked up.</v>

60
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>So I hope there's not a lot of women in it that would mean they're being raped.</v>

61
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>More does that.</v>

62
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>But it is also,</v>

63
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just from a female perspective,</v>

64
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 1>if a chick's funny,</v>

65
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>it's harder because something happened to her.</v>

66
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.571
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>

67
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:42.280
<v Speaker 1>but they can't talk about certain things like,</v>

68
00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:43.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

69
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>no man wants to see a woman on stage town politics stories or politic jokes.</v>

70
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>If it's funny you say that,</v>

71
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 1>but they did create a lot of the daily show.</v>

72
00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:53.674
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're right,</v>

73
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe you,</v>

74
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but most people in the audience for the woman who harder,</v>

75
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I won't rule out anything if I'll take,</v>

76
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I won't say any premises hacky,</v>

77
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.801
<v Speaker 1>just punch lines.</v>

78
00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 1>So if your premise is airline fucking peanuts,</v>

79
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:05.561
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

80
00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what your punchline is.</v>

81
00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your punchline justifies it,</v>

82
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

84
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

85
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I won't rule out any premise.</v>

86
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Premise is or hacky,</v>

87
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 1>but people probably don't want to hear it,</v>

88
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:15.874
<v Speaker 1>but who you know,</v>

89
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.391
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

90
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:16.601
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

91
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>if you can get people to listen to some shit that they basically don't want to</v>

92
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>hear,</v>

93
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

94
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 1>oh great,</v>

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.421
<v Speaker 1>like this is from,</v>

96
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 1>I used to do the black rooms when I started out.</v>

97
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree with you.</v>

98
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

99
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally in agreement with you.</v>

100
00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:27.131
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking.</v>

101
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:27.970
<v Speaker 1>What are you drinking?</v>

102
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.863
<v Speaker 1>Caveman coffee.</v>

103
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.943
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking to you.</v>

104
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I feel wired is wicked wire from that 270 milligrams.</v>

105
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 1>How many did you might go?</v>

106
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I just started sipping wine,</v>

108
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:38.081
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

109
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I can one that's empty.</v>

110
00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Did you black out and suck that one Justin?</v>

111
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.401
<v Speaker 1>I just drank one.</v>

112
00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is this?</v>

113
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

114
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cares about those.</v>

115
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>You like the use of like fungal.</v>

116
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not used that often that it is in Jersey.</v>

118
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

119
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Go to the east coast.</v>

120
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Go to where those old school guineas landed on boats,</v>

121
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>fucked each other on the rocks and made a bunch of them and they all stayed</v>

122
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:04.110
<v Speaker 1>there about phone.</v>

123
00:03:04.111 --> 00:03:04.944
<v Speaker 1>Google.</v>

124
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>

125
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>what's the Italian Horn like?</v>

126
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:07.841
<v Speaker 1>If you're Italian,</v>

127
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>you always have had one of those</v>

128
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>pig shows.</v>

129
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:13.054
<v Speaker 1>You're a moron.</v>

130
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.241
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

131
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it came from.</v>

132
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>We all had them in high school though.</v>

133
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>It was like if you had a gold chain with a horn,</v>

134
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.804
<v Speaker 1>like wow,</v>

135
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>look at stylish,</v>

136
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>did not know that thing existed.</v>

137
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>It's called the comma.</v>

138
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Cellos seen that sperm before,</v>

139
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably what it is.</v>

140
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.343
<v Speaker 1>Cold sperm,</v>

141
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>little Horne or Horne let sometimes abbreviated to Como.</v>

142
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Isn't Italian amulet or talisman worn to protect against the evil eye</v>

143
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.230
<v Speaker 1>or Mala Ciccio and bad luck in general and historically to promote fertility and</v>

144
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:48.814
<v Speaker 1>virility.</v>

145
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>That's the last thing we need to promote fertility and kids in high school</v>

146
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>wearing those things.</v>

147
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>So it is a sperm?</v>

148
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

149
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Neapolitan.</v>

150
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>It's called Kumu Cielo or variance thereof.</v>

151
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.871
<v Speaker 1>What you're talking about?</v>

152
00:04:02.871 --> 00:04:03.704
<v Speaker 1>My sperm.</v>

153

<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

154
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:06.311
<v Speaker 1>It is just,</v>

155
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>it's just between your and your golden Jizz on your chest,</v>

156
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.601
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

157
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

158
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>The Golden Tj's or protect you from the evil eye.</v>

159
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>You gave me the evil eye,</v>

160
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>but I still got my not off.</v>

161
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

163
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>The fucking evil eye over here.</v>

164
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>What you're wearing it right where a pearl necklace with Lynn too.</v>

166
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

167
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it's foul.</v>

168
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Foul little amulet.</v>

169
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Imagine they talk those kids into wearing golden just around the neck and all</v>

170
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>these years they thought,</v>

171
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

172

<v Speaker 1>that fucking evil.</v>

173
00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I could suck my dick about that.</v>

174
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go out.</v>

175
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I got a good amount of gold chains.</v>

176
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.171
<v Speaker 1>I got up.</v>

177
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Good solid fucking horn hand.</v>

178
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

179
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Can't,</v>

180
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Catholic priests probably give them to me it looks like calm.</v>

181
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even look like a horn.</v>

183
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>What kind of fucking Horn is that?</v>

184
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Where it's round on the top like a,</v>

185
00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>like a sperm head.</v>

186
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Horns aren't rounded at the top.</v>

187
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 1>It's all rounded.</v>

188
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.581
<v Speaker 1>The top.</v>

189
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's swimming up stream to the guys.</v>

190
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Mass is going into your mouth.</v>

191
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>If you go back,</v>

192
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 1>go back to those pictures of different ones.</v>

193
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Is there anyone that has a flat top that looks like a fucking horn?</v>

194
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.811
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

195
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>All of them are rounded at the top.</v>

196
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Like Jizz.</v>

197
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Those Italian horns,</v>

198
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>they're all rounded at the top.</v>

199
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:25.271
<v Speaker 1>Like just,</v>

200
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>

201
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any of them that look,</v>

202
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

203
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>that's not an Italian horn at six that's the wrong one.</v>

204
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>That's some,</v>

205
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 1>that's some like Gucci Shit.</v>

206
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.993
<v Speaker 1>Like someone,</v>

207
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.500
<v Speaker 1>some designer got ahold of it and a new take on deal.</v>

208
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.331
<v Speaker 1>Italian horn.</v>

209
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:42.330
<v Speaker 1>It's all the rage everyone wears.</v>

210
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.050

213
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe people wear that shit.</v>

214
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.073
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

215
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>They can't help themselves.</v>

216
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>They grew up in those communities.</v>

217
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:56.494
<v Speaker 1>I did it too.</v>

218
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I wore one.</v>

219
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.460

<v Speaker 1>They're all wearing it.</v>

223
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>You're all wearing it.</v>

224
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

225
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.031

228
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.160

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>He kissed the ges.</v>

234
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.580
<v Speaker 1>It's just my good luck,</v>

235
00:06:15.581 --> 00:06:16.414
<v Speaker 1>judge.</v>

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.331
<v Speaker 1>God bless you.</v>

238
00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:22.240
<v Speaker 1>What saint who should be Saint Peter,</v>

239
00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:23.074
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

240
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

242
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

243
00:06:25.091 --> 00:06:27.190
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be which ones attached to it.</v>

244
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.001
<v Speaker 1>That's like weird.</v>

245
00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Like there's always affiliations,</v>

246
00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:31.570
<v Speaker 1>like certain saints are attached to certain,</v>

247
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.960
<v Speaker 1>the fucking ridiculous.</v>

249
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.603
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

250
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.971
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

251
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:37.804
<v Speaker 1>what year was this,</v>

252
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Dear God,</v>

253
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

254
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I've been having so much on it or whatever.</v>

255
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

256
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

257
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you're great.</v>

258
00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>For a guy who's been hit in the head as many as you,</v>

259
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

260
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I never had a concussion.</v>

261
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I will say that we must have never had a concussion.</v>

262
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

263
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

264
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.740
<v Speaker 1>But what is a concussion?</v>

265
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Concussion is like,</v>

266
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:52.001
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

267
00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>they check your pupils.</v>

268
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:54.790
<v Speaker 1>They're not dialing correctly.</v>

269
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.171
<v Speaker 1>None of them.</v>

270
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:57.360
<v Speaker 1>No concussions and all,</v>

271
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.510
<v Speaker 1>all that hard sparring.</v>

272
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

273
00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

274
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I find that hard to believe that he never got hit with a shot that they didn't</v>

275
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:03.004
<v Speaker 1>see coming.</v>

276
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the difference.</v>

277
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

278
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

279
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

280
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Besides one time in a huge fight where a dude hit me in the side of the head</v>

281
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:10.140
<v Speaker 1>with a brick and I saw it last second,</v>

282
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I at least rolled with it.</v>

283
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.880
<v Speaker 1>And that didn't give you a concussion?</v>

284
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.620
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

285
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

286
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.823
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

287
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.873
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge bro.</v>

288
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.950
<v Speaker 1>It was hip hop night at the nightclub I was bouncing at.</v>

289
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

290
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:19.054
<v Speaker 1>sounds like fun.</v>

291
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.953
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

292
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.873
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

293
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.370
<v Speaker 1>and the Illinois gangbangers and the Iowa gangbangers started going at it and I</v>

294
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:26.410
<v Speaker 1>tried breaking it up and they all attacked me,</v>

295
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.861
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

296
00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

297
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's when I,</v>

298
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.261
<v Speaker 1>everybody was wearing,</v>

299
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it was wintertime.</v>

300
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.120
<v Speaker 1>So I was choking people.</v>

301
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>A guy got me in a headlock and I was grabbing people by their coat lapels and I</v>

302
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:37.480
<v Speaker 1>hit my head in between his head and his head and I'd choke him unconscious.</v>

303
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd find a new coat and I was working my way backwards out the front door and</v>

304
00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:42.700
<v Speaker 1>finally snuck out of the headlock,</v>

305
00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:43.600
<v Speaker 1>put him in a rear choke,</v>

306
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:44.710
<v Speaker 1>went backwards off the door.</v>

307
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.820
<v Speaker 1>He went limp.</v>

308
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I dropped him.</v>

309
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.420
<v Speaker 1>And then as I turned to get out into the street,</v>

310
00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:50.830
<v Speaker 1>cause there was cops everywhere at that point.</v>

311
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:51.551
<v Speaker 1>There's dogs,</v>

312
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:51.840
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

313
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a snow storm.</v>

314
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.921
<v Speaker 1>Last second,</v>

315
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I see this coming at the side of my head and I duck in,</v>

316
00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:59.200
<v Speaker 1>it bounces off my head and this dude goes,</v>

317
00:07:59.201 --> 00:07:59.861
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

318
00:07:59.861 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 1>like I was going to go down and I turned and I looked at him and rifled and with</v>

319
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 1>the right hand and knocked him out.</v>

320
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you know there's just dogs diving into the crowd.</v>

321
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.470
<v Speaker 1>It was a good one.</v>

322
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.280
<v Speaker 1>And that was a fun one.</v>

323
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Dogs,</v>

324
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.840
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

325
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.250
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

326
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

327

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:14.890
<v Speaker 1>They work real well.</v>

329
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not good because they don't know who the fuck they're biting.</v>

330
00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:18.431
<v Speaker 1>They might bite you.</v>

331
00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.750
<v Speaker 1>They might bite the bad guys.</v>

332
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:20.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
