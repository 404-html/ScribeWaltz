1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.590
<v Speaker 1>The general good experience in a manner dangerous,</v>

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's why we have a system called the patriarchy took women might cost as a</v>

3
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>bit about a great system to protect women from the ages of man called Patriarchy</v>

4
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:14.214
<v Speaker 1>and we threw it.</v>

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.690
<v Speaker 1>We throw it away because the colleges.</v>

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to talk about Patriarchy because I feel that young 20</v>

7
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>year old women need their own Illuminati to talk about their failures on what's</v>

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.781
<v Speaker 1>It's yeah,</v>

10
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's Illuminati for girls.</v>

11
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Conspiracy theory.</v>

12
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy can ask for the set definition.</v>

13
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:34.851
<v Speaker 1>There isn't one.</v>

14
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that suspicious?</v>

15
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.451
<v Speaker 1>Same with racist.</v>

16
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>There is one in the dictionary,</v>

17
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the accepted one.</v>

18
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Ask just any online feminist.</v>

19
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>

20
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

21
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>you can be wherever you can be like it's.</v>

23
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

24
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>It means you're my ex boyfriend named Gary Click of mean girls is that</v>

25
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy are in a position of power.</v>

26
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the patriarchy,</v>

27
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>but men have been in the workplace for hundreds of years more than women is that</v>

28
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a real problem with the idea that it should be caught up.</v>

29
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>But what about when you hear this shit where somebody goes,</v>

30
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>when people wonder where all the female comedians know who said that do to</v>

31
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.451
<v Speaker 1>people talking about it?</v>

32
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>When?</v>

33
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>When Louie got shellacked by that fucked up article,</v>

34
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>people were saying that shit about,</v>

35
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

36
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>how come is that an equal number of female comedians to males?</v>

37
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>because women are treated better in our society.</v>

39
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>If there's an amount of female comedians,</v>

41
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>women are being abused way more than ever because you don't get in this job from</v>

43
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:25.134
<v Speaker 1>a happy.</v>

44
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>This job isn't about support.</v>

45
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>It's you get last because you're fucked up.</v>

46
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>So I hope there's not a lot of women in it that would mean they're being raped</v>

47
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:32.484
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

48
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.151
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

49
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>But it is also just from a female perspective of a chick's funny.</v>

50
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>It's harder because something happened to her.</v>

51
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.561
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>

52
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>but they can't talk about certain things like,</v>

53
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

54
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>no man wants to see a woman on stage telling politic stories or politic jokes.</v>

55
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.333
<v Speaker 1>If it's funny,</v>

56
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I say that,</v>

57
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>but it did create a lot of the daily show.</v>

58
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.693
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're right,</v>

59
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe you.</v>

60
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>But most people in the audience,</v>

61
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.580
<v Speaker 1>for the woman who started out harder,</v>

62
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I won't rule out anything if I'll take.</v>

63
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I won't say any premise has hackey just punchline.</v>

64
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>So if your premise is airline fucking peanuts,</v>

65
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

66
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what your punchline is.</v>

67
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a punchline justifies it.</v>

68
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

69
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

70
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I won't rule out any premise on the premises or hacky,</v>

71
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>but people probably don't want to hear it.</v>

72
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>But who,</v>

73
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.381
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

75
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

76
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>if you can get people to listen to some shit that they basically don't want to</v>

77
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>hear.</v>

78
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

79
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.983
<v Speaker 1>oh great,</v>

80
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.800
<v Speaker 1>this is for my use to do the black rooms I started.</v>

81
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.400
<v Speaker 1>So I totally agree with you.</v>

82
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally in agreement with you.</v>

83
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about drinking caveman coffee.</v>

84
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking to you.</v>

85
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I feel wired is from that 270 milligrams.</v>

86
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.571
<v Speaker 1>How many did you have?</v>

87
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:36.240

<v Speaker 1>Well I just started sipping wine,</v>

89
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.041
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

90
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I get one that's empty.</v>

91
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Did you black out and suck down and just I just drank one.</v>

92
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is this?</v>

93
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cares about those.</v>

94
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>You like the use of like fungal.</v>

95
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not used that often.</v>

96
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>It is in Jersey.</v>

97
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Go to the east coast.</v>

98
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Go to where those old school guineas landed on boats,</v>

99
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>fucked each other on the rocks and made a bunch of them and they all stayed</v>

100
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:04.830
<v Speaker 1>there about fungal.</v>

101
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>What's the.</v>

102
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>What's the Italian Horn like?</v>

103
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>If you're Italian,</v>

104
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>you've attended one of those</v>

105
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

106
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.083
<v Speaker 1>You're a moron.</v>

107
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.241
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

108
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it came from.</v>

109
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>We all had them in high school though,</v>

110
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>like if you had a gold chain with a horn,</v>

111
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.804
<v Speaker 1>like wow,</v>

114
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>It's called the scene that sperm before,</v>

115
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably what it is.</v>

116
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Cold sperm.</v>

117
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Little Horn or horn lit.</v>

118
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes abbreviated tacoma.</v>

119
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Isn't Italian amulet or talisman worn to protect against the evil eye</v>

120
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.250
<v Speaker 1>or Mala Chico and bad luck in general and historically to promote fertility and</v>

121
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>virility.</v>

122
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>That's the last thing we need is promote fertility and kids in high school</v>

123
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>wearing those things.</v>

124
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>So it is a sperm.</v>

125
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

126
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.590

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

134
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>The golden ges were protected from the evil one.</v>

135
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>You gave me the blog,</v>

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it's foul.</v>

143
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Foul little amulet.</v>

144
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Imagine they talk those kids into wearing golden ges around their neck and all</v>

145
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.380

169
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.811
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

170
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>All of them are rounded at the top.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everyone wears it.</v>

187
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wears it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They can't help themselves.</v>

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>They grow up in those communities.</v>

194

216

<v Speaker 1>That's like weird,</v>

217
00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:31.540
<v Speaker 1>like there's always affiliations like certain saints are attached to certain,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.000
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

222
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.833
<v Speaker 1>what year was this?</v>

223
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Dear God,</v>

224
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.031
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

225
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been so much on whatever.</v>

226
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.650
<v Speaker 1>You're great for guys.</v>

227
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Been hitting the head as many as you.</v>

228
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

229
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I never had a concussion.</v>

230
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.291
<v Speaker 1>I will say that.</v>

231
00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

232
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.810
<v Speaker 1>you must have never had a concussion.</v>

233
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.740
<v Speaker 1>But what is a concussion?</v>

234
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Concussion is like where they check.</v>

235
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Your pupils are not correctly.</v>

236
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.623
<v Speaker 1>None of it.</v>

237
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>None of them.</v>

238
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.360
<v Speaker 1>No concussions at all.</v>

239
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.510
<v Speaker 1>All that hard sparring.</v>

240
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

241
00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

242
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I find that hard to believe this.</v>

243
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.620
<v Speaker 1>He never got hit with a shot that I didn't see coming.</v>

244
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the difference.</v>

245
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

246
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

247
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Besides one time in a huge fight where a dude hit me in the side of the head</v>

248
00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:11.140
<v Speaker 1>with a brick and I saw it last second night at least rolled with it.</v>

249
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And that didn't give you a concussion?</v>

250
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.230
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

251
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

252
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.291
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

253
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:15.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

254
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge.</v>

255
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.950
<v Speaker 1>It was hip hop night at the nightclub I was bouncing at.</v>

256
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

257
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.053
<v Speaker 1>sounds like fun.</v>

258
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.160
<v Speaker 1>And and the Illinois gang and the Iowa gangbangers started going at it.</v>

259
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I tried breaking it up and they all attacked me,</v>

260
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

261
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

262
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's when I.</v>

263
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.261
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was wearing,</v>

264
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:29.981
<v Speaker 1>it was wintertime,</v>

265
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 1>so I was choking people.</v>

266
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.770
<v Speaker 1>A guy got me in a headlock and I was grabbing people by the lapels and I'd hit</v>

267
00:07:34.771 --> 00:07:37.480
<v Speaker 1>my head in between his head and his head and I'd choke him unconscious.</v>

268
00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I'd find a new coat.</v>

269
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And I was working my way backwards out the front door and finally snuck out of</v>

270
00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:42.701
<v Speaker 1>the headlock,</v>

271
00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:43.600
<v Speaker 1>put him in a rear choke,</v>

272
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:44.740
<v Speaker 1>went backwards out the door.</v>

273
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.821
<v Speaker 1>He went limp.</v>

274
00:07:45.821 --> 00:07:46.654
<v Speaker 1>I dropped him.</v>

275
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.400
<v Speaker 1>And then as I turned to get out into the street,</v>

276
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:50.830
<v Speaker 1>because there was cops everywhere at that point,</v>

277
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:51.664
<v Speaker 1>there's dogs.</v>

278
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a snow storm.</v>

279
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.921
<v Speaker 1>Last second,</v>

280
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I see this coming at the side of my head.</v>

281
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Then I duck and it bounces off my head and this dude goes,</v>

282
00:07:59.201 --> 00:07:59.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

283
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.760
<v Speaker 1>like I was going to go down and I turned and I looked at him and rifle them with</v>

284
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.030
<v Speaker 1>the right hand and knocked him out.</v>

285
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you know,</v>

286
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:07.030
<v Speaker 1>there's just dogs diving into the crowd.</v>

287
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.460
<v Speaker 1>It was a good one.</v>

288
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.293
<v Speaker 1>And that was a fun one.</v>

289
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Dogs,</v>

290
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.833
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

291
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.673
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

292
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.660
