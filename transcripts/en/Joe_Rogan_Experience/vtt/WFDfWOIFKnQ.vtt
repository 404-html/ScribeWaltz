WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.860
Boom,
and we're alive.
Joshua,
how are you?
I'm good,
Joe,
how are you dude,

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.750
your story?
Well,
we were talking before this.
All right.
Because,
uh,

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.260
I had seen online that you,
uh,

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.790
had gotten fired for this whole Donald Sterling comment thing and then you had

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:19.230
said to me,
you took some heat for the Donald Sterling thing too,
but not really.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.210
I didn't.
There's,
there's no,

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.530
there's only the only real heat is you get in trouble.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.480
Like you lose your,
you lose a job.

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.950
You actually got fired for saying something that's entirely reasonable.

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.960
And I'm going to paraphrase what you said,

11
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:38.961
but I believe what you said was he has every right to be an old bigot in the

12
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:44.070
privacy of his home and that he's a victim because this fucking floozy that he

13
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:48.150
was hanging around with had recorded him and then leaked the audio.
Right.

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980
Which is totally,
completely reasonable.
You called him an old bigot.

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.850
You didn't in any way support him.
I said he was a bigot in my own,

16
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.520
my own statement.
Even the statement that was isolated.
Yeah.

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.200
Thank you for picking up on that.

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.380
But this idea that in the privacy of your own home that your words should be,

19
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.600
they should be gone over with a fine tooth comb by the entire world and then

20
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:16.320
that's not some horrendous invasion of privacy.

21
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.630
Like that's fucked man.

22
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.161
<v 1>To me,</v>

23
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:23.180
that invasion of privacy is a way more egregious error than someone being a

24
00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:24.370
shithead it as on time.
Right.

25
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.430
<v 0>And even what he said,
the reality of what he said,
he said,</v>

26
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.090
and he never used a racial slur.
I mean calm a bigot if you will.

27
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.800
But what he said was,
I don't want to his girlfriend.

28
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.000
I don't want you taking pictures with these black guys.

29
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.640
I don't care if you fuck them.
Right.

30
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.650
But I don't want you taking pictures with them.

31
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.130
Like I don't care if you fuck them is a huge part of his statement.

32
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.320
I would not say that's a bigot.
I mean,
look,

33
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.400
<v 1>so worst case,
right?
We're or best case if,</v>

34
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.790
if w depending on what your perspective is,
social justice warrior or or,

35
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.480
or whatever.
But yeah,
best case scenario,
worst case scenario,
he's a bigot.
Right.

36
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:05.870
But right.

37
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.350
Even that shouldn't affect me the way that it seemed to have been effecting

38
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:12.080
everybody.
Right.
And the way that the media was hyping it up and the media was,

39
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.350
was spinning it and totally not necessarily looking at the other kind of really

40
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:20.600
bad CD shit that was going on around that whole thing.
Right.
Yeah.
I mean,

41
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:24.200
I have to question what is the mistress,
his motives in that,
right.

42
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:27.470
Like all that's hearsay and I know that in the wake of all of that,

43
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:30.430
there was lots of finger pointing and he said,
she said going on and,

44
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.960
and lawsuits filed.
But I think that,
you know,

45
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:36.650
it's not hard to imagine that her motives weren't pure.
You know,
they weren't,

46
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.320
they weren't like,
it wasn't like she was some White Knight,
you know,

47
00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:42.440
rushing into,
to,
to do some great social justice.

48
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:43.610
I think that at the end of the day,

49
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:48.500
she was really out to take this guy down or get something out of it.
Right.
Well,

50
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:53.270
didn't she say that she didn't release it?
I believe that was her statement.

51
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.420
Yeah.
I mean,
whoever,
whoever got ahold of it,

52
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.230
I don't know what her statement isn't at the end of the day,
Joe,

53
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:00.010
to me it's hearsay,

54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 2>right?
That all of that shouldn't matter to me.
What matters to me is like,</v>

55
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.220
and what I was trying to call attention to,

56
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.520
what I've always tried to call attention to is the way people kind of,

57
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.360
we have these weird priorities.
We,
we love to be,
have this endorphin drip.

58
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:15.880
We love to be angry,
we love to be a part of something big.

59
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.690
And then we don't necessarily take a step back and look at like the big picture

60
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:23.440
of what was happening,
what was going down and um,

61
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.490
and what could we be talking about instead of all of this stuff.
Right.
Well,

62
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.140
it's just infuriating to me that you can get fired for what I believe is an

63
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:37.120
incredibly innocuous statement.
I mean,
maybe this is coming from me,
maybe my,

64
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.210
my perception of the difference between working for a public company and,

65
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.240
and,
and having controversial opinions and you know,

66
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:50.020
me being a comedian,
a cage fighting commentator,
and so does it,

67
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.840
I have different standards.
I guess it's a different world.
Yeah.
I mean,

68
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:55.170
I can say something pretty fucked up and I'll,

69
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.390
I might get a call from the UFC and then I'm like,
wait,
what are you drunk?

70
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.400
You know,
like that,
that's,
they're like,
yeah,

71
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.040
pretty much I might say it then I'll say,
sorry,

72
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:06.460
I was fucked up and then it goes away.
But I,
you know,

73
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:10.660
I just can't believe that the standards are so low or that the,
the,

74
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.810
the outrage standards that it's like,

75
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.300
it requires such a minimal ripple on the seismic,
you know,

76
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.540
the seismograph that people will freak out to the point where you can lose your

77
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:26.200
fucking job for calling someone a bigot and saying,

78
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.640
this guy should have the right to do that in his home and be,

79
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:35.050
be a piece of shit.
I know,
I know what to expect from,
um,

80
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.790
from Westboro Baptist church.
Right.
I know what to expect from the KKK.
Right.

81
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:42.760
I don't agree with any of that shit.
And I,
I,
uh,
bore it,

82
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.440
I think that they're all scumbags,
but,
but,
but I,

83
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.870
I kind of know what to expect from that.
And that shouldn't surprise me when,

84
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.880
when some headline comes out or when they do some weird stuff,
right.
Um,

85
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.100
a lot of people were saying,
you know,
well,
Donald Sterling,

86
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:58.150
he had this huge long history of being like racially weird and,
and,

87
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.340
and questionable.
So it's like,
well then why,

88
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.210
why you acting really surprised that this thing happened at all and why are you

89
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.180
supporting like a breach of privacy in that way?
Because that to me is a,
is a,

90
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.200
is a more sort of unalienable right.
Um,
to,
to,
you know,
to privacy.

91
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.950
I completely and totally agree.
And I think that,

92
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.760
that this,
this idea that somehow or another,

93
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.870
you should be on your best behavior all the time.
You can't just say something.

94
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.260
If you're alone,
you want to say something completely disgusting.

95
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.780
You may or may not mean it.

96
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.280
You might be under the influence of alcohol or drugs,

97
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:38.980
but you're not giving public statements.
Right?

98
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:43.030
And so for those public statements or for it to get out like a public statement

99
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.210
and for people to absorb it like a pump and then analyze it and critique it and

100
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:52.750
criticize it and then get crazy about it.
I found it ridiculous.

101
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.290
And I think if the guy does have this long history of being racist,

102
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.990
I understand then,
then I understand why people were upset.
Like they look good.

103
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:03.750
We got him like here it is.
Right.
We caught them but what did they do with me?

104
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.100
Right.
But understand how you caught him.
Yeah.
You know,

105
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:11.600
I mean you caught him in a fucked up way that nobody should get caught that way.

106
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.580
I mean that's just not how the world is supposed to work in America in 2015 I

107
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:18.480
mean what,
what,
what does everybody upset about?

108
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.110
Everybody's upset about this Edward Snowden thing,
right?

109
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:26.111
Cause Edward Snowden found out that the NSA is secretly wire tapping every

110
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:31.170
fucking phone in the country and recording all your emails,
recording all your,

111
00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:34.880
your voicemails and everybody got crazy.
Like that's outrageous.

112
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.900
Well that's no different.
This is all private stuff.

113
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.320
I mean this is very similar.
It's along the same lines,

114
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.340
the idea that you can be judged in him ultimately.

115
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:50.510
I mean guy got his fucking team got taken away,
hammered.
I mean it's insane.

116
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.370
It changed the course of his life.

117
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:54.890
And for someone like that to like he's a billionaire,

118
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.760
he's the money aspect is hardly anything for him.
Right.
To him it's his legacy.

119
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:02.120
The thing that mattered most to him,
completely trashed,
completely gone.

120
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.720
And again,
I,
it doesn't matter who he was and what other people thought of him.

121
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:08.000
And what matters again to me is just the way that,

122
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.020
and honestly I wasn't even that mad at the NBA because if you look at,

123
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:13.340
if you look at the position they were in,

124
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:17.000
they kind of had their hand forced and a lot of ways,
uh,
under this,

125
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:21.620
under this torrential downpour of like media and public discourse.

126
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.910
And so like,
in a way I almost like empathize with,

127
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.750
with them in the position that they were put in.
But,

128
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.040
but to me it's the way that we reacted to it and the way that we kind of were

129
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:34.010
okay with it at a part of it.
And so I was trying to be the,

130
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.000
the one voice of reason at the time,
swimming,

131
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.590
swimming against the stream to try to bring some,
some,
you know,

132
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.750
common sense of the conversation,
which is like this guy,

133
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.220
he's not this weird monster dude.
You know,
he's not like this,
this,
this,
you know,

134
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.450
crazy guy who's wreaking havoc and,
and blowing up the cities and towns.

135
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:54.410
Like he's an old guy who grew up in an era where very different than ours and he

136
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:58.040
might have some weird shit floating around in his head and maybe,

137
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.650
maybe all of that was true.
But at the end of the day,

138
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:03.260
what still is not right is what's happening to him right now.

139
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.790
And you made this one tweet,
which again,
I think it's fairly innocuous.

140
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.530
I actually know completely innocuous,
totally justified.

141
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.450
The first tweet the company you were working for makes in response to it.

142
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.570
They call you,
they're former community leader.

143
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:24.220
Was that how you found out you were fired?
Practically.
Um,
so I'll,

144
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:26.700
I can run it through the time table list if you want it.
So,
so the,

145
00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:29.270
the beginning of the day,
what company was it again?
Oh,
well,

146
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:31.490
the company that I work for is called Turtle Rock Studios.

147
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.630
A bunch of really talented artists who are making it an incredibly ambitious

148
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:38.960
game called evolve.
Um,
and so the game was,

149
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:42.860
the game is and was and still is really awesome.
Um,
but the,
the,

150
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.840
the company,
you know,
game development,

151
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:47.180
we work in a slightly different clock than most of corporate America.

152
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:50.180
We've worked,
we'd go in at like 10:00 AM and we leave at like 7:00 PM,

153
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:52.880
because we're usually up until really late in the late in the evening.

154
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:56.010
So I really don't even wake up until nine o'clock

155
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.970
<v 1>every day,
most days.</v>

156
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.410
So that day I woke up and my phone was kind of buzzing and blowing up.
Um,
uh,

157
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.980
one of my,

158
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.960
one of my really close friends and colleagues at the time texted me and he was

159
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.920
like,
Hey,
by the way,
you know the stuff you tweeted about the other day,

160
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.710
like some news outlet picked up on it,

161
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:14.370
some small thing and old sure group,

162
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.030
exactly who we wanted to capitalize on that,
on that,
that sensational headline.

163
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.640
And so he,
he was just giving me a heads up and I was like,
Oh yeah,
you know,

164
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:24.450
thanks.
Whatever.
Um,
it to me at the,
at the time I was like,
whatever,

165
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:27.660
like I know what the group that,
I don't want to name the site,
but,

166
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:30.990
but I know what they're about.
They do this all the time.
So I was like,
whatever.

167
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.420
Um,
and then,
so,
uh,

168
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.080
maybe I jumped in the shower and I get out and I've got texts from like our GM

169
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:40.890
at our,
at our studio,
like,
you need to go radio dark on all social media period.

170
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.030
And I was like,
what?
I was like,
what?
And so I texted him back and I'm like,

171
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:46.920
is this in relation to the article?

172
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.180
The one article that no one else picked up on and that like,
um,
you know,

173
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:54.090
half the comments were like,
that dude,
that's totally not what Josh was saying.

174
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:56.730
And the other half were kind of reacting sensationally to it,

175
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.250
but like the other half even on the comments and Erica were like,

176
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.780
you're taking them out of context.

177
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.910
And that was the entire extent of the controversy circling me at the time.
Um,

178
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:08.650
and then 45 minutes later I still have,
you know,

179
00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:11.700
left my apartment to go into the studio yet 45 minutes later my email stops

180
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:14.580
working and I'm like,
oh,
like I'm not dumb.
That's stupid.
I'm like,

181
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.740
they literally just shut off my email.
Um,

182
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.880
and then so I tried calling him and he didn't take my call and then an hour

183
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:22.170
later he's like,
yeah,
we should,

184
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.780
we should probably meet it like to Starbucks around the corner.
And I was like,

185
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.280
what?
Like you don't even want me to come into the office and talk about this.

186
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:32.820
Like you don't want to hear my side of it.
You don't want to see what's what,

187
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:36.450
like it's just done.
And then they issued the statement that they made,

188
00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:39.660
which was like the literally putting the match to the kerosene.

189
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:41.010
So maybe there was some kerosene,

190
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:45.250
maybe there was some like potential for outrage and then when they fired me,

191
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.540
it turned into this huge thing in the gaming industry around like,

192
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.520
was that right?
Was that wrong?

193
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.180
So like the vast majority of people who have never even heard about that or even

194
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:58.800
would've cared that I tweeted that.
Um,
kind of like everybody heard about it,
um,

195
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.740
mainstream heard about it.
Like Mark Cuban started following me on Twitter.

196
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:02.490
Like if you were,

197
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.910
if they were afraid the NBA was going to get pissed at us for me for weighing in

198
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.010
and then,
you know,

199
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.530
they're kind of reaction to it and made it like 50 times worse.
Yeah.

200
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:15.360
I wish I was in on it when it happened cause I would've went crazy and no,

201
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:18.430
I would have tweeted,
and you know,

202
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.140
we would have talked about it on the podcast as it happened.
I,

203
00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:24.870
I wasn't aware of it until after the fact,
but it,
to me,

204
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:29.280
it's smacks of this outrage culture that we're in now where people were just

205
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:33.050
waiting for the green light to be a cunt and that that's what it is.
It's,

206
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:36.420
it's not really that they're angry at this.
I don't believe it.

207
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:40.410
I think there's a great deal of fake outrage,

208
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:44.250
recreational outrage that we're experiencing in our culture right now.

209
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:49.251
And it's because people for the first time ever have a voice instantly to talk

210
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.950
about anything.
And that's what Twitter is.
That's what Facebook is.

211
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.400
<v 0>You instantaneously can project your thoughts out to the world.</v>

212
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.810
And people love doing it and they love being pissed off and they're most likely

213
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:03.790
pissed off because of their life.

214
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.450
They're most likely pissed off because of the relationship or their job or their

215
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:10.450
weight or you know,
whatever the fuck it is.

216
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.450
But they're just not balanced people.

217
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.050
And there's a lot of them and they're looking to hit that fucking gas pedal when

218
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:20.050
they see that green light because that greenlight was that Josh Hollins,

219
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:24.520
a pizza shit that fuck mother fucker.
He supported Donald Sterling dairy.

220
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.710
How dare you sending racism

221
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.580
<v 1>in 2015 and here's the scary thing for me,
Joe,
is that these people,</v>

222
00:12:31.581 --> 00:12:36.220
I mean these people,
I don't want to like make people sound weird,
but they've,

223
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:40.150
oh they've always been here and they've only now had the microphone to talk

224
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:44.230
about this.
So we as a society,
society has to be better than the individual.

225
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:47.830
I'm saying what I'm trying to say is that these individuals who you know are

226
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:51.970
fueled by that they've always been around and now we as a society need to be

227
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:54.940
bigger than the individual and we need to look at that and understand we need to

228
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:55.870
identify what it is,

229
00:12:55.871 --> 00:12:59.050
understand why it's wrong and the kind of damage and the kind of risk it

230
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:03.610
presents to free thinking,
free speech and even industry.
And then we need to,

231
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.520
you know,
change the way we're behaving very consciously,

232
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:08.380
very cognizantly with every,
with you know,

233
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:11.890
everything that we do to try to suppress those feelings.

234
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.780
Cause they're just natural tendencies.
Like if you,

235
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:16.990
if you try to boil it down to just the,
like the neuroscience of it,

236
00:13:16.991 --> 00:13:20.110
these are just like emotional receptors in our brains.
It's,

237
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.820
it's what makes us tick.
It's the,
it's,
it's why these click baity articles like,

238
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.450
you know,
11 crazy wonders of the world revealed after you click this link.

239
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:32.890
It's why that that is so successful because those appeal to the emotional

240
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:35.920
centers of our brain instead of the cognitive centers of our brain and being too

241
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:39.210
kind,
they appeal to retards say,
well

242
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.590
<v 0>that's what's going on.
What you're doing,</v>

243
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:46.591
what you're doing with Twitter and with Facebook is empowering the whole world

244
00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:49.840
to communicate.
And it's a beautiful thing.
It's,
it's amazing.

245
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.100
<v 1>It was meant to be a beautiful thing.
And I as a social psychologist,</v>

246
00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.030
like I self prescribe myself to that.
I didn't go to school for this,

247
00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:00.880
but I'm fascinated by it.
I learned,
I tried to learn everything I can about it.

248
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.370
And,
and in my position that I've been in,
I've,
I've,

249
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.070
my whole career in building and architecting communities and,

250
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.520
and the way people interact online and with on social media.

251
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:13.570
So I say this with like a certain amount of self loathing because I was kind of

252
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:14.920
part of the probability that empire up.

253
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:19.260
Now I look at back at it and I think there's problems with this and,
and it's,

254
00:14:19.261 --> 00:14:20.910
it's unlocking a,
like a,

255
00:14:20.911 --> 00:14:25.160
a toxicity that is running rapid across a bunch of different issues and,

256
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.890
and it leads to just hate and bile and venom and harassment and sure.

257
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.490
<v 0>Now,
I honestly believe is a temporary step,
uh,
on,</v>

258
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.600
on the way to more enlightened culture.

259
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.630
I really do believe this and I think that what we're experiencing now is people,

260
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.230
when you see someone write something like,

261
00:14:46.231 --> 00:14:48.990
what was the name of this company that you work for again?
Turtle Rock,

262
00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:53.420
Third Rock,
turtle rock studios.
You do not fire this man.
You know,

263
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.950
expect me to boycott your business.
You don't know who wrote that.

264
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.680
That guy could be shitting his pants as he wrote it.

265
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:05.540
He could be jerking off into fucking other people soup.
He could be,

266
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.171
you know,

267
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:11.171
driving on the highway with one foot on the gas and one hand on his cell phone

268
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:14.150
on the other hand,
on his dick.
You,
you don't know.

269
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.210
We don't know who these people are there words.

270
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.270
Anyone can type a sentence,
anyone can talk,

271
00:15:20.271 --> 00:15:24.560
but you don't know who that person is.
Like what should I consider your opinion?

272
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.250
We all know idiots.
We all,

273
00:15:26.251 --> 00:15:31.251
we've all run into idiots in our lives that if you went to them with an opinion,

274
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.430
you ask them a question about anything.

275
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.910
They're likely to give you some really fucking stupid answer.

276
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.670
And you wouldn't even consider it because you go,
oh well that's Mike.

277
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.300
Mike's a tool,
you know?
Of course he said that he's a fool.

278
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.630
And when you see Mike's words written down with a period and an exclamation

279
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:52.160
point and it looks all normal,

280
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.220
like it doesn't seem like it came from a fucking idiot.

281
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.130
We're used to talking to people.
I look at you,

282
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:00.200
I can tell you a reasonable intelligent guy.

283
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.920
We're having a wonderful conversation and your normal okay.

284
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:07.960
But if you're some fucking idiot,
and you were saying the same,
you know,

285
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.870
thing that these people that are outraged,
uh,
you know,
uh,
about your,

286
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.010
your tweet about Donald Sterling,
if you were an idiot and you were saying that,

287
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.830
I would immediately dismiss it.
I would say,
well,
this guy's an idiot.

288
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.980
This is real simple.
But en masse and,
and,

289
00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:23.420
and in that wave and online and social media,
like that context,

290
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:25.760
you don't know and you don't know if this guy's an idiot or if he's a thought

291
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:26.271
leader or,

292
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:29.480
and so then all of those messages and all of those tweets and all of those

293
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.410
hashtags,
they add up and it's,
it,
we lose the context.
I mean,

294
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:37.700
we lose the forest through the trees.
We don't just do that.

295
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.750
It's also these people have an earned the ability to communicate.

296
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.350
They haven't earned it.
They've just found it.
Like,
I haven't earned it.

297
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.300
I just found it.
I mean,
I stumbled upon this ability through the Internet.

298
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.980
I mean,
that's what's we've all done.
You haven't really earned it right.

299
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.440
At least you're consistent about it,
right.
Your,

300
00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:57.980
your message is always fairly fairly coming from a very pragmatic place.
You,

301
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:00.920
you take a look at the guy,
one arbitrary guy who was,

302
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.730
who is typing some anger shit and his Twitter feed and you scroll back through

303
00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:07.610
his history and the stuff that he was complaining about just the other day or

304
00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:08.444
the last week.

305
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.330
It could be in stark contrast to whatever he happened to be anger about today.

306
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.360
Right?
Or coming from a completely different place of,

307
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.320
of morals and standards that he has.
Well,

308
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:17.060
that's one of the coolest things about Twitter's.

309
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:18.740
And when someone says something really stupid,

310
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.720
he go to their Twitter page and go,
oh,

311
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:25.520
look at this amazing river of retardation that's coming out of your fat head.

312
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.820
You know,
it's funny,
I,
I used to have a real problem with like,

313
00:17:28.821 --> 00:17:33.470
I used to get baited easily into stupid arguments and just stupid spend hours

314
00:17:33.471 --> 00:17:36.560
trying to change a guy.
And,
and uh,
and I started doing that,
right?

315
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.510
Where I'd click through and I read through it.
I'm just like,
it's,

316
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.050
this isn't worth it.
It's not worth my time.
It's almost never worth it.

317
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.220
It's almost never worth it.

318
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.450
But I think that these people have never had this ability to communicate before

319
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:49.010
and they don't think about it too much.

320
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.320
And I think that this power that human beings have today through social media,

321
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.920
it's amazing.
Like ultimately it's way better.

322
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.260
It's way better than not having it,

323
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.230
and it's an amazing time.

324
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:06.930
But this is how I like to put it in perspective to people.

325
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.780
If you're in a room with a hundred people,

326
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.580
what are the odds that one of those people is a total fucking moron?

327
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:19.410
It's about a hundred percent if you have a hundred people in a room,
well,

328
00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.860
you'd have 99 amazing people.
As a comic,
you see this all the time.
It's the,

329
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:25.440
it's the one heckler.
It's the one of course,
holding in their room,
right?

330
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:27.630
And so you just expand that out to the whole world.

331
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:30.060
Expand that up to the entire Twitter and sound domain.
Well,

332
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:33.060
just the whole planet looking at the United States of America,

333
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.160
if it's one out of a hundred that means there's three point whatever,
five,

334
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.740
what is it?
350 million people in this country.
Yeah.

335
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.880
That's three and a half million retards.
Three and a half million million.

336
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:50.100
Slobbering shitheads just pounding on their keyboards.

337
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.280
Demanding action,
demanding.

338
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:56.640
You get fire demanding,
you get reprimanded,

339
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.480
demanding you apologize.
And over what?

340
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.150
Over the over their shitty fucking lives.
That's what it is.

341
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.770
But these what the real,

342
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:10.010
the real problem is is that companies like turtle rock are pussies and that

343
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:13.230
they,
they can't look at this rationally.

344
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.520
They can't look at this reasonably to human beings.
Just like,

345
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:19.680
why did you write that?
Oh,
I wrote it because,
you know,

346
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:23.610
I feel like the invasion of privacy thing is much more important than the fact

347
00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:26.880
that this guy said something that was,
you know,
racially fucked up.
Okay,

348
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.600
good point.
I mean,
that could really at the end of it,
yeah,
but you're,

349
00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:32.850
you're taking these opinions from all these other people,

350
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.270
people that are chime in and just because they're looking for that fucking green

351
00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:36.540
light,

352
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.360
they're looking to hit that gas cause they're frustrated because they're stuck

353
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:43.010
in traffic all day because they're,
their body sucks because the,

354
00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:46.860
the girlfriend has want to touch them.
Whatever the fuck reason it is context.

355
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:49.710
That's their life context.
But that's their shit.
Let them,
let them deal with it.

356
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:52.860
Right.
Don't bring repercussions than other people.
And again,
me,
you know,

357
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.320
I'm fine.
Whatever I'm doing just fine.
But the,
the,

358
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.550
the kind of damage that that did to people that I cared about who we're still at

359
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.190
the company,
right?
Like my friends,
they're my colleagues who,

360
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.950
because when that'll happen,
like it was,
it was just that,
right?

361
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:09.330
It was mostly people just yelling and angry at them for doing what they did to

362
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:13.170
me.
Right.
Well,
they should be that.
That makes sense.
And,
and,
and,

363
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:17.950
and so that should be the repercussion for firing someone for free speech and,

364
00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:20.670
and that,
and that wasn't,
that wasn't good though either.
Right?
Like,

365
00:20:20.671 --> 00:20:23.820
that was still really bad too.
And that,
that wasn't to me,

366
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:25.550
that wasn't even any better,
right?
That,
no,

367
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.850
the way it's better is you take the person fire you and they should be fired and

368
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:33.990
they should be publicly flogged.
Take them out with rubber dicks.

369
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.120
Just smack them in the face like a hundred lashes.
It's just,
it's nonsense.

370
00:20:39.121 --> 00:20:42.870
It's,
it's,
it's a fools endeavor to,

371
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.920
to try to please all the fucking idiots of the world and to

372
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.300
<v 1>not look at that raw,</v>

373
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.870
I don't know how anybody can look at what you said rationally and be outraged.

374
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.250
You'd have to be a real fucking piece of shit to get angry without enough to

375
00:20:57.251 --> 00:21:00.070
think that you should lose your ability to make a living.

376
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.820
You should lose your job.
But that's what people love to do.

377
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.220
They love to get people fired.
I mean,

378
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:11.221
it's one of the more invasive aspects of social media,

379
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.170
the social justice warrior types that we'll try to get people fired from their

380
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:21.310
job and they will organize and attack and they're trying to get a result and

381
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:24.580
when they get a results like these turtle rock dummies who fired you,

382
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.710
they feel like they've claimed victory,
but there's no victory there.
You know,

383
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:31.270
you went on to get a better job.

384
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.980
They went on to get fucked over the whole thing turned into a big shit fest and

385
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:41.130
online it became this hot point of debate and I think ultimately they should

386
00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:44.170
learn and everyone should,
everyone should learn.
That's the thing.

387
00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.660
What I would want to do and what I keep doing it and I didn't,

388
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.500
it didn't stop at all.
By the way,
I love,
I'm okay with being the provocative guy,

389
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:53.650
right?
Provocation doesn't always have to be a negative word,
right?

390
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.660
There's anytime you evoke an emotion,

391
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.520
it's because you're saying something distinct.

392
00:21:57.521 --> 00:22:01.900
You're saying you're not being just sameness and muted and and an average and

393
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:06.640
completely agreeable.
I like being the guy who has like poignant thoughts,

394
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.570
who wants to share a different angle in a different perspective with as many

395
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:14.950
people as I can and just try to keep the conversation moving forward because

396
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.070
what you end up seeing and what people are trained into doing,

397
00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:22.390
which which happened with with my whole thing is is they get trained and to and

398
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:25.720
to taking aside and then closing off the other side.

399
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.160
You see this a lot with you have any,

400
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.050
do you have any like Facebook friends that are like super like Wah Wah,

401
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.850
like some who either super religious or some who were super atheist and you

402
00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:37.870
watch some of the arguments they get in and you watch the,
the aftermath of them.

403
00:22:37.871 --> 00:22:38.704
Like I had a,

404
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.820
I like a die hard atheist friend of mine who who would always argue with,
with,

405
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:45.790
with Christians,
always argue with anybody who says like thank you know,

406
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.940
thank God for being here for me through this hard time.

407
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.680
And he would even go on that post and argue and debate with them.
Like,

408
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:54.070
he's kind of just,
that guy is that guy at the,
at the party.

409
00:22:54.071 --> 00:22:57.910
And so what I noticed that he would keep doing is he'd get into these arguments

410
00:22:57.911 --> 00:23:00.460
and then he would defriend all of the religious people.

411
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.190
And when I take a step back and I observe his behavior,

412
00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:06.460
what he's doing is he's surrounding himself with more and more likeminded
people.

413
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:11.650
And he's removing any other discourse that like how do you don't evolve unless

414
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:13.570
you debate unless you have a conversation.
Right?

415
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.590
So he's just surrounding himself with more of these likeminded people who share

416
00:23:17.591 --> 00:23:22.090
his ideas and then he's ranting inventing with those group of likeminded people

417
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:24.580
about how angering the other side makes them.

418
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.700
So now he's not even having a debate with the other side.

419
00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:30.100
He's just having this circle jerk with his own,

420
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.230
with his own group of friends about,

421
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.470
about what they assumed the other side thinks and means and believes.

422
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.210
And so you take that with any issue or,
or,
um,

423
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.830
with any set of values that you have.
It's the same thing.

424
00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:46.040
Anytime that you cut off ties with another person,
you can,
you could call that.

425
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.230
<v 0>Well,
I just surround myself with people who make me happy,</v>

426
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.720
but I call that almost like if that's the case,

427
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:53.210
then you've kind of forfeit the right to be mad at me for having a different

428
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:56.630
opinion because if you're not going to come and to the table and and understand

429
00:23:56.631 --> 00:24:00.320
what my opinion is and and have an and have a conversation with me about where

430
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:01.101
I'm coming from,

431
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:04.670
then I mean you kind of lose the right to make up your mind about what I think

432
00:24:04.671 --> 00:24:07.580
and believe.
That's a very good point.
It's a very good point.

433
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.540
As long as you look at it reasonably and as long as you look at it objectively

434
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:14.750
and saying,
how am I getting anything good out of this?
Like for example,

435
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.340
you arguing with these people online that you don't want to argue with you.

436
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.960
You go to their Twitter feed,
look at what they're saying to you and you go,

437
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:23.210
what am I doing?
Should I might getting involved with them?

438
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:26.390
I don't want to engage with this person because it's pointless to me.

439
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.580
Like in that sense like,
well no,

440
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:30.680
you don't need to let that person into your life.

441
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:35.681
And if you read some ridiculous inflammatory stupid shit that someone's writing,

442
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:40.430
you can make a a value choice.
You can make a choice.
Like you know what,

443
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.270
my time is very valuable and I just,
I'm going to defend this guy.

444
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.410
I don't want to be involved.

445
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:50.150
But there is something that's going on in this culture that I think is happening

446
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:54.800
because of this incredible new ability to communicate and form these groups of

447
00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:55.790
likeminded people.

448
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.780
When you get this massive confirmation bias and these groups and because of that

449
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:04.460
they,
they reject outright any notion of debate upon these issues.

450
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.000
And this is a big problem right now in universities.
Yeah.

451
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.940
It's a huge problem where people don't want to be offended and they're trying to

452
00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:14.750
create safe spaces and they're trying to create places where you,

453
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.500
you can't say things that they might think are offensive,

454
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:21.740
but you might think are totally reasonable.
Like your tweet,

455
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:26.660
like your tweet in a lot of universities with thought to be would be deemed

456
00:25:26.661 --> 00:25:30.980
incredibly offensive.
Even though it's,
it's a legitimate subject of debate.

457
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.820
It's a legitimate subject of debate.
Like why,
why try to change us old fuck,

458
00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:37.070
he's going to be dead in a month.
Like what do you give a shit?

459
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.650
Why are we wasting energy on this exact so many bigger issues that we face every

460
00:25:40.651 --> 00:25:43.820
day that you can fall into a lot of war right now?

461
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.870
And yet we're worrying about Donald fucking sterling.
Yeah.
You know,
and,
and,

462
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:49.280
and anytime that you say that now,

463
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:52.040
like you run the risk of just Joe Rogan a racist is he don't care about race

464
00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:54.860
relations in the United States.
And it's like that,
that's not the point.

465
00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:00.170
But you don't run that risk.
That's not true.
You run that risk with idiots.

466
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.140
It's not a reasonable risk,
you know?
It shouldn't be.

467
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.390
It shouldn't be and it's not.
It's not,

468
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:09.860
and that's where your company fucked up because that's,
it's not a reasonable,

469
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.480
if you look at what you wrote,

470
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.570
what firing someone for that is not a reasonable reaction.

471
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.040
If you look at what you wrote,

472
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.570
being infuriated at you and wanting your job and wanting your head,

473
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.280
why don't you to pay in one you to publicly apologize.

474
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.980
That's not a reasonable reaction either.

475
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.950
This idea that everyone has to acquiesce,

476
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.990
that everyone has to bow down to the masses and then anytime there's anything

477
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:35.960
controversial,
you're best off just keeping your mouth shut.

478
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.860
You best off just not communicating and not projecting your thoughts for,

479
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:44.550
for for fear of other people disagreeing and then the hate and the anger

480
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.500
<v 1>secure.
You're just,
what does that world look like?</v>

481
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:48.420
Diluted down generation over generation.

482
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.330
Is that really the world you would want to be in South America?
I tell you that.

483
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:57.090
That's not my America.
Yeah,
it's a land of pussies.
It's ridiculous.
It's just,

484
00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.210
you said the confirmation confirmation bias is probably the best way to put it.

485
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.950
It's all,
it's also,
it's also the,
no pun intended,
the black,

486
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.360
the way we look at it,
black and white,
we look at it like there's no,

487
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.450
there's no gray area with a lot of these people.
So it,
there's um,

488
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.800
in gaming and other biggest year and I was feminism and Gamergate and um,

489
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.030
and so the,
you know,
you,
you take a,
a feminist activist who sang some stuff.

490
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.430
And if you are too,
which by the way,

491
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.090
let's say I wholly support equal rights,
gender equality,

492
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:25.560
all to all forms of quality,
I think,

493
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:28.650
I think people should be deemed as who they are as people and what they're

494
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:30.540
saying and what they're bringing to the world doesn't matter about your age,

495
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:34.290
gender,
sexual orientation,
nothing.
So the,
the,
um,

496
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.680
but let's say that I'm talking to a feminist and she says something that I think

497
00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:40.500
is just wrong.
I think it's a,
it's a bad opinion.

498
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:43.980
It's an opinion form based on a bias or it's a,
it's an invalid stat.

499
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.160
And I argue with her for one second.
I'm immediately a misogynist.

500
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.750
I'm immediately a sexist because I opposed one point of her platform and now

501
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:53.490
suddenly I'm the antibiotic again,

502
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.630
again only to idiots and only two people that aren't looking at things

503
00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:01.650
objectively and only if people that are coming into it with a bias in the first

504
00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:03.690
place.
But it's it just,
is it just idiots because let's say,

505
00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:04.920
let's say you're that feminist,
right?

506
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:07.590
Let's see here that activist and let's say you're a really smart person and

507
00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:11.280
you've done a lot of research and you're just,
you're so,
you're,

508
00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:14.790
you're a smart person,
but you're so invested in your mission,

509
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:18.060
you're so invested in what you're fighting for that you forget just for one

510
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:19.320
minute,
for one minute,

511
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:23.100
you forget that there's another side to it that there's other perspectives.

512
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.410
Is that the way of looking at other ways of looking at an issue,

513
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.860
even just for one second and you say something and then a bunch of people

514
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:31.710
retweeted and then it looks bad for the guy.
You know,

515
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.740
in a way that person who's the smart person technically influenced a lot of that

516
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.220
like negative shit from it from happening that then transpired.

517
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:44.700
And so in a lot of ways it's like having a conversation with even the smart

518
00:28:44.701 --> 00:28:46.890
people.
We think that they're leading activism and they're leading,

519
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.720
they're leading the charge on things.
You know,

520
00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:52.680
it's trying to educate that tier of people who can be spoken to reasonably to

521
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:55.260
understand that like,
you know,
you need,

522
00:28:55.261 --> 00:28:57.120
you need to be more open minded in the sec.

523
00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:01.070
The second that you push someone away,
you're already,
you're already like,
uh,

524
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.580
like abandoning your cause.

525
00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:04.600
Your costs should be bringing more people in the secondary,

526
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.370
you react to what someone else said and you push them away like that.
You're,

527
00:29:08.371 --> 00:29:10.800
you're technical.
You know,
you're the one not technically you're,

528
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.240
you're the one doing the wrong thing.
Well,

529
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:14.790
the problem with this conversation right now is that it's kind of vague and

530
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.850
we're not talking about very specific statements that could be debated on their

531
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:22.530
merit.
W versus this idea of,
uh,

532
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:25.730
immediately using an ad hominem.
Like you're a massage NIST I,

533
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.020
that is the best way to shut down any sort of debate.

534
00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.490
I immediately call you a racist,
sexist.
I mean that's,

535
00:29:32.491 --> 00:29:36.040
that is the,
that's the feminism playbook.
The,

536
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.010
the dumb feminism playbook,

537
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.010
not the intelligent feminists that look at the reality of the

538
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:47.010
<v 0>world and see qual inequality and want to correct that and don't hate men.</v>

539
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:52.681
Like there was this woman that was doing something for Google ideas or I forget

540
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:56.560
what the exact thing was,
but she was arguing with people on Twitter.

541
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:01.560
And one of the things you said is,
I eat men for breakfast.
Like,
well,

542
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.570
why should that be?
Yeah,
you're a fucking ridiculous human.

543
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.260
What you eat every one of the opposite gender.
So are you in a,
at a war,

544
00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.790
you were in a gender war.
It's like,
is this,
do you want to make,

545
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.470
create a quality for women?

546
00:30:14.471 --> 00:30:19.471
Or do you actually want to make up for all the men who rejected you or shit on

547
00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:23.890
your,
dumped you or broke your heart or or whatever or whatever it is.

548
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.150
What is it?
Is it,
you have picked a team and you're fighting for that team,

549
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.780
like the dolphins versus the 40 niners because that's what it seems like and

550
00:30:31.781 --> 00:30:35.830
that is what it is.
It's Mac versus windows.
I mean it's,

551
00:30:35.831 --> 00:30:40.630
it's fucking android versus iPhone.
People pick fucking teams.

552
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.580
They get crazy.
It Chicago versus New York.
Fuck Hill.
I'm from San Francisco.

553
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.640
It's the same goddamn thing.
And you decide,
you know,

554
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:52.990
I'm a feminism and feminism man fucking suck.
Yeah.
Well no,

555
00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:56.260
men don't suck.
Men are humans,
you know,
and women don't suck either.

556
00:30:56.261 --> 00:30:59.290
They're humans.
Individuals in each gender suck.

557
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.440
And the idea that you're going to be on team vagina and it doesn't have any

558
00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:07.040
rotten players,
you're fucking crazy.
You're crazy.
You're instantly crazy.
If,

559
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.240
if any man tries to say that,
all men are amazing,

560
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.590
that guy's a fucking idiot.
Right?
Like what are you looking around?
Are you,

561
00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.920
are you talking to people?
Have you looked at history?

562
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.810
Have you taken a poll recently of the opinions of these fucking guys with decks?

563
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:28.330
There's a lot of guys who are shithead,
shithead,
Donald Sterling's one of them.

564
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:32.650
And Michelle heads maybe.
I mean,
I don't know.
I mean,
based on what you said,

565
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:36.180
especially in a quilt in issues of equality,
yes,
there's no,

566
00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.000
No side should be losing one site doesn't have to when Niggas on the other side

567
00:31:40.001 --> 00:31:43.300
having to lose like that shouldn't be on teams.
It should be the human race.

568
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:47.230
Right.
You know,
I,
there's big fans of a lot of women.

569
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:50.830
I think a lot of women have achieved some fucking incredible,
amazing thing.

570
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.680
And I think there's a lot of men that I think a disgusting,
right?

571
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:56.620
There's a lot of men I think are losers and they're annoying and they make

572
00:31:56.621 --> 00:31:59.890
excuses for their failures and they,
it's never about them.

573
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:01.930
It's always about they got fucked over it.
Like,
oh,

574
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:05.720
they're fucking brutal and boring and tiresome.
And,
and they,

575
00:32:05.721 --> 00:32:08.830
they are roadblocks.
The roadblocks for conversations.

576
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.350
They are blood clots for progress.

577
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.980
I mean there's a lot of people like that out there.
Well both genders.

578
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.700
And I think that,
you know,
this whole idea of feminism and you know,

579
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:22.340
one of the things that happened that I thought it was really hilarious,
um,

580
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.880
I don't remember what it was about,

581
00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:28.690
but I retweeted something cause I retweet tweet things that are provocative with

582
00:32:28.691 --> 00:32:29.650
Ar.
I don't agree with them.

583
00:32:29.651 --> 00:32:32.710
I don't believe that a retweet should be an endorsement,
I think.

584
00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:36.040
But it triggers thought it makes pants have a thought in their head for one

585
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:40.880
moment of the day.
So this woman who was a feminist called me an Mra.

586
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.620
So what's the fuck is that?
So I had to Google it.
It's a men's rights activist.

587
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.150
So I'm like,
hold on.

588
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.500
Are you really mocking me for supporting men's rights?

589
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:54.890
When you're a feminist,
like a youth,
you're mocking it.

590
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.910
You're openly mocking the idea of men's rights.

591
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.780
But meanwhile you're supporting female rights.

592
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:07.520
This is preposterous.
You're a crazy person.
You're a crazy person.

593
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:09.260
Lost in this constant struggle.

594
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.810
And then I went to her Twitter page and checked her out.
Of course,

595
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:16.550
she's morbidly obese and she has pink hair,
so she's,
she's a mess.
Right.

596
00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.120
But that,

597
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.980
that's the real cause of all this strife and anxiety and anger.

598
00:33:21.981 --> 00:33:25.340
It has virtually nothing to do with the issue itself.
These are,

599
00:33:25.341 --> 00:33:28.400
these issues become greenlights for some people,
for some people.
Yeah.

600
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.600
I completely agree.
In that particular case,
it was certainly true,

601
00:33:32.601 --> 00:33:36.920
but I think that this,
this feminism in gaming thing,
like,

602
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.870
boy,
I don't,
I've,
I've looked at both sides of this,
this,

603
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.530
it's convoluted on both ends.

604
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.820
Yet the hate that these women who were involved in video game development have

605
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:50.180
gotten from men is fucking disgusting.
Of course.
I mean,

606
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.110
the harassment and then people say,
oh,
the death threats aren't even real.
Like,

607
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:58.850
what the fuck ever.
They still get them,
you know?
I mean,
if,
and,
and they're,

608
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.050
and they're not just,
it's not just,
I'm going to kill you.
It's so dark.

609
00:34:02.051 --> 00:34:05.450
It's so toxic.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

610
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.420
there's way more violence being directed at them,
you know,

611
00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.920
whether it's real or not,
but I didn't print that.

612
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:17.000
It is directed at the men that are supposedly the oppressors.
Right.
You know,

613
00:34:17.001 --> 00:34:20.510
you're not seeing like a bunch of women saying we should get together and cut

614
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:23.540
all these guys' dicks off and stuffed them down their mouth and make them choke

615
00:34:23.541 --> 00:34:26.300
to death on it.
But this,

616
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.290
this whole fucking battle like at the,
at the root of it all,

617
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:35.000
it should be a battle about what we should be developing.

618
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.710
Games should be about what is the best way to make a really quality game that

619
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:43.280
people are going to enjoy and what is the best way that all these people can

620
00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.840
interact with each other.
It shouldn't be about like,

621
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.860
well we need 10 women because we have 10 men and the women should have an equal

622
00:34:48.861 --> 00:34:52.430
say because I know the men shouldn't even have an equal say now your,
your,

623
00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:55.040
your ideas should stand on their own merit.

624
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.070
I hate the idea of quotas it across most issues when you,

625
00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.830
especially when you talking about like police having quotas for the number of,

626
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.710
of certain races they need to investigate.
That's wrong.

627
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:06.740
And at the same time on the other side with,
with this issue,
it's like,
yeah,

628
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:11.390
I hate the idea that you need to hire so many of these people just because,

629
00:35:11.391 --> 00:35:13.160
right.
Just just to keep the balance equal.

630
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.130
It's a horse shit did and it's th there's,
there's some real clear,
um,

631
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.280
areas in life where,
you know,
it's a horseshit idea.
The NFL is one of them.

632
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.360
Okay.

633
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.470
If there was a quota in the NFL where the NFL needed a certain amount of women

634
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:32.060
to play as linebackers,
sure.
Do you know how fucked up football would be?
Right.

635
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.350
If you needed to have,
you know,
how many linebackers are there?
Three.

636
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.220
If you needed to have at least one woman,
we do,
you know,

637
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:44.460
fucking horrific and preposterous.
Those games would be,

638
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.910
everybody would just shoot threatened straight for the chick and run her over.

639
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.500
Right.
And then you'd be accused of sexism because you,

640
00:35:50.501 --> 00:35:54.160
you keep giving that girl concussions,
but that it's,

641
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.920
she's not qualified for that position.

642
00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:00.810
That position belongs to some square jawed fuckhead from Indiana who's been

643
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:04.950
taken steroids since he was a baby.
That's,
that's the guy you want for that job.

644
00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.530
You want some 500 pound fucking gorilla,

645
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:11.100
it's going to stop people from crossing that space.
That's,
that's it.
That's,

646
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:15.330
that's in,
that's the clearest example of a quota.

647
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.400
And the same could be said creatively,
like the idea that you,

648
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.540
you want a certain amount of women or a certain amount of men and nonsense

649
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:28.260
nonsense.
What is the content?
What is the quality of your ideas?

650
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.520
How much time do you spend focusing on these ideas?
Which,

651
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.750
which by the way has nothing to do.

652
00:36:33.751 --> 00:36:36.900
It's not like what you're saying is that women aren't as capable of doing that

653
00:36:36.901 --> 00:36:40.350
job.
But what you're saying is there may not,
it's not about that.

654
00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:43.200
It's about who's in front of you at the time and who do you want to put in that

655
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.490
position and,
and where are your,
you know,
what,

656
00:36:45.491 --> 00:36:47.400
what are you going to care about at the end of the day,

657
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.470
you're going to care about the contribution that's being made.

658
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.370
There's this amazing interview that Ronda Rousey did recently in Australia cause

659
00:36:53.371 --> 00:36:54.880
she's supposed to be fighting.
Um,

660
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.230
well she is fighting in a couple of weeks in Australia and it's the biggest UFC

661
00:36:58.231 --> 00:37:01.260
event ever headlined by a woman.
Okay.

662
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.410
70,000 seats in Australia.

663
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.700
And this woman does this interview or does this question,
sorry,

664
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:12.810
this is a media scrum and she says,
um,

665
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:17.530
how do you feel we were having an issue here in Australia with,
uh,

666
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.400
equality of pay for women's football.

667
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:25.020
How do you feel about equality of pay in the UFC?

668
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:29.010
And this is why it's such a stupid question because she makes more money than

669
00:37:29.011 --> 00:37:33.540
anyone in the sport.
She's the number one earner in the UFC.
And she goes,
look,

670
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:38.850
I get paid the most out of anyone in the UFC and I'm a woman and I don't get

671
00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:41.190
paid that much because Dana and Lorenzo,

672
00:37:41.191 --> 00:37:45.150
the owners of the company wanted to do something nice for the ladies.
She's like,

673
00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:48.930
I get paid the most because I put the most asses in the seats and more people

674
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:51.270
want to come to see me because I'm the best,
you know.

675
00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:54.870
And when she said that everybody cheered and they were Boone when this lady had

676
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:57.450
this question.
But her question is preposterous.
Yeah,

677
00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.920
it's a ridiculous question because you're,

678
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.740
you're talking to the number one earner in his board who happens to have a

679
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:04.200
vagina.
Right.
You know,
it's,
it's the,

680
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.300
she got there through the quality of her work and the amount of eyes that she

681
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:12.930
attracts because of that work.
That's,
it's that simple.

682
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.540
It's that simple that what she's been able to do,
the,

683
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.490
the outlier status that she has been,

684
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:20.910
this beautiful woman that kicks people's asses had being unusual.

685
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.800
It generates a significant amount of money,

686
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.920
so much money that she makes more money than anybody else.

687
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:30.300
So this idea that like you're supposed to pay women the same amount that you pay

688
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:34.020
men.
Well,
well what if only half the people go to see the women?

689
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.670
Do you still have pay them the same amount?
Well,

690
00:38:36.671 --> 00:38:39.670
that's a shitty business model because then you're not gonna make as much money.

691
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:43.750
<v 1>Yeah.
It's,
that's a tough way.
I mean,
it's,
it's a tough way to look at it.</v>

692
00:38:43.751 --> 00:38:47.620
It's a tough concept to unpack for a lot of people.
I feel like,

693
00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.090
<v 0>I don't know why.
I mean they think that,
you know,</v>

694
00:38:50.091 --> 00:38:54.410
it's supposed to be one for you and one for me.
No,
it's a competition,
right.

695
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.300
When you get out into the marketplace.
Yeah,

696
00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.960
<v 1>the same.
The,
the,
the,
I think the most,</v>

697
00:38:57.961 --> 00:39:01.080
the example that resonated best with me was the,
um,
uh,

698
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:04.080
the Jennifer Lawrence thing where,
where she did you read about that?

699
00:39:04.081 --> 00:39:05.940
Where she was,
there's the huge,
uh,

700
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.390
she wrote a big open letter about how she didn't get paid as much as Bradley

701
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.520
Cooper did a during the American also movie and,
and,

702
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:17.520
and for a whole bunch of reasons.
Uh,
and,
and,
and,
okay.
That's fair.
I am.

703
00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:19.170
Okay.
I want to hear,
I want to hear the argument right.

704
00:39:19.171 --> 00:39:22.640
But the argument that I heard was,
was incomplete.
Right.
Um,

705
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.440
how about the number of lines?
Both of them spoke in the movie,
right?

706
00:39:25.441 --> 00:39:29.060
How about the number of minutes both of them spent on screen in the movie?
Um,

707
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.130
how about the number of days she even went to work compared to the number of

708
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.820
days he went to work to be on set and to do filming.
Right.
And,

709
00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.130
and so when you look at that quantitatively,
you go,
well,
why,

710
00:39:38.131 --> 00:39:42.630
why wouldn't you be paid the same amount as him for for a fourth or fifth lead

711
00:39:42.631 --> 00:39:44.760
role in that movie?
Right.
When you look at it quantitatively,

712
00:39:44.761 --> 00:39:49.020
she actually got paid more per minute than he did.
Sure.
There you go.
And,
and,

713
00:39:49.021 --> 00:39:51.390
and then so,
and then what you don't hear her talking about,
of course.

714
00:39:51.391 --> 00:39:53.820
And I don't,
I don't like this argument either cause there's no,
again,

715
00:39:53.821 --> 00:39:55.530
there's no reason that like they need to,

716
00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.470
the other side needs to lose for one side to when it shouldn't be about that.

717
00:39:58.471 --> 00:40:00.210
But of course then you look at like the,

718
00:40:00.211 --> 00:40:03.060
the new movie that she's in where she's getting paid more than any of her male

719
00:40:03.061 --> 00:40:07.710
costars and you don't talk about that.
Right.
And,
and so it's almost like this,
we,

720
00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:08.603
we,

721
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.090
we get angry and outraged about things when they're convenient to be angry and

722
00:40:12.091 --> 00:40:13.140
outraged about.
And we don't,

723
00:40:13.141 --> 00:40:15.990
we don't call it out on the bullshit when it's the double standard,

724
00:40:15.991 --> 00:40:17.400
when it's on the other side of that curve.

725
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.460
<v 0>Well I give her a pass because the whole world saw her asshole and it wasn't her</v>

726
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:26.290
idea.
You know?
I mean,
I think she's probably emotionally wrecked because of that.

727
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:29.560
And there's also probably a lot of people in our ear telling her she got fucked

728
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:32.320
over and agents and managers and a lot of people

729
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.810
<v 1>you could go out and you,
and you can,
you can talk about this,</v>

730
00:40:34.811 --> 00:40:38.020
this is the right time to talk about this.
Right.
And again,
that's that,

731
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:41.260
that's that smart people who have figured out how to manipulate the masses

732
00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:44.530
emotions into,
into getting profit,
into getting eyeballs,

733
00:40:44.531 --> 00:40:47.340
into getting ratings and to getting good things for that.
And I,

734
00:40:47.341 --> 00:40:48.250
I'm always against that.

735
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.420
<v 0>Well,
the argument is interesting.
You know,
the argument is very interesting.</v>

736
00:40:51.421 --> 00:40:55.680
Like who should get be getting paid what and why should you be getting paid
more?

737
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.250
But the reality is you're going to have a really hard time getting sympathetic

738
00:40:59.251 --> 00:41:04.200
voices or sympathetic ears rather when you're making millions of dollars,

739
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.711
like,
oh,

740
00:41:04.711 --> 00:41:08.430
I'm only making 2 million while he's making four or whatever the fuck it was

741
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.280
like,
boy,
cry me a river,

742
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.980
you're making millions of dollars and you want people to feel bad.

743
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:18.090
Like that's kind of ridiculous.
And if you look at it in terms of the number of,

744
00:41:18.091 --> 00:41:21.870
like you said the number of hours that she was onscreen,
but who knows?

745
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.170
Who knows why she said that?
Who knows?
I mean she,
she actually,

746
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.890
she got shit on by this reporter or wants,

747
00:41:28.891 --> 00:41:31.860
cause she was at some award show and she was drunk and he wrote something about

748
00:41:31.861 --> 00:41:34.550
it and she had some response.
They know to,

749
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.980
you know why she did it and you know,

750
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.270
fuck this guy and like you're really worried about me because I got drunk at

751
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:44.910
award show,
like fuck off and it,
and she's right.
It gets 100% right.

752
00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.310
And would she have gotten that grief if she was a man?
I say no.

753
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:52.430
If you know,
fucking fill in the blank.

754
00:41:52.431 --> 00:41:56.030
If Brad Pitt had a couple of drinks at some award show and he was liquored up

755
00:41:56.031 --> 00:41:59.480
and laugh and,
and being ridiculous,
he could say,
hey,

756
00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:03.110
I was just fucked up at that award show and I had a good time,
but whoops,

757
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.530
what did I say?
And no one's going to say,
boy,
I'm really worried about Brad Pitt.

758
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:10.730
So no one's,
no one's saying that inequality doesn't exist.
It definitely exists.

759
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.780
And as long as we're having pragmatic conversations about it and we're staring

760
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:17.360
it in the face because it is an ugly issue,
it's a scary issue.

761
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.410
But as long as we're not taking teams and rattling palm POVs,

762
00:42:21.411 --> 00:42:23.330
as long as we're not,
we're not just just,

763
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.820
just cutting off the lines and making boundaries.

764
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:28.580
As long as we're constantly having that conversation and we're not looking for

765
00:42:28.581 --> 00:42:31.670
someone else to get hurt in the process of having that conversation,

766
00:42:31.671 --> 00:42:34.820
then as long as we're still talking about it,
we're going to be making progress.

767
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.740
I think what you just said is so important,

768
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:40.910
as long as you don't want other people to get hurt.
Yeah.
That.

769
00:42:40.911 --> 00:42:43.270
I think that's a really important point of it that you,

770
00:42:43.271 --> 00:42:45.980
you don't want to hurt the other people.
What?

771
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:50.240
You don't want to hurt team dick in order to prop up team vagina.
Yeah.
Don't,

772
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:52.690
don't make me scared.
Don't make me scared to participate.

773
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.280
After that whole Donald Sterling thing with me,
I was,

774
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:59.420
I absolutely was scared for like months.
Like maybe I shouldn't tweet anymore.

775
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.230
But of course I came back to my senses and I thought that's ridiculous.

776
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.820
I shouldn't,
I shouldn't feel that way.

777
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:08.010
I shouldn't be pushing away from the table because some,
you know,

778
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:12.440
bad shit happened to me.
I that made me want to talk about things even more.

779
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:17.630
I mean this and then wanting to to make people learn that that's not the way you

780
00:43:17.631 --> 00:43:20.570
get your way or that's not the way that you make a point is by bringing someone

781
00:43:20.571 --> 00:43:21.710
else down.
Yeah.

782
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:26.770
Well I think it's also companies get scared and they get scared of backlash and

783
00:43:28.101 --> 00:43:32.450
boycotts and they make executive decisions and those executive decisions are

784
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:35.450
oftentimes only made in those,

785
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:39.560
in that context and the large company form.
Like that's the only time.

786
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.290
Like if there's just a couple of people,
like you're saying you don't see it.

787
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.470
Yeah,
I don't see it.
Oh,
but I'm not going to see it.

788
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.320
I don't care if I said something like that and people got upset,
I would go,
oh,

789
00:43:49.321 --> 00:43:52.100
I have to go.
Whatever.
I just let I do.
I'd say something else.

790
00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:54.350
I'd say something even more outrageous.
I would keep it going.

791
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:58.460
I don't care because I'm not going to get,
if I get fired by the UFC,
a bug.

792
00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:02.900
Oh well hey guys,
loved working for you.
Still support the company.
Great time.

793
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:05.750
But I'm doing five other things at the same time and one of the reasons why I do

794
00:44:05.751 --> 00:44:07.670
that,
it's I do it.
It's calculated.

795
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.830
I don't like only having one job because I don't like worrying about losing that

796
00:44:12.831 --> 00:44:14.330
job.
I don't want to worry about shit,

797
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.440
especially if I have to worry about something that would impede on my ability to

798
00:44:18.441 --> 00:44:21.350
speak freely.
Right.
I'm not interested,
you know?

799
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.360
That's why I'm not interested in network gigs.

800
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:27.320
Those are not fun because you have to fucking watch everything you say.

801
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.360
They want to take over your social media account.
You know,

802
00:44:29.361 --> 00:44:31.070
that's what happens when you get on a television show.

803
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.930
They want to be able to tweet for you.
They want your pee.

804
00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:37.770
Like I was talking to Arsenio Hall recently and you know he had that Arsenio

805
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:42.600
Hall show.
Yep.
That came back and he can't get it onto his Facebook.

806
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.050
He couldn't use his Twitter like they owned it.
A lot of youtubers are,

807
00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:47.580
are going through the same stuff right now too.

808
00:44:47.581 --> 00:44:50.550
A lot of youtubers who are assigning TV deals are coming back and going,
this is,

809
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:53.700
this is not what I wanted for my brand in my audience.
Right,
exactly.

810
00:44:53.701 --> 00:44:54.840
They're stealing your,

811
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:58.950
your people and then they tweet for you and they want you to tweet promotional

812
00:44:58.951 --> 00:45:01.110
things and they want you to,
you know,

813
00:45:01.111 --> 00:45:05.550
promote your show and live tweet your show and we'll,
we'll do it for use.

814
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.060
They're going to do it in your voice.
This is amazing what I did this,

815
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.330
but it's not even you.
You get someone else saying that,
you know,

816
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:14.490
and I'm very adamant about if you,

817
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.250
there's just automatic tweets that'll happen on my page.

818
00:45:17.251 --> 00:45:19.230
Like if something gets uploaded to youtube,

819
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.970
but if you see an opinion and if there's an opinion or a joke,

820
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.200
even if at the joke fails,
that's coming from my little fat fingers.
That's it.

821
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.760
That's the only way I would do it.
And I,

822
00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.700
I think that it's what I loved what I tweeted you too.

823
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:35.940
I think I asked about like your producer for the show and you're like,
dude,

824
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:38.520
it's me.
Like what?
Like you're talking to me right now.

825
00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:41.660
You're not talking to some other person.
Well that you know means Jamie.

826
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:45.120
Jamie's over there.
You could talk to him.
But I just think that,

827
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.510
I just think we live in a strange time and it's very important during this

828
00:45:50.511 --> 00:45:54.540
strange time to keep your sanity and to,

829
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:58.350
to keep your ability to express yourself.
Because like you said,

830
00:45:58.351 --> 00:46:01.770
as soon as you are afraid of speaking your opinion,
if as long as,

831
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.880
as soon as you think about typing something that you really believe in and he'd

832
00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:07.980
say,
you know what,
it's not worth the risk.

833
00:46:07.981 --> 00:46:11.610
I would like to keep these ones and Zeros showing up in my bank account.

834
00:46:11.611 --> 00:46:14.760
Let me just back off that.
Who are you then?
Right?
Because you're not,

835
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.580
you're not who you are.
You're a slave.
You're a slave to the system.

836
00:46:17.581 --> 00:46:21.180
The cliched phrase,
right?
So at that point you're a slave to the system and look,

837
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.540
look down three or four generations down the line of that and what does it look

838
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:26.160
like that it's not a place that I want to live.

839
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.140
We're all just these like diluted down versions of each other that are identical

840
00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:33.870
in the same and don't have opinions and voices like that's don't want to hear

841
00:46:33.871 --> 00:46:36.660
that either.
They want to hear those tweets or read those tweets.

842
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.570
When you write something like that and they go,
yeah,
that is fucked up.

843
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:44.130
This chick just recorded him and then not just recorded but broadcast it to the

844
00:46:44.131 --> 00:46:47.070
world,
sold it to whatever outlets or somebody did.

845
00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.620
Everyone ended up saying what I said,
I was ahead of the,

846
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:52.760
I was way ahead of the curve.
I said it like,
like the day after it all happened.

847
00:46:52.761 --> 00:46:53.594
Right.
And I was the first,

848
00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:56.660
I was the first one through the breach and I got fucking slammed for it.
Right.

849
00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:00.540
Yeah.
Everybody ended up ultimately having that opinion about it.
And,

850
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.500
and yet the end of the day,
like she,
you know,
she know then.
Then she got sued by,

851
00:47:04.501 --> 00:47:09.090
um,
by his now ex wife because she was getting showered with gifts that were from

852
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:13.230
her estate and all sorts of,
and it's like,
yeah,
you gotta realize that it all,

853
00:47:13.231 --> 00:47:16.650
this is hearsay by the way.
I don't know anything about the,
the facts,

854
00:47:16.651 --> 00:47:21.450
but legit leads a good word,
allegedly.
You got to imagine that she,
uh,
that,
that,

855
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:25.650
you know,
something was like,
like you got to imagine that she was like,

856
00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.380
was trying to get some money from,

857
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.870
from instead of releasing those tapes that sterling was like fuck off.
Like,

858
00:47:30.871 --> 00:47:32.320
like do whatever you want with the tapes,
right?
Yeah.

859
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.910
Like I can totally see how that happened.

860
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:35.800
Maybe not like maybe that's not how it went down,

861
00:47:35.801 --> 00:47:38.790
but I could totally see that playing out like some episode of the entourage,

862
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.860
right.
Where it's like,
um,
where,

863
00:47:40.861 --> 00:47:44.530
where you just don't know how the motives were not pure.
Yeah.

864
00:47:44.531 --> 00:47:47.560
And episode the entourage,
but funny.
It's different.
Well,

865
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:53.320
I think what's going on with,
with her and him is she's getting,

866
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.290
look,
it's prostitution.
It's really clear and simple.
I mean there's,

867
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.310
she's not fucking that guy.
She thinks she's hot.

868
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.290
Like if you're having sex with someone,

869
00:48:02.291 --> 00:48:05.350
you should probably be attracted to them or be getting something out of it.

870
00:48:05.351 --> 00:48:07.780
But we love that.
We love the reality of the way there.
The life.

871
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.650
Real life is like become an episode of any reality TV show that you've seen and

872
00:48:11.651 --> 00:48:14.170
people in for the same reason that realities do you get.
It's so successful.

873
00:48:14.171 --> 00:48:14.780
People love.

874
00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.890
It's why Donald Trump's campaign is so successful right now because it's a

875
00:48:17.891 --> 00:48:22.000
living,
breathing incarnation of reality TV.
You're absolutely right.

876
00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:24.850
100% and we love it and we support it and we vote and we say yes.

877
00:48:24.851 --> 00:48:26.380
Just like we would vote for reality TV.

878
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.810
Well it makes it exciting all of a sudden instead of someone saying some can

879
00:48:30.811 --> 00:48:34.450
shit that,
you know,
a team of speech writers where he's like,

880
00:48:34.451 --> 00:48:37.870
I want to put up a wall to Mexico and put my name on it.
Like what the fuck?

881
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.650
You know,
he comes exciting and essentially his NBA team,
did we?
No.

882
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.330
Does he have one?
W would if we did,
but it's a,
he's,
it's a year away.

883
00:48:46.331 --> 00:48:48.400
So right now it's just fun.
It's just fun,

884
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:52.540
silliness until it gets down to whatever fucking corporate criminals they're

885
00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:54.850
actually going to put into the position of actually running the country.

886
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:58.370
So right now it is reality TV.
It's what it is,

887
00:48:58.371 --> 00:49:00.940
is it's the most interesting game in town right now.

888
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.930
It's a sport that everybody has to watch for whatever fucking reason.

889
00:49:04.931 --> 00:49:07.790
You at least have to know the score.
Yeah.
I mean that's,

890
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.700
they also ultimately comes back to the mainstream media.

891
00:49:09.701 --> 00:49:12.040
They're the ones who are,
are technically leading the charge.

892
00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:15.580
They're the ones who everybody has kind of queuing off of and everybody's being

893
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.170
being influenced by,

894
00:49:17.171 --> 00:49:20.020
and that's also something that I'm constantly going to be at odds with.

895
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.850
I'm always gonna fight that.
Yeah.

896
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:25.750
And mainstream media itself is just a money making machine.

897
00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:30.770
It's not like this idea that mainstream media news is actually their,

898
00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.570
their sole purpose is to disseminate information,

899
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:39.460
to educate the masses and to keep you informed about all the happenings in the

900
00:49:39.461 --> 00:49:42.850
world.
It gives shit that way.
It used to,
it used to be when it was broadcast,

901
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:45.850
when it was,
when it was,
what is the utility?
It was essentially a utility.
Well,

902
00:49:45.851 --> 00:49:49.420
it's still exist in the form of online journalism.
I mean,

903
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:53.470
what's going on now today when you see something like the Guardian printing that

904
00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:56.680
Ed Snowden,
all the,
the,
the,
the,
the revelations.

905
00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.930
When no one else wanted to touch it.
I mean,

906
00:49:58.931 --> 00:50:03.460
he went to other people first and they said no.
So that's real journalism.

907
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.001
When,

908
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:08.020
when someone print something incredibly controversial but something they think

909
00:50:08.021 --> 00:50:11.470
is important,
that's going to piss off the entire country.
Wiki leaks,

910
00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:13.870
that's real journalism.
But it happens.

911
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.170
It happens so infrequently because they were so scared.
They were terrified.

912
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:21.790
They should be Edward Snowden's living in Russia and a fucking homeboy,

913
00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:24.700
the Pale ghost with the fuck's his name,
Julian massage.

914
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:29.030
Julian Assange is holed up in a fucking embassy.
He can't leave.

915
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.750
He stuck in a house.
It's all madness.
It's all madness.
I mean,

916
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:36.680
those two people are arguably two of the most important figures of the 21st

917
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:40.940
century when it comes to establishing what is the current state of the

918
00:50:40.941 --> 00:50:42.950
government when it comes to surveillance,

919
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:47.060
when it comes to the spreading of actual information about what's going on in

920
00:50:47.061 --> 00:50:48.980
the world,
where are we at?
Well,

921
00:50:48.981 --> 00:50:53.690
those two guys are responsible for two gigantic leaps of revelation where

922
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:56.900
everybody's had to stay.
Take a step back,
especially Edward Snowden.

923
00:50:56.901 --> 00:50:58.310
Everybody's had to take a step back.
No,

924
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:02.190
what the fuck is happening when I not a text message and my just texting Jamie

925
00:51:02.191 --> 00:51:04.910
and calling them a big queen or am I,

926
00:51:04.911 --> 00:51:07.250
am I going to get in trouble with people like what's going to happen?

927
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.420
Is someone going to read some of my joke texts to one of my friends,

928
00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.780
take it out of context and get me fired for that.
But that's,

929
00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.400
that's the world we live in today.

930
00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:20.390
We live in a very weird time and in these weird times,

931
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.710
the idea that CNN is going to kick you the fucking real deal,

932
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.200
they're going to drop the real knowledge on Fox News.

933
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:30.680
They don't give a fuck about you.
They're just trying to sell commercials.

934
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:34.040
It's all they're doing and every time that you click on one of those click baity

935
00:51:34.041 --> 00:51:34.431
articles,

936
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:37.190
every time you click on one of those sensational tweets and hit their page,

937
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:38.300
you're part of the problem.

938
00:51:38.301 --> 00:51:41.870
You're the one positively reinforcing that business model.
In a way.

939
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.240
I think honestly that it's beautiful that they operate in this way because

940
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:50.180
they're seeling their own demise.
I really do believe that.

941
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:55.070
I believe Fox News and CNN and all these people are ultimately they're on a path

942
00:51:55.071 --> 00:51:59.210
they can't get off and that path leads to being irrelevant.

943
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:02.990
It's going to happen as long as that burned though man.
Cause I know,
right,
right.

944
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:04.100
When social media came out,

945
00:52:04.101 --> 00:52:06.380
when Twitter was invented and when Facebook was invented,

946
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.110
people were saying the same thing.
They're like,
is this the end of two media?

947
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.220
How long has it been around?
Really a couple of years.

948
00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:16.160
In a couple of years we've seen some massive changes.

949
00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:20.810
I mean really incredible and,
and some bad like what happened to you.

950
00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:24.860
But I think that what that is is this new found ability,

951
00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.330
this new found ability that people didn't earn and they just have and they
don't.

952
00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.700
They're irresponsible with it.
They don't know what they're doing with it.

953
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:35.990
They also don't understand what communication would it,

954
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:38.570
what it really means to Bro.
And they don't,

955
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.470
they're not taking into account how other people going to perceive them.
Like,

956
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.730
here's a perfect example,
Justine sacco.
You know her story?
Yes.

957
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:50.600
Everyone knows her story.
If you don't know it.
She was a publicist,

958
00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:54.680
she was about to get on a plane to go to Africa and she goes,

959
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:59.060
I'm going to Africa.
Hope I don't get aids.
Just kidding.
I'm white,
lol.

960
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.440
And she went to sleep,
woke up in Africa,

961
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:08.530
fired and the whole world hated her and she deleted her Twitter account.

962
00:53:08.991 --> 00:53:11.210
And she still hasn't recovered.
I mean,
it doesn't,

963
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:13.820
you wish you worked for some game company now that just got in trouble.

964
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.850
What does it say it again?
Fan Duel.

965
00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:20.330
She works for Fan Abdul and she got in trouble recently.
What happened?

966
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:21.411
She didn't get in trouble.

967
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:24.510
Her name's just come out because they've gotten in trouble and she's,
well there,

968
00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.250
there are myths them as their publicist.

969
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:31.270
<v 1>Oh,
how hilarious is that?
You know?
Yeah.
They're there amidst to,</v>

970
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.510
it's Kinda,
it's Kinda like me whenever I come to another company.
Right.

971
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:33.841
It's like,

972
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:36.990
it's like I have to of course answer that question and people are talking about,

973
00:53:36.991 --> 00:53:40.080
oh,
it's Xyz company hired Josh Holen again.
Right?
Yeah.

974
00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:42.600
But what you said was nothing like what she said,

975
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:45.330
but what she said she had like fucking 10 followers.

976
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:46.860
She thought she was being funny.

977
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.260
Like she's probably on an Xanax or something like that.

978
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:52.950
She probably popped into the MBN joke,
whatever.
It's just shitty.
Joe.

979
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.050
We've all had shitty jokes.
You've had plenty in your life.
Career load.

980
00:53:56.950 --> 00:54:00.900
I'm not a comedian and I have shitty jokes at the time.
And Twitter,
you know,

981
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:03.420
it doesn't matter if you,

982
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:06.840
it doesn't matter if you don't agree with what she said you shouldn't want.

983
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:10.410
What happened to her to have happened to her.
Yes,
exactly.
And people wanted it.

984
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:13.590
They made it so badly they were calling for,
they were putting her head on a,

985
00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.520
on a pike and demanding it.
There was another girl,
I can't remember her name,

986
00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:19.140
but she,
she took a picture in front of,

987
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.770
she was at like the Arlington cemetery or something.
She,
she was uh,

988
00:54:22.771 --> 00:54:27.720
in front of a sign that said,
um,
I'm like,
no,
no shouting or some are quiet,

989
00:54:27.721 --> 00:54:31.950
please quiet,
quiet,
please be respectful or some sign like that.

990
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:34.830
And so she took a picture of Frederick wish she was like pretending like she was

991
00:54:34.831 --> 00:54:37.860
yelling.
Um,
and you know,

992
00:54:37.861 --> 00:54:40.210
just cause that's what she thought was finally now,

993
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:43.080
now she put it on line and it went crazy cause because people were talking about

994
00:54:43.081 --> 00:54:45.720
how she was disrespecting our troops and our soldiers and the last ones,
right.

995
00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.180
And then of course,
so she goes out and talks about it.
She goes,

996
00:54:48.181 --> 00:54:51.570
if you look at my page,
I,
that's just what I do.
Whenever I see a sign,

997
00:54:51.571 --> 00:54:54.480
when I see a sign that says no smoking,
I put up a fake cigarette in my lips.

998
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.840
When I see a sign that says no soliciting,
I pretend like I was listening it.

999
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:01.950
Her shtick is she just does the opposite thing that signs say.
And when you,

1000
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:05.370
when you understand that context,
you realize she's just being funny.
Why,

1001
00:55:05.371 --> 00:55:09.420
why would she lose her job over that?
But it's this odd,
she lose her job.
Uh,

1002
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.400
I don't know.
Actually.
I don't know enough about it.

1003
00:55:11.401 --> 00:55:14.490
I shouldn't be talking out of my ass right now,
but whatever,
whatever it was,

1004
00:55:14.491 --> 00:55:16.720
there was,
outreach is a big thing.
There's a big thing and that's why I had,

1005
00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.810
I had a comment out.
Of course I defended her,
um,

1006
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:23.760
and she was doing media and whatnot.
Of course,
it's so insane.
But again,

1007
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:25.890
it's just the green light.
It's all it is.

1008
00:55:25.891 --> 00:55:28.800
It's just content in the gas and they just,
I found one,

1009
00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:32.840
we found a target called show.
Oh fire.

1010
00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:36.890
<v 0>That's what it is.
When the Cecil,
the lion thing happened,</v>

1011
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:41.420
there was a New York Times article that a man from Zimbabwe road and it's a in

1012
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:43.730
Zimbabwe,
we do not cry for Lyons.

1013
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:46.760
And he talked about lions that have killed his family.

1014
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:51.200
The guy lost his leg to a poisonous snake bite.
The guy who wrote the article,

1015
00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:54.200
I mean,
he's like his,
his take was like,
look,
Africa,

1016
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:58.400
the wilds of Africa is not your friend is,
is,
it's fucking terrifying.

1017
00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.760
It's beautiful to behold,
but it is absolutely terrifying.

1018
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:06.170
So this idea that you call this lion's Cecil and that we're all crying because

1019
00:56:06.171 --> 00:56:09.710
we'd lost Cecil Fuck's he soul,
you know,
I mean that's what he's saying.

1020
00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:14.490
All I did,
I mean all I did was retweet that article.
Yeah.

1021
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:19.600
And I got so many fucking people that were angry with me.

1022
00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.271
What was the article?

1023
00:56:20.271 --> 00:56:23.270
It was the angle of the article and the article was in Zimbabwe.

1024
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.000
Do not cry for lions.
That was the title of the article.
It was written by,
um,

1025
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:32.350
I don't know if he was a student.
I forget what he,
but he's living in America,

1026
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:35.950
but he's from Zimbabwe.
Right.
And um,
well we don't,
we don't,
we don't understand.

1027
00:56:35.951 --> 00:56:39.520
We are,
are,
we have no perspective outside of our bubble that we live in.
Exactly.

1028
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.020
Well also,

1029
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:45.850
I mean this guy is just giving his point of view as a person who was from

1030
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:49.030
Zimbabwe.
You know,
I mean,
this is,
this is his,

1031
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:53.590
all I did was retweet the article.
If so many fucking people are angry at me,

1032
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.500
there was so mad at me,
I can't believe you're supporting this.

1033
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.920
You know what that guy did?
Is it,
he's a piece of shit and a murderer.

1034
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:02.840
And I like as if you just went and stepped on a kitten.
Yeah,
exactly.

1035
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.790
Hitting kittens with baseball bats over the fence into your yard.
Right?

1036
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:09.670
Like it's,
it's,
it's,
it's just the green one.
It's,
it's a,
it's an indoor,

1037
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.310
you're right,
it's great.
It's,
it's this endorphin drip that we seek.

1038
00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:16.750
And when we get it through this feedback loop of what we get it through,
anger,

1039
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:17.591
anger releases it,

1040
00:57:17.591 --> 00:57:22.030
and then we get it through the feedback loop of seeing someone else paying for

1041
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:24.670
something that youth they didn't,
it didn't agree with or that you didn't like.

1042
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.630
And I'm,
I'm sometimes too much of an optimist,

1043
00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:30.970
but I'm also,
uh,
I,

1044
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:36.020
I tried to look at things objectively outside the context of culture and what we

1045
00:57:36.461 --> 00:57:37.870
expect of today.

1046
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:42.970
And I look to the future and when I'm looking at is there is a trend and the

1047
00:57:42.971 --> 00:57:47.971
trend is from the moment that human beings invented language to the time they

1048
00:57:48.221 --> 00:57:51.940
started writing things down to the time they started distributing that written

1049
00:57:51.941 --> 00:57:56.500
word to the time they figured out how to broadcast and how to get ideas out

1050
00:57:56.501 --> 00:58:00.070
there through television and radio to the Internet.

1051
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:05.760
What I'm seeing is the trend is a shorter distance between human beings.

1052
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:07.630
There's a trend.

1053
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:12.310
The trend is connectivity and I think ultimately we're dealing with this

1054
00:58:12.311 --> 00:58:16.870
adolescent period in this kind of activity where all these people that have

1055
00:58:16.871 --> 00:58:20.230
never thought about the idea of progress put projecting these words.

1056
00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.560
Like if you get a guy like Brian Williams on TV and he's bullshit and about

1057
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:27.340
going to Iraq,
that's the guy that's responsible for his words.
Okay,

1058
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:29.470
that's the guy that's a professional broadcaster.

1059
00:58:29.471 --> 00:58:32.980
He should know what he's saying when he gets on television,

1060
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:37.390
he sees that red light.
He,
he's,
he's getting paid or do that.
He's getting paid.

1061
00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:41.230
He's,
he's prepared for it his entire fucking life.
Okay.

1062
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:46.210
That's a guy who understands the,
the,
the re,
the repercussions of his words.

1063
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:51.720
The average person has the same ability to reach human beings as Brian Williams.

1064
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:54.820
When Justine Sacco wrote that tweet,

1065
00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:59.970
she probably reached as much people or as many people as Brian Williams did when

1066
00:59:00.191 --> 00:59:03.100
he lied about going to our,
or getting shot down in Iraq.
Right.

1067
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:05.890
It's probably incredibly similar.
Yes.

1068
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:10.090
And that's a new thing that is a really,
really,
really new thing.

1069
00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:15.130
I think as it gets closer and closer,
it's going to move from the written word.

1070
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:19.120
It's going to move from type and video and it's going to be some sort of a brain

1071
00:59:19.121 --> 00:59:22.340
to brain interface.
And when that starts happening,

1072
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.870
and I don't think we're far away from that,

1073
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:27.230
I think we're a decade or two at most,
when that starts happening,

1074
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:29.060
this is all going to be bullshit.
It's not going,

1075
00:59:29.061 --> 00:59:31.100
I'm gonna be able to read your thoughts and I'm not,

1076
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:36.490
I'm not going to wonder whether or not you know your reacting because you were

1077
00:59:38.151 --> 00:59:42.080
beaten as a child or your,
you know,
your boyfriend dumped you.

1078
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:47.060
I'm going to know and we're going to know each other in a really weird,
intense,

1079
00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:49.640
intimate way then I don't think we'd get possibly understand today.

1080
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:53.480
When you talk to people that live during the fucking,

1081
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.330
during the inquisition and you told them about Twitter when go to them and hand

1082
00:59:59.331 --> 01:00:02.510
them this device and see what they do.
So they'd shoot you for witchcraft.
Well,

1083
01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:06.080
they didn't have guns.
They'd fucking stab you or they'd fucking whatever.

1084
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:10.010
But we're going to look at something like that.

1085
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:15.230
Something in the future and probably the fairly fairly,
I don't mean,

1086
01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:19.400
I want to say no more than 20 years.
I think it's in our lifetime.

1087
01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:22.950
<v 1>That's,
that might be ambitious.
Well maybe not.
When I learned,</v>

1088
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:25.670
I look at people like one of my idols is like Elon Musk when I looked like a

1089
01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:29.150
truly visionary person who also a really smart dude.

1090
01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:31.280
Just a genius and on every level when,

1091
01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:36.050
when a guy like him is talking about AI scaring him.
Yes.
And when he,

1092
01:00:36.051 --> 01:00:38.450
when he's going,
it scares me.
I'm going,

1093
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:42.730
I should probably be scared to guys because,
and when you think about,
yeah.

1094
01:00:42.731 --> 01:00:44.360
With the way that we're already right now,

1095
01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:49.040
like a fusing computer chips in with brains and helping to restore language

1096
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:49.730
centers.
Well,

1097
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:52.820
what happens when that AI computer chip can directly interface with your brain

1098
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:56.660
and learn about it and learn about its circuitry and understand it in a way
that,

1099
01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:59.560
and at a rate that we did,
it took us this many years to,

1100
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:03.020
to learn and it's going to learn it overnight.
And then a second.
Um,
yeah,

1101
01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:04.070
that's a scary idea.

1102
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:08.390
<v 0>I did a podcast with Sam Harris recently in the last half hour of the podcast</v>

1103
01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:13.280
was all about Ai.
It was all about a conference that he had want to,

1104
01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:16.850
and he had gone to this conference with,
uh,

1105
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:22.090
like one idea about what AI was and left terrified and left saying,

1106
01:01:22.671 --> 01:01:26.480
well,
this is not just something to be fearful of.
This is something inevitable.

1107
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.780
Yeah.

1108
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:31.780
And Ilan Musk statement that we are summoning the demon was just horrific.

1109
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:35.030
That's,
that's a terrifying thought.
Chilling.

1110
01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.780
That it came from the mouth of such a smart dude too.
It's going to happen.

1111
01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.910
I think we are,
I mean my,

1112
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:44.480
my way of describing it and I've been talking about this for a long time that I

1113
01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:49.430
think we are some sort of an electronic cocoon where the electronic caterpillar

1114
01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:51.550
that's going to become the butterfly we were,

1115
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.160
we are developing into something like when a,

1116
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:58.580
when a caterpillar creates a cocoon,
it doesn't know what the fuck it's doing.

1117
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.980
It's not reading manuals.
It didn't go to school for it.

1118
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.210
It's not like it's not like,
you know,

1119
01:02:02.211 --> 01:02:06.080
meeting together with other caterpillar support groups and are you prepared for

1120
01:02:06.081 --> 01:02:08.870
your transition into butterfly them?
No,
they just fucking do it.

1121
01:02:08.871 --> 01:02:09.381
They don't even know why.

1122
01:02:09.381 --> 01:02:11.630
This is the next thing that I do now is I think this cocoon.

1123
01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.980
I think that's what we're doing.

1124
01:02:12.981 --> 01:02:16.070
I think that's what we're doing at our obsession with technology or obsession

1125
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:16.880
with innovation.

1126
01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.450
I really firmly believe that we are fueling even through our obsession with

1127
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:26.100
materialism,
because materialism ultimately you,
you always want the biggest,

1128
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:30.600
best thing,
the newest,
latest,
greatest.
And the companies have to keep up.

1129
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:32.070
So they're all competing.
You know,

1130
01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:36.120
nexus has to come up with a better phone because the iPhone six s is out and

1131
01:02:36.121 --> 01:02:38.160
then that,
you know,
fucking boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

1132
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.720
And it keeps going faster and faster and faster until you,

1133
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:44.670
you're getting your Dick sucked by a robot man.
You know?
And then the,

1134
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:48.690
that robot is a deciding that it wants to take over your house and turn into a

1135
01:02:48.691 --> 01:02:50.340
nuclear fusion center.
I mean,

1136
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:54.000
who the fuck knows what a hundred years from now looks like or thousand years

1137
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:54.834
from now it looks like.

1138
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.220
But I think that what we're seeing with all this electronic outrage and all

1139
01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:01.110
these people communicating worth seeing this,

1140
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:05.820
these initial blips of this new found ability to communicate.

1141
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:07.470
Do you think that that's a new found awakening?

1142
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.710
It's an important step in the process of what you're saying or unnecessary.

1143
01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:14.210
It's inevitable,
but I think that,
um,

1144
01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:19.170
I'm very optimistic about where that's going to lead.
I think the beauty is,

1145
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:24.030
and if we all realize that we're all just human beings and that competition is

1146
01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:28.320
actually good because the real competition is with yourself to do your best and

1147
01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:31.260
you are inspired by other people who are doing their best.

1148
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:35.700
You compare yourself to them and instead of shitting on them instead of trying

1149
01:03:35.701 --> 01:03:36.750
to put them down,

1150
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:42.000
you look at them and get inspired or maybe not.
Maybe you say,

1151
01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.330
I,
I appreciate the amount of effort that person's done,

1152
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.690
but I don't want to work 12 hours a day.
I don't think that's smart.

1153
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:51.540
I would rather surf.
I think surfing's a way to go.
I mean,

1154
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:54.300
I think I have 80 years on this planet if I'm lucky.

1155
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.480
I want to enjoy them in the inn is richly fulfilling away as possible and you

1156
01:04:00.901 --> 01:04:02.940
should be able to do that.
Yes.
What have you,
um,

1157
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:07.200
are you familiar with a guy named Chuck Fresco?
Yes.
Yeah,
he does the,
uh,

1158
01:04:07.201 --> 01:04:11.670
the Venus project and all about resource based economies.
He,
I mean,
he,
he simply,

1159
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:12.510
um,
you know,

1160
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:17.220
he talks about it like we have enough resources on the planet to sustain every

1161
01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:20.400
human being that we will have for a long time,
equally fairly,

1162
01:04:20.401 --> 01:04:23.520
and they could do whatever they want as long as we got rid of the dollar,

1163
01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:27.000
as long as we got rid of the need to,
to earn a dollar into a mass,

1164
01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:29.700
these dollars and to spend them and to enhance your life through them.

1165
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.170
If we just,
if you take like the,

1166
01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.730
an inventory management system that like Walmart has or Amazon has and scale it

1167
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:39.000
up to a global level and you inventory every blade of grass,
every tree,

1168
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:42.240
every piece of wood,
every,
every raw material or material that we have,

1169
01:04:42.241 --> 01:04:45.840
and then you create a system that for distributing to that equally and freely so

1170
01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:47.910
that anybody can have anything at anytime that they want.

1171
01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:51.610
That's a fucking great utopia,
eh.

1172
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:54.120
The problem with that is it removes incentive.

1173
01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:56.100
Like there's a reason why people work hard.

1174
01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:58.890
The one of the reasons why people work hard,
it's because they want to get ahead.

1175
01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:01.620
And that's the idea right?
You want to have a nice home,

1176
01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:04.710
you want to create a book,
you want to,
you know,

1177
01:05:04.711 --> 01:05:09.711
you want to put together a project that ultimately reaches a lot of people.

1178
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:12.160
Like when you're creating a game that you use,

1179
01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:15.120
how many people do you think would make that game if there was no money involved

1180
01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:16.410
in it?
That's our incentive now,

1181
01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:19.720
but maybe be a different incentive surface cause you already see that in,
in,

1182
01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:23.740
in current day,
in current day capitalism.
You see like a teacher,

1183
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.250
a teacher isn't doing what she does for the,
for the money,
you know,
um,

1184
01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:30.790
surgeons are arguably doing highly specialized.

1185
01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:32.830
Surgeons aren't doing it for the money they're doing it for.

1186
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:37.750
Maybe they had a child afflicted by a disease or they or researchers who do all

1187
01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:39.880
this stuff,
right?
They don't live extravagant lives,

1188
01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:42.970
but they love to research and look to solve problems.
I think maybe,

1189
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.320
maybe there are enough people in the planet who are passionate about doing

1190
01:05:47.321 --> 01:05:49.960
things or,
or want to do something for a ha or,

1191
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.710
or could want to do something for a higher reason than just money.

1192
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.480
There's always going to be some that do.

1193
01:05:55.481 --> 01:05:59.260
But what percentage of our population are surgeons that do things specifically

1194
01:05:59.261 --> 01:06:02.680
because they had a child afflicted by the disease.
It's incredibly minute.

1195
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:07.870
What percentage of our population is teachers that just want to help children

1196
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:11.020
and it's not that big.
It's small.
You know.

1197
01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:14.560
And I think most people are out there struggling cause they want Alexis,

1198
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.640
most people are out there.
They want to move into the house,
down the block.

1199
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:22.510
They want to and these are not wise choices and a lot of ways cause they're not

1200
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:25.900
engineering their life in a way that's harmonious or that's really going to

1201
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:29.500
prepare them for a long healthy,
happy life.

1202
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:31.660
They're just rat wheel in it.

1203
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:34.090
They're just hamster wheel and it just fucking spinning and,

1204
01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.940
and trying to collect shit until they die.
And I,

1205
01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:42.030
but I think ultimately that's like our transition from living as apes trying to

1206
01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:47.290
compete against the other apes in order to fuck and make babies.

1207
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:52.291
And then you get eaten by a Jaguar to live in an apartment in Los Angeles in

1208
01:06:52.601 --> 01:06:57.601
2015 and finding out that you got fired because you made something on Twitter

1209
01:06:57.970 --> 01:07:00.460
that,
you know,
upset people.
I mean there's,
there's this,

1210
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.320
there's a transition involved there and the,

1211
01:07:03.321 --> 01:07:08.321
the radical transition of our environment changing it when you juxtapose that

1212
01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:10.450
with our physical transition,

1213
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:14.330
but we're not much fucking different than we were a thousand years ago.
No,

1214
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.420
the world sure it's fuck is.
Yeah.

1215
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.010
You'd be a fascinating guy to discuss like the Fermi paradox with,
I feel like,

1216
01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.920
cause you're,
you said you're optimistic,
so like wait,

1217
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:28.240
is that the ultimate doom for humanity?
I don't think there's an ultimate doom.

1218
01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:33.610
I think humanity,
look,
if you went back to the neanderthal days and said,
listen,

1219
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:36.630
you guys are fucked.
Let's just enjoy your time here.

1220
01:07:36.631 --> 01:07:38.680
It keep throwing those fucking spears of Willie Mamis.

1221
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:42.160
But ultimately you ain't gonna make it.
What,
what would they do?

1222
01:07:42.161 --> 01:07:43.870
Would they carry on with it?
Keep going.

1223
01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:47.050
What would you went back to the ancient hominids that we're living in Africa

1224
01:07:47.051 --> 01:07:50.650
that had just climbed down from the trees and sort of experimenting with nude

1225
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:54.580
food sources and trying to figure out tools.
Would you say,
hey look,
guys,

1226
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.320
I know you're,
you're,

1227
01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.100
you're trying real hard to keep your family alive and you're trying to,

1228
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.940
but your family's fucked,
right?
You people are fucking,
you know,

1229
01:08:00.941 --> 01:08:03.490
even figured out shoes.
He's still have thumbs in your feet.

1230
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:04.600
You're not going to make it.

1231
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.050
He's going to be some new thing that comes after you that's going to be awesome.

1232
01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:11.590
It's going to have a goatee is going to be talking on a microphone on a podcast

1233
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.420
that's you.
You know,
you,

1234
01:08:13.421 --> 01:08:18.421
if you were standing in the savannas of Africa 300,000 years ago when our

1235
01:08:18.441 --> 01:08:23.441
ancient hominid ancestors first started traveling around and figuring out

1236
01:08:24.081 --> 01:08:28.580
hunting and all sorts of other things,
you would look like a goddamn alien.

1237
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:33.910
If you walked out holding onto your phone and started taking pictures of them,

1238
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.840
how much different would that be than a spaceship landing in Washington DC and

1239
01:08:38.841 --> 01:08:43.160
then coming out with a ray gun and,
and baking duplicates of people,
right?

1240
01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:46.850
It would be probably less ridiculous if the aliens did that.

1241
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.120
Then you showing up in Africa a half a million years ago.

1242
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:53.150
But I think we would react to it differently than Africa half million years ago

1243
01:08:53.151 --> 01:08:55.580
would have reacted to that may be.
Um,

1244
01:08:55.610 --> 01:09:00.380
but I think our future is like the alien that comes down and reproduces people

1245
01:09:00.381 --> 01:09:02.870
with a laser.
I mean I think our future is,

1246
01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.790
I think that's why the alien archetype exists.
I,

1247
01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:08.900
I'm very pessimistic when it comes to,

1248
01:09:08.901 --> 01:09:13.901
or very cynical when it comes to the idea of a alien invasion.

1249
01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:14.760
Oh yeah.
This,

1250
01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:19.010
the idea that we've been abducted or the people have come here from or beings

1251
01:09:19.011 --> 01:09:20.030
have come here from another planet.

1252
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.810
It's more likely in my mind that that archetype exists.

1253
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:25.220
Cause we were extrapolating,

1254
01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.090
we're going from looking at gorillas to looking at people to looking at,
well,

1255
01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:29.930
what are we going to become?

1256
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:34.310
What we become this big headed thing with very little used for muscle and
tissue.

1257
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.860
We're probably going to communicate telepathically.

1258
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:40.190
We're not going to need mouths are vocal chords and we're,

1259
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.930
we're probably not even gonna need sex.
Right?

1260
01:09:42.931 --> 01:09:45.830
Because we've got probably gonna reproduce through some sort of a genetic

1261
01:09:45.831 --> 01:09:50.360
replication process created by scientists.
That's probably our future.

1262
01:09:50.361 --> 01:09:54.310
It's probably going to be more efficient,
more healthy.
We're,
we're our,

1263
01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:56.540
our monkey bodies that need sex.

1264
01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:59.630
We need to come and we need to feed it with food and all that.

1265
01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.620
We're kind of prisoners to that and I think slowly but surely,

1266
01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:08.000
if you can prove that people can be more harmonious and more happy or more

1267
01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:13.001
healthy or whatever the fuck would be the benefit in evolving past that,

1268
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.630
I think it's almost inevitable.

1269
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:19.750
I think that's when you look at this idea of this big headed thing with a little

1270
01:10:20.301 --> 01:10:22.580
skinny body,
fuck man,
that's,
that's,

1271
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:25.670
it's kind of obvious like this is where we're going.

1272
01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:28.610
We're becoming more and more slender.
We're more,

1273
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:31.550
we look at us in comparison to all the other animals.

1274
01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.620
Like if you grab your dogs like for like grab his skin,

1275
01:10:35.621 --> 01:10:36.860
it's fucking tough.

1276
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:40.460
It's like they could bite each other and they don't even get hurt that much.

1277
01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:43.310
Right?
If you got bit by a dog,
you're fucked man.

1278
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:46.910
But dogs like two dogs would get mad at each other at a dog park Ra and they

1279
01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:49.230
bite each other and everybody's,
okay,
let's walk off.
Yeah,

1280
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.530
you need to put a little fucking,
you know,

1281
01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.800
little rubbing alcohol and his little ouchie and he's fine.

1282
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:57.290
And then two days later that doesn't even look like a whole anymore.

1283
01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:01.250
We'd be fucked.
And I think our,
our soft,

1284
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:06.830
fleshy bodies,
we're reacting to the lack of need to be hard.

1285
01:11:06.831 --> 01:11:10.220
You don't,
you don't need fans anymore.
You don't need a tough hide.

1286
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:14.070
What you need is a big brain and what you need is it technological

1287
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.480
<v 2>innovation in order to,</v>

1288
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:20.520
to catch up to this incredible electronic world that we've created.
But again,

1289
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.450
only a small,

1290
01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.770
tiny fraction of our society will be a part of that evolution.

1291
01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:29.100
The vast majority are just going to be along for the ride for that.

1292
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:32.140
So what does that mean for the I would they be along for the ride?
If,
if,

1293
01:11:32.141 --> 01:11:36.480
if I think those a tiny fraction can create that.
Yeah,

1294
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:39.930
but just like how many people use cell phones?
How many people use the Internet?

1295
01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:42.630
It's not a tiny fraction.
It's the vast majority.

1296
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:45.780
And I think ultimately that's what's going to happen to the entire species.

1297
01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:50.130
I think the vast majority are going to be privy to the incredible innovations of

1298
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:54.750
tiny,
small,
few people like Elon Musk.
Those are the ones,

1299
01:11:54.751 --> 01:11:58.080
those innovators,
those geniuses.
I hope so man.
And I couldn't,

1300
01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:02.520
it couldn't come any sooner,
honestly.
Like we asteroid,
oh,
we need to,

1301
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:05.610
we need to be thinking way bigger than,
than we are right now.
I mean,

1302
01:12:05.611 --> 01:12:07.360
you look at it,
she didn't even like climate change,
right?
It's,

1303
01:12:07.361 --> 01:12:10.290
it's a bigger issue than just the United States.
Um,
it's a,

1304
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:14.130
it's a global issue and the sooner that we can get on board at global agenda,

1305
01:12:14.131 --> 01:12:18.660
but man,
did we get far removed from the way this conversation's too?
We did,

1306
01:12:18.661 --> 01:12:21.750
but we didn't because I think ultimately what we're talking about when we're

1307
01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:24.390
talking about this outrage says Twitter outrage.

1308
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:29.630
I think ultimately what it really boils down to is a bunch of people that are

1309
01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:32.850
being unreasonable and they're communicating in this unreasonable way,

1310
01:12:32.851 --> 01:12:36.630
but they're just,
there's,
they're out there.
There's a lot of them.
Most people,

1311
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:41.790
like what percentage of people do you think really commented on that and got

1312
01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:45.180
outraged?
What,
when it comes to the,
in the scheme of like the America or,

1313
01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:49.020
or the planet,
less than 1%.
It's way less.
May.
Less than,

1314
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:53.490
less than one 10th of 1%.
Exactly.
Tiny amount.
So most people,

1315
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.660
this is what I think we across every issue,
every communication,

1316
01:12:57.661 --> 01:13:02.160
just through that,
there's a general challenge.
It's hard to think critically.

1317
01:13:02.161 --> 01:13:04.860
Critical thinking is not an easy thing to do.
And I think that,

1318
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.610
I think that for a lot of people,
like take for example,
uh,

1319
01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.050
when two galaxies collide together,
what,
what,

1320
01:13:13.051 --> 01:13:15.930
how do you describe what it looks like?
Describe what happens if you,

1321
01:13:15.931 --> 01:13:19.470
if you live through that.
When you pose that question is no living through that.

1322
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:22.650
No,
there's,
when I posed the question to some people,
that's,

1323
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.390
that's usually the answer,
right?
They go,
they go,
oh,

1324
01:13:24.391 --> 01:13:27.090
two galaxies collide and it's just shit crashed into each other.

1325
01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:30.750
And planets exploding and sons eating other stars and black holes eating each

1326
01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:33.660
other.
And the reality though,
when you think about,
and when you,

1327
01:13:33.661 --> 01:13:36.560
when you judge the magnitude of the distances between those objects,

1328
01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.210
reality is statistically,
it's unlikely any two object would come,

1329
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.590
would impact at all.

1330
01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:43.050
They'll come close and you're going to have some gravitational effects.

1331
01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:47.640
But the odds that any two objects actually collides is really,
really,

1332
01:13:47.641 --> 01:13:50.850
really small.
And so when I think that when,
when you know,
you,

1333
01:13:50.851 --> 01:13:51.690
you pose that question,

1334
01:13:51.691 --> 01:13:55.950
a lot of people that they imagine this apocalyptic scenario,
but it's just,

1335
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:59.580
it's because they have a tough time,
um,
estimating things,

1336
01:13:59.581 --> 01:14:01.680
they have a tough time thinking outside of their bubble,

1337
01:14:01.681 --> 01:14:04.740
outside of their own consciousness and to like,
you know,
what could that be?

1338
01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:08.130
It's why.
It's why Google used to have the,
um,
that interview question,

1339
01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:12.190
that famous one,
like how many golf balls will fit in this would fit in this

1340
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:14.720
<v 1>school bus.
Right?
And a lot of people criticize that as like,
ah,</v>

1341
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.050
what a dumb question that has nothing to do anything.
And it's like,
well,

1342
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:20.800
they want to know do you,
do you say a million,
a billion or 100,000?
Right?

1343
01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:22.630
They want to know what scale are you,

1344
01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:25.780
are you able to estimate the size of an object?
Because that gives,

1345
01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.840
that just gives like a real quick feedback as to like,

1346
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:33.220
where are you on the critical thinking level?
Um,
so I think that when,
when you,

1347
01:14:33.221 --> 01:14:35.740
when you,
when you apply that to what we were talking about today,

1348
01:14:35.741 --> 01:14:40.390
I think that a lot of,
a lot of people have a tough time and myself included,

1349
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.720
have a tough time estimating and uh,
and,

1350
01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.200
and oftentimes taking a step back from whatever their current daily issue is.

1351
01:14:47.201 --> 01:14:49.870
Whatever their current stresses,
whatever their current,
uh,

1352
01:14:49.871 --> 01:14:52.840
endorphin release they're seeking is whatever their current thought is.

1353
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:57.010
And they have a tough time always keeping in perspective perspective.
The big,

1354
01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.090
the big key here,

1355
01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:02.710
keeping in perspective like what the rest of the universe is and the world is

1356
01:15:02.711 --> 01:15:05.290
and the other people even just next door to you are going through,

1357
01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:09.390
<v 0>well there was an article that I tweeted today,
um,
from Yahoo,</v>

1358
01:15:09.391 --> 01:15:12.600
from the UK,
evidence of the multiverse.

1359
01:15:12.601 --> 01:15:15.890
We might have just bumped into another universe.
Hmm.

1360
01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:17.790
What was the evidence

1361
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:23.040
weigh herself because you know,

1362
01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:26.250
it's one of those things that you have to read like four or five times in

1363
01:15:26.251 --> 01:15:30.270
Georgia in order to like really figure out like,
wait,
wait,
what are you saying?

1364
01:15:30.330 --> 01:15:31.570
So you have to dies me with me.
Hear you

1365
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:34.280
<v 1>through those nights where you click like 14,</v>

1366
01:15:34.281 --> 01:15:36.820
15 links deep Wikipedia and you get done in life,

1367
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.120
like four hours have gone by and you're like,
fuck,
I'm fried.
I need to go to bed.

1368
01:15:41.121 --> 01:15:41.650
Right.

1369
01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:45.520
<v 0>Oh.
Or I'll watch documentaries on hyper novas or something like that.</v>

1370
01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:50.521
And you try to wrap your head around the idea of a star exploding and taking out

1371
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:56.110
the entire solar system or many other solar systems nearby.

1372
01:15:56.111 --> 01:16:00.160
And the fact that this is happening millions of times a day,

1373
01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:04.780
all throughout the universe.
If there was a,
um,
a documentary that they had,

1374
01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:08.410
I don't remember it was science channel or what channel it was on,

1375
01:16:08.411 --> 01:16:13.411
but we're scientists at one point in time were concerned that there was a war

1376
01:16:13.511 --> 01:16:18.190
going on in space because they were recognizing these gamma bursts,

1377
01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:21.340
these incredible bursts of massive amounts of energy.

1378
01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.110
And they were happening at a,

1379
01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:26.710
in a repeated fashion all throughout the sky.

1380
01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.220
And they had to try to figure out what the fuck was going on.

1381
01:16:30.221 --> 01:16:32.620
Is there an alien war?
Like this is like,
you know,

1382
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:34.710
what could this be any decades ago?
Sure.

1383
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:39.280
And slowly but surely they started figuring out like,
oh my God,

1384
01:16:39.281 --> 01:16:44.230
these are exploding stars.
These are Novas and they happen all the time.

1385
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:49.020
And if it happens close by,
that's a wrap civilization.
Yeah,
that's a wrap.
Oral,

1386
01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:52.810
that's a wrap.
Oxygen.
No more water.
No,
no,
no.
You're not going to need that.

1387
01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.100
It's all,
it's all gone.

1388
01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.480
And that is the reality of the cosmos all throughout the sky.

1389
01:16:58.481 --> 01:17:02.920
When we look up there,
look up at infinity somewhere out there where you,

1390
01:17:02.921 --> 01:17:05.650
you know,
in a,
in impossible distance away from us,

1391
01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:12.920
a stars exploding and that's what they do.
Jason Silva,
cool.

1392
01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:16.590
Astrophysicist guy.
He a Jason.
Yeah,
he does awesome youtube videos.
He,
he,

1393
01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:20.240
he takes this incredibly difficult science and communicates in a way that we

1394
01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:24.290
emotionally respond to and I love that.
And he had a,
he was just talking about,

1395
01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:28.640
like he said,
one line in one of his videos somewhere where he was like up there.

1396
01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.090
That's not an up there far away place.
You're in the middle of it.

1397
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:36.710
You're in the middle of the universe right now.
Like in and even our galaxy,

1398
01:17:36.711 --> 01:17:40.700
right.
We have these paintings of what the Milky Way Galaxy looks like.
People,

1399
01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.830
a lot of times people don't even have ever have the thought.

1400
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:44.600
They would never need to even think about this,

1401
01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:47.630
that we don't have a picture of what our galaxy looks like.

1402
01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:50.480
We have an artist rendition of what we think our galaxy looks like,

1403
01:17:50.481 --> 01:17:54.500
but the furthest craft we have is barely out of our own like sun belt.

1404
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:59.270
It's a out of our own like gravitational pull from our own son.
So,
um,

1405
01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:02.880
again,
just we're not even looking at it from outside.
Not yet.
Yeah.

1406
01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:07.130
I photos of the,
it won't happen anytime inside of our lifetimes.
No,

1407
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.260
unless we figured out how to bypass the speed of light.
But yeah,
man.
Yeah.

1408
01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.100
And even then,
we're talking about hundreds of millions of light years.

1409
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.820
So even going at the speed of light,
it's going to take a hundred million years.

1410
01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:26.710
The most mind fucky statistic that I ever saw in one of these documentaries was

1411
01:18:27.051 --> 01:18:31.800
there were talking about the possibility of each ho they were talking about the

1412
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:34.790
relative size of supermassive black holes,

1413
01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:39.260
and that every galaxy has a supermassive black hole that's one half of 1% of the

1414
01:18:39.261 --> 01:18:42.290
mass of the galaxy,
the large,
the galaxy,
the large,
the black hole.

1415
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:47.500
And they're speculating that inside that black hole may be a whole nother

1416
01:18:47.691 --> 01:18:50.300
universe with completely different laws.

1417
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:55.070
And that inside that universe may be other galaxies that have supermassive black

1418
01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:58.340
holes at their center.
And inside those supermassive black holes,

1419
01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:03.230
there are other universes.
So in our hundreds of billions of galaxies,

1420
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:08.390
there may be hundreds of billions of individual universes inside of those.

1421
01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.340
And when you go inside of them,

1422
01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:15.460
there's hundreds of billions of more individual galaxies with hundreds of

1423
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.920
billions of more individual universes inside of them.

1424
01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:23.900
And that is ultimately intensely fractal.
And it is truly infinite in that sense.

1425
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:25.640
In which one of those are we in right now?

1426
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:30.290
Yeah,
it's mind fucky.

1427
01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:35.620
But Cecil was a lie and he lived in Zimbabwe and he was loved.

1428
01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:41.780
Donald Sterling's a piece of shit.
Don't joke about aids if you're white.

1429
01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.850
Exactly.
Yeah,
we're,
we're,
we're our,

1430
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:49.610
our lack of perspective is a alarming,

1431
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.250
but fuck it make sense.
I mean,

1432
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:56.000
we still have these goddamn monkey bodies and I think that's ultimately going to

1433
01:19:56.001 --> 01:20:01.001
be the big pole or the big appeal of transcending this physical embodiment that

1434
01:20:03.921 --> 01:20:08.610
we carry our consciousness in and then accepting this idea of a symbiotic

1435
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:13.610
<v 1>relationship with some sort of microchips and fucking fiber optic lines or</v>

1436
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:17.790
whatever the hell it's going to take form up.
I mean,

1437
01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:21.510
we're essentially symbiotically connected to technology or it already with

1438
01:20:21.511 --> 01:20:23.040
glasses,
you know,

1439
01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:27.810
we need these fucking things that we've created that cover over our eyes to see

1440
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:32.130
better or with phones.
Man,
I left my house the other day.

1441
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:35.970
I got a hundred yards from my door in and went shit.
My phone.

1442
01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:38.340
It was like I left my baby on the roof.

1443
01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:42.720
Like I had turned around like I was terrified.
I mean,
that's ridiculous.

1444
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:47.760
I can't just go somewhere and a borrow someone's phone and call my wife and go,

1445
01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:51.660
Hey,
I left my phone at home.
I'll be home in a couple of hours.
Fuck that.
Well,

1446
01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:54.990
that's why when you say that over the timeline you've seen we're getting closer

1447
01:20:54.991 --> 01:20:57.240
and closer to the connections when more people are getting connected and we're

1448
01:20:57.241 --> 01:21:00.660
going to connect it with more people and closer.
I agree technologically,

1449
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:03.630
but I feel like in the real physical world that we live in,

1450
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.970
we're getting further apart and we look at,

1451
01:21:05.971 --> 01:21:09.480
we look at people's lives on social media like on Instagram and Facebook and you

1452
01:21:09.481 --> 01:21:12.980
know,
all the models were coming out right now with their posts about,
you know,

1453
01:21:12.981 --> 01:21:15.030
Instagram models posting about how,
how,

1454
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:17.400
you know what you don't see the side of it.
You don't see right.
The,

1455
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:21.990
the hundred shots that it took her to get that perfect photo and the argument

1456
01:21:21.991 --> 01:21:24.540
she got in with her sister over.
Take one more,
take one more,

1457
01:21:24.541 --> 01:21:27.000
take one more before she got that perfect one that year.

1458
01:21:27.001 --> 01:21:29.880
Then liking and you're then trying to compare your life to,

1459
01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:34.770
we are pushing like our real connections in real personal lives where at first

1460
01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:37.800
of all we're judging ourselves based by this impossible,

1461
01:21:37.801 --> 01:21:41.340
unattainable standard on social media that,
that,
you know,
if people,

1462
01:21:41.341 --> 01:21:42.750
someone takes a bad picture,
they don't upload it,

1463
01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:45.270
they believe that one and they take a better picture.
And I think a better one,

1464
01:21:45.271 --> 01:21:46.940
better one better one until that's the one that,

1465
01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:49.410
that it doesn't even look at hardly looks like them anymore.

1466
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:53.250
And now we're expected to measure us looking at the mirror against that

1467
01:21:53.251 --> 01:21:55.260
perfectly lit,
perfectly critiqued,

1468
01:21:55.261 --> 01:22:00.210
careful image of what we think are our next best person is like.
And that Scott,

1469
01:22:00.211 --> 01:22:02.940
some really weird implications to evolution.

1470
01:22:02.941 --> 01:22:06.030
I'll give you one example real quick with Instagram is um,

1471
01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:08.040
I have a little sister and I'm,

1472
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:11.850
I'm terrified of when every time she gets in another social media account.

1473
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:14.730
Cause I'm like,
oh no.
Like,
like,
like,
you know what,
where,

1474
01:22:14.731 --> 01:22:18.300
where is this going to lead?
When I think about,
um,
young kids,

1475
01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:22.110
let's say impressionable teenagers who are going through the most important

1476
01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:24.930
biological and neurological development phase of their,
of their,

1477
01:22:24.931 --> 01:22:26.130
what will be their adult life.

1478
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:30.480
They're coming into their identity and they have access to this dopamine drip,

1479
01:22:30.481 --> 01:22:34.890
this endorphin drip in their brain that generations before never had that kind

1480
01:22:34.891 --> 01:22:35.760
of access to it.

1481
01:22:35.761 --> 01:22:40.500
When a girl can upload a photo on to Instagram and start refreshing the dozens

1482
01:22:40.501 --> 01:22:45.440
of your hot baby,
sexy baby,
nice smile,
pretty girl.
And,

1483
01:22:45.441 --> 01:22:50.070
and she does that during a time when she's otherwise dealing with a difficult

1484
01:22:50.071 --> 01:22:53.880
conflicting emotion inside of her and that's now her drug.

1485
01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:58.170
That's her escape from otherwise facing that reality and growing through it the

1486
01:22:58.171 --> 01:23:01.350
way generations before did.
I'm not saying it's necessarily bad or wrong,

1487
01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:04.410
maybe this is a better way to go through that stage of your life,

1488
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:06.130
but maybe it's not.
Maybe that's

1489
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:10.990
<v 0>bad that you can so easily bypass all that hard shit you would have otherwise</v>

1490
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:14.410
had to have dealt with internally.
Right.
What is that doing to,
to evolution?

1491
01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:15.340
You know,
we don't know.

1492
01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:18.460
We won't know for a long time until we look back on it and go,
that was,

1493
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:21.340
that was probably not great.
Or maybe we look back at it and go,

1494
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.900
that's what led us to where we are,

1495
01:23:22.901 --> 01:23:26.380
but it's got to have some impact and that kind of stuff.
You know,

1496
01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:29.950
I deal with on a daily basis as I try to figure out like,
oh,

1497
01:23:29.951 --> 01:23:32.920
how do I want to bring my games on these platforms and all I want to buy games,

1498
01:23:32.921 --> 01:23:37.570
interact with people in these ways.
Yeah.
I mean we really don't know.

1499
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.360
We're just guessing.
These children are Guinea pigs,
right?

1500
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.660
They're growing up in this weird world,
right?
I mean,
uh,

1501
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:47.740
I grew up in a world where you could bullshit,
you could lie.
Nobody knew.

1502
01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:52.750
Just Google a little Ruth Zuni fucking 35 miles across.
Do don't worry about it.

1503
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:57.670
Like now when people Google it and go,
you're an idiot.
It's 24,000 miles dummy.

1504
01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:05.390
You can hear the smart one now.
Cause he googled it.
I think,
um,

1505
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:10.680
I have this other thought about these things and this progression and I think

1506
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:15.160
that we look at the world,
we look at everything that's going on,

1507
01:24:15.161 --> 01:24:20.161
whether it's butterflies or elk or eagles or caterpillars.

1508
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:23.320
And we look at it all and we say,
well,
that's nature,

1509
01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.950
but we look at ourselves and because we're conscious and because we can make

1510
01:24:26.951 --> 01:24:31.951
choices and because we can objective really look at the risks versus rewards of

1511
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:37.090
each decision and debated amongst each other and seek advice from peers.

1512
01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:38.990
We don't think of it as natural.

1513
01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:42.010
We think of it as something that we can manipulate and something that we can

1514
01:24:42.011 --> 01:24:43.750
change and that we can alter.

1515
01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.900
But I think that human behavior might just be ultimately the most complex

1516
01:24:49.121 --> 01:24:52.900
version of the natural world that we know and that all of our behavior,

1517
01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:56.770
all this stuff that we're doing,
whether it's are rampant materialism,

1518
01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.980
our obsession with a tension and technology,

1519
01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:05.260
all this stuff is leading to what I said before that this electronic
caterpillar,

1520
01:25:05.261 --> 01:25:09.400
I think that what we are,
what we're doing right now is totally natural.

1521
01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:13.170
And this a obsession with checking your likes on your ass.

1522
01:25:13.171 --> 01:25:16.120
Pick to make sure that everybody thinks you're hot.
This is,

1523
01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:20.110
this is all just going to fuel your desire to get a better camera.

1524
01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:22.690
It's going to fuel your desire to,
uh,

1525
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:27.750
get a new phone or to support the newest social media platform that's gonna

1526
01:25:28.450 --> 01:25:32.590
allow your ass to shake and a much more enticing way that's going to get you

1527
01:25:32.591 --> 01:25:37.591
even more likes and hearts and fucking thumbs ups and emojis.

1528
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:41.220
I think it's natural.
I really do.
I mean,
I don't,

1529
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:46.330
I don't know what we can do about it other than communicate our concerns about

1530
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:50.110
the potential downfalls of this behavior and this kind of thing.

1531
01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:53.250
Confront the negative.
Don't,
don't shy away from it.
Confronted,

1532
01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.900
solve the negative problems that are coming with it as well.

1533
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:57.410
Keep an open mind about it and,

1534
01:25:57.630 --> 01:26:01.750
and never stopped communicating because we do that.
We've,
we've lost that.

1535
01:26:01.751 --> 01:26:02.850
We've lost sight of what the goal of,

1536
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:07.460
and that's what's a huge problem with that company firing you.
Cause they,

1537
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:12.490
they impeded on your ability to communicate and you communicate it in a very

1538
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.850
concise,
objective,
analytical way.

1539
01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:19.400
You looked at the problem,
he said,
look,
this guy,

1540
01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:22.700
he has every right to be an old bigot and the privacy of his own home,

1541
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:26.240
like the fact that you got in trouble for that,
it's,

1542
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:31.270
it shows the repercussions and the downfalls of this new time and when we

1543
01:26:32.001 --> 01:26:33.200
stopped communicating.
Yes.

1544
01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:37.190
And especially when also when you let in too many voices.

1545
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:39.440
Like how about you and that guy sitting down,

1546
01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:41.010
you and that guy that wanted to fire you.
Right.

1547
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:44.420
I would sit down and have a fucking conversation.
Right.
I mean not,

1548
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:48.470
don't shut off my email.
Stupid.
Like what are you doing meet at Starbucks.

1549
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:50.240
How about fuck you?
Yeah.
You know,

1550
01:26:50.241 --> 01:26:52.790
I mean wouldn't you have loved to have a few million bucks in the bank right

1551
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:56.220
then?
Oh boy,
you just go shit,
suck my Dick Stupid.
Oh boy.

1552
01:26:56.221 --> 01:27:00.080
He just go online and just do a a youtube video.
Listen to with this dummy.

1553
01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:00.850
Just help me.

1554
01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:01.621
<v 1>Well I did that day.</v>

1555
01:27:01.621 --> 01:27:05.920
They were trying to dangle severance and stuff and tangle and pay.
Yeah.

1556
01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:10.190
I said fuck no to that,
you know,
I,
when that whole thing was unfolding,
um,
it,

1557
01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.350
it got,
it got like a lot because so a lot of media outlets you,
you,
um,

1558
01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.510
I I linked it to the opiate Anthony,
they,

1559
01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:19.420
they talked about it and they completely had my back obviously cause those guys

1560
01:27:19.421 --> 01:27:22.700
are super levelheaded people.
But,
but the um,
the,

1561
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:26.860
the media shit storm that started to unfold,
CNN,
Fox News,
everybody,

1562
01:27:26.861 --> 01:27:28.360
every major outlet was reaching out to me,

1563
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:31.450
trying to get me to come on their show.
And I was sitting at a crossroads.

1564
01:27:31.451 --> 01:27:32.980
I am a communications professional.

1565
01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:36.190
I knew that and I had seen what happened to Justine sacco before.

1566
01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:38.980
I think that happened for me.
Um,
and,
and I,
I was,

1567
01:27:39.010 --> 01:27:42.850
I was well aware of where this could go for me in my career and my personal
life.

1568
01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:45.670
So I realized that,
you know,
I need to take control of,
of the,

1569
01:27:45.671 --> 01:27:46.780
of the Pr Shit Storm.

1570
01:27:46.781 --> 01:27:49.750
I need to be the one who makes the right moves while the company makes all the

1571
01:27:49.751 --> 01:27:53.620
wrong moves and I need to get this back on track.
So they didn't,
you know,

1572
01:27:53.621 --> 01:27:54.700
part part of their terms.

1573
01:27:54.701 --> 01:27:57.100
They didn't want me to do any media appearances whatsoever.
They want,

1574
01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:01.330
they wanted us to go away.
Right.
Course cowards.
And so I,
I couldn't,

1575
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:03.010
I couldn't take the blood money I have to do.

1576
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:05.440
I had to make sure that how much that one right

1577
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.280
<v 0>costing you a lot.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1578
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:13.960
Tens of tens of thousands of dollars for you.
Fuck them.
Yeah.

1579
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:17.090
I hope it cost them even more.
Yeah.
They um,

1580
01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.540
you know how that guy keep his job.
The guy who fired you,

1581
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:21.560
how did he keep his job?

1582
01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:25.050
<v 1>The,
the,
the culture of that company was different too.
You got to it.</v>

1583
01:28:25.051 --> 01:28:26.620
It would take a long time to unpack the,
the,

1584
01:28:26.621 --> 01:28:30.160
the complexities of how a publisher relationship works with a studio in our

1585
01:28:30.161 --> 01:28:30.701
industry.

1586
01:28:30.701 --> 01:28:34.270
And so they were at the studio level and they just wanted to make fucking games.

1587
01:28:34.271 --> 01:28:35.440
They're artists,
they're creators.

1588
01:28:35.650 --> 01:28:38.680
They just wanted to make cool shit and go to work and have fun doing it.

1589
01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.130
And then the,
the publisher was the one who had the business relationships.

1590
01:28:42.131 --> 01:28:45.040
They're the ones who had relationships with the NBA that they were afraid of,

1591
01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.190
but they were funding the studio's development.
They didn't own the studio,

1592
01:28:48.191 --> 01:28:52.300
but they funded it.
And so like when it comes down from the top where they go,
oh,

1593
01:28:52.301 --> 01:28:54.430
you know,
he can't work on the project anymore.
We're not going to,

1594
01:28:54.431 --> 01:28:56.500
we're not going to give you any more funding.
It's like,

1595
01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.590
I would love for someone from that company to,

1596
01:28:58.591 --> 01:29:02.520
to call the bluff because I don't think that would ever come that.
But um,

1597
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:05.700
but they couldn't.
And I,
it's,
it's,
it's sucks that they got put in that position.

1598
01:29:05.701 --> 01:29:08.100
It's sucks that,
that no one there,
it could have the backbone.

1599
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.460
I know how I would've handled it if I was running that company at the time.

1600
01:29:11.461 --> 01:29:13.800
What would you have done?
I would've,
I would've said,

1601
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:16.380
I would've said I would've called the bluff of the,
of the publishing company.

1602
01:29:16.381 --> 01:29:19.560
And I would have said,
that's ridiculous.
Uh,
wait a day,

1603
01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:23.130
nothing is going to happen and we'll talk about it again tomorrow.

1604
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:26.400
And then when nothing happened and when everything goes away and no business

1605
01:29:26.401 --> 01:29:29.270
deals were threatened,
we'd go now,
what was the big fucking deal?
Yeah,

1606
01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.680
what was the big fucking deal?
It's finished making the game.

1607
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:35.250
Let's not have a bunch of people mad at us because we,
we,
you know,

1608
01:29:35.251 --> 01:29:39.800
trampled all over someone's constitutional rights and let's,
let's,
you know,

1609
01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:40.920
let's implement his good ideas.

1610
01:29:40.921 --> 01:29:43.500
That was the other thing that they lost was all of these programs and

1611
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:46.710
initiatives that I was building and that I was going to take charge of and run

1612
01:29:46.711 --> 01:29:47.700
through the Games,

1613
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:51.720
lunch cycle and keeping all of the players engaged and all this stuff I had done

1614
01:29:51.721 --> 01:29:55.470
before I was going to do again for them on this new Ip,
this new thing that like,

1615
01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.360
that needed that work more than anything.

1616
01:29:57.361 --> 01:30:00.660
It didn't have anything to build off of.
It was starting from zero.
Um,

1617
01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:01.760
all that was gone.
Like,

1618
01:30:01.761 --> 01:30:05.730
they didn't have a person to come in that could carry those,
those,
you know,

1619
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.140
carry that torch further and finish the job.
I'd started good.
Oh good.

1620
01:30:10.141 --> 01:30:14.490
That's their punishment for being pussies.
It's sucks at suck for everybody,

1621
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.420
but you like your new job.
I do like my job better.
I get to,

1622
01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:22.620
I get to make and that I get to explain what your new job is.
People at home.

1623
01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:25.410
Well,
so,
um,
so anybody who knows video games,

1624
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.050
I worked for a company now called Three d realms.
Huge company.

1625
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:31.590
Well they used to be a huge company,
small company now,
but huge name.
Right?

1626
01:30:31.591 --> 01:30:34.830
Because they're the guys who made like Duke Nukem.
Right.
You know what I mean?

1627
01:30:34.831 --> 01:30:38.100
Commander Keen.
Like these are some of the most retro old school classics that,

1628
01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:40.710
that,
that,
you know,
influenced an entire industry.

1629
01:30:40.770 --> 01:30:44.010
And is there less people were going in and out?
Oh,
absolutely.
Yeah.
They,
they,

1630
01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:48.030
for the last decade where they weren't really doing anything,
um,
it would just,

1631
01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.760
you know,
shrink,
shrink,
shrink,
shrink,
shrink.
So now they're,
they,

1632
01:30:50.761 --> 01:30:54.570
they had a bunch of litigation that was happening as well that they were able to

1633
01:30:54.571 --> 01:30:57.750
finally put to rest and now the company is able to look to the future.

1634
01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:00.180
And so they brought me on to be like,
let's,
let's start,

1635
01:31:00.181 --> 01:31:03.510
let's build this thing back up and we're going to start with a new Ip.

1636
01:31:03.511 --> 01:31:07.350
And that new IP is called bombshell.
What does an IP intellectual property,
okay,

1637
01:31:07.351 --> 01:31:12.240
so internet protocol,
I'm like,
how's that a nerd now work IP,

1638
01:31:12.241 --> 01:31:14.820
intellectual property.
It's just,
it's a,
it's a franchise.
So bomb shells,

1639
01:31:14.821 --> 01:31:19.380
the new brand,
the new game,
creating a whole new slate of characters.
Um,
and it's,

1640
01:31:19.381 --> 01:31:24.180
uh,
it's,
it's what we want to,
to start that sort of come back for three realms.

1641
01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:28.110
The game,
I don't know you,
you said you played games,
shoot camera.
Um,

1642
01:31:28.230 --> 01:31:31.770
for a long time.
For many,
many years to a point where,
how to walk away.

1643
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:35.720
I was always wasting way too much time playing.
Mostly quake.
Okay.

1644
01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.030
That was the big one.
I was playing quake online fucking eight,
eight,

1645
01:31:39.031 --> 01:31:40.620
10 hours a day sometimes.
Yeah.

1646
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.330
But Duke Nukem I know that there was a new one that they worked on forever.

1647
01:31:45.331 --> 01:31:49.240
It got to be a forever.
Yeah.
But it got to be a joke.
People,

1648
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:51.270
the online joke was,
you know,

1649
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:54.150
it's going to come out right after Duke Nukem comes out or there was all these

1650
01:31:54.151 --> 01:31:55.680
jokes about when it would come out.
Yeah.

1651
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:58.920
It did come out eventually did come out eventually.
And um,

1652
01:31:58.950 --> 01:32:03.870
and it's tough for anything that,
that goes for 12 years of highway 12 years.

1653
01:32:03.871 --> 01:32:06.300
Like yeah,
it was like something like 12 years.
How does that happen?

1654
01:32:06.301 --> 01:32:09.340
And explained that to me.
Well,
die wasn't here for that,
so I don't,

1655
01:32:09.341 --> 01:32:12.730
I don't know all the story,
but you're not responsible from what I know.
Yes.

1656
01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.960
From what I know is,
uh,

1657
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:18.250
the game just went through a lot of iteration.

1658
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:23.430
So every year the next big thing came out and the game was no longer the next

1659
01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:27.040
big thing.
So they had to add some more stuff to it to try to beat the next,

1660
01:32:27.090 --> 01:32:29.020
the thing that just came out and then something else came up.

1661
01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:31.780
And so this constant trying to,
you know,

1662
01:32:31.781 --> 01:32:35.320
striving for perfection and there was other problems and there was lots of

1663
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:40.210
controversy.
You could read articles,
um,
for,
for,
you know,
for days,

1664
01:32:40.211 --> 01:32:44.680
literally days where people are just investigating that whole evolution of that

1665
01:32:44.681 --> 01:32:47.710
franchise they using for the three d engine was the unreal engine.

1666
01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:50.590
It kept changing.
That was the thing like the engine,
the engine kept changing,

1667
01:32:50.591 --> 01:32:52.840
the technology kept changing,
the requirements kept changed,

1668
01:32:52.841 --> 01:32:56.170
everything kept changing.
Instead of just polishing something up,

1669
01:32:56.171 --> 01:32:58.490
sticking with what you had in getting it out the door,
you,

1670
01:32:58.491 --> 01:33:00.790
you can you compare that to the game where we're working on now,
like bombshell,

1671
01:33:00.791 --> 01:33:03.220
right?
Bombshells built on unreal engine three,

1672
01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:06.250
that's the last generation revenue your lunch and unreal engines on for now.

1673
01:33:06.251 --> 01:33:10.540
It's just,
it's,
it's unreal engine now.
Um,
and,
and,
but,

1674
01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:12.160
but imagine if they,

1675
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:16.090
if for bomb show we had an indefinitely kept upgrading the engine,

1676
01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:17.560
changing new technologies,

1677
01:33:17.561 --> 01:33:20.500
implementing new technologies and new workflows and new stacks and new things

1678
01:33:20.501 --> 01:33:21.910
breaking,
it would never end.

1679
01:33:21.911 --> 01:33:24.450
It would be a never ending building and polishing cycles.

1680
01:33:24.451 --> 01:33:26.290
So that was kind of what my perspective,

1681
01:33:26.291 --> 01:33:28.270
any of what Duke Nukem was stuck in for a long time.

1682
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:32.890
So it was just a poor management yeah.
Project and,
and you know,

1683
01:33:32.891 --> 01:33:36.460
creatively you could,
you could debate whether it was also creatively like,
um,

1684
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:41.200
you know,
almost like this,
this need for perfection,
you know,
like,
like no one,

1685
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:45.430
no one pixel can be out of place,
that type of thing.
Um,
and people did,

1686
01:33:45.431 --> 01:33:47.500
they pointed fingers to that whole thing.
But at the end of the day,

1687
01:33:47.501 --> 01:33:52.420
what came out was Duke Nukem forever and,
and it wasn't,
um,
you know,

1688
01:33:52.630 --> 01:33:56.350
I don't think anything could sustain like a decade of hype and ever live up to

1689
01:33:56.351 --> 01:34:00.790
that expectation.
That good.
Was it a good game to people enjoy it?
No,
it was,

1690
01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:05.670
it was a pretty infamously like poor game.
It was like,

1691
01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:08.560
but again,
I don't think that it was the fault of the,

1692
01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:12.630
of the game or the developers.
I think it was maybe,
maybe to some extent,
but,

1693
01:34:12.631 --> 01:34:16.360
but I think more than anything,
it was failed by its own image.
It was like,

1694
01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:19.870
it was like this,
it was built up and gamers had like built this,

1695
01:34:19.930 --> 01:34:23.620
this expectation in their head about what it could be and then it just,

1696
01:34:23.621 --> 01:34:27.160
it wasn't,
you know,
you'd never had a chance of living up to that.
Um,

1697
01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:28.720
imagine rebooting a,

1698
01:34:29.050 --> 01:34:32.680
like a crazy old franchise and it just never living up to it.

1699
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:36.310
Living up to what you would have expected from that.
Yeah,
kind of.

1700
01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:39.770
It's kind of impossible,
right?
I mean it's,

1701
01:34:39.771 --> 01:34:41.800
it's to have something go on for 12 years,

1702
01:34:41.801 --> 01:34:45.670
just like they just have to get it out to cut their losses.
Right?
Yeah.
So,

1703
01:34:45.671 --> 01:34:48.730
so that,
that,
you know,
happened finally.
It's,
it's,

1704
01:34:48.731 --> 01:34:52.330
it's in the past and now we're able to,
to focus on the future,
which is,

1705
01:34:52.331 --> 01:34:54.910
which is new Ip,
which is bombshell.
Did you,
you're,
so,

1706
01:34:54.911 --> 01:34:57.260
you're familiar with Duke Nukem enough,
you know,
where that character was like?

1707
01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:01.640
Sure.
Well,
back in the day,
in the 90s,
that kind of character works,
right,

1708
01:35:01.641 --> 01:35:04.190
because it's a super one dimensional character.

1709
01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:07.730
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Predator.
Exactly.
And just,
just the,
the,

1710
01:35:07.731 --> 01:35:10.880
the perfect stereotype of what that likes sports,

1711
01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:14.690
a nigger or Stallone character was from the 80s will reincarnate and in video

1712
01:35:14.691 --> 01:35:19.070
game form in the 90s.
Right.
Well,
um,
that kind of character doesn't really work.

1713
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:23.420
Yeah.
There he is.
Super Brooding masculinity and it's just,

1714
01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:25.513
yeah,

1715
01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:30.020
so the belt buckle so that that character doesn't even,

1716
01:35:30.021 --> 01:35:32.090
that character today would have,
it would have trouble playing.

1717
01:35:32.091 --> 01:35:34.940
People come to expect more depth and complexity from,

1718
01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.520
I feel like from their characters,
certainly in movies and in,

1719
01:35:37.521 --> 01:35:42.410
in all the video games we play.
So things evolve.
So bombshell,
uh,
was a character,

1720
01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.370
she's not one of those,

1721
01:35:43.371 --> 01:35:47.450
but she was a character who actually originated in the Duke Nukem era.

1722
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.070
Like back in the nineties.

1723
01:35:49.071 --> 01:35:52.190
She was concept it and conceived as a sidekick to Duke Nukem.

1724
01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:54.620
And so when she was originally conceived,

1725
01:35:54.621 --> 01:35:58.070
she was this kind of overly satirical version of the,

1726
01:35:58.071 --> 01:36:01.130
of the female sexy time check as well in the same way Duke was.
Right,

1727
01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:02.720
which may have played back then,

1728
01:36:02.721 --> 01:36:06.110
but it certainly wouldn't play it today in the culture that we have now with,

1729
01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:10.820
with feminism.
And with women in gaming and,
and,
and even beyond that,
just simply,

1730
01:36:10.821 --> 01:36:13.310
she wasn't a complex character.
She wasn't interested in character.

1731
01:36:13.311 --> 01:36:15.920
She wasn't propelling necessarily that storyline.

1732
01:36:15.921 --> 01:36:19.510
So we had to kind of go back to the drawing board with this version of
bombshell,

1733
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.180
the one that we've been working on the last couple of years.
Oh,
she's bad ass.

1734
01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:26.640
Yeah.
Well that's,
that's even the,
that's the old version of bombshell.
Oh,

1735
01:36:26.641 --> 01:36:30.650
what does she look like now?
So now she's,
she's much less bare.
Midriffs.
Right.

1736
01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:35.030
Much less skin.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Let's pull up,
up,
down,
down,
down.

1737
01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:39.650
Right above the one you had open that one.
Yes.
That's the same one.
No,
no,
no.

1738
01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.810
The one where she's holding the revolver.
Yes.
Yeah.

1739
01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:46.310
So this is just there.
Yeah.
You don't see much.
But over here,

1740
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:50.750
click on the two to the right one down that one.
Yes.
Oh no,

1741
01:36:50.751 --> 01:36:52.700
that's not it either.
Well,
close out of this.

1742
01:36:52.701 --> 01:36:56.780
Go to just go to bombshell.com because we actually bought this domain away from,

1743
01:36:56.781 --> 01:37:01.220
uh,
it used to be like psalms,
horn mogul had it.
No,
it's an ass.

1744
01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:05.600
Oh No.
Yeah.
So we,
we bought,
you have to pay for it.
I don't know.

1745
01:37:05.601 --> 01:37:06.650
It was before my time,
but,

1746
01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:10.370
but God got it away from that and now we've turned it into,
so that's the rub.

1747
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:11.030
I'm sure.

1748
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:15.830
So she's got this bionic arm and she is a character is defined more by who,

1749
01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.680
what she's been through and,
and,

1750
01:37:17.681 --> 01:37:22.040
and like way very multifaceted personalities and attributes,
not just traits,

1751
01:37:22.041 --> 01:37:25.950
not just physical appearance.
Do you have to run this past feminism in gaming?
No.

1752
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:29.810
That it's okay.
No,
but what I need to ask for all Gamers,
right?

1753
01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:31.790
Is to look at this and go,
it's not,

1754
01:37:31.791 --> 01:37:36.260
it's not easy making a strong female character that can,

1755
01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.920
uh,
sustain that can appeal to both men and women.
Um,

1756
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.740
tomb raider,
right?
So we get to draw from awesome inspirations like Lara Crop,

1757
01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:50.420
Sarah,
Connor,
even Ripley,
right?
Um,
and,
and we're able to look at like,
yeah,

1758
01:37:50.421 --> 01:37:53.420
this works.
But what makes that thing work?
It's not,
it's not,

1759
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:55.980
the physical appearance is not what you look like.
It's,
it's who you

1760
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.230
<v 2>are and what you stand for.
So Shelly bombshell,</v>

1761
01:37:58.231 --> 01:38:02.520
she got her nickname because she was like the foremost bomb disposal expert in

1762
01:38:02.521 --> 01:38:05.280
the GDF is actually lost her arm.
It is how she lost her arm.

1763
01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:09.420
And so now she her look,
she's real.
Oh,
was kind of disturbing me.
It dude.

1764
01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.980
She to us,
she is and,

1765
01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:16.530
and we want to see it in constantly and bring it to life dude.
Oh cause players,

1766
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:23.400
um,
so um,
she was a part of the Duke Nukem franchise.

1767
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:27.630
She was,
if you scroll down or you can click on the media link at the top,

1768
01:38:27.631 --> 01:38:29.920
you can see more screenshots that are a little bit closer.
There you go.

1769
01:38:29.921 --> 01:38:34.200
As Duke Nukem the only game that,
well there's Dika Katana.
Right.

1770
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:38.490
That was another game that kind of went that way.
Right.
It was dragged on.

1771
01:38:38.491 --> 01:38:42.150
It was John Romero after he left it software.
It was a little,
yeah,

1772
01:38:42.151 --> 01:38:47.040
it was sort of typecast as well.
That was a fucking good game though.
Sure.
That's,

1773
01:38:47.050 --> 01:38:50.970
that came,
got fucked over.
That was a fun game.
Like the physics were cool.

1774
01:38:50.971 --> 01:38:55.450
It was like very much like quake one but with better graphics and weapons were

1775
01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:59.070
cool.
Yes.
Yeah.
And and,
and I've,
excuse me,

1776
01:38:59.071 --> 01:39:01.200
I'm not saying those games don't have a place they do.
Right.

1777
01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:05.110
And that's the thing like,
like we,
what we don't want to be doing to,

1778
01:39:05.111 --> 01:39:09.270
to creators to create a people to artists is making them kind of like kind of

1779
01:39:09.271 --> 01:39:12.480
like we didn't want to walk on egg shells with combat with talking about these

1780
01:39:12.481 --> 01:39:14.400
controversial issues today.
And I feel like we didn't,

1781
01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:17.700
we don't want our artist walking on eggshells worried about worried about well

1782
01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:19.350
what are people gonna think are they going to be,

1783
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:22.620
I think it'd be down to our next for being sexist or misogynist or,

1784
01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:27.630
or fueling some,
some negative negative aspect of,
of pop culture.

1785
01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:30.300
Well she's got big tits so you're in trouble,
right?

1786
01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:33.630
Look at her like people are going to definitely say that you're doing something

1787
01:39:33.631 --> 01:39:36.660
wrong because she's hot.
I hope not so far.
No one has,

1788
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:39.850
I mean I haven't seen it yet.
Wait till this fucking podcast goes live.
She,

1789
01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:42.650
she is hot and wait until you watch a trailer.
I don't know if you were able to,

1790
01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:45.900
she's got to fight.
Is that the boss?
One of the bosses?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Can you,

1791
01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.680
can you pull up videos cause yeah.
Fuck yeah,
you should.
You should pull it.

1792
01:39:48.681 --> 01:39:51.840
The Xero earth guardians on our youtube video.
Yeah.

1793
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:54.330
We'll make sure you don't shut down our youtube videos because that's what

1794
01:39:54.331 --> 01:39:54.960
happens.

1795
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.260
That's what they do is your intellectual property of whatever fucking complain

1796
01:39:59.270 --> 01:40:02.550
about us.
Oh No,
you don't say that.
No.

1797
01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:06.060
There's gotta be some company at the head of this though.
Absolutely.

1798
01:40:06.061 --> 01:40:10.710
It's our company.
Yeah,
but do you have the pole?
Can you really make this happen?

1799
01:40:10.711 --> 01:40:13.980
Absolutely.
You'll never.
All right.
Find a video.
Jamie.

1800
01:40:14.210 --> 01:40:17.250
bombshell.com if you scroll up,
it's the,
it's the top one at the here,
right?

1801
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:20.730
A little bit down to that middle one.
All right,
here we go.
Yup.
Is Xero screen?

1802
01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:25.300
Yeah,
the packs one.
All right.
Hit that pitch and go full screen.

1803
01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:27.980
I also love our music.
We have an incredible composer.

1804
01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:29.970
[inaudible] name's Andrew whole shore.

1805
01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:45.463
<v 3>Why is it freezing?</v>

1806
01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:53.980
<v 2>Okay.
Stop.
Pause.
Listen,
we can't watch it like this.
Pause it.
Let it,</v>

1807
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:55.203
let it load up.

1808
01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.153
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1809
01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:58.390
<v 2>It is loaded.
I saw the buffer.
Yeah.</v>

1810
01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:01.870
Something's wrong with your fucking shitty buffer on Youtube.

1811
01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:05.370
Try it from the beginning.
Jammer.

1812
01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:06.373
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1813
01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.600
<v 4>These are the zeroth guardians today.
It's because you went full screen,</v>

1814
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:16.570
<v 3>right?
Did you just leave like this?
This is fine.</v>

1815
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:19.230
I agree.
More

1816
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:29.680
English isn't that convenient.

1817
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:34.650
<v 4>So she'll do the game.
Kind of be like breaking the fourth wall,</v>

1818
01:41:34.690 --> 01:41:35.650
talking to the audience.

1819
01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.220
It's almost like she knows this is like a,
you're looking at it.

1820
01:41:41.221 --> 01:41:45.700
It's third person.
It's top down.
Yeah,
it's an isometric gave.
So,
so this is,

1821
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:48.280
it's amazing when you can just now seeing how far along,

1822
01:41:48.281 --> 01:41:51.550
even from when this video was recorded,
how much better the game is.

1823
01:41:51.551 --> 01:41:53.230
But these are the Xero earth guardians.

1824
01:41:53.231 --> 01:41:56.720
One of the boss fights here playing with two sticks on your controller.
Um,

1825
01:41:56.721 --> 01:41:57.130
so you're,

1826
01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:59.350
you're running around with a left one and you're handling with the right thumb

1827
01:41:59.351 --> 01:42:01.540
stick and then you're just,
you're,
you're shooting,

1828
01:42:01.541 --> 01:42:03.670
you're using different abilities,
different,
uh,
you know,

1829
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:04.750
she's got her mighty punch.

1830
01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.720
She's got eight different weapons that she can finish.

1831
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:10.540
The [inaudible] textbox type controller.
Yeah.
Playstation,

1832
01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:13.030
Xbox one and playstation four.
It's going to be like the,

1833
01:42:13.031 --> 01:42:15.370
the controllers that you come to expect on PC,

1834
01:42:15.371 --> 01:42:18.310
which is releasing later this month is the keyboard and mouse configuration as

1835
01:42:18.311 --> 01:42:21.010
well.
So that's where always be top down like this.
No.

1836
01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:25.720
So sometimes we pull it down into third person just got jacked.
It was made by,

1837
01:42:25.721 --> 01:42:26.680
it was made on the unreal engine.

1838
01:42:26.681 --> 01:42:29.590
So we're able to build it in super high fidelity and you can bring down the

1839
01:42:29.591 --> 01:42:32.650
camera to be like if a third person game almost in the game was actually kind of

1840
01:42:32.651 --> 01:42:35.920
designed to be a first person or third person shooter.
Yeah.

1841
01:42:35.921 --> 01:42:38.950
First person is my favorite because it feels like you're actually there.

1842
01:42:39.330 --> 01:42:40.930
You know,
you're running through these three d worlds.

1843
01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:44.980
Top down is like you're either watching,
well if you love quake,

1844
01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:46.780
and if you love first person shooters,

1845
01:42:46.781 --> 01:42:50.350
we actually have a build engine prequel to bombshell that's going to come out,

1846
01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:53.410
uh,
after this game that,
um,

1847
01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:56.820
that takes place in the first person and it looks very retro style.
Like,
oh,

1848
01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:02.440
so when is this game out?
So this game comes out November 26th.
A PC.

1849
01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:05.420
Yeah.
Oh,
this is where they merged together.
It's a stage three of the boss.

1850
01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:08.920
He's coming out first.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
They merge.
Yeah.

1851
01:43:08.921 --> 01:43:12.790
They literally merged together now.
So now they're one giant boss.
Oh,

1852
01:43:12.791 --> 01:43:16.540
this seems like a hard game to play.
Yeah,
it's got,

1853
01:43:16.541 --> 01:43:18.520
have you ever played dark souls?
No.

1854
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:22.810
It's got times where it's Kinda got dark souls difficulty.
It's not an easy game,

1855
01:43:22.811 --> 01:43:27.040
but it's also very accessible game and easy to pick up and play.
Well,

1856
01:43:27.041 --> 01:43:29.860
it looks awesome.
This is very,
this is the kill sequence.
And this,
to me,

1857
01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:34.300
you're kind of defines it about her personality.
It defines our personality.
Yeah.

1858
01:43:38.970 --> 01:43:40.260
<v 3>Sets the tone for who she is</v>

1859
01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:53.030
<v 2>for the folks.
This at home,
I mean listening to this,</v>

1860
01:43:53.031 --> 01:43:57.320
which is the vast majority of the people.
This is not that fun.

1861
01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:58.370
So uh,

1862
01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:02.480
for them go to bombshell.com and you can watch these videos and check it out.

1863
01:44:02.481 --> 01:44:04.310
But very cool graphics.

1864
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:06.590
It looks like a fun game to play and if you really into games,

1865
01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:08.310
there's probably something you check out.

1866
01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:13.100
The thing about games that I like is that the amount of fucking entertainment

1867
01:44:13.130 --> 01:44:17.180
you get from a really good video game and how much is a good video game cost

1868
01:44:17.181 --> 01:44:19.280
these days.
Typically they're 59 bucks,
60 bucks.

1869
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:23.390
Think about how many hours of entertainment you can get from what,

1870
01:44:23.391 --> 01:44:26.890
especially if you turn it into a first person shooter where you go online and

1871
01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:29.030
play multiplayer,
right?
Oh my gosh.

1872
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:33.560
Hundreds of hours people are putting into this thing and this game is not going

1873
01:44:33.561 --> 01:44:35.340
to be that much.
This came to be like 39 bucks.
It's,

1874
01:44:35.410 --> 01:44:38.300
it's a single player on the game.
Doesn't have,
oh really?
Yeah.
Single player.

1875
01:44:38.301 --> 01:44:41.240
Only game.
But we want to make like co op this game would be so fun for that.

1876
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.790
But like,
yeah,
like you talk about even the full price games,

1877
01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:47.330
like the call of duty will be 60 bucks.
Right?
Well that game with,

1878
01:44:47.331 --> 01:44:48.640
with how many hours you get to put into it,

1879
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:51.950
you compare it to like a two hour movie that you see for 12 bucks or 14 bucks

1880
01:44:51.951 --> 01:44:53.390
down at the AMC.
Right?
Right.

1881
01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:57.050
And you're getting so much bigger bang for your entertainment dollar buying a

1882
01:44:57.051 --> 01:44:58.520
video game than you would in a movie.

1883
01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.840
And so a lot of times when people are worried about our games getting too
pricey,

1884
01:45:02.841 --> 01:45:07.040
you know,
with mobile games being so cheap and so affordable that they are,
um,

1885
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:09.890
you know,
with how much entertainment you're getting out of it.
It's crazy.

1886
01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:13.220
I don't think these artists are getting paid enough,
honestly.
Well,

1887
01:45:13.221 --> 01:45:16.580
the amount of money that you guys make don't video games is bigger than any

1888
01:45:16.581 --> 01:45:19.000
movie now,
right?
Oh yeah.
Yes.
It's,

1889
01:45:19.001 --> 01:45:23.960
it's surpassed I think 2012 or 13 that's crazy.
When it surpassed.
Holly wouldn't.

1890
01:45:23.961 --> 01:45:27.860
Yeah.
When did it surpass porn?
I don't know that it's started way earlier.

1891
01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.570
Corn does it make that much money anymore?

1892
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:33.260
They say the way porn makes big money these days,

1893
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:37.640
and this is kind of a sneaky thing,
is um,
uh,
hotels,

1894
01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:41.760
hotels,
that's where people buy porn.
Interesting.

1895
01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:44.630
That's where people most of the time by well if you're a business guy,

1896
01:45:44.631 --> 01:45:45.770
you could expense it.
The trip,

1897
01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:49.940
you can expense it on your trip and 1999 for a movie.

1898
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:54.470
But if you watch,
yeah,
if you play,

1899
01:45:54.471 --> 01:45:57.470
if you play bombshell and if you walk away with a different image,

1900
01:45:57.471 --> 01:46:01.280
jump into your head.
Then just that blonde babe scantily clad tits and ass.

1901
01:46:01.281 --> 01:46:02.091
Then we've done something.

1902
01:46:02.091 --> 01:46:06.020
We left an impression on you that that tells you that that what defines a bomb

1903
01:46:06.021 --> 01:46:07.930
show,
it defines a bad ass chick is,

1904
01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:12.350
is more of her context in her life and what she's doing and how she's combating

1905
01:46:12.351 --> 01:46:14.170
that adversity than it is what she looks.

1906
01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:18.770
Are you guys preparing for feminists blowback feminism and gaming blowback?
No.

1907
01:46:18.771 --> 01:46:22.010
I mean I think about it a little bit more of myself just because of the way I

1908
01:46:22.011 --> 01:46:25.220
think.
And what I've been through,
but that's not what the team had.

1909
01:46:25.221 --> 01:46:28.480
Inner interceptors.
The studio in Denmark making that game intercept,

1910
01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.200
no one there is thinking that they're just thinking.

1911
01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:32.660
We have this idea for an incredible,

1912
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:37.040
incredible chick and incredible villain to hate Jadus Haskell.
He's the villain.

1913
01:46:37.041 --> 01:46:39.980
You didn't see him in that trailer,
but he is the lead a antagonist.

1914
01:46:39.981 --> 01:46:42.410
He's voiced by the voice of Duke Nukem,
John Saint John,

1915
01:46:42.411 --> 01:46:45.470
so he's also part of the three d realms.
Family's still there.

1916
01:46:45.471 --> 01:46:50.160
Just looking at making incredible characters with a fun story.
One's saying

1917
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.550
this story is serious,
like you saw it.
She rides,

1918
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:56.140
she rides a shield and punches him in the face to do the extra.
Well,

1919
01:46:56.190 --> 01:47:00.270
she throws some grenades under the shield,
blows them up and go find,

1920
01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:04.500
which is like that classic over the top almost be action movie type stuff.
Right,

1921
01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:07.710
but that's,
that's the game that we're making.
We don't want it to be too serious.

1922
01:47:07.730 --> 01:47:10.560
Right.
We want it to still be on the fund side a series.
Now,

1923
01:47:10.561 --> 01:47:14.160
speaking of technology and technology of the future,

1924
01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:16.890
are you guys going to start doing things like oculus rift?

1925
01:47:16.891 --> 01:47:19.800
You can just going to start producing games for,

1926
01:47:19.801 --> 01:47:23.160
for something that's like completely immersive like that we could man,

1927
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:26.130
we don't want to say no to anything.
We couldn't say yes now.

1928
01:47:26.131 --> 01:47:28.740
He had done nothing to announce on your show unfortunately.
But it's,

1929
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:31.980
it's the technology is amazing.
Have you tried it?
Have you worn those?

1930
01:47:31.981 --> 01:47:36.981
I've only worn while I have one to two versions of worn the original version,

1931
01:47:37.141 --> 01:47:41.520
which is very pixelated,
which was amazing because it gave me this like,
Whoa,

1932
01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:45.720
this idea of like,
I see where this is going.
And then more recently,
um,

1933
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.250
my friend Louis from unbox therapy was in here and he showed me one that's a

1934
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.500
cell phone.
You slide it in Samsung gear galaxy.
Yeah,

1935
01:47:54.610 --> 01:47:59.340
Samsung phone and you put it on,
but it's still not the real deal.

1936
01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:02.040
The real deal is the one that hooks up to a computer and,

1937
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:05.730
but I saw that video where you get to look around.

1938
01:48:05.731 --> 01:48:07.980
It's completely three dimensional.
The guy playing the piano.

1939
01:48:07.981 --> 01:48:10.840
Have you seen that one?
Yeah,
it's mind blowing.
I've worn both the,

1940
01:48:10.841 --> 01:48:14.600
the valve has their vibe and then you have,
um,
you have the oculus rifts.

1941
01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:19.230
Sony has the,
uh,
has,
there's that,
what's the best one?
Uh,
they're,
they're all,

1942
01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:22.980
they're all,
they're all bleeding edge.
They're all like,
you know,

1943
01:48:22.981 --> 01:48:25.320
to me they're all like at the same level.
They all have their different things.

1944
01:48:25.321 --> 01:48:27.420
One has more refresh rate.
One is high resolution,

1945
01:48:27.421 --> 01:48:31.290
one has the hand tracking so you can move your hands and stuff.
Like they're all,

1946
01:48:31.291 --> 01:48:32.790
they're all just,
it's such a new technology.

1947
01:48:32.791 --> 01:48:36.360
They're all making great strides and [inaudible] but no matter what,

1948
01:48:36.361 --> 01:48:39.870
when you're playing on the,
it's,
the experience is so hard to describe.

1949
01:48:39.871 --> 01:48:41.250
I'm going to do it injustice right now,

1950
01:48:41.251 --> 01:48:44.010
but it's like you really are in a different world.

1951
01:48:44.011 --> 01:48:48.740
I played a simulation where I was standing in this,
um,
uh,
this,
this halt.

1952
01:48:48.741 --> 01:48:52.230
We were like a,
like a jail cell,
like a jail hall and there's this t rex,

1953
01:48:52.231 --> 01:48:55.950
you hear it walking and it comes around the corner and it starts walking towards

1954
01:48:55.951 --> 01:48:58.310
you and is roaring.
It's super high.
Fidelity and you can look around,

1955
01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.380
you can move,
you can move around.
And when he started walking at me,

1956
01:49:01.381 --> 01:49:06.381
I had this like visceral natural instinct to duck down and then it detected that

1957
01:49:06.541 --> 01:49:09.360
I had ducked it down because it can have the motion tracking like the we remotes

1958
01:49:09.361 --> 01:49:10.350
do.
And uh,

1959
01:49:10.351 --> 01:49:13.090
and so he leaned down and like looked at me and roared and my face and then he

1960
01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:17.400
walked over me and I realized that I've never had that reaction from a normal

1961
01:49:17.401 --> 01:49:19.920
game where I've like had to physically move in my space.

1962
01:49:19.921 --> 01:49:24.000
But that made me have this like response in my,
I felt my heart rate going up.

1963
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:27.750
That was so much more immersive and you can,
you have to experience it.

1964
01:49:27.751 --> 01:49:31.440
If you ever have a chance to go to like a trade show,
like Penny Arcade Expo,

1965
01:49:31.441 --> 01:49:35.790
Pax South or Pax East,
um,
go to these trade shows and like wait in line,

1966
01:49:35.791 --> 01:49:39.110
it's worth it.
Try it out because it's such an incredible experience.
Well,

1967
01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:43.140
I know John Carmack is involved with some oculus rift stuff cause we were

1968
01:49:43.141 --> 01:49:47.130
tweeting back and forth and I've been a [inaudible] studios way back when
before,

1969
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.010
um,
quake

1970
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.870
<v 0>three was released.</v>

1971
01:49:49.871 --> 01:49:54.370
I got to play like an early version of it with Tim Willits and all those guys

1972
01:49:54.371 --> 01:49:58.060
online or on a land rather.
It was really fucking cool.

1973
01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:03.420
But they're doing some crazy oculus rift shit and I just can only imagine what

1974
01:50:03.701 --> 01:50:06.570
that's going to be like.
The first oculus game we make over.
I'll bring you in.

1975
01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:09.280
I want you to see it.
I want you to tell us what you,
what you think.

1976
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:13.210
Well the first person shooter and Oculus rift with probably if you can get some

1977
01:50:13.211 --> 01:50:16.960
sort of an omnidirectional treadmill that feels realistic.
They have those too.

1978
01:50:17.250 --> 01:50:19.480
I've seen it's tough.
It's like a workout.

1979
01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:22.600
It's really hard to be is great because you know,

1980
01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:25.700
one of the things about dance dance revolution,
um,

1981
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:28.090
that game that's like really popular in arcades.

1982
01:50:28.091 --> 01:50:30.850
One of the cool side effects is a lot of people lost weight,

1983
01:50:31.150 --> 01:50:34.210
like a shit load of weight because they were gamers.

1984
01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:36.370
But they got really into playing this one game.

1985
01:50:36.371 --> 01:50:39.670
This game requires you to jump around and bounce around and they were burning

1986
01:50:39.671 --> 01:50:42.610
off all these fucking crazy calories.
And there's,

1987
01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:46.930
I think there's a whole website dedicated to dance,
dance revolution,

1988
01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.460
a weight loss.

1989
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:53.140
Like it's showing all these people that have lost like fucking 60 70 80 pounds

1990
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:56.950
just playing this silly game.
Is this fun?
Yeah,
and they're having fun doing it.

1991
01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:01.240
Now think about a first person shooter like unreal style,
right?

1992
01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:03.820
And you're running around these corridors.

1993
01:51:03.821 --> 01:51:08.050
You've got an oculus rift headset on Omni Omnidirectional treadmill,

1994
01:51:08.051 --> 01:51:09.760
which means you can go left right back,

1995
01:51:09.761 --> 01:51:14.620
forth 45 degree angles up and down fuck band.

1996
01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:17.050
And then you use these.
A lot of these treadmills,

1997
01:51:17.230 --> 01:51:19.510
they operate on you pushing them,
right?

1998
01:51:19.511 --> 01:51:23.950
Because they don't move like a a treadmill.
We have to keep up with it.
Right?

1999
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.350
It's your footprints are actually forcing it to move.

2000
01:51:26.351 --> 01:51:28.810
So there's a little bit of resistance to it.
The one that I had,

2001
01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:32.140
the one that I saw,
I didn't get to try it though,
is they had this thing,

2002
01:51:32.141 --> 01:51:34.570
this almost sock thing you put on instead of a shoe,

2003
01:51:34.571 --> 01:51:38.260
it's like a boot that's super soft material and then rather than the thing being

2004
01:51:38.261 --> 01:51:40.720
attract that you have to move and have all that resistance because that was

2005
01:51:40.721 --> 01:51:43.960
harder to move.
It was this really slick surface.

2006
01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:47.980
So you're still bound in but you just glide your feet over it.
Oh whoa.

2007
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:51.820
That's cool.
You like Polish it up like a,
almost like a,
like a bowling alley.

2008
01:51:51.821 --> 01:51:52.360
You would.

2009
01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:55.330
And then so you're almost like walking in place in gliding and because you still

2010
01:51:55.331 --> 01:51:57.370
have that hardest holding up,
you don't slip and fall.

2011
01:51:58.150 --> 01:52:01.150
And that was kind of interesting too.
That is kind of interesting.

2012
01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:03.970
I would think one would be better for fitness.
Absolutely.

2013
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.660
But the resistance probably get some,

2014
01:52:05.661 --> 01:52:10.210
a really good workouts in with an omnidirectional treadmill with resistance.

2015
01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:11.650
I mean if you're,
if you're like,

2016
01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:15.100
I know there's one that they're working on that I had heard is fucking

2017
01:52:15.101 --> 01:52:18.850
terrifying.
It's based on Ridley Scott Alien.
The,
the,

2018
01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:22.030
the first alien movie.
The game.
The game.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2019
01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:26.280
And if you seen it,
I've seen the clips.
Yeah,
I've heard it's fucking horrifying.

2020
01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:29.350
Where people were worried that people are literally going to get heart attacks.

2021
01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:31.660
Yes.
Because you're,
and you have to duck and he,
and you see it,

2022
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:34.630
you actually see it walking around and it's trying to find you and you

2023
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:39.010
physically have to duck and move your body down so that it can't see you in the

2024
01:52:39.011 --> 01:52:40.660
gate.
And when it finds you,
it roars at you.

2025
01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:42.490
And you watched the activity as the fine brothers.

2026
01:52:42.491 --> 01:52:44.950
It's the fine brothers Youtube channel where they have these,
um,
they,

2027
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:49.160
and he's like teens react videos,
they'll put a teenager's in chairs,

2028
01:52:49.161 --> 01:52:50.780
they'll film them reacting to these things.

2029
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:54.350
It's so fucking funny to watch them do a climbing.

2030
01:52:54.351 --> 01:52:55.580
They're climbing at their eyes,

2031
01:52:55.581 --> 01:52:58.070
trying to get the thing off because it was terrifying that,

2032
01:52:59.330 --> 01:53:01.670
well isn't that this and this,

2033
01:53:01.671 --> 01:53:04.910
like sort of a glimpse of what's going to happen when they figured out how to

2034
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:08.120
make some sort of,
not just the goggles that you put on,

2035
01:53:08.121 --> 01:53:10.010
like like what they're doing with oculus rift,

2036
01:53:10.190 --> 01:53:13.400
but some sort of a neural interface where they bring you into this world.

2037
01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:16.910
Would you ever want to leave that world?
That's the question,
right?
I mean,

2038
01:53:16.911 --> 01:53:19.370
is that what we're going tricks maybe.
I mean,

2039
01:53:19.610 --> 01:53:21.290
when we're talking about artificial life,

2040
01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:24.530
maybe that's how artificial I was going to coopt us think it.
Well look man,

2041
01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:29.000
we got this thing.
You know,
you don't need to live like this baby.

2042
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.871
You know?
I mean,

2043
01:53:29.871 --> 01:53:32.480
how many people are out there just can't get people to touch them.

2044
01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:37.160
They're so sad.
So depressed.
Why would you do that when you can be Robin Hood,

2045
01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.600
right?
You can literally,
okay.

2046
01:53:38.601 --> 01:53:43.601
This is the people were watching a video of the people wearing the oculus rift

2047
01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:47.990
and a
turn it up,

2048
01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:50.230
<v 4>Jamie Lee,
they,</v>

2049
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:55.350
oh my God,
this is amazing.

2050
01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:58.410
<v 0>Oh,
first of all,
it moves like</v>

2051
01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:02.520
<v 4>a really high level 3d shooter with high resolution,</v>

2052
01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:07.530
but it's total oculus rift.
Oh my God.

2053
01:54:07.531 --> 01:54:08.364
It's running.

2054
01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:14.000
<v 0>Running at you.
Is that mean it got her?
Yeah.
Oh that's hilarious.</v>

2055
01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.460
Cause I'm still convinced that this is all happening.

2056
01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:21.370
<v 4>And then when it eats them,
it happens in front of them.
They can,</v>

2057
01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.460
they can see them say complete down and see their intestines getting ripped out.

2058
01:54:25.461 --> 01:54:26.460
Yeah.
Terrific.

2059
01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.460
<v 0>She's like,
dammit,
I just got jacked.
Whoa.
So when,</v>

2060
01:54:32.610 --> 01:54:36.630
when that little face is on the corners,
that mean.
Got Ya.
Yeah.

2061
01:54:36.631 --> 01:54:38.550
There was a little bit buggy to that.

2062
01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:42.000
They were playing like a glitchy building and whatnot.
We're seeing the future.

2063
01:54:42.001 --> 01:54:42.151
Right?

2064
01:54:42.151 --> 01:54:46.620
I mean if you go back to pong and you look at what you've got now with bombshell

2065
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:50.910
and you look at this and go,
what the fuck is that?
I mean,
Pong was what,

2066
01:54:50.970 --> 01:54:55.170
80 not 70 war.
Yeah,
long time ago.

2067
01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:58.740
I don't even remember.
I don't know.
I don't remember what year it was.

2068
01:54:59.490 --> 01:55:04.020
What year do you think pawn ones tell you?
Yes.
Jamie sixties yeah.
No,

2069
01:55:04.050 --> 01:55:08.940
really.
I guess 72 [inaudible] 70 1972 okay.

2070
01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:14.840
So think of that thing is 72 and now think of what's going to be like 40 years

2071
01:55:16.231 --> 01:55:18.780
from now.
How cool and how quick we got here.
Yeah,

2072
01:55:18.781 --> 01:55:22.770
that's the thing at 40 years sounds like a long time.
43 years,
ain't shit.
No.

2073
01:55:23.290 --> 01:55:25.230
Well,
especially if you extrapolate,
you know,

2074
01:55:25.231 --> 01:55:29.070
you look at like what's going on today?
It's exponential.

2075
01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:33.360
It's not just 40 years from now.
It's like 40 years,

2076
01:55:33.630 --> 01:55:38.280
40 days.
Let's,
let's go.
Just back to 2005 right to just,
just 10 years,

2077
01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:42.300
2005 the video games were,
they were,
they were completely different.

2078
01:55:42.330 --> 01:55:43.990
They were still in large part.

2079
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:45.390
<v 2>Sprite driven.
Sprites are a bit,
well,</v>

2080
01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:46.680
I'm not going to get into the technical right.
Yeah.

2081
01:55:46.681 --> 01:55:49.500
I'm not going to get into the technical jargon,
but it does.
I mean,
I,
it's,

2082
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:53.760
it's not truly three d like the effects are,
are fakes today.
Oh,

2083
01:55:53.761 --> 01:55:55.020
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.

2084
01:55:55.021 --> 01:55:58.860
It's just like a bunch of two d objects put together and at any way.
Um,
but this,

2085
01:55:58.890 --> 01:56:03.890
this virtual reality was something that always had been talked about a long time

2086
01:56:04.081 --> 01:56:05.640
ago.
It was always like the thing,

2087
01:56:05.641 --> 01:56:08.950
like one day we're going to have virtual reality.
I mean it was,

2088
01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:13.170
it was a big plot line in movies and like the 1980s,

2089
01:56:13.171 --> 01:56:14.670
but the technology wasn't there,

2090
01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:19.260
but now the technology has finally caught up to it.
And again,

2091
01:56:19.261 --> 01:56:22.170
this is just the beginning.
It's going to get crazier than this.
Right.

2092
01:56:22.590 --> 01:56:26.460
I would hope so.
I would assume so much teacher.
Um,
what,
what,

2093
01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:28.350
what I want to know is how is it going to change?

2094
01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.810
Like what Netflix has changed the whaling Hollywood and,

2095
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:35.160
and how TV shows are made.
Like I want to know what those,

2096
01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:39.100
I can't wait to find out when an experience through it.
Um,

2097
01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.680
the effect that's gonna have on game.
We'll do,
what about movies?
There was a,

2098
01:56:43.681 --> 01:56:45.810
um,
there was a movie that a,

2099
01:56:45.811 --> 01:56:49.910
they did a trailer for that was an Oculus rift and a,
it was pretty innocuous.

2100
01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:52.920
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was completely three dimensional.

2101
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:54.930
Like you could get inside the movie,

2102
01:56:54.931 --> 01:56:59.220
you could move around and watch things happen from different places inside the

2103
01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:02.670
movie.
That's incredible.
Yeah,
and this is where I think what they did,

2104
01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:06.390
I saw it online and uh,
they were just sort of demonstrating it.

2105
01:57:06.391 --> 01:57:08.930
It might just be like a proof of concept sort of a thing.
Sure.

2106
01:57:09.090 --> 01:57:13.740
But they were doing it in real time and this person will like moving around,

2107
01:57:13.741 --> 01:57:16.440
watching all this shit happen.
I mean,
we're going to go,

2108
01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:20.610
like if you go to a movie theater,
right?
You're sitting in a theater,

2109
01:57:20.611 --> 01:57:23.810
it's a big hole,
big giant place number.
Sitting down and eating popcorn,

2110
01:57:23.850 --> 01:57:27.480
watching this flat screen in front of you where everything takes place.

2111
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:32.700
What if instead of that you enter into a warehouse and that warehouse is the

2112
01:57:32.701 --> 01:57:37.701
film you strap on these goggles and they have an environment with wind and heat

2113
01:57:37.890 --> 01:57:42.890
and all sorts of different three dimensional environmental effects that can

2114
01:57:43.531 --> 01:57:47.670
allow you to like different terrain.
Like maybe the,
the,
the,

2115
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:52.560
the terrain is somehow under pliable or movable or liquid.

2116
01:57:52.561 --> 01:57:56.730
They can change what the effects of it are.
And you could,

2117
01:57:57.150 --> 01:57:59.280
you could walk around in the Shire.

2118
01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:03.930
I mean you could be in the fucking hobbit land climbing the hill to where Bilbo

2119
01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:06.100
Baggins houses opening the door,

2120
01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:08.700
looking at him and he's telling you to come on inside.

2121
01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.740
This isn't,
this isn't unrealistic,
right?
Oh,
it's already here.

2122
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:15.510
There's the one proof of concept video.

2123
01:58:15.511 --> 01:58:19.680
Maybe Jamie can find it where it's with the oculus rift,
they created three.

2124
01:58:19.681 --> 01:58:21.590
They created a third person shooter.
So it's,

2125
01:58:21.591 --> 01:58:26.591
it's a real life third person game where the guy has a wide angle camera mounted

2126
01:58:27.781 --> 01:58:29.790
in a backpack on his back that is back here.

2127
01:58:29.791 --> 01:58:34.220
So it looks down and it can see himself standing there and he's wearing these,

2128
01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:37.980
these,
these three glasses and it's doing the head tracking in real time.

2129
01:58:37.981 --> 01:58:42.280
There's maybe like an 80 millisecond delay.
So it almost imperceivable.

2130
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:47.200
So he's seeing his own is literally living an out of body experience through

2131
01:58:47.201 --> 01:58:50.260
accurate and he's walking around like he's the third person Avatar to the world.

2132
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:52.420
Wow.
Right.

2133
01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:56.320
We know some games allow you to go from third person to first person until I

2134
01:58:56.321 --> 01:58:57.460
switched back and forth.

2135
01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:02.560
That's going to be a like to look at your own hands in the game on the trigger

2136
01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:07.540
and I could see your hand pulling and that's what the vibe was two and an

2137
01:59:07.541 --> 01:59:10.570
oculus.
I think oculus came out with a peripheral as well.
Now where you hold,

2138
01:59:10.630 --> 01:59:13.930
you hold these little things in your hands and now that the head tracking device

2139
01:59:13.931 --> 01:59:17.380
can track or the cameras can track where your hands are with in relation to your

2140
01:59:17.381 --> 01:59:20.590
eyes so you can hold a gun up and see the gun that you're holding.
Yeah,

2141
01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:24.880
totally makes sense.
Why wouldn't you?
You know,
I mean if if you're game,

2142
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:26.830
I mean that would be so much more immersive.

2143
01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:30.520
If you had a game that required you to shoot it monsters with a shotgun and you

2144
01:59:30.521 --> 01:59:34.900
had a fake shotgun but it is heavy like a metal shotgun and had a real cocking

2145
01:59:34.901 --> 01:59:38.740
mechanism and you could really see the shells you jacked,

2146
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:40.240
you had to put new shells in.

2147
01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:43.720
Maybe like maybe you have shells in your pocket and that's how you reload.

2148
01:59:43.721 --> 01:59:47.740
Like maybe have like a bucket of shells,
but fuck it could be awesome.

2149
01:59:47.770 --> 01:59:52.540
You've seen Hollow Lens,
right?
No Hollow Lens is,
is in a lot of ways,
even better.

2150
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:55.530
I've,
I've seen it,
oh,

2151
01:59:56.020 --> 02:00:00.220
where they had aliens and breaking through the walls of your home.
So you,

2152
02:00:00.221 --> 02:00:04.480
it's not yet god goes,
that's like a lens.
And so you still see your space,

2153
02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:06.400
but it's like as soon as you put them on,

2154
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:10.870
you could look at that wall and now suddenly an alien can break through the wall

2155
02:00:10.871 --> 02:00:11.351
and it make,

2156
02:00:11.351 --> 02:00:14.230
it actually makes it look like your wall is tearing apart and aliens climbing

2157
02:00:14.231 --> 02:00:17.500
through it.
And then you're shooting at the alien in your own house,

2158
02:00:17.501 --> 02:00:18.430
at your own wall.

2159
02:00:18.670 --> 02:00:21.670
So it's bringing video games into your world instead of putting,

2160
02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:23.680
transplanting you into another world.

2161
02:00:23.790 --> 02:00:27.400
How the Lens is bringing that game experience into wherever your space is.

2162
02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:30.280
I forgot the name of it.
Yeah,
but I do remember that now.

2163
02:00:30.281 --> 02:00:34.690
And then there was the other one.
Um,
what was it?
Magic leap.
Yeah.

2164
02:00:34.691 --> 02:00:38.170
That's the other one where they're showing three D holograms.

2165
02:00:38.171 --> 02:00:41.530
Like have a little elephant dancing in your hand.
If that's ballon,

2166
02:00:41.531 --> 02:00:44.700
that magic leap demonstrations have come out recently.
I'll try it.

2167
02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:49.450
I'll find it for you real quick.
Yeah,
like a,
like a real demonstration.

2168
02:00:51.730 --> 02:00:53.230
Well they had one where it was fascinating.

2169
02:00:53.231 --> 02:00:57.310
It was just a little girl sitting on her bed watching a four inch high ballerina

2170
02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:59.880
spinning around in a bed.
Like it was a real ballerina.

2171
02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:02.890
Like it was fucking Tinkerbell.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
And again,

2172
02:01:02.891 --> 02:01:07.840
what does that do to a generation of mind blowing new inspiration and

2173
02:01:07.841 --> 02:01:11.860
imagination that no other generation like ours had?
Yeah.
And where does it lead?

2174
02:01:11.861 --> 02:01:14.980
Because obviously they're going to take it to the next place.

2175
02:01:14.981 --> 02:01:19.390
As they become more educated and they go to school and they learn how to create

2176
02:01:19.391 --> 02:01:23.380
this kind of content and they learned how to evolve it and make it better and

2177
02:01:23.381 --> 02:01:27.880
make the technology better and fucking Christ.
Man,
we're in for some weird shit.

2178
02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:32.080
That's a good time to be alive.
It's amazing.
It's the best time to be alive ever.

2179
02:01:32.081 --> 02:01:34.420
And we have so much shit to complain about though.
Yeah.

2180
02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.540
We've always had shit to complain about.
Oh,
this is real.

2181
02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:40.740
It says that this was shot through the magic leap.
Right.
Okay.

2182
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:44.240
Play it like two weeks ago.
Whoa,
whoa.

2183
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:47.870
October 14th,
2015 no special effects

2184
02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:52.230
or compositing were used

2185
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:57.640
and it's not all glitzy.
It's not like having trouble.

2186
02:01:57.641 --> 02:02:02.260
It's so smooth with every motion of the,
so that's underneath the table.

2187
02:02:02.290 --> 02:02:05.110
We're looking at this robot thing.
That's super cool.

2188
02:02:06.510 --> 02:02:07.870
Oh whoa.

2189
02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:12.400
This girl sitting at a desk and she's a excellent posture by the way,

2190
02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:17.620
as she's sitting there,
there is a fucking solar system floating over her desk,

2191
02:02:18.370 --> 02:02:23.200
but it looks real.
It looks realistic.
At least there's trails.

2192
02:02:23.230 --> 02:02:24.940
That's what they're trying to show is the focus.

2193
02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:29.800
It reacts to the depth of field of the real world.
Yeah.
Whoa.

2194
02:02:29.801 --> 02:02:33.340
Wow.
I says so as you get close to it,

2195
02:02:33.341 --> 02:02:36.710
if you look at it like you could focus on earth like there's,

2196
02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:37.900
it's our source system,

2197
02:02:37.901 --> 02:02:42.160
there's our son and it's all the planets are the right size and the proper order

2198
02:02:42.250 --> 02:02:44.410
and just imagine that the applications for this,

2199
02:02:44.411 --> 02:02:48.100
imagine when a science teacher can put this in a classroom and let you like walk

2200
02:02:48.101 --> 02:02:52.550
around a universe or a galaxy and interact with the objects in,

2201
02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:56.860
in like your actual space.
When I'm confused as what's the projection method?

2202
02:02:56.861 --> 02:02:59.700
How are they doing that?
It's a lens that they're wearing.

2203
02:02:59.701 --> 02:03:01.510
I correct me if I'm wrong,
Jamie.
I don't know this one.

2204
02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:03.820
I don't think Erin's not letting anyone know.

2205
02:03:03.821 --> 02:03:08.320
I think as afraid now because it's super high concept and they're not sharing

2206
02:03:08.321 --> 02:03:10.060
because that girl's playing it all cool.

2207
02:03:10.061 --> 02:03:12.400
She wasn't even looking at the solar system right next to her.

2208
02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:17.350
If just kind of horse shit.
If that was like hollow lens is technology.
They were,

2209
02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:20.560
they had the camera looking at through the filter that would be projecting that

2210
02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.830
into the world.
Yeah,
so you still have to wear a device I would assume.

2211
02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:26.920
I would assume.
Okay.
I would assume,
yeah,

2212
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:31.950
because there was one image that they had a where it was a floating whale.

2213
02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:36.670
They were on the beach and they were looking up and above the beach like where

2214
02:03:36.671 --> 02:03:39.850
the sand is.
There was a whale that was floating in the sky.

2215
02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:43.600
I could only imagine that that would be the case if you were wearing some

2216
02:03:43.601 --> 02:03:45.180
goggles or something like that.
How we'll see.

2217
02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:48.880
How are you going to project something in the air and have it look completely

2218
02:03:48.881 --> 02:03:53.770
three dimensional and solid and yeah,
look at this.
This is the one,

2219
02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:57.940
oh yeah,
I did see this clip.
Oh my God.

2220
02:03:58.990 --> 02:03:59.980
But here's the thing,
weren't so,

2221
02:03:59.981 --> 02:04:03.970
weren't all of them in the youtube clip I saw all the people in the room were

2222
02:04:03.971 --> 02:04:05.440
reacting to.
Exactly.

2223
02:04:05.441 --> 02:04:10.060
But here you're seeing a bunch of kids in a gymnasium that are watching this

2224
02:04:10.061 --> 02:04:12.880
whale fly through the air,
but the kids don't have anything on their eyes.

2225
02:04:12.881 --> 02:04:16.000
So we can see.
Right.
See this is kind of bullshit.

2226
02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:18.530
Like w they'll tell us eventually.
Yeah.

2227
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:23.440
But obviously this is some stunt stuff they're working on right now.
Yeah.

2228
02:04:23.441 --> 02:04:26.410
When I saw the amazing,
I assumed that they were just reacting to the,

2229
02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.690
they were just acting because they had said,
oh,

2230
02:04:28.691 --> 02:04:31.210
now there's a whale jumping out and just react to so that it makes the viral

2231
02:04:31.211 --> 02:04:34.570
video on you.
That's what I thought happened.
But it might be fine.

2232
02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:37.920
That's weird.
You know,

2233
02:04:37.921 --> 02:04:41.240
it's weird to be alive now and see all this stuff happening.
And just,
uh,

2234
02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:44.880
just the speculation of what it's going to be like in a decade.
Well,

2235
02:04:44.881 --> 02:04:48.960
you're a little bit older than me.
Um,
W W W I mean you've got to eight,

2236
02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:51.870
you're 48 so you got to experience,
how old are you?
28.

2237
02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.990
So you've a lot older than you.
You got,

2238
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:58.050
you got to experience what time was like as an adult before all this stuff.

2239
02:04:58.051 --> 02:05:02.040
So even when was your memo?
Yeah,
well,
I remember no internet right now.

2240
02:05:02.041 --> 02:05:05.700
A 1994.
I got my first computer was a,

2241
02:05:05.701 --> 02:05:10.701
as an old Mack back when max only had tam those boxes.

2242
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:15.930
You know,
I had one of those and uh,
I remember thinking,
what,

2243
02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:19.200
how crazy is this internet thing?
You've got mail,
you know,

2244
02:05:19.201 --> 02:05:20.940
go on AOL and look around.

2245
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:26.190
It's been completely fascinating to watch that evolve and watch a change.

2246
02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:30.020
And a lot of it happened while I was,
um,

2247
02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:35.100
while I was on news radio.
Um,
the guys that I worked with,

2248
02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:40.160
a lot of the writers were like heavily into video games and those guys got me

2249
02:05:40.201 --> 02:05:41.940
addicted to quake.
It was quick too.

2250
02:05:41.941 --> 02:05:44.880
At the time because they had developed a local area network.

2251
02:05:44.881 --> 02:05:49.881
They had a installed a land in their office and they had spent a shitload of

2252
02:05:49.951 --> 02:05:52.320
time,
they supposed to be writing.
They would,

2253
02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:55.080
they would play games to like two o'clock in the morning and then start writing.

2254
02:05:55.320 --> 02:06:00.090
But it was so crazy.
I could,
I had never seen anything like it.

2255
02:06:00.091 --> 02:06:03.240
And that's how I became like massively addicted but also addicted to the

2256
02:06:03.241 --> 02:06:03.601
Internet.

2257
02:06:03.601 --> 02:06:07.680
And that's when I started going online and finding out about websites and

2258
02:06:07.681 --> 02:06:12.270
reading things and realizing you get your news online.
And I was like,

2259
02:06:12.271 --> 02:06:15.780
this is amazing.
You could read the news and they're like,

2260
02:06:15.781 --> 02:06:17.510
you'd get the news in real time.
Then I was thinking,

2261
02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:19.830
well well you don't have to wait until the morning for the paper to come out.

2262
02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:23.550
You just wait for the website to refresh and then it got smaller and it's kept

2263
02:06:23.551 --> 02:06:26.850
getting smaller and you have in your pocket at any moment you can get notified

2264
02:06:26.851 --> 02:06:31.320
when news happened.
Yeah,
that's gotta be see you.
I think you,
you and,

2265
02:06:31.321 --> 02:06:33.570
and even me and a lot of ways,
cause I remember a time before that too,

2266
02:06:33.571 --> 02:06:34.051
I was younger,

2267
02:06:34.051 --> 02:06:37.710
but I remember when the Internet was really getting into our house.
Um,

2268
02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:40.050
so I feel like we were like in a great,

2269
02:06:40.710 --> 02:06:45.330
a great generation for perspective.
And not to go back to all that stuff again,

2270
02:06:45.331 --> 02:06:48.930
but it's like the next generation,
even even,
even like my,

2271
02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:51.210
my younger sister's generation,

2272
02:06:51.211 --> 02:06:54.660
like they didn't have all that perspective necessarily.

2273
02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:58.920
And now I have little toddlers and nephews who are growing up with,
with,

2274
02:06:58.950 --> 02:07:00.650
you know,
iPads and they're there.

2275
02:07:00.710 --> 02:07:03.240
They're doing stuff sitting on the couch after school and their iPad.

2276
02:07:03.241 --> 02:07:07.830
And so I'm just worried like,
and what do you think,
do you think you were,

2277
02:07:07.831 --> 02:07:11.250
you and I are in like the good,
the best generation for perspective,

2278
02:07:11.251 --> 02:07:13.830
or do you think that it's better to be a generation,

2279
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:17.730
a generation now or a generation before you and I?
Um,

2280
02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:19.920
well I think if you want to compare the two,

2281
02:07:19.921 --> 02:07:23.490
there's no way they're going to understand what it was like to not have the

2282
02:07:23.491 --> 02:07:26.370
internet.
They're not going understand it,
right?
It's going to be a concept.

2283
02:07:26.371 --> 02:07:29.010
It's like us understanding what it was like before written language.
Right?

2284
02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:32.820
We're never going to get it.
We can,
we can pretend all we like.

2285
02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:36.310
We're never going to really know what that's like.
But I think the leap

2286
02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:39.550
<v 0>between written language and with no written language,</v>

2287
02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:44.410
written language took so much longer to have an impact than what we're

2288
02:07:44.411 --> 02:07:47.440
experiencing in,
in just a couple of decades and a couple of decades.

2289
02:07:47.441 --> 02:07:51.670
The world has changed radically and it's happened right in front of our eyes.

2290
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:52.180
Yeah,

2291
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:56.650
and I think that human beings have a really difficult time recognizing change

2292
02:07:56.651 --> 02:07:58.400
while it's taking place right in front of them.
Right.

2293
02:07:58.450 --> 02:08:01.150
I think it just seems normal to us,
but I think when,

2294
02:08:01.330 --> 02:08:04.240
when history looks back at this era,
they're going to say,

2295
02:08:04.241 --> 02:08:07.330
this is the craziest moment in time.
This was when it all began.

2296
02:08:07.331 --> 02:08:11.170
This was the birth of the machine.
This was when it came alive.

2297
02:08:11.171 --> 02:08:14.890
When information became viral for the first time,

2298
02:08:14.891 --> 02:08:16.240
like literally viral,

2299
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:21.250
like became almost a living organism and spread and there was hiccups and there

2300
02:08:21.251 --> 02:08:25.060
was Justine sacco and Josh Olin and there was all sorts of weird shit that

2301
02:08:25.061 --> 02:08:29.750
happened along the way and viral videos and fucking that.

2302
02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:33.970
What does that fucking guy from Korea,
Gangnam style is also,

2303
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.740
there's all the strange things have happened,
you know,
strange things.

2304
02:08:38.741 --> 02:08:42.340
Hamster dance has been a lot of weird stuff that's happened because of the

2305
02:08:42.341 --> 02:08:47.320
Internet,
but ultimately it's,
it's,
it's more good than bad.
Oh yeah.

2306
02:08:47.321 --> 02:08:49.750
Way more good.
I think people were more informed,

2307
02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:52.810
more edge and I think they're kinder.
I really do.
I think he'd,

2308
02:08:52.811 --> 02:08:57.811
despite all these cuts that get crazy overstuff I think there's more good stuff

2309
02:08:58.510 --> 02:09:01.870
coming from people online.
It's,
it's also the communities that you foster.

2310
02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:02.913
Like the,

2311
02:09:02.970 --> 02:09:06.850
the people that I'm in contact with that connect to me through this podcast or

2312
02:09:06.851 --> 02:09:11.250
through my other stuff.
There's super positive.
It's so much more kind.

2313
02:09:11.530 --> 02:09:15.490
I mean you can find pockets of Douche bags they found form these little

2314
02:09:15.491 --> 02:09:18.100
communities and they just shit in each other's mouths all day.

2315
02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.310
You're going to find that with any sports,

2316
02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:24.660
you're going to find that with the video games,
with any witness,

2317
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.700
you're going to have like minded communities and some of them are going to be

2318
02:09:27.701 --> 02:09:29.710
toxic.
But for the most part,

2319
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:33.820
what I encounter and the people that I interact with online,

2320
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.350
incredibly positive.

2321
02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:39.520
Even criticisms like the criticisms that I've experienced online,

2322
02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:44.410
for the most part,
the vast majority of them are polite,
vast majority.

2323
02:09:44.770 --> 02:09:47.410
You know,
I think that's rare.

2324
02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:52.500
I think also people are learning how to use social media and the Internet and

2325
02:09:52.961 --> 02:09:55.900
this new found ability.
They're learning how to do it.

2326
02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.640
And some people do it wrong.

2327
02:09:57.641 --> 02:10:00.550
I mean there's some people that have like essentially attack blogs.

2328
02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:01.631
You go to their blog,

2329
02:10:01.631 --> 02:10:04.060
it's just them shitting on one person or shitting on another person.

2330
02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:06.790
And why are they doing that?
Well,
they're doing that because they can,
you know,

2331
02:10:06.791 --> 02:10:09.430
cause it's the first time they've ever had a voice in their whole life and

2332
02:10:09.431 --> 02:10:11.490
they're gonna use it to displace,
you know,

2333
02:10:11.770 --> 02:10:14.530
some of the anger and hate that they have in their own life.

2334
02:10:14.531 --> 02:10:17.460
And they just throw it out there in the world.
And this,

2335
02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:22.450
these are all like hiccups and growing pains.
And I think it's amazing.
I really,

2336
02:10:22.451 --> 02:10:25.780
really do.
That's why,
that's why I do what I do.
That's why I liked it.

2337
02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:29.650
I like to still be talking to as many people as I can and changing and

2338
02:10:29.651 --> 02:10:33.710
influencing in a positive way,
hopefully as many lives as I,
because

2339
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:35.890
<v 2>just like the university,
you know,
I'm a part of it.</v>

2340
02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:37.190
I'm in the middle of it and I want to,

2341
02:10:37.191 --> 02:10:39.650
I want to be a part of it and I want you to be a part of it.

2342
02:10:39.651 --> 02:10:42.470
That's why I love Comedians,
tuner respect comedians because they talk,

2343
02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:46.370
they talk about these kinds of social issues with such,
you know,

2344
02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.480
just on a just absolutely brazenness and they don't care.

2345
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:54.260
Most people don't care what other people think about it.
And they make,

2346
02:10:54.261 --> 02:10:57.230
they make you laugh at the same time that they make you really think and be

2347
02:10:57.231 --> 02:11:01.340
thoughtful about it.
So I really respect what you do and,
and,
and,
you know,

2348
02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:03.530
kind of paving the way for that because you,

2349
02:11:03.531 --> 02:11:06.920
you were doing that in an era before there was social media so,
well,

2350
02:11:06.921 --> 02:11:09.260
it was easier before there was social media.
You will,

2351
02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:12.410
you didn't get attacked for it.
It was limited to one room at a time.
Right?

2352
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:14.310
You got attacked in that room,
you know,

2353
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:17.720
but I think people had less of a,

2354
02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:21.590
they had less of this,
uh,

2355
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:25.010
entitlement to outrage that people have now.
Right.

2356
02:11:25.011 --> 02:11:30.011
And I think that there has been some attacks on comedians that have gone sort of

2357
02:11:30.021 --> 02:11:34.500
the way that,
you know,
you see these attacks on people for whatever reason,

2358
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:37.710
social media,
whether it's the lion killer guy or Justine sock,

2359
02:11:37.711 --> 02:11:41.150
or you who's going to be these targets that exist.

2360
02:11:41.151 --> 02:11:44.000
And they have occasionally gotten after comedians.

2361
02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:46.160
And for the most part,

2362
02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:51.220
comedians have vehemently and aggressively like supported and,

2363
02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:57.950
and defended themselves.
And one another stat.
Yeah.
And defendant one another.

2364
02:11:57.951 --> 02:12:02.060
It's a super important thing.
Like Daniel Tosh had an incident that,
you know,

2365
02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:05.180
there was a few comedians that actually turned on him and they were ostracized

2366
02:12:05.181 --> 02:12:09.530
by the community.
You know,
the people will never respect them more.

2367
02:12:09.531 --> 02:12:12.920
Forget that they,
for Social Media Brownie points,

2368
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:16.090
they tried to pretend that what he did with some outrageous thing.
Okay.

2369
02:12:16.190 --> 02:12:18.820
By cracking jokes.
So it happens everywhere.
Cause that was the one,

2370
02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:20.080
the one thing that I wish would have,

2371
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:23.030
if I could have changed anything about what happened with,
with me,

2372
02:12:23.031 --> 02:12:25.940
it would have been that I would loved for more of my peers to come out and been

2373
02:12:25.941 --> 02:12:30.500
like this is wrong.
I would love for more people to have had,
you know,
the,
the,

2374
02:12:30.501 --> 02:12:34.340
the gonads to come out and say fuck that.
He didn't do anything wrong publicly.

2375
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:36.830
They all came to be privately man causing.
Right.

2376
02:12:36.831 --> 02:12:38.210
But as you would expect friends to do.

2377
02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:42.060
But I would love for people to have been like,
you know what,
that's not okay.

2378
02:12:42.110 --> 02:12:42.440
And I,

2379
02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:45.740
cause I see that all the time in the comic community where that's how you fight

2380
02:12:45.741 --> 02:12:45.920
that.

2381
02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:48.800
That's how you get back against that and that's how you make sure that that shit

2382
02:12:48.801 --> 02:12:51.170
doesn't,
you know,
research and take over.

2383
02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:54.680
But we have to because without that the art form is shit.

2384
02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:57.320
I mean it really doesn't even exist.
The,
the,
the,
the,

2385
02:12:57.321 --> 02:13:00.950
the art form of standup comedy depends upon freedom because you're going to say

2386
02:13:00.951 --> 02:13:02.000
things that are offensive,

2387
02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:05.990
you know that you don't even mean because the offensive things will be funny,

2388
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:09.920
you know,
and you've got to know when you meet him or when you don't meet him.

2389
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.760
Like I went through this whole bit in my last special where I was explaining

2390
02:13:13.761 --> 02:13:17.030
like this is a Tracy Morgan bit that he got in trouble for,

2391
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:20.570
cause he said that if his son was gay would stab him.
And then I'm like,

2392
02:13:20.571 --> 02:13:24.580
well he also said he would eat a mile of shit to get to Beyonce,
his ass.

2393
02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:27.590
Do you understand?
He said both of those things and the same set.
Like,

2394
02:13:27.610 --> 02:13:31.100
like we got to like look at what he's doing.

2395
02:13:31.110 --> 02:13:34.500
He's saying things that are outrageous that are not real.

2396
02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:36.750
He's not in court given an affidavit.

2397
02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:40.680
He's making a joke because he knows that some parents are shitheads when their

2398
02:13:40.681 --> 02:13:41.850
sons come out to them.
Right.

2399
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.940
And that's the joke that he was making and I understand that.

2400
02:13:44.941 --> 02:13:47.190
And you think that's what he was doing?
No,

2401
02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:50.610
I think he was pretending that he would stab his son if he was gay because it's

2402
02:13:50.611 --> 02:13:54.330
outrageous.
I don't think he was saying like simple as that,
but yeah,

2403
02:13:54.331 --> 02:13:56.460
I don't think it was like a social stand.

2404
02:13:56.790 --> 02:14:01.110
Like we was taking a stand on social issues and mocking those parents that would

2405
02:14:01.111 --> 02:14:05.550
do that.
No,
I think he's pretending that he would do that.

2406
02:14:06.230 --> 02:14:08.040
But the last funny,
but it's protected.

2407
02:14:08.070 --> 02:14:11.770
But the last thing that he was doing and suggesting that's okay.
Yes,
exactly.

2408
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:15.540
That's the important,
you know,
I mean people,

2409
02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:19.860
people have to look at what standup comedy is the same way they look at movies.

2410
02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:24.060
If you watch Goodfellas,
okay.
Nobody really got shot when they made that movie.

2411
02:14:24.150 --> 02:14:27.180
It was,
it was fake.
It was,
it was entertainment.

2412
02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:32.340
And if you listen to rap music,
same thing.
Okay.
They're not really shooting cops.

2413
02:14:32.370 --> 02:14:34.840
So what,
what,
what people,
what people think is,

2414
02:14:34.890 --> 02:14:39.390
is they argue that that bye bye fetishizing that by pretending that,

2415
02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:43.260
that we're somehow changing society and culture and,

2416
02:14:43.261 --> 02:14:45.310
and I completely reject that theory,
right?

2417
02:14:45.311 --> 02:14:47.850
And in video games we get that a lot with violence.
In video games,

2418
02:14:47.851 --> 02:14:48.780
there was a lot,

2419
02:14:48.781 --> 02:14:53.220
a lot of lawsuits actually went to the supreme court in California over

2420
02:14:53.221 --> 02:14:57.720
California versus the Ema.
And um,
thankfully video games one,

2421
02:14:57.721 --> 02:14:59.940
it was like a seven to two vote,
but the,
the,

2422
02:15:00.150 --> 02:15:03.330
what they were arguing is that violent video games can lead to these mass

2423
02:15:03.331 --> 02:15:04.800
shootings can lead to violence in your life,

2424
02:15:04.801 --> 02:15:08.520
lead to aggression despite not a single study supporting any of that evidence.

2425
02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:12.300
And I come to realize that video games as an industry,
we're just,

2426
02:15:12.450 --> 02:15:16.480
we're just younger as an,
as a,
as a,
as an as an art form,
where younger we're,

2427
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:19.260
we're a very immature industry,
just like movies,

2428
02:15:19.261 --> 02:15:23.550
just like music m and Marilyn Manson went through the same scrutiny back when

2429
02:15:23.551 --> 02:15:26.460
they were having violent and vulgar,
let rap lyrics,
right?
They went for them.

2430
02:15:26.461 --> 02:15:31.260
Ozzy Osborne,
you know,
people were blaming them for kids killing people.

2431
02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:34.650
And every time we come to realize,
you know,
it's probably not real.

2432
02:15:34.710 --> 02:15:35.760
It's probably not the case.

2433
02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:39.550
And no matter what someone writes in a manifesto or what someone,
you know,
might,

2434
02:15:39.551 --> 02:15:44.340
might,
might,
some study person might think,
you know,
and at some university,

2435
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:46.740
um,
there's nothing that suggests that.
And if anything,

2436
02:15:46.741 --> 02:15:50.400
there's data that suggests that,
you know,
these things as mediums or releases,

2437
02:15:50.401 --> 02:15:52.530
they lowered regression,
they,
they,
um,

2438
02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:57.360
they make people happier and better people overall.
Yeah.
The release,

2439
02:15:57.570 --> 02:15:57.991
you know,

2440
02:15:57.991 --> 02:16:02.991
that there's this idea that watching something violent and watching something

2441
02:16:03.961 --> 02:16:06.660
sexual and watching these things that are horrific,

2442
02:16:06.661 --> 02:16:10.710
they release this anxiety and the least release the desire to actually do those

2443
02:16:10.711 --> 02:16:15.540
things.
Yeah.
And that you can somehow,
or another by,
you know,

2444
02:16:15.850 --> 02:16:18.810
by viewing those,
alleviate those issues in your own mind.

2445
02:16:18.840 --> 02:16:19.980
I used to work on call of duty.

2446
02:16:19.981 --> 02:16:24.600
And so we of course that that game like that has a close interaction with the,

2447
02:16:24.601 --> 02:16:28.670
with the armed services,
with,
with our,
our,
our militaries.
And,
uh,
and,

2448
02:16:28.671 --> 02:16:30.580
and every time that I met with them,

2449
02:16:30.581 --> 02:16:33.040
they would tell me stories about things like,
you know,

2450
02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:36.220
so vets would talk about how they deal with like PTSD.

2451
02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:39.400
They deal with adjusting to society by playing call of duty or,

2452
02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:42.840
or people on deployment in,
in like fob.
He's like,
you know,

2453
02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:45.700
boots in the sand would talk about going to get,
you know,

2454
02:16:45.701 --> 02:16:47.830
going in and playing these things.
Cause they would have little,
uh,

2455
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:49.510
almost like Internet cafes.

2456
02:16:49.511 --> 02:16:51.760
They'd have little tent set up where they would go in and play these,

2457
02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.760
play the Games on,
on workstations and,
um,

2458
02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:58.090
and we actually would send some times x boxes out to them and,
and,
and um,
and,

2459
02:16:58.091 --> 02:17:01.360
you know,
help them get through that stuff.
Uh,
and,
and again,

2460
02:17:01.361 --> 02:17:03.460
to them it was like that was their way of,

2461
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:07.870
of keeping us a sense of sanity and normalcy to their,
their otherwise,

2462
02:17:07.871 --> 02:17:11.560
how the hell they had to go through.
And that,
you know,
those stories just,

2463
02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:16.480
they always ring home to me and I realized that,
um,
no matter how much,
but again,

2464
02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:18.310
it's just perspective.
It's like,
I,
I,
it,

2465
02:17:18.370 --> 02:17:21.640
it still tears me down to think that we're still debating these things.

2466
02:17:21.641 --> 02:17:23.660
We're still debating whether finally video games and this and that,

2467
02:17:23.790 --> 02:17:25.480
and here's why the debate is bullshit.

2468
02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:30.670
Would it affect you if you went and saw a violent video game or a violent movie?

2469
02:17:30.671 --> 02:17:33.670
Would you go out and commit violence because of it?
No.
You're a grown adult.

2470
02:17:33.970 --> 02:17:37.450
So are,
what are we doing with video games?
We raising children with them.
No,

2471
02:17:37.451 --> 02:17:39.400
you're raising your fucking kid.
Okay.

2472
02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:44.760
And if your kid grows up to be a suicide bomber or a mass murderer or rapist,

2473
02:17:45.130 --> 02:17:48.310
you can't blame movies,
man.
It's not the movie's fault.

2474
02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:52.060
There were way more influential factors in that kid's life that led him to where

2475
02:17:52.061 --> 02:17:54.190
he was then the macula.
Exactly.

2476
02:17:54.210 --> 02:17:58.960
And usually whatever adjuncts that they have is,
you know,
they're,

2477
02:17:59.050 --> 02:18:02.340
they're seeking some sort of relief through those video games.
Right.

2478
02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:05.080
And if they have fucked up thoughts inside their head,

2479
02:18:05.380 --> 02:18:07.750
it's not Quintin Tarantino didn't put them in there.

2480
02:18:07.751 --> 02:18:10.090
Ozzy Osborne didn't put them in there,
you know,

2481
02:18:10.091 --> 02:18:13.870
call of duty didn't put them in there.
It just didn't,
it's not,
it's not the case.

2482
02:18:14.050 --> 02:18:18.040
They can live vicariously through those horrible things and not want to commit

2483
02:18:18.041 --> 02:18:22.060
crimes.
And that's,
and you know,
the argument could be made for that sexually to,

2484
02:18:22.061 --> 02:18:26.670
you know,
there's a lot of people that believe that porn,
uh,
even crazy porn,
uh,

2485
02:18:26.671 --> 02:18:31.630
alleviates people's desires and need to do fucked up things sexually or yet or

2486
02:18:31.631 --> 02:18:35.360
to do the thing that they watched in the,
in the porn.
Exactly.
Um,

2487
02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:39.160
and that's a good thing.
That's not making best desensitizing them.

2488
02:18:39.161 --> 02:18:40.120
That's not that.
Again,

2489
02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:43.330
that all comes from a place that I think just lack of understanding and almost

2490
02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:46.380
it comes to replace a close mindedness here.
It's that confirmation bias.

2491
02:18:46.390 --> 02:18:49.360
You have a theory and so you will look at the world through the stained glass

2492
02:18:49.361 --> 02:18:50.620
lenses of that theory.
Yeah.

2493
02:18:50.650 --> 02:18:53.650
Instead of looking at it objectively and understanding the data and what the

2494
02:18:53.651 --> 02:18:57.640
data's telling you and you're always going to have examples where you can point

2495
02:18:57.641 --> 02:19:02.641
the finger at that person and blame whatever and influences from the media,

2496
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:09.150
whether it's music or games or films or anything for for their,

2497
02:19:10.030 --> 02:19:12.150
their behavior and their actions.
But you,

2498
02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:15.940
you got to have to look at all the factors in their life and what percentage of

2499
02:19:15.941 --> 02:19:19.090
the pie is the video game,
right?
It even a sliver.

2500
02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:24.070
I mean is it even a percent or 2% what about the 98% of them getting sexually

2501
02:19:24.071 --> 02:19:28.040
abused or beaten up or bullied or the fact mom drank like a

2502
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:29.150
<v 0>fish when they were in the womb?</v>

2503
02:19:29.370 --> 02:19:31.910
Who the fuck knows that it makes what makes it broken person?

2504
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:35.660
The idea that a person can be perfectly normal and then sit down and play call

2505
02:19:35.661 --> 02:19:37.790
of duty and want to go fucking shoot up a mall.

2506
02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:42.880
That's crazy talk and you as an adult producing a product that is supposed to be

2507
02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:50.390
it.
At the very least your parents are supposed to approve your use of it.
Right.

2508
02:19:50.450 --> 02:19:53.480
The eye.
But most of it is like Keith kids that are,
you know,

2509
02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:57.280
in their teens or older,
those are they,

2510
02:19:57.300 --> 02:19:59.510
they're formed their own personalities already.

2511
02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:03.470
You're not getting your personality from playing bombshell and even still,

2512
02:20:03.471 --> 02:20:06.650
we still have rating systems just like the movies have the EPA,

2513
02:20:06.651 --> 02:20:08.180
we still have the SRB.

2514
02:20:08.181 --> 02:20:11.540
We're still properly rating them and making sure that parents have to sign off

2515
02:20:11.541 --> 02:20:14.000
if they're going to buy the thing with the kid that to be there in the store,

2516
02:20:14.001 --> 02:20:15.450
you have to have a guard.
You know,

2517
02:20:15.470 --> 02:20:18.410
we still have all those same systems just in case.
Right.

2518
02:20:18.411 --> 02:20:21.080
Because it's still good to be better safe than,
sorry.
I agree,

2519
02:20:21.081 --> 02:20:26.081
but not to the degree that you're removing an entire John Mra of game or John or

2520
02:20:26.181 --> 02:20:30.500
of entertainment because of it being too safe and people should be allowed to

2521
02:20:30.501 --> 02:20:32.580
vote with their pocket book.

2522
02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:35.870
You know you should be able to vote with your wallet,
vote with.

2523
02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:40.030
If you think that something's offensive and you think grand theft auto it,

2524
02:20:40.031 --> 02:20:44.780
it legitimizes robbery and violence and I don't want to be a part of that.

2525
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:46.760
So this is what you do.
You just don't buy it.

2526
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:50.420
It's real simple and that let the open market decide and the idea that you were

2527
02:20:50.421 --> 02:20:55.100
going to fucking nanny state the whole world,
that it's nonsense.
It's nonsense.

2528
02:20:55.101 --> 02:21:00.101
And I think video games have been the latest victim or the latest in our culture

2529
02:21:00.470 --> 02:21:03.640
of something that Tipper Gore tried to do with rap music.

2530
02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:06.200
And I mean it's been done forever.
It's been done forever.

2531
02:21:06.201 --> 02:21:08.900
They've always tried to find a scapegoat for why people are fucked up.

2532
02:21:09.350 --> 02:21:13.100
But people are fucked up cause people are fucked up.
Deal with it,
deal with it,

2533
02:21:13.101 --> 02:21:16.370
face it face you don't understand it.
But that's okay.
We,
we,
we have,

2534
02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:19.220
we have more work to do to figure it out.
Don't just go to the easy thing,

2535
02:21:19.221 --> 02:21:23.090
the easy explanation that that makes you feel more comfortable at night.
Yeah.

2536
02:21:23.091 --> 02:21:24.890
We're not talking about John Carpenter.

2537
02:21:24.891 --> 02:21:28.010
What does that movie he did where the people read the book in the mouth of

2538
02:21:28.011 --> 02:21:31.400
madness.
They read the book and they went fucking crazy for reading the book.

2539
02:21:31.401 --> 02:21:35.810
Now there's a giant number of people play call of duty and never shoot anybody.

2540
02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:38.930
Okay?
You got to take them into account.
You can't just say,

2541
02:21:38.931 --> 02:21:42.170
well this guy played call of duty and then he went on shut.
What else did he do?

2542
02:21:42.171 --> 02:21:45.890
Did that Guy p?
Well when he pees it made them go out and shoot no more pigs.

2543
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:47.840
Yeah,
no more ping.
Did he drink milk?
Well,

2544
02:21:47.841 --> 02:21:51.700
fucking milk kills milks out there killing babies.
That's nonsense.
I can't,

2545
02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:53.300
it's like,
it's like everything causes cancer.

2546
02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:55.280
Everything causes cancer these days.
Well,

2547
02:21:55.281 --> 02:21:58.460
everything causes death because we all die.
That's right.
So everything you do,

2548
02:21:58.730 --> 02:22:01.580
you get online that's causing death or fluffing.

2549
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:03.590
We worked out a lot of shit today,
Josh.
I didn't to do.

2550
02:22:03.610 --> 02:22:06.250
I feel good about this process.
Thanks for letting me talk to you about it.
Uh,

2551
02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:08.990
my pleasure brother.
My pleasure and good luck with your game.

2552
02:22:08.991 --> 02:22:12.530
Good luck with bombshell.
Thank you.
And,
uh,
and,
uh,
everything else you do,
man.

2553
02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:15.290
I really appreciate it was a lot of fun.
Cheers,
brother.
Um,

2554
02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:19.970
j d underscore,
what does it,
what does that stand for?

2555
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:21.860
It's funny.
[inaudible] there's a story.

2556
02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:26.010
I'll come in next time and tell you about it.
Okay.
Next time.
J D 2020

2557
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:29.220
<v 4>on Twitter,
Josh Hall and Ladies and Gentlemen.
All right.</v>

2558
02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:30.570
See You fuckers next week.
